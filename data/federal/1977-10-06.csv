Private Nursing Homes: Pensioner Patients TeleTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many pensioners who are holders of the Pensioners Health Benefit Card, have suffered undue hardship as teleinmates of Private Nursing Homes, because the Federal Government subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges as body to represent the laid down. Many pensioners whose spouse was an inmate of the Private Nursing Homes suffered poverty in an endeavour to sustain their partner while in the nursing home. Only in rare cases was the statutory rninimum patient conas laid down adhered to. That the telephone was a matter of life and death to many pensioners, but because of the cost of installation of the teleEstate Duty phone many are unable to afford the installauon. That those pensioners who have only their pension and litde else to live on and are forced to pay high rents, are in many cases living in extreme poverty. The foregoing facts impel your petitioners to ask the Auspasses to tralian Government as a matter of urgency to: 1. Make sure that subsidies paid to Private Nursing Homes are such that each pensioner holding a Pensioners Health Benefit Card will pay the Private Nursing Home no more than the statutory minimum patient contribution, which will allow six dollars per week to be retained by the pensioner patient for their personal use.

3,Mr KEATING,GENERAL ELECTION,I ask the Prime Minister: Is his intention to have the House of Representaapproved tives dissolved for the purpose of holding general election later this year?,15
4,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GENERAL ELECTION,What a fascinaton ing and original question! NA,15
5,Mr GILES,DROUGHT RELIEF IN SOUTH,"I address my question to the Minstage ister for Primary Industry and refer to the extribution tremely serious drought affecting farmers throughout most of South Australia. Can the Minister inform the House whether he has any estimates of the effect on crops and on the income of producers in that State? Can the ister inform the House the amounts the South Australian Government has spent and commitwords, ted? Can he also tell us what support the monwealth Government intends to offer?",15
6,Mr SINCLAIR,DROUGHT RELIEF IN SOUTH,"I am grateful to the honourslaughter able gentleman for the question because the Federal Government has always expressed attitude of support, both directly and indirectly, for those who are affected by natural disasters. Because of the minimal contribution made by the States, so often the producers feel that Commonwealth has played no part in assisting them. Indeed very significant sums of money, amounting to approximately $34m, have been been spent by the Federal Government over the last two years in helping the States relieve the finan-see cial plight of producers in various centres throughout Australia where natural disasters have affected them. So, on that basis, the States obviously have found it financially to their advantage to maintain a system whereby they require. accept within their budgets the first part of payLoans ments made in respect of natural disaster relief. House The Commonwealth then picks up the tab over of and above that minimal payment. We still have a showeth system which means that in any instance a State to may elect to turn towards a joint contribution on loans to State Housing organizacent a dollar for dollar basis; but, as I understand the hardposition, no State has sought that alternative. I am told that at the moment about 85 per cent of South Australia is still very seriously affected by drought. Tragically, there seems little prospect of relief. It is estimated that the State wheat crop will return about 50 per cent of the State average yield. The barley yield may be a little higher, at about 75 per cent of the State average. However, about 20 per cent of holdings will have no income from crops, and a further 30 per cent will have very low incomes. The honourable gentleman asked me about the expenditures on various drought relief measures. I have been it advised by my Department that carry-on loans amount to about $300,000; carry-on a loans, including loans approved last year, amount to about $645,000; and freight rebates livestock and fodder amount to about $50,000. So, about $lm has been provided in various loans under rural reconstruction to enable people to carry on. NA As I understand that South Australia up to this has not expended $1.5m-it s minimal conlevel from its own resources-it could apply a number of measures which perhaps it has not applied, including the slaughter of aged stock or drought affected stock, all of which can be compensated for under existing approved Minschemes in accordance with formulae between the Commonwealth and the States. In other the South Australian Government could Compursue a number of measures which are in accordance with existing formulae, including the of aged stock or drought affected stock, for which there is a scheme of offset within the an drought assistance measures. The Commonwealth stands prepared to assist the South Australian Government to provide help to those affected by the drought, in accordance with those the existing procedures. The Commonwealth is most concerned at the plight of so many of those about whom the honourable gentleman's question has directed. We certainly are prepared to assist in relieving theirfinancialplight. However, we the basis of Commonwealth-State assistance as enabling the State to play its part and to administer the scheme. We certainly stand behind it in providing whatever additional assistance individual land holders in that State might NA",15
7,Mr BRYANT,INCREASES IN MEDICAL FEES,I address a quesuon to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relabase tions. Why does the Government surrender so meekly to requests from the medical profession for an increase in its fees andfightso viciously against decent wage justice for people working industries such as the electricity industry Victoria?,16
8,Mr STREET,INCREASES IN MEDICAL FEES,"I am surprised that the honourMclntyre, able member has taken the attitude taken in relation to the power workers dispute in Victoria in which about 2,000 men in the Latrobe Valley are holding an entire State ransom.",16
9,Mr BRYANT,INCREASES IN MEDICAL FEES,"Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question was in two parts. The firstbe related to the Government's surrendering to request of the medical profession for a fee rise when doctors are already adequately paid",16
10,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,INCREASES IN MEDICAL FEES,Order! There is no very substance in the point of order. The honourable member will resume his seat.,16
11,Mr STREET,INCREASES IN MEDICAL FEES,"Unhke the situation in respect of the power workers in the Latrobe Valley to whom the honourable gentleman referred, the medical fees have been setded by a proper cess of negotiation and arbitration. A deputy president of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, Mr Justice Ludeke, has held a long and painstaking inquiry into medical fees- I think my colleague the Minister for Health will confirm, this-to operate for next year. As a resultbeing of that long and careful investigation Mr Justice Ludeke has made certain recommendations. It wtil be interesting to see whether there is equal willingness to accept the decisions of arbiber's tration in the case of the power workers in Victoria. NA MONITORING STATION AT CAPE GRIM completed.",16
12,Mr GROOM,ESTABLISHMENT OF BASE LINE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development. Is it a fact that scientists and technical officers from the Minister's Derect partment and the Department of Science have been conducting experiments and taking air samples in many parts of Australia to determine the most suitable site for a base line monitoring station? Do those experiments suggest that Grim in north-western Tasmania is the ideal location for such a station? If so, when will a manent base line station be established at Cape Grim? Also, what is the estimated cost of the tion and the associated facilities?",16
13,Mr NEWMAN,ESTABLISHMENT OF BASE LINE,"Yes , it is true that members of my Department are examining a site for a line station at Cape Grim in Tasmania. In fact, the establishment of a base line station in Australia has developed out of the recommendation made in 1972 by the United Nations Conin ference on Human Environment that ten base in line stations be estabhshed throughout the world. I beheve we confirmed that arrangement in 1972 through a speech made by Sir Laurence the Australian Ambassador to the that he has United Nations at that time. Base line stations are used to measure the to quality of air and traces of air thatflowfrom areas free from any pollution whatsoever. So one of the problems with locating the station is that the site has to be very carefully selected and must free from local interferences not just for a the matter of a couple of years but as much as SO years and maybe 100 years. So, in order to meet those requirements, each site has to be selected carefully. Investigations have been made of a site at Cape Grim in Tasmania. The site promises to be suitable, particularly on the results of some instrument tests that have been taken. The decision as to where the station will be located is one that will be taken not only by my proDepartment. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Department of Science and the Department of Environment in Tasmania will be involved also. However, I would think that Cape Grim will prove to be a favourable site subject to local development kept away from the area. That is the one problem still to be resolved. I believe that the station when it is established will be worth between an $500,000 and $lm. I know the honourable memconcern about this area. I know that he has been pressing the point for some time to see when a decision will be taken. I think we are getting to a situation in which a decision will be made as soon as the feasibility studies are NA",16
14,Mr UREN,MONETARY POLICY,"I preface my question, which I dito the Prime Minister, by saying that this Government has often said that monetary policy would be conducted in a way to ensure adequate funds to sustain a recovery in the private sector. Is the Prime Minister aware that in 1976-77 Cape money supply as measured by M3 increased by lOVi per cent while money gross domestic prodperuct rose by more than 15 per cent, and that the latest figures for the 12 months to August show staan annual increase in the money supply of only iV* per cent? In view of these facts, when will this Government stop the credit squeeze which is now a major factor in preventing economic to recovery?",16
15,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MONETARY POLICY,"It has been the cedures Government's very plain intention, which has been fulfilled by monetary authorities, that should be available for proper, worthwhile and viable projects. If the honourable gentleman give the names of any firms that have been solely refusedfinancefor any expansion project or in the proper course of carrying on their business can guarantee that matter will be examined forthwith. It is not the Government's intention that worthwhile expansion projects should be report harmed or held up by lack offinance.It is not Government's intention that the normal operState ations of business should be restricted by financial restraints from the banking sector. give that invitation to the honourable gentleman. Also I think the honourable gentleman's analysis is probably somewhat simplified because there are other concepts apart from the gross increase in the funds available. The velocity of circulation is obviously a material factor. NA",17
16,Mr ELLICOTT,ILLEGAL IMPORTATION OF DRUGS,"Has the Minister for Busiprehend ness and Consumer Affairs seen Press reports regarding a question asked in the New South Wales Parliament alleging that Customs authorifavourably ties are hamstrung in their fight and suggesting that the Army, Navy and other military authorities might be used to support Customs activity? Will the Minister inform the House whether any initiative is proposed or necessary in this regard?",17
17,Mr FIFE,ILLEGAL IMPORTATION OF DRUGS,"The short answer to the last part of ical the question raised by the honourable member similar for Wentworth is no. I have seen the reports Development referred to by the honourable member. They would involve scheme concern a question asked of the Premier in the sistance so that the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales by innovative wayscraft Mr Cleary, the member for Coogee. Mr Cleary in the country which asked the Premier whether he would support an ucts as hops in Tasmania approach to the Prime Minister to see whether of Australia, so that individuals the services of the armed forces could be used to petent to do this work could be encouraged assist in apprehending people who illegally import drugs into Australia. I am amazed that the Premier agreed to support this suggestion without first acquainting lumself with the present ment position. The defence forces are already utilised allocate that extensively by my Department in its drug enforcement operations. The assistance provided, particularly to the Narcotics Bureau, is both routine surveillance nature and in direct support of specific seizures and apprehensions. Some time ago a special committee comprising senior Defence and Customs personnel was estabUshed ensure further that the co-operation was at a maximum level. The committee meets as necessary and has established special operational proand intelligence reporting criteria. funds I think this is an opportune moment to remind the House that Australian Customs and particucan larly the Narcotics Bureau do not have to rely on their own facilities. The Narcotics Bureau is an expert organisation but it also has the I full co-operation of all other appropriate government agencies, for example the Commonwealth Police and the Territory police. I am pleased to that there is a high degree of excellent cothe operation between the Narcotics Bureau and the police. This is a very difficult area. I know undue that suggestions have been made that more I people and more luggage ought to be searched at the international terminals. I am sure that most honourable members, if not all, will realise that this is impractical. It is a very difficult area in which to operate. The administration has to rely upon intelligence information to a large degree. Peope are importing heroin concealed within their bodies and within motor vehicles. The Bureau has to rely largely upon intelligence to apthese people. I emphasise to this House that the rate of apprehension and seizure by the Australian authorities compares more than with that in comparable countries against drugs throughout the world. NA",17
18,Dr CAIRNS,UNEMPLOYMENT INITIATIVE,"I ask the Prime Minister or the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations a question. Would they be prepared to consider estabUshing what would be a new or radapproach to unemployment? It would not be to the dole, the Regional Employment or a training scheme. It provision of a subsidy or aswork could be performed in in the cities, or foodstuffs grown would replace such prodor meat in certain parts able and comto do it. Will the Prime Minister or the Minister consider the provision of a fund and the appoint of a committee of people, who are sympathetic and understand what is involved, to fund.",17
19,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT INITIATIVE,"The Government of a and, I believe, all members of the Parliament share the concern that the honourable gentleman expressed through his question. That is one of the reasons the Treasurer made it perfectly plain in his Budget Speech that there would be no finanunduly cial Umit this year on the various training grams and employment assisting programs, a number of which are designed specifically to within assist young people. This also applies to the comdetails will munity youth support schemes. If there are to be time, individuals training schemes for individuals no opportunity will be denied to a person because of an arbitrary ceding on funds. In addidon, my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relato tions has been examining, in a good deal of of detail, proposals and schemes that are operating in European countries to see whether there is anything that can be gained from their example to help aUeviate the present position in Australia. tick, That examination is still proceeding. The Government shares very much the to honourable gentleman's concern that people who want to work ought to be able to get jobs. Whatever this Government can do to alleviate immediate and short term hardship, it certainly will do. The programs that are working for young people through the various National Emprogram. ployment and Training schemes already have sisted over 100,000 people. That is quite a stantial number. Obviously many more will be helped throughout the course of this year. The Minister is devoting his attention to these matters on a continuous basis and the schemes will be and improved as and when they can be improved. NA",17
20,Mr SULLIVAN,ASSISTANCE FOR CATTLE INDUSTRY,"My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. I refer to the Minister's statement of 22 September concerning aid to the beef industry. In that statement the Minister spoke of the need to improve the mediate cash flow to beef producers. He said: The scheme will apply from tomorrow, 23 September 1977. It will take some weeks tofinaliseadministrative rangements for the lodgement ofclaims. When can the beef producers actually claim for assistance and when can the Minister further details concerning the scheme?",18
21,Mr SINCLAIR,ASSISTANCE FOR CATTLE INDUSTRY,"There were a number of components in the beef package I announced on 22 September which will mean an immediate the improvement in cash flow to cattle producers. The matter to which the honourable gentleman has turned his attention is the per head contribupage tion following certain disease control mechanthe isms. The difficulty of course is establishing the person concerned is significantly involved the beef cattle industry. Quite often administrabenefits tion is hard. The person concerned may Uve in remote and isolated area. The Government is endeavouring to ensure that people are not disadvantaged in estabUshing that these proprocedures have been undertaken. I hope that the legislation will be announced the next couple of weeks so that the be definitively set out. In the meanwho pursue any of these operations should not do so just on the basis of seeking ehgibility for the levy. However, if they are undertaking any of those procedures which are be listed in the legislation, that is the spaying heifers up to two years of age, tuberculosis and brucellosis testing, brucellosis vaccination, drenching for worm and fluke control, or dipping for treatment of external parasites such as catde they should make a statutory declaration before a responsible person showing the extent which they have been involved in those operations and indicate the number of cattle concerned. When the legislation is finaUy determined and is in the Parliament they will be able to estabUsh the fact that those procedures have been undertaken in accordance with the normal asDiscussions have already been held with the subState authorities on that part of the package relating to the assessment of rural reconstruction assistance. I hope that it will be possible to make a statement fairly shortly on both carry-on loans household support which wtil specify some modifications to ensure that any person who is seriously disadvantaged because of the level of his income will be able to secure assistance from the rural reconstruction authorities in those two areas. That assistance, which would be available immediately, would help the cashflowposition of growers. As soon as a full statement is availimable I will ensure that it is distributed to interested honourable members so that they can make it widely known in their electorates and so arthat people who are in a disastrous financial position and for whom this measure was introduced will know specifically how they can receive the provide benefit within the scheme.

22,Dr KLUGMAN,MEDICAL FEES,"My question is directed to Minister for Health. I preface it by quoting from Mr Justice Ludeke's report of the inquiry on medical fees which was tabled yesterday. On 13 of the report Mr Justice Ludeke refers to fact that to come to a conclusion on medical that fees it was necessary that they should be in examined by reference to changes in the medical scheme which have an effect on the a income of medical practitioners outside the area of adjustment of fees, where there has been a change which leads to an increase in incomes and where there has been no proportionate change in work loads. He says: The Department also drew attendon Medibank upon incomes, and rect billings, changes in methods of remuneration for services rendered to patients in Standard (previously wards of public hospitals and the introduction of complete medical cover for pensioners . . . Mr Jusdce Ludeke then goes on",18
23,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,MEDICAL FEES,Order!,19
24,Dr KLUGMAN,MEDICAL FEES,This is the question.,19
25,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,MEDICAL FEES,Order! I suggest 31.9 that the honourble member for Prospect come to his question.,19
26,Dr KLUGMAN,MEDICAL FEES,"This is it. I am sure that the Minister for Health would not have memorised this report, so it would not have possible for him to comment on it, with all respect. Mr Justice Ludeke goes on to say: In the event, the Department acknowledged that it have available any substantive information which permit an assessment to be made for these matters He concludes: . . . they have consequently played no part in determinations of the inquiry. I ask the Minister whether he agrees that the Deabout partment's failure to provide the substantive mformation is deplorable, to put it at its lowest, when an amount of $67m is involved.",19
27,Mr HUNT,MEDICAL FEES,"I think that even Mr Justice Australia Ludeke appreciated the great difficulty would confront the Department in trying to achieve the profile that the honourable member for Prospect was seeking in relation to the changed arrangements in universal health insurance in this country since the introduction Medibank. The Department for sometimehas been seeking to obtain from the computerised system the information that would inquiry to assess the new levels of incomes of the medical profession as a whole. I do not anticipate that that information will be available in any meaningful way until some time next year, withstanding the fact that the resources of operating Medibank and the resources of my Department have been employed to their utmost in trying achieve the statistics that would be valuable in arriving at a total profile of doctors' incomes Australia. Honourable members will recall that Dr Scotton was hopeful that the Medibank sysation tem would have statistics available to enable objective assessments to be made. There are, course, tens of thousands of doctors in this country, and to try to take out individual incomes raises very serious questions of privacy. standing that, the Government is using the resources it has available to try to obtain the necessary information to assist in future to the effects of inquiries. referred to features such as diI think the House ought to know that Mr Public) Justice Ludeke's determination has resulted in an increase in doctors' incomes of 3.8 per cent for the year 1978. By any standards that is a very reasonable income increase, particularly when compared with what happened when the Labor Government was in office. For instance, in 1974-75 we saw an increase in doctors' fees of per cent and in 1975-76 an increase of 20.5 per cent, making a total increase of 52.4 per cent. Since this Government came to office there even have been much more moderate increases in doctors' fees. Last year the Government negobeen tiated an increase of 7.5 per cent across the due board. This year Mr Justice Ludeke determined an average increase of 7.3 per cent, which exdid not cludes any increase for pathology fees. If no would increases occur in pathology fees for 1978, the . . . actual increase will be 6.7 per cent. This takes into account the increase in practice costs and the increase in incomes thought to be desirable the within the plateau indexation concept. Notwithstanding the honourable member's concern the fact that the information was not available from the computers, the increase in doctors' incomes for the whole of 1978 will be 3.8 per cent. If we could keep increases in incomes into that sort of level we would wipe out that inflation overnight. NA",19
28,Mr GILLARD,CAPITAL OUTFLOW,Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a statement sugof gesting that two compames have been advised to withdraw funds from Australia? Is the Prime Minister in a position to comment on the accuhelp an racy of this statement?,19
29,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CAPITAL OUTFLOW,"Yesterday a serious statement was made which indicated that nota number of companies had advised companies in Australia to withdraw funds. It indicated that Credit Suisse, the Deutsche Bank and to the Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank had from time to time been active in raising loans overseas for in Australia. It was a serious allegation because it claimed that the Euro-Pacific Finance CorporLtd, a partly owned subsidiary of two of the three banks that have just been mentioned, of had been advising, among others, the Nesdes Co. (Aus.) Ltd to withdraw funds from Australia in view of the situation relating to the currency. NotwithThis morning the Chairman and Managing Director of the Nestles company rang my office and indicated that the statements were completely untrue and that the Euro-Pacific Finance Corporation had not been in touch with the Nesdes company. The Managing Director said that he had never heard of the Euro-Pacific Finance Corporation until he looked it up in trade directory this morning and that his pany has never received advice from that poration. He confirmed in a telephone call to the Euro-Pacific Finance Corporation that there had been no contact between the company and the Corporation. He said that the Nestles company had not sent money out of Australia other than for normal purchases of materials and that in fact in July that company had brought funds into Australia. This matter was originally raised in question asked by Senator Wriedt in another place. This again indicates the completely missporting chievous and false way in which the Opposition has been behaving in relation to these particular matters. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask a supplementary question of the Prime Minister. He will themselves remember that on the 20th of last month he described as an interesting suggestion my tion as to whether the Government had conwatched sidered publishing the names of companies and persons who had been transferring funds out Australia in an unaccountable fashion and publishing the amounts so transferred. I out that the Canadian Government had instinumbers tuted that practice. I now ask the Prime Minister: Has he followed up this interesting suggestion which the Canadians have found to be cable one?",19
30,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CAPITAL OUTFLOW,The honourable something member's suggestion does remain an interesting one but whether Canada has found it of general use and help might be open to doubt because at certain times for legitimate business reasons companies require to transfer funds out of into this country. These reasons could be Sydney unrelated to any speculation of the kind that honourable member for Oxley so mischievously gentleman and in an obviously subversive fashion has been seeking to promote throughout fore the publication of the names of companies acting in that way could very well at certain bring companies under criticism when they deserve none. That may well be the objective the honourable gentleman but I hope that it question would not be. NA NA,20
31,Mr BAILLIEU,ELECTORATE,"I ask the Prime Minister whether he attended last Saturday's Victorian Football league grand final at the Melbourne a Cricket Ground? Does he agree with me that in comthe last two weeks the Collingwood and North CorMelbourne teams have provided some of the most exciting top grade contests in the history of Australian Rules football? Is the Prime Minister aware that North Melbourne's zoned territory for recruiting players takes in a good deal of the La Trobe federal electorate? In view of this link and as a result of the contribution by the North Melbourne Football Club to sport and entertaina ment, can I have an assurance that when next I make an approach for funds to improve certain grounds and facilities in the La Trobe electorate I will get a sympathetic heating?",20
32,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ELECTORATE,"Alon g with about 100,000 other people I did attend that match. It was a wonderful spectacle and a credit to the teams involved. In spite of the somewhat friendly rivalry which sometimes occurs between my State and New South Wales, those who regard as being in the senior State must concede certain advantages to Australian Rules. quesAbout 40,000 people, or 50,000 at the most, two football games in Sydney while on each occasion in Melbourne, that is, at the tied of match and the subsequent match, about 100,000 people watched the game.

33,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ELECTORATE,"It is interesting to see honourable members opposite stirred about other than politics for a change.

Does the last sentence of his reply to the honourable member for La Trobe mean that the Government proposes to change the policy under which, as the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Depvelopment told me yesterday in a prepared answer, 'no new grants were made under the program of capital assistance for leisure facilities m 1976-77 and no new grants will be made for projects under this program in 1977-78'?",20

Are these criticisms justified? Can the Minister provide me with up to date information concerning the successful cise implementation of the scheme?,21
36,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT PROJECT SCHEME,On e might say that seek the question of the honourable member for Parramatta is appropriate considering the symbol of his football team.,21
37,Mr VINER,EMPLOYMENT PROJECT SCHEME,"As one of the 108,000 people this scheme. who watched thefirstgrandfinalbetween North Melbourne and Collingwood I can agree completely with what the Prime Minister said the greatness of the national sport, that is, Ausis trahan Rules football. I say that notwithstanding that I am a hockey player and would like some opportunity to applaud the virtues of hockey as perhaps the greatest amateur sport played in Australia. Coming direcdy to the quesuon asked by the honourable gendeman, I am glad of the opportunity to correct the errors- I should perhaps say the malicious errors-put forth by the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the other place about the community development and employment project scheme. The criticisms are completely unfounded. It was suggested by the honourable senator that the scheme contravened certain anti-slavery conventions of the United Nations and other ternational provisions, such as those of the Interhis national Labour Organisation. The advice have, after consultation with the Department Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General's Demean partment, is that those conventions are in no contravened. I point out to the House, and for benefit of the shadow Minister, that Aboriginals want to work. They have welcomed with great enthusiasm the CDEP schemes which are a voluntary system for the employment of Aboriginals. The schemes are operating on a pilot basis in a number of communities such as Ernabella and Fregon in South Austraha, Bamyili in the Northern Territory and Wiluna in Western Australia. Projects for other places are being discussed with Aboriginal communities.

I asked him whether he discussed with the Minister for Health- I emphasise the word 'discussed'-the irregularities in quarantine procedures in Western Australia and the issue of a letter of clearance to an infested ship in New South Wales, the Vishna Kaiyan. The Minister in his answer has indicated that the responsibility rests with the Minister for Health that I should direct my inquiries to him. I ask the Minister whether in fact he has discussed these matters with the Minister for Health and pointed out the important consequences for primary industry, especially the Uvestock sector, of in any breakdown in quarantine procedures. Does answer to me mean that in fact he has not disI cussed with the Minister these very serious of breakdowns in quarantine procedures? Does it that the Department of Primary Industry is way not concerned or that the Minister is not conthe cerned with the consequences of any breakdown in quarantine procedures? Does the answer also mean that the Minister does not consider it to be necessary to raise with the responsible Minister a matter which is of such important consequence to his portfolio?",21
38,Mr SINCLAIR,QUARANTINE IRREGULARITIES,"I can understand the Union honourable gendeman's atutude because there are within the Labor Party quite apparent major divisions between individuals and between tions. That sort of divisiveness does not exist the Government, thank goodness. As a result, there is a capacity for communication between Ministers, between parties and between departthat mental officers. That ensures that which the honourable gentleman envisages not arise. Quarantine is a matter of major conyear cern for the Department of Primary Industry. The fact that the adrninistration of quarantine procedures is within the ambit of my colleague the Minister for Health in no way lessens my cern, or that of my Department, with the stancording dards of quarantine. Whether they be applied vessels and the necessity for them to be well fumigated and to be maintained at the maximum possible standard of cleanliness for the export grain, or whether they be applied in any other area, is incidental. Our concern is that those dards should be maintained at the highest possof ible level. There is close and continued contact between my Department and the Department result administered by the Minister for Health on matters affecting quarantine. With respect to matter of administration, however, it obviously not necessary for two departments to exercise the same responsibihty. The particular matter raised by the honour the able gentleman was referred to my colleague's Department. The administration of it is within his control. If the honourable gendeman wants supplementary answer, he might well find that greater he can obtain the details, which I understand requested, from my colleague who administers this matter. I can assure him that partment of Health and the health ministry and both the Department of Primary Industry and andThere the primary mdustry ministry have concern to ensure that, in relation to the export of powers under the Transport grain, meat or any other products, but particuvalid for various reasons, he larly those meant for human consumption, the stances in which the Queensland highest possible quarantine standards are set and could intervene quite directly and have maintained. I can assure him also that coto ordination of policy is maintained between our two departments.",22

41,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,QUARANTINE IRREGULARITIES,"Can the Prime Minister inform the House whether a request for intervention by the Commonwealth in the Seamen's dispute with the Utah company has been received from the Queensland Government? Can the Prime Minister indicate to the House facwhat powers the Commonwealth Government inand the Queensland Government have to take action to overcome the bans imposed by the Seamen's Union against Utah ships and to ensure the jobs of thousands of Queensland the difficulty workers are maintained? does Mr MALCOLM FRASER-Since May of this the Seamen's Union has refused to provide services at Hay Point for vessels operated by Utah in the coal export trade to Europe. The Seamen 's Union has been claiming that Utah vessels conshould be manned with Austrahan crews. Acto the analysis available to us, if the Seato men's Union's claims were met in full it could jeopardise exports of coal from Austraha to Europe; it could well jeopardise future contracts. of Obviously that would have consequences not only for Utah but also for other companies, and stanit would have consequences for the development coal fields not only in Queensland but also in New South Wales. It is now well known that, as a of the bans that have been imposed by the all Seamen's Union, the development of the $250m the Norwich Park coking coal project in central is Queensland has been deferred. That has cost Queenslanders 2,000 jobs and has put at risk the jobs of 1,500 other Queenslanders. Because of the delay in the commencement of the project, Queensland and Federal governments have lost about $5m in export levies, rail freights, royalties and taxes. Clearly the loss to the State a of Queensland as a whole would be very much than that. I believe that that result is typihe cal of the action of some small and extremist groups which seek the maximum disruption of both the Dethe Australian economy. have been discussions between myself a continuing matter. Because of the Premier Queensland in relation to this the Premier believed that his Act would not be sought circumGovernment the right appear in various Conciliation and Arbitration Act proceedings in a way that is not now available to the State. It is my understanding that he wished to seek deregistration provisions against the Seamen's Union in this matter. Of course, action is available to employers under the provisions of the Act. When the Director of the Industrial Relations Bureau is in his office fully- I think he has taken up office in the last day or two-provision s will be available to him. I have had legal advice from the Attorney General that the powers available to the Queensland Government are in no way unpaired by any Acts of the Commonwealth or by High Court decisions concerning the Seas and Submerged Lands Act. In fact, the powers available to the Government and Parliament of Queensland to declare a state of emergency in the whole State or any part of it under the Transport Act are available fully to the Premier and the Queensland Government. Power to act is available to the Queensland Government in a diverse number of ways under its own Acts. The Transport Act gives the Queensland Government very great powers training indeed. It may be that the Premier believes that the powers under that Act are too great to use relation to the Utah dispute. If that were so, lieve that an amendment to that Act would give the Queensland Government a greater range of options and that the Queensland Government would have the capacity to do something about that. If the Queensland Government is unwilling to use the very great powers that are undoubtnot edly available to it, the Commonwealth will tainly examine its legislation to see should be done in relation to a most serious and damaging dispute. NA NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-Will the Prime Minisfact ter confirm that Cabinet has approved the spendtaken ing of $ 100,000 on advertising in Australia s nic newspapers before December this year? Why is the Government showing such sudden interest in the welfare of the ethnic communities after two years of consistent and distressing cutbacks by his Government in migrant programs? Is this an effort to soften up critics in the ethnic Press preparation for a premature election, which Federal President of his party revealed in a letter to the Australian Financial Review today honourable gentleman has been discussing with the federal executive of his Party? How does he justify the use of taxpayers' money for party political purposes?",22
42,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NEWSPAPERS,"There is an ongoGovernment ing obligation on the Government to make sure that the services available to migrant communibelltown ties are known and understood by them. There are ongoing programs managed by the various departments. Concern has been expressed in available some migrant circles that the services and facilities provided by this Government are not adequately known by migrant communities. For example, I was discussing certain matters with one migrant community in Melbourne a few days ago. Its members seemed not fully aware of the very wide range of services available under the Commonwealth Employment Service or of the various training and retraining schemes managed by my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. When there is unemployment in migrant areas as there is in other areas, it would seem only reasonable that measures ought to be taken to make quite certain that the facilities and resources are known and understood. Young migrant people who would be eligible for various programs should have the possibilities brought to their notice and should not be denied in access to these programs because of a lack of I beunderstanding of their purpose and intent. It is the Government's intention to make sure that the wide range of services and faculties that it provides is known and understood, and on a continuing basis. So, these matters are in fact being reviewed. But the honourable gentleman need be disturbed. There is nothing new. It is cermerely an improvement on what has been conwhat can and tinuing for quite some time. One of the matters that have made this revised approach necessary is the continuing falsehoods used by the Leader of the Opposition and other members of his Party who have suggested that programs of this Government on behalf of migrants had been reduced, curtailed and cut. In a very wide number of initiatives have been by my Government which are significantly ethimprovmg the services available to migrant communities. There have been initiatives in the contracting out of services provided by government to resource centres in Sydney and Melbourne. Those experiments are working in an imaginative, thoughtful and useful way. We mean to in make quite certain that migrant communities the understand what this Government does and what it provides and that the distortions of the the Opposition will not be successful. HEALTH: HOSPITAL FINANCE",23
43,Mr BAUME,NEWSPAPERS,"Has the Minister for Health noted the political criticism of the Federal by Labor parliamentarians at the official opening of the federallyfinancedCamppubhc hospital last weekend? Could the Minister tell the House how much money the States, particularly New South Wales, have for new hospital construction this year compared with previous years? Could the Minister ensure that at future official openings of federallyfinancedpublic hospitals in Labor governed States a member of the Government will be guaranteed the right of reply to improper and untrue propaganda speeches such as those made in my electorate last weekend by the honourable member for Werriwa, the New South Wales Premier, the New South Wales Minister for Health and the State member for Campbelltown? Could the Minister also answer allegations that there has been widespread abuse of the benefits paid to private nursing home proprietors to care for bed-fast patients?",23
44,Mr HUNT,NEWSPAPERS,I am indebted to the honourable member for Macarthur for drawing this criticism to my attention. I am surprised that the Premier of New South Wales and the New South Wales Minister for Health would indulge themselves in such a blast against the Federal Government and the Federal Minister because we have been so generous and co-operative with them in trying to assist them to extend their health services in New South Wales. Last year all State governments received $ 108m towards their hospitals development program. Mr E. G. Whitlam-And this year $50m.,24
45,Mr HUNT,NEWSPAPERS,"And this year $50m, because the States are $62lm better off. State governments are better off than they have ever been as a result of our federalism policy. While they are balancing their Budgets with credits, we are still labouring under great difficulty trying to bring the Commonwealth Budget into some sort of balance after three years of extravagance and ^responsibility by the Whitlam Labor Government. In a short period of three years, the Labor Government introduced many rather good schemes. But that Government was very extravagant, and in some instances very irresponsible. As a consequence, the Labor Government increased its tax take by over 90 per cent in its three years in office, thereby taking money out of the pockets of the Australian people, also robbing the States and giving local government a pretty raw deal. We have attempted to try to reverse this situation. I think it ill befits Labor politicians to try to make out on such a platform that this Government is giving the States a raw deal. In 1976-77, the New South Wales State Government spent $51.6m on its hospital program. Of this amount, the Commonwealth contributed $36m but it did not get one iota of thanks for that. In 1978 New South Wales is to spend $76.3m. The Commonwealth will be contributing $15m towards that project, meeting 50 per cent of the net operational costs of hospitals and increasing grants to the States by $62lm or 17 per cent. I am rather surprised that Mr Wran, the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party should have launched such an unfair and unnecessary attack upon a Government which has done so much. NA NA NA NA",24

58,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I have received a force letter from the honourable member for persons Gellibrand (Mr Willis) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The social and economic consequences of prolonged increasing unemployment. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces",25
59,Mr WILLIS,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The Opraises this matter because it is acutely concerned at the effect on this country of conquestinued and increasing unemployment and the apparent disinterest of the Government in taking effective action to reverse this disastrous situation. The result of this appaUing governmental indifference to lengthening dole queues is that this nation is experiencing rapidly escalating social problems born of the despair and alienation of the unemployed, and severe economic loss through the enforced idleness of hundreds of thousands of people. These social and economic consequences need to be recognised by this ParMr liament because they expose the sheer an inhumanity, short sightedness and wastefulness of Government poUcies which are irrefutably based on the continuance and even the extension what he said. of unemployment. Despite the Government's token attempts to appear concerned about unemployment the reality is that it is only toying with the issue. It has far less than most other comparable coundone in this regard. For such inaction and indifference this Government stands condemned. The social and economic consequences of such poUcies are so massive and so appalling that it cannot be allowed to continue the destructive course it has charted for the last VA years. I remind the House of what has happened over the I last 1% years. Unemployment has increased substantially. At the moment there are 334,000 registered unemployed. That is 86,000 more are than in August 1975, two years ago when the nonthen Opposition was suggesting that the then Government could not run the country and should be forced out of office. The Bureau of Statistics figures for unemployment show that are 318,000 unemployed now which is given 74,000 more than in August 1975. At the end of July 1977 the total number of wage and salary earners employed in Australiathese are the latest figures-was 26,500 less than in July 1975, two years previously. This is in a situation where the normal increase in the work is approximately 2 per cent, about 120,000 per year. Despite that, over the two-year period there has been a reduction in the number of employed persons by 26,500. Private industry was going to nave the lights turned on. AU sorts and of beaut things were going to happen. The fact is that there are 58,600 fewer wage and salary earners in private industry than there were two years ago. Youth unemployment rates today are appallingly high. Two years ago the unemployweeks; ment rate for teenagers was 12.0 per cent. For boys it was 10.6 per cent and for girls it was per cent. Today, two years later, the teenage employment rate is 16.7 per cent. For boys it 14.6 per cent and for girls it is 19.1 per cent. other words, virtually one in five of every teenage girl who has left school and is looking for a job cannot get one. Aboriginal unemploythey ment is 36 per cent according to a leaked document published recently. The unemployment situation is appalling much worse than it was two years ago when the Labor Government was still m office. The future trends are that the situation will get much worse. There is no possibility of any reduction in ployment in 1977-78, the currentfinancialyear, without a drastic change in government policy. This is shownfirstlyby the Budget which anticiSo, pates no reduction. Statement 2 of the Budget says that the likelihood is for litde or no change between June 1977 and June 1978. Frankly, I think that is a highly optimistic forecast. So too does the Reserve Bank, which said in a leaked document published recently showing forecasts of economic prospects for the current financial year, that estimates for unemployment would rise from 5.3 per cent at the end of the last cial year to 6.1 per cent at the end of this dar year and 6.0 per cent by mid 1978. In other words, the Reserve Bank says that unemployhigher ment will be much higher in 1977-78 than it was disputes. in 1976-77. The Department of Employment and Industhe trial Relations also is highly pessimistic about any improvement. In the recentiy published document 'Employment Prospects by Industiy and Occupation', dated July 1977 the Depart19,350,000, ment said that, while it can be expected that economy will improve during 1978, any corre1976-77. sponding upturn in labour demand by employers is likely to be slower to eventuate. So, we these Government sources saying that there will be no reduction in unemployment; that in fact there will be a substantial increase in unemployand ment on top of what we have had already in last year and three-quarters under the Fraser Government. This has enormous economic and social consecost quences. The economic consequences stem from the massive loss of production plus the need divert vast resources to the relief of the unemployed. Let us look at the production loss. The average number of unemployed in 1976-77, acconsequences cording to the Commonwealth Employment Serrefer vicefigure,was 302,000 people. Assuming 225 working days-that is, 52 weeks less seven four of them for annual leave, one for sick leave and two for public holidays- a total of 68 12.0 million working days was lost through unemE unloyment in 1976-77. The total amount of wages is >st because of unemployment in 1976-77, using In the same wagesfigureas is used to calculate wages lost by industrial disputes in 1976-77, was a massive $2,157m. Similarfigures,although are slightly less, come from using the figures Cabinet from the Bureau of Statistics. These are fantastic losses. The wage loss of and $2,157m represents 2.6 per cent of gross domestic product in 1976-77. In fact, the loss would be even greater than those figures show because if these people were working instead of being ununememployed the amount of production we would get would be more than just the amount of wages paid. There would be additional value added. there is a very much more substantial loss than appears on the surface. The House also should note that these losses dwarf the losses incurred by society through industrial disputes. Industrial disputes in 1976-77 resulted in the loss of 3.1 million working days. Compare that with 68 million working days lost as a result of unemployment in 1976-77. Total wages lost through industrial disputes were SlOOrn last financial finan-year. Compare that with the $2,157m lost calenthrough unemployment. In other words, the wage loss through unemployment was 21 times than the wage loss through industrial Looking at the increase in unemployment in period that this Government has been in office-the figure of 86,000 to which I referred before-annualise d the number of working days lost through that increase in unemployment is compared with the 3.1 million workthe ing days lost through industrial disputes in The wage loss calculated from this annualised increase in unemployment under the have all Fraser Government is $614m. Compare that with the $ 100m lost through industrial disputes. This shows the enormity of the loss of production the loss of income caused by this enormous the increase in unemployment. In addition to the wage loss and the other value added loss we have the fact that unemployment involves a vast in unemployment benefits. This year it will cost us more than three-quarters of a billion dolto lars for unemployment benefits. The estimate is $780m and the cost could well be higher than the estimate, as it was last year. The severe social of unemployment, to which I will in a moment, involve extensive economic costs in addition to the economic costs I have mentioned already. So, in total the economic consequences of unemployment in this country are nothing short of massive. They dwarf the losses through industrial disputes. I turn now to consider the social consequences. the There is increasing evidence, both here and overis seas, of the frightful social consequences of high and prolonged unemployment. The available evidence indicates that unemployment is directly them related to increasing rates of general crime, Melbourne suicide, mental illness, heart disease, drug addicbourne, twohospitals tion, domestic violence and other social disorders. In thetimeavailable I can indicate briefly the nature of this evidence, but if any General, honourable member wants to obtain details I can supply them to him. In regard to centiy as having crime, a senior criminologist in the Australian Institute of Criminology's Research Division, Dr Mukherjee, was quoted recently as having said: Numerous overseas studies have shown unemployment and crime rates are related. The evidence in Austraha is more scarce, but a Industrial report by a South Australian working group on youth unemployment last year showed that juvenile offences were much higher amongst the panment young unemployed than amongst those at school or in employment. In relation to suicide, of increased suicide rates in Australia being related to unemployment, particularly amongst people young people. A report by the Mental Health related Authority of Victoria, pubhshed in February year, showed that attempted suicide had reached almost epidemic proportions in two Victorian centres surveyed. They were Ballarat and denong. In Ballarat one in every 40 of the ployed men and women attempted suicide duradmission ing each of the two years of the Dandenong the proportion was one in 80. Dr Abie Kessel, the then acting deputy chief medical officer of the Victorian Health Authority, worked on the survey, said: Suicide among the unemployed was one of the most ing features of the survey. Not surprisingly, the report also found that suicide rates were highest amongst young people who, of course, have the highest unemployment rate. Dr Paul Wilson, a reader in sociology Queensland University, said recently that the suicide rate amongst young unemployed beSouth tween the ages of 15 and 24 years hadrisenby about 25 per cent in the past year. The director of the Link-Up welfare group in Melbourne, Mr John Dickinson, said recentiy are that his group's telephone service for desperate people was averaging a suicide call every 30 hours. Such calls are up more than 30 per cent last year. He also said that, whereas the age group involved used to be mid-30s to mid-40s, it is now mostly late teens to mid-20s. Again that is highest unemployment group. One Melbourne hospital, the Alfred Hospital, reportedly handling serious suicide attempts at the rate of four a day. Most of the people involved are in their teens and twenties and three-quarters of are female. Daily rates for the other major are as follows: Royal Melserious suicide attempts a day; Saint only Vincent's, two; Prince Henry, two; Western three; and Preston and Northcote, more regularly toDickinson, three. Mr of Link-Up, who talks these sorts of people, was quoted resaid: I think unemployment is a big contributor. The Melbourne Age of 6 June this year contained an article about mental illness. The article quoted the Department of Employment and Relations as confirming atinkbetween mental illness and unemployment. It said: Unemployment is a cause of many people being admitted to Victorian mental hospitals, according to officers of the Deof Employment and Industrial Relations. It then quoted the officer in charge of the Department 's handicapped persons section as having there is a lot of evidence said: In fact there is evidence emerging that the number of entering psychiatric hospitals with problems direcdy to unemployment is increasing significantly. this Furthermore, a study pubhshed in the United States in 1973 entitled 'Mental Illness and the Economy' showed that over the past 100 years Danwhenever the economy has turned down, unemthereby increasing unemployment, the rate of to mental hospitals hasrisenin a more survey, whilst in or less exact ratio. Referring now to heart disease, Professor Noel who Drane and Mr Rex Bunn of the School of Economics at the Macquarie Univerisity recently pubhshed a study which demonstrates that unstrikemployment has played a major role in deaths from heart disease in Australia. It shows that over the last 50 years the rate of heart disease mortality has risen after increases in unemployment and has fallen with improvements in at the job market. According to Mr Keith Windschuttle, the social historian at the New Wales Institute of Technology, similar studies in the United States of America have produced much the same results. Turning now to drug addiction, although there no studies that establish a clear link between drug addiction and unemployment, there are many indicators of such a connection. One such onindicator is the evidence given to the Senate's Health and Welfare Committee this year by the director of the New South Wales Health Comtrahan mission's central drug and alcohol advisory vice, in which he stated that substantial groups heroin addicts had been detected recently in three parts of Sydney-area s with high youth employment levels. They were Blacktown, pool and Bankstown. An increasing number of addicts were also being detected in other areas substantial unemployment. In regard to domestic violence, a survey ducted last year by the Royal Commission into Human Relationships of 1 i l women who went to the Elsie Women's Refuge in Sydney showed a definite link between unemployment and wife bashing. The survey showed that 44 per cent of the husbands who assaulted their wives had regular work. These and other indicators of social disorder indicate the enormous problems being created by unemployment in this and other countries. It becomes almost criminal for government to adopt policies which do not attempt to reduce unemployment. There is no we have had. doubt that there are massive social costs of unemployment. These costs are borne principally by the unemployed and their dependants, and they also involve important consequences for whole of society through increased social order and the financial cost of attempting to trol and treat that disorder. Even if one has no compassion for the unemployed surely one us should be concerned for society as a whole.",25
60,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,Order! The consequences honourable member's time has expired.,28
61,Mr BROWN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"If industries the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) had shown one ounce of concern for the social and economic consequences of unemploycent ment, which he has been talking about for the last 15 minutes, and if he had suggested one means by which some of these problems could be rectified we would have supported the matter of public importance with enthusiasm. Indeed looked to me when I read the daily program this was to be something of a bipartisan suggesattitude tion to deal with some of these great social prob-J. lems. But it seems that all we are faced with another debate about the causes of attitude unemployment-wh o caused it, Liberal, Labor off, or whatever? What a turgid, dull experience is going to be once again. If we are going to an argument about unemployment and about sistance, the causes of unemployment then let us have I put it to the House that it is abundantly clear that the increases in unemployment started to in in this country in the three years of the AusLabor Party's rule. I promise not to bore serthe House with statistics, as the honourable of member for Gellibrand did, but there is one simple statistic which should put an end to the unwhole of this argument. I ask the honourable Livermember for GelUbrand and other honourable members supporting him to deny it if it is not of true. When we left office at the end of 1972 the economy of this country was in a very healthy state. There were 136,000 people unemployed. conWhen the Labor Party left office there were 328,000 people unemployed in this country. Unemployment had more than doubled as a result of the economic poUcies that that party adopted when it was in power. When one looks at a basis statistic such as that, one sees what a completely no meretricious matter of public importance this one is. Unemployment started its upward movement during those three years and it is very clear that the wholesale damage done to the economy a during those three years has been a major contributing factor to the continuous unemployment I put it to honourable members that the economic poUcies that were adopted during that time the were almost calculated pohcies which certainly disresulted in substantial unemployment during conthat period. We have only to look at some of the policies. We could talk of them for hours but let just look at one or two. There was the 25 per cent tariff cut which was brought in with, I would think, an almost complete indifference to its for the individuals concerned. It was from that time until the present that our such as the clothing, textiles, plastic and rubber industries and many others started their decline. It was from the time of the 25 per tariff cut that the rot started to set in. Quite apart from the economic damage caused by that decision and quite apart from the wholesale assault on those industries, what concerns me far more than all of them is the indifference that was it shown on that occasion to the individual men that and women in those industries. What was the of the honourable member for Lalor (Dr F. Cairns) who was the responsible Minister at is yetthat stage? His attitude and the Government's were that these people could be bought that all that had to be done was to establish this yet another government scheme, to give it a havefancy name such as Structural Adjustment Asto pour in millions of dollars if they it. could be found and to buy off those exemployees. What a callous, indifferent and heartless attitude that was towards the ordinary men set and women working in those industries whom the Labor Party continually pretends that it represents. That is just one of the economic decisions made by the Labor Party at thattimewhich led ployers to the substantial increases in unemployment wages and during Labor's term of office. case the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) says this when he speaks, that unemon ployment was not solely the result of the Labor individuals Government. It must take a major blame for it, but it is not solely Labor's responsibe individualsThat biUty. Certainly other forces are at work in the society which also lead to unemployment, and it is wise that we should recognise them. The firstthing of them is the wage structure which exists in this employers country. I put it as a simple basic proposition wage and salary rates that, because of-the wage structure existing in this country, many industries have priced themselves out of world markets. As they have themselves out of world markets, the employees have priced themselves out of jobs. It is all very weUforthe Conciliation and Arbitration ComArbitration mission, under the system that we have now, fix wages and salaries which it says are going apply in the market place. It is a completely different situation when employers in the market place have to make a decision whether they can employ people at the wage and salary rates has which are fixed by the Arbitration Commission. Until we grapple with the problem Australia continue to be faced with unemployment and will continue to price itself out of world markets, and the economy will not revive. Our Minister for Special Trade (Mr Howard) is beating his way around Europe and trying tofindnew markets for some of our manufactured goods and our primary products. No doubt this will be a successful enterprise. the fact remains that while the major cost bility increases in our manufactured goods-wag e and salary increases-remai n and continue, the problem Minister is engaged upon a herculean task and he will not meet with unqualified success. I to put forward the suggestion- I hope that it is helpful suggestion and something that the Oppoployable. sition may Uke to consider-that we should be looking at the structure of the Arbitration mission. Quite apart from the fact that there State wage tribunals, it is the Commonwealth Concitiauon and Arbitration Commission that sets the pace. Its function is to solve disputes which come before it, and most of disputes concern appUcations for wage increases. I suggest that we should be looking at structuring of the Arbitration Commission to widen its functions. We cannot continue the present situation where ail that exists is a fixationthing of wages and salaries and then it is left to the market place to employ or, as is often the case, not to employ individuals subject to those wages and salaries, for the simple reason that emcannot afford to employ people at those salaries which are fixed by the ComI hasten to add, in mission. I would Uke to see a situation whereby the Commission as it is constituted there are who are aware of the market conseshare of Commission.decisions quences of made by the Arbitration is thefirstdung. There should on the Commission who because of their experience are able to contribute someto this very vexed decision as to whether will be able to employ and as to whether industries will be able to survive at the fixedby the Arbitration Commission. priced We have done something Uke this with the Industries Assistance Commission, so it is not a novel idea. I would like to see it appUed in the Commission also so that we do not to have this absurd division between the Arbitotration Commission, on the one hand, on some remote cloud,fixingwhat it thinks is appropriate as wage and salary levels and, on the other hand, the real world of industry and commerce which to translate those decisions into practice and which has to face the real decision of whether will industry and commerce can afford to employ people at the wages and salaries which are fixed by the Commission. Therefore I hope that we can look at the question of restructuring the ArNegotiations bitration Commission. There is another area which concerns me very much and it is something for which again I say the Opposition is not primarily responsible. But Indeed the Opposition may have no responsifor it at all except that that party has been in government and was unable then to solve the that I am about to mention. It is this: I venture to suggest that there is something wrong want with our education system when so many people a leave the system and are, to put it bluntly, unemThere are people who even after several years of secondary education are barely litComerate. They have no conception of how to apply arefor jobs. They have almost no initiative and almost no conception of how to go about applying for a job and how to present themselve to industrial a prospective employer. those One of the notable improvements which the present Government has made to this is the a reintroduction of the Community Youth Support scheme. It at least makes an effort to get young people into a position where they have someto offer the employers. They know how to apply for a job and how to present themselves for a job. That is a step in therightdirection it is nowhere near a solution to the whole problem. What is wrong with our education system when year after year we produce people who are virtually unemployable or who, if they do obtain jobs, obtain jobs in fields which are quite unsatis-serious fying to them? I see that the Commonwealth has an inquiry investigating this matter. I think Mr Justice Williams is responsible for this investigaApart tion. It is extraordinary that we should be invespoint, tigating this matter at such a late stage. Why no previous government embarked upon such exercise when it is so obvious that the education system we have is not one which produces individuals who are able to find satisfying, ful and productive work in the economy? The honourable member for GelUbrand said which in support of the subject of this matter of pubUc importance that the Government is doing nothin ing about the economic and social consequences. I have already mentioned the Commumty Youth Support scheme, which is a very substantial improvement along the Unes of rectifying unemby ployment and of improving the opportunities available to the unemployed to find employover-idealistic ment. If the honourable member would like read that part of the Budget Speech which is out on page SO of Hansard he will see more details of what the Government is doing with respect to retraining schemes. He will obtain from other sources details of the education proconstructive gram for unemployed youth. If he looks elsethis where he will see details of the Special Employment Training program. He should know also about the Commonwealth Rebate Apprenticeship Full-time Trainspeech ing scheme and about the improvements which the Government has made to the National Emthing: ployment and Training scheme. No doubt that scheme was first thought up it was a desirable initiative, but at that stage when I not in this House but was an ordinary member of the community it seemed to me that a large number of people at pubhc expense were learnmany ing macrame work, attending pottery classes social welfare courses and a few other things which no doubt in an ideal society might be desirable things for them to pursue. Indeed, as a bench. result of the NEAT scheme as it operated then there is one thing that we can be sure about, is, that this country will never be short of social workers. I suggest that what the present Government has done is an improvement. What it has done has been to provide on the job training in the real but world of commerce and industry for individuals who qualify under the NEAT scheme. Not only is it a better system because it provides on the job training, but it is a scheme which now provides coverage to many many thousands more people than previously were eligible to be covered. That is an improvement. I think it represents a very and genuine attempt by the Government to take up some of the slack in unemployment. from all that we come back to the basic which is that the rate of unemployment has will start to go down when the economy starts to an improve and continues the momentum which has already been achieved since the present Government embarked on its economic poUcies. fruitWhen the economy has improved there wiU be no problem so far as unemployment is concerned. When we revitalise the private sector, still after all the assaults to which it has been subjected employs three out of four people Australia, then there will be more employment opportunities for the people. We will improve the economy of this country continuing with the economic poUcies of the present Government and not by adopting the proposals to spend more govern to ment money which still come from the Labor set Party. That is the standard tedious suggestion that comes forward. Nothing constructive other than that comes forward from the Labor Party; also indeed, I very much regret to say that nothing has come out of this discussion on matter of pubUc importance which has been Youth raised by the honourable member for Gellibrand.",28
62,Mr COHEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The by the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr Brown) was unique at least for one It is thefirsttime that I have heard any when member from the Government side of the very chamber admit that the unemployment which was occurred when the Labor Party was in office was not totally the fault of the Labor Government. I commend him for that, if for nothing else. In senses he made a good speech, although I and disagree with him. It makes one wonder how a person of his ability is still on the back bench when so many lightweights are now on the front that I disagreed with him when he talked about the causes of unemployment. The topic of this discussion is 'The social and economic consequences of prolonged and increasing unemployment'. I want to take up with the honourable member the difference between the situation which existed during the period from 1972 and 1975 and the situation which exists the period from 1972 to 1975, whilst unemployObviously ment did increase under the Labor Government it also increased quite dramatically all over world. Let me cite a few figures: In France ing that period unemployment rose from measures 394,000 to 1,015,000. It almost trebled and it has been static ever since. In West Germany it from 274,000 to 1,074,000; in Belgium it rose from 92,000 to 218,000; in the United Kingdom it rose from 611,000 to 1,274,000, and so Since then, however the level of unemployment has continued to rise in Australia whereas in United States it has dropped by 1.6 per cent, West Germany it has dropped by 0.4 per cent, and in the United Kingdom it has dropped only 0.5 per cent. That is the difference what has happened in Austraha and what has happened in the rest of the world. Let me remind honourable members of the Having statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when he was making his policy speech on 27 November 1975. He said: Only under a Liberal-Nauonal Country Party Governincrease ment will there be jobs for all who want them. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said: There will be a sustained drive to put Australians work and to create employment for thousands of school leavers who face the dole lines under the Whitlam policies. What a change there has been since those halwin cyon days of 1975 when the Government was swept into power! All these commitments and all the reasons for dismissing the Labor Governcause ment from office have gone by the board as employment has continued to rise. Let us cona sider a fewfigures.The Australian Bureau of Statisticsfiguresindicate that at the end of August 355,000 people-5.7 per cent of the work force-were unemployed. That means that 60,700 more people were unemployed than at the same time last year. Of the young people tween the ages of 15 and 19 years 118,200 are unemployed, representing 37.2 per cent of total unemployed. Thisfigurerepresents 16.7 cent of this age group, of which 37,000 are still looking for theirfirstjob. The Commonwealth Employment Service figures show that 333,978 people are unem-said ployed, or 5.4 per cent of the work force. Whichcauses. ever way we look at it, thatfigureis high and it higher than it was before. Honourable members should remember that young people under the age of 21 years make up only 12 per cent of work force yet they constitute 36.2 per cent total unemployed. A further 90,000 young was people will be looking for work at the end of the now. During current school year. the policies of the present Government are doing nothing to cure the problem of the unemployment. In fact, they are compounding it. durThe Government could and should adopt to alleviate the employment problem. Instead it is diverting attention from this overridrose ing problem by feeding speculation about an early election. If the experts are right, if the Reserve Bank and the economists are right, if on. Professor Warren Hogan, the Liberal Party's economic adviser, is right, we can expect the unthe employment level to reach between 400,000 and in 450,000, or 7 per cent of the work force, this financial year. So much for the present Governby ment's pre-election promise to reduce unembetween ployment to 1.5 per cent. This Government has reached a new high in its attempt to deceive the Austrahan people. totally failed to fulfil the promise it made to cure inflation and despite all the lies now being told about how the Government has reduced inflation, the latest consumer price index of 13.4 per cent is only 0.2 per cent below the increase at the end of 1975 when the Government came to office. Having the dubious honour of seeing unemployment rise to the back to highest level since the Depression the Government is now proceeding to change the method of measuring both of these indicators. If it cannot by doing anything, it changes the rules by which we measure unemployment and inflation. We now have no seasonally adjusted figures. Bethey would be embarrassing to the un-Government they have been aboUshed. We have new thing by which to measure inflation called an implicit price deflator. It sounds almost pornographic. Nobody had heard of it a few weeks ago and suddenly it is a new measure because it makes inflation look good. Now the Government is attempting to aboUsh the Commonwealth Embeployment Service statistics and instead use the Bureau of Statistics because they wtil make unthe employmentfigureslook more favourable. If per there is to be an election, thefigureswill be delayed until after the election so that they will not embarrass the Government. The honourable member for Diamond Valley that we had done nothing about looking at I made the suggestion to the Prime Minisis ter in the opening week of this session that we set up a select committee of the Parliament to look at job creation schemes and at the problems of the youth unemployment, the committee to report of back to the Parliament quickly. He said that it an interesting idea but nothing has come of it. We have made an offer, I will not say in a bipartisan way but in a united way, to help solve the real human problems that occur with unemployment. My colleague the honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr Willis) made some reference to various mental health authoriues in Victoria and I would Uke to refer to those details again because they are worth repeating. A study conducted by the Victorian Mental Health Authority in BaUarat and Dandenong in 1975 found that the rate of attempted suicide among the employed was very high in both areas. In Ballarat it was more than 12 times the average rate among unemployed and in Dandenong seven dmes the average rate for the area as a whole. The findings of this study are similar to those of other studies conducted in Australia and overseas which have concluded that unemployment can lead to severe mental and physical illness and can be a major cause of death. As unemployment increases, so do the rates of mental illness, suicide, heart disease, death from ulcers and infectious diseases and infant, maternal and foetal deaths according to a social historian at the New South Wales Institute of Technology, Mr Keith Windschuttle. Also unemployment has been found to be the cause of or a significant tor in many cases of marital breakdown, domestic violence and emotional disturbances in the young. We must recognise that unemployment is our worse social problem. The young and the inexperienced have been particularly badly affected by the current labour market situation. Unemployment amongst the young is unacceptably high and is Ukely to stay that way unless the Government takes positive action to alleviate the situation. The transition from school to regular employment is an especially critical time. So many of us are so far away from our school days that we have forgotten what a scary time it can be between 17 and 18 years of age faced with the prospect of going out into the world, having to start a new job, a new Ufe, a new career away from the security of family and parents, having to perform in a quite different way from the way we performed at school. We have forgotten what a traumatic experience that is for young people. But how much worse must it be if they find, when uncertain of themselves as adults, that they cannot get a job. If they cannot get a job for a few weeks that is not such a problem but when it comes to months or years is it any wonder that they lose confidence in themselves and possibly turn to taking drugs as a form of relief or to a complete escape by way of suicide? It is no wonder that they are in a serious situation. Some of us are so far removed from that period that we have forgotten what it can be Uke. There has been no move by the Government to introduce local employment schemes. I have nottimeto go through them but there have been many suggestions made from this side of the House and it was quite unfair of the honourable member for Diamond Valley to say that they had all been just a matter of spending money. Obviously some money will be involved but, with the help of the former Minister for Labour, the best Minister for Labour we have ever had, the Opposition has put forward some very good suggestions to the Government.",30
63,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT, Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,32
64,Mr RUDDOCK,UNEMPLOYMENT,"It is interesting to notice the way in which this debate has developed. The only concern of the honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr Willis) was to look at the statistics for the 1% years that this Government has been in office. Then after a very thoughtful speech by the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr Brown) in which he made some pertinent but honest comments fac- about the nature of unemployment and expressed the concern that honourable members on this side of the House genuinely feel, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) attempted to come to grips with the problem by at least acknowledging the role played by the Australian Labor Party in office when unemployment in Australia grew from 136,000 to 328,000 by thetimeit left office. He came up with the same excuse that was offered by honourable members opposite when the Labor Party was in office. Today I took the opportunity to read the record of some of the debates that have taken place already on this subject and I thought that we may have heard today from one of the Labor Party's front bench spokesmen, such as the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson), who gave the same sort of statistics as did the honourable member for Robertson in a debate in this House on 5 March 1975. Mr Brown-It was almost the same speech.",32
65,Mr RUDDOCK,UNEMPLOYMENT,"It was almost the same speech. In it the honourable member for Burke endeavoured to defend the rate at which unemployment rose under Labor by referring to certain statistics. What he tried to say was what the honourable member for Robertson said, that is, that under Labor unemployment rose but it was a phenomenon that was very much the same throughout the world and therefore we could not blame Labor. The fact is that the honourable member for Robertson today attempted to that same argument by saying: 'Do not blame for what happened before. It really was thing that was beyond our control'. A comparinificantly. son of the unemployment statistics for the tries which the honourable member for Burke chose to refer to in 1975 with the current statistics for those countries shows that the phenomenon still very much the same.",32
66,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,UNEMPLOYMENT,You would not be game to say that to his face.,33
67,Mr RUDDOCK,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I will. If the honourable Let member for Robertson was so concerned about this question as to be bipartisan in the approach he would want to take, he also would realise that if we wanted to rest on our laurels we could the same excuse today. What of thefiguresfor Canada? The honourable member for Burke provide referred to Canada and said that its level of employment had reached 6.7 per cent; yet today it is 7.7 per cent.",33
68,Mr WILLIS,UNEMPLOYMENT,Try the United States.,33
69,Mr RUDDOCK,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I would like to take a such different approach from that taken by the honourable member for Robertson. Instead of saying 'and so on' and leaving out the United grass. States of America I inform the House that in the United States there has been a marginal improvement and unemployment has dropped by 1.8 per cent. Unemployment in Australia gone up at much the same rate as it has in Canada, from 4.1 per cent to 5.1 per cent, while in Italy it has gone up from 4.1 per cent to 6.8 cent. If we wanted to selectively go through statistics and look for excuses we could them, but the fact is that in this House and in debates that ought to be going on in the munity we should be looking at the causes of employment rather than making the pious stateone ments of the sort we hear often when honourable members express with righteous indignation their concern at the level of unemployment. know it is hard for the people who are unemWe ployed and I share the concern of families befinding cause their kids cannot get a job. Each one of on this side of the House is concerned about the problem and the nature of the programs developed while in office expresses our concern about the problem. I propose to go through them. If we look at the programs which the tralian Labor Party developed when in officeyoung the ones which were said to deal with June unemployment-we suddenly realise some remarkable facts. As I understand the situation there were three programs. First of all, there the National Employment and Training scheme. use That scheme was developed and announced us long before the levels of unemployment under somethe Labor Government started to rise sigDid the Labor Party have in mind, counwhen it developed the NEAT scheme, that it would have to cope with large levels of unemployment? Is that the reason why the scheme was is brought in before the numbers started to rise?",33
70,Mr WILLIS,UNEMPLOYMENT,No.,33
71,Mr RUDDOCK,UNEMPLOYMENT,"No. I did not think the honourable member would suggest that it was. us look at the structural adjustment scheme. It also was developed before the significant levels of unemployment started to occur. The only scheme the Labor Party developed in order offer to relieve unemployment was the Regional Employment Development scheme. Its job was to work of a totally unskilled nature and to ungive people something to do in order to keep them out of thefiguresor statistics which are kept. The purpose of that scheme was to reduce the numbers of unemployed in Austraha by giving the unemployed some work in electorates as that of the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young). The work was largely digging ditches, painting fences and cutting If honourable members think that those schemes were meant to deal with the problem, has then I suggest that the approach which the present Government is taking is much more constructive. We are developing programs to look at perthe cause and to deal with the cause. That is what these we have to look at. We have spent money on find upgrading the Commonwealth Employment the Service, particularly by the introduction of the comimportant communications networks which are unso essential so that jobs which are available in area can be made available for the unemployed from another area. We have expanded the NEAT scheme along the lines elaborated by I the honourable member for Diamond Valley. have made that scheme more relevant to job rather than having an elaborate tertiary us education assistance scheme which simply paid larger benefits to those people who were in the we have know. That is largely what happened. We have developed the Special Youth EmAusployment Training Program under which 7,500 persons were benefiting as at the end of 1977. We have the education program for unemployed youth under which some 550 people whose educational skills were not adwas equate in the education system will have those skills brought up to a level that will help them find jobs. We have increased assistance for prenticeship training, particularly with the development of the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training scheme on which greater emphasis is being placed. We have the as relocation assistance scheme which is an imporare tant development and an innovation will help peoplefindjobs in those areas in which they are available and for which their skills training will fit them. We have the program, the community youth support scheme.",33
72,Mr WILLIS,UNEMPLOYMENT,Not one job.,34
73,Mr RUDDOCK,UNEMPLOYMENT,It is an important scheme because it is dealing with the very social problems about which the honourable member was talking today as involving young people. was the nature of his speech. That is the only matter he raised. The community youth support Works scheme provides a mechanism in electorates such referred as mine in which we have three schemes under ways way. I have participated in developing them. They involve young people. Mr Brown-There are three in my eleaorate.,34
74,Mr RUDDOCK,UNEMPLOYMENT,"There are three in the eleccies torate of the honourable member for Diamond Valley. Young people are given an opportunity to equip themselves in a better way tofindjobs which are available. We have the Community Development Employment Projeas scheme for training Aboriginals. It is important. We have the Williams inquiry into education and training. I believe that the problem of unemployment is ditioning real. I beheve that the policies enunciated shortly and which I would be happy conditioning plant; and to spell out in greater detail are genuine attempts to deal with the problem. They are far more sinparks, cere attempts than those which were made by the ations previous Government to deal with the causes and problems of unemployment. I deal with one other important area which always overlooked. One honourable member in the House will recognise these words when I rebe call them, because they were said by a senior Opposition spokesman when in government. made reference to one man's pay rise costing another man his job. That statement is as will relevant today as it was then. When we look what is going on, particularly in Victoria, in tion to efforts by the trade union movement, which honourable members opposite are so closely aligned, to break the indexation guidelines and to destroy the wage-fixing system in this country, we realise that honourable members opposite have no interest in unemployment. They would be seeking to bring about a conment structive settlement of those disputes which apwould not involve the breaching of the indexation guidelines if they were concerned about unemployment. Quite frankly, I predict that unemployment will increase gready, as it has already a result of strikes, if the indexation guidelines broken as a result of the activities of the and which unions in Victoria.",34

77,Mr HAYDEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, I claim to have been misrepresented in the ParUayesterday. I seek to have a statement made by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) withdrawn. Yesterday afternoon at the conclusion of my speech the honourable member for Denison, who had moved down to the table on the Government side-presumabl y to interject more effectively as I spoke-calle d across the table: 'You are a traitor'. I responded, in somewhat elegant fashion: ' I will sock you in the bloody ear if you call me a traitor again'. The honourable member responded by saying: 'You have a go'. Then you, Mr Deputy Speaker, said 'Order!'; and then you called the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson). I presumed, wrongly as the record shows, that you had called me to order. That was the way I understood the situation. I therefore made some points, again with some delicacy, which I regret now and for which I apologise to you. However, I think that the statement made by the honourable member for Denison is offensive in the extreme and quite unparliamentary. I ask that that statement be withdrawn.",34
78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION," I appreciate the way in which the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) has approached this problem. I shall refer to the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) in just one moment. Before I do so I point out, because I think it is important, that when the confrontation occurred across the table I was in the Chair. Although I heard conversation going on, I did not pick up any part at all of the statements which were made. Honourable members have my absolute assurance on that point. I suppose that that points to the difficulty the Chair has when a fair amount of conversation is going on, particularly when, as in this case, Hansard picks up the remarks. I would have thought it very much to the betterment of the parliamentary institution if both honourable members were to agree that the two statements be removed from the official Hansard record, other than the daily Hansard. It is not for the Chair to rule in that way at this stage, but that is what I would wish to be done. Having heard the explanation given by the honourable member for Oxley, but having in mind that I did not hear that remark made yesterday afternoon by the honourable member for Denison, I require the honourable member for Denison to withdraw that remark.",35
79,Mr HODGMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Before responding, I simply",35
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I think it might be better if the honourable member were to withdraw his remark at the outset because it is strictly an unparliamentary remark. Honourable members must not impugn other honourable members in this House, regardless of their views or anything else, by making personal references of that nature.",35
81,Mr HODGMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I wish to submit to you with respect that, by reference to a passage in May's Parliamentary Practice, that comment in context may not in fact have been unparliamentary. I wish to read a brief passage which appears on page 445 of the nineteenth edition of Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice.",35
82,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable member for Denison can take a point of order and make reference to May in domg so if he so wishes. In the meantime I point out to him that the Chair is quitefirmand quite definite that no member of parhament can make references in the terms that he did to any other member of parhament.,35
83,Mr HODGMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order on that ruling in a spirit of goodwill. I simply refer to page 445 of the nineteenth edition of May's Parliamentary Practice. One finds set out on that page an appendix of unparliamentary expressions. Included among those unparliamentary espressions is the word 'traitor'. Also to be found are references to House of Commons debates in 1911 and a further debate in 1948. I have not had time to check the Hansard record, but May gives a qualification, which is a very important qualification, and which reads: It must however be emphasised not only that the list is not exhaustiveI do not take that point but I do take the next pointbut also that the permissibility of some of them would depend upon the sense and temper in which they were used: I repeat the words: 'the permissibility of some of them would depend upon the sense and temper in which they were used'. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) and I have been engaged this week in an economic debate. I want to say from the outset that the word I used was used in that context. On Tuesday of this week I had moved a censure motion against the honourable member for Oxley for making statements which, in the terms of the motion, were economically subversive. That motion was carried by this House. Notwithstanding the carriage of that motion, the honourable member for Oxley has continued to make pubhc statements which have exacerbated the situation which he created and for which the House censured him. So I make thisfirstand fundamental point: I have made it clear to the honourable member for Oxley that I do not suggest he is a traitor at large but I gest that in the strict context of that economic bate he has been an economic traitor to It Austraha. That is the sense in which I used the term. I now turn to the word 'temper'. My remark was not shouted from one side of the House the other when the proceedings of the House Respresentatives were being broadcast. I had walked down to the table to speak to the Minister for Post and Telecommunicadons (Mr Eric Robinson) who was to be the next speaker in the in debate then in progress. I spoke briefly to Minister. The honourable member for Oxley down upon concluding his speech-Hansar d is not strictly correct in ihis-Hansar d records as saying: 'You are a traitor'. The word that used and the word that I noted at that dme was: 'Traitor'. I said that direcdy to him as he sat down. Hansard shows that Mr Hayden then said: I will sock you in the bloody ear if you call me a again. I do not know whether I did not hear the honourtirely able member-the honourable member said that he regretted saying those words-bu t I still know whether he indicated that he would withgenuinely draw them. If he did so indicate, I did not him do so. I am being called upon to withdraw something. I simply draw attention to the fact- also.",35
84,Mr YOUNG,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Why do you not withdraw?,36
85,Mr HODGMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable member for Port Adelaide persistently tries to stifle me in Parliament; he persistently fails and he will conbent tinue to fail. The words that I noted down point immediately after the incident occurred were these:,36
86,Mr HAYDEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"If you say that again I will punch bloody ear. To that I then responded: Have a go. I meant it. The comment was made in that the honourable member for Oxley has been an economic traitor. It was said directly to him. Mr was not even heard by you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was a direct comment to him. I went to the Hansard office last night. I make no criticismtrue. Hansard. The honourable member for Oxley knows that I went to the Hansard office he arrived there a few minutes after I did to ask whether in fact the exchange would appear in Hansard.",36
87,Mr LES MCMAHON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Did he sock you in the nose?,36
88,Mr HODGMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"No . I was informed that the exchange would not appear in Hansard, so I took Corio. do sug-no further action. This morning I was told by deHansard: 'We are sorry; you were misinformed. is in Hansard'. I said: That is allright'.I make no complaint about that at all. I made the remark in the context of the honourable member being an economic traitor. In view of the reference into May I do not believe that my statement was of unparliamentary because it was made in the context of the honourable member being an economic traitor. There was very Utile difference between that remark and what I said unchallenged the House in the debate on the motion which I the moved on Tuesday and which in fact was passed sat by the House censuring the honourable member for Oxley. Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask me you to rule on my point of order in which I have I submitted that the remark was not unparliamentary in the context in which I have explained to the House it was used. I said that the honourable member for Oxley was an economic traitor, and I submit that that is not unparliamentary. I submit traitor therefore that I cannot be called .upon to withdraw it. Whether I would withdraw it is an enseparate question. However, I submit to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I should not be do not called upon to withdraw something which I believe, which the majority of the hear members of this House genuinely believe, and the majority of Australians genuinely believe",36
89,Mr SCHOLES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to speak to the point of order. The point of order this has been argued at length. It is therefore incumupon you, I think, to hear argument on that of order. Firstly, it has been acknowledged that the statement was made. Secondly, I suggest that the interjection made by the honourable you in the member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) was not an unusual one from him; he makes it quite regularly during the speeches of honourable members. the sense Mr YOUNG - He has a foul mouth. It Bourchier-That is uncalled for.",36
90,Mr SCHOLES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"It may be uncalled for, but it is of because Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Honourable members on both sides of the House are not helping the honourable member for Corio, nor are they helping the Chair, to take a point of order in the proper manner when occasion occurs. The honourable member for Corio is speaking to a point of order raised by the honourable member for Denison. I call the honourable member for",36
91,Mr SCHOLES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The matter of withdrawal is of courtesy to the House. The honourable memyou ber for Denison draws a parallel between maksuch ing such a comment in a general debate and more making it during a debate on a motion of cenyou sure. Quite a different set of circumstances pUcable when a modon of censure is being fence debated in the House. As you will well realise, Mr Deputy Speaker, descriptions and terms traitors. which would not be allowed during a general definal bate are allowed during a debate on a censure motion because of the very nature of that motion. An exchange across the table in which words of that sort are used is unparliamentary according to the practice and procedures adopted in this House, and it is that practice and those proreciprocating cedures to which we must resort in determining these matters. The passage in May deals with situations which are not covered by precedents or normal procedures followed in this do not think that this is a matter which the House should spend time debating. I suggest that the interests of the House would be well served both honourable members withdrew remarks and the matter were closed forthwith.",37
92,Mr HAYDEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to speak to the point of order. Clearly when the honourable member for Denison (Mr but Hodgman) spoke to the point of order he took the opportunity to canvass the issue. He says May refers to the permissibiUty of the use of tain words depending on the sense and temper in which those words were used. I submit to you that he used that word last night in an ill temmade pered and indeed intemperate manner and the sense in which the word was used was to personalise a situation in such a way that honourable member would expect, if he had any reasonable degree of nous, that I would respond with and that accordingly it would be most Ukely that solve it would be commented upon in the newspapers. outside the I want to put two points to you in regard to this night, despite matter, Mr Deputy Speaker. The first is that the honourable member showed httle diligence or which energy in working in some depth",37
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable honourable gentleman should not debate this,37
94,Mr HAYDEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The point has been made. The sense and temper with which this word has been used are relevant. They show neither dihgence nor industry in working in depth speech. He shows a remarkable factiity for ing somewhat sensationalised comments of personal nature.,37
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I think this is outside the point of order. one Mr HAYDEN - The next point I make is that if accept what he is putting to you, that there is a thing as an economic traitor, which is acceptable than other sorts of traitors, then will have to categorise all of these offensive is apand unparUamentary terms. We will have detraitors who will not be commercial traitors or political traitors but who may be part-time There is no end to this sort of thing. The point I make relates to the point raised by the honourable member for Corio as to proper conduct in this House. If the honourable member for Denison is allowed to get away with this conduct-h e has been getting away with this sort of conduct for some time- I am quite capable of with a great deal of energy, in a personalised way, which would not be particularly pleasant for him. Frankly, I would not be bothered doing it, but I am quite capable of House. I doing it. So are other members.",37
96,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable if member is not helping his own case. He should their not debate the point.,37
97,Mr HAYDEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The point is very important. Other members of this House are also capable of reciprocating. In other words, we would have a chaotic situation. Therefore, you have no choice to require from the honourable member the proper standards of conduct which are imposed that on other members of this House. Whether he is cerprepared to withdraw or whether you are prepared to force him to withdraw, I certainly withdraw the comments I made last night. They were under extreme provocation as a result of a that rather nasty, personalised interjection. such as Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER- I wonder whether the the honourable member would let me get on the business. I think this problem might that itself quite well. The Chair takes the view the honourable member for Denison was area in which we were involved last the well-reasoned case he put in he quoted May. The Chair did not hear the remark. It is in Hansard. Therefore, at this stage it is officiaUy recorded. I would require the member to withdraw the remark he point of order. made last night.",37
98,Mr HODGMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, in deference to you I withdraw the word 'traitor'. I indicate that the honourable member for Oxley is an to present a economic traitor. mak Mr HAYDEN - Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask that a the honourable member withdraw that remark. His withdrawal is unacceptable.",37
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The Chair will not accept that withdrawal. That is unparUamentary language for one member to use of another. It in Hansard and should be withdrawn.,37
100,Mr HODGMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I have withdrawn the word which appeared in Hansard.,38
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I suggest that the honourable member resume his seat.,38
102,Mr SCHOLES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I ask the honourable member to withdraw the remarks that he subsdtuted which will appear in Hansard now.,38
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I take the view that I have asked the honourable member for and Denison to withdraw in unqualified fashion, the I think he has. I am very pleased that the honourable member for Oxley has also withdrawn. The only thing that I think needs to be said is think the two remarks should be deleted from Hansard.",38
104,Mr SCHOLES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I take a point of order. The wayhonourable member for Denison substituted another remark during this debate, and he not withdrawn it.",38
105,Mr HAYDEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I take the same point of order. He has substituted 'economic traitor' for 'traidrawal tor', and he has not withdrawn it. He should withdraw all comment or we will seek to discuss the matter further. I think that is unnecessary. One must seek to have these unparUamentary comments withdrawn. They would not stand up outside. I would certainly not hesitate to propriate action outside if it were said. If I not take appropriate acdon here and seek proper safeguard from the Chair, I would not have much standing outside ifi protested when somepoint body used that term outside. Mr Burr- I point out that the honourable member for Denison, when speaking to his stances motion of censure of the honourable member for Oxley, on Tuesday used the words 'economic traitor' repeatedly. At thattimethose references were not chaUenged by the honourable member for Oxley or any other member of the Opporespect sition. If they were acceptable during the on the censure motion on Tuesday, I can see no reason they should not be acceptable in another reference by the honourable member for Denison at a later stage.",38
106,Mr UREN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am conportunity cerned that this term was used. heard only by the honourable member for Oxley.",38
107,Mr SINCLAIR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Are you making a point of order?,38
108,Mr UREN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Yes , and I am trying to bring some sanity into this place. I understand the feeling the honourable member for Oxley because of alno legations in similar terms made against me is place, and used by a newspaper. I fought for 616 years in the courts of this land to clear my name. Then this House supported me. The then Prime Minister, John GortonMR DEPUTY SPEAKER-I am not clear about the honourable member's point of order.",38
109,Mr UREN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The point I am trying to make is that the use of the word 'traitor' against any member of this House refers to the allegiance of that member and what he owes to his country his feUow men. As far as I am concerned, if and honourable member for Denison has any decency at all he will say quite clearly that he withdraws unreservedly any such allegation. It is that a Iterrible thing to make such an aUegation against any member of this House anywhere at any time. It is about time he stood up in a decent has Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-I think this is going beyond the point of order.",38
110,Mr UREN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"It is the spirit in which the withis made. We want to see the spirit in which the honourable member withdraws it. Only if it is withdrawn in the correct way will we accept it. If it is not, we wiU move a motion against you, Mr Deputy Speaker. take ap Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER- I think I should say did two things. First of aU, the issue when I was in the chair last night has been satisfactorily resolved, from my point of view. The second is that if any member objects to an utterance of another member. Speaker Snedden has repeatedly said that he will ask for a withdrawal of the remark. All I can do under those circumto solve the situation is to ask the honourable member for Denison whether he will withdraw the phrase 'economic traitor'.",38
111,Mr HODGMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, out of to you, the Chair and the House I debate unreservedly withdraw. I repeat that: I unreservedly withdraw. I simply note that at no stage in this discussion did I make any attack on any other honourable member. I regret that some honourable members have taken the opto attack me. I unreservedly withdraw, Apparently it was and I say",38
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I suggest that the honourable member resume his seat, and that will solve the situation. I invite any point of order at this stage before I request Hansard to delete of the remarks that were made last night. If there is complaint, it would be my intention to ask the in thisActing Speaker to carry out that wish. Mr Donald Cameron- Mr Deputy SpeakeT, the only point I wish to make is that after the minute discussion in the House-allegatio n and counter-allegation-is there any purpose in changing the record? It isfirmlyentrenched in the record by virtue of the present debate in this chamber.",38
113,Mr HAYDEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I do not want it changed. The record is a record of reference and it ought to be left there.,39
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I accept the two points of view. I will not press it. OILSEEDS LEVY BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Sinclair, and read a first time.",39
115,Mr SINCLAIR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second dme. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on the production of oilseeds in Australia. The moneys raised levy will be used tofinancea research scheme for the Australian oilseeds industry. Provisions for the research scheme are contained in the related Oilseeds Levy Collection and Research Bill 1977. The commencement date of the Act will fixed by proclamation. It is expected that this be 1 November 1977, a date chosen to coincide with the seasonal pattern of production. Initially, the levy will be applied to the duction of sunflowerseed, soybeans, seed, rapeseed and linseed. However, there is provision for other oilseeds to be brought into the scheme at a later date by regulation. The legislation provides for an initial levy of tonne with provision for the rate to be varied to a maximum of $2 per tonne. Any subsequent alterations to the operative rate of levy will prescribed by regulation. The Bill provides that any action to prescribe additional oilseeds for purpose of the levy and any change in the operdeduct ative rate of levy shall take into consideration any relevant recommendation of the Australian Wheat growers' Federation which within its organisational structure an oilseeds committee representing growers in the oilseed operation producing States. The legislation provides that the grower is able to pay the levy. Levy is payable where grower delivers the oilseeds to another person processes the oilseeds. For convenience the levy is collected from the crusher or other person whom the grower delivers the oilseeds. it is uneconomic to collect small amounts of levy 20- as the administrative costs associated with their collection are not very different from those involved in collecting larger amounts. Accordingly, provision is made to exempt from the levy a crusher or other person to whom less than 15 tonnes of oilseeds is deUvered in any levy year. Similarly, a grower who himself processes less than 15 tonnes of oilseeds in a levy year is exempt. It is expected that given normal seasonal conditions the levy will raise around $200,000 annually. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) adjourned. NA Second Reading RESEARCH BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Sinclair, and read a first time. Second Reading",39
116,Mr SINCLAIR,OILSEEDS LEVY COLLECTION AND," I move: by the That the Bill be now read a second Ume. The purpose of this Bill is to provide the machinery necessary for the collection of the levy imposed by the Oilseeds Levy Bill 1977 and to be establish an Oilseeds Research Trust Account to will fund an oilseeds research scheme. This Bill should be read as one with the Oilseeds Levy Bill 1977 which I have just introduced. The Bill provides for the Act to become operative on the prosame date on which the Oilseeds Levy Act 1977 safflowercomes into operation. The levy is imposed on the production of oilseeds and growers are Uable to pay the levy. $1 per However, for practical and administrative up reasons, the levy will be collected by the Commonwealth from the crusher, or other person, to be whom the grower deUvers his oilseeds. There is, of course, provision for the crusher, or other perthe son, who pays the levy on behalf of the grower to the amount of the levy from the purchase price of the oilseeds or otherwise recover from the grower an amount of levy paid on his behalf incorporates to the Commonwealth. The Bill provides for the estabUshment and of a joint Commonwealth industry research scheme for the oilseeds industry. The lifunds raised by means of the levy will be paid the into the Oilseeds Research Trust Account and or the Government will provide a matching contribution on a dollar-for-dollar basis to meet to expenditure from the Trust Account on approved However, research projects. It is the estabUshed poUcy of the Government to foster schemes of this nature to undertake research into the problems that exist in our industries. The oilseeds industry will become of the many primary industries where this joint approach to research between the industry government is undertaken. Similar schemes are already operating most successfully in respect the wool, meat, wheat, dairy, pig and chicken meat and other rural industries. The oilseeds industry in Australia is in a relatively early stage of development. Small ties of linseed and safflower have been grown many years but over the past decade an expanseasonal sion of output particularly in sunflowerseed, rapeseed and soybeans has occurred. Even first though the industry is relatively new its value production is already over $40m annually. About half of Australia's vegetable oil operational requirements are imported and it therefore has significant import saving potential. Moreover oilof seed growing represents an important alternative to the more traditional grain crops. The industry is thus one of great potential. There is scope for expansion in oilseeds program duction but, if this potential is to be realised, industry must develop on a sound basis with an increased research effort to improve bat pests and diseases and, in particular, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would know so well as Chairman of our Government Rural Committee, sponsible it is very necessary to develop varieties that suitable to the Australian environment. This scheme will contribute to a proper orderment ing of priorities in oilseeds research. At the time it will ensure that the funds from the Account are expended on research projects that are additional to and do not merely replace the adjourned. existing research effort. The proposal for an oilseeds research scheme was initiated see ds committee of the Australian Wheat growers' Federation. The Government has expressed its willingness to participate with time. the oilseeds industry in a jointly financed research scheme. The Australian Agricultural Council has also endorsed the proposed scheme. The Bill establishes an oilseeds research mittee which will make recommendations concerning expenditure from the Trust Account. research committee will comprisefivemembers, one from each producing State, representing the oilseed:, growing industry and one member each representing the Australian Agricultural Council, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australian universities and the Department of Primary Industry. The main function of the committee wtil be to consider research proposals and formulate recomrural mendations on a program of research and on one expenditure for the oilseeds industry for approval by the Minister for Primary Industry. Purand poses for which moneys from the Account may be expended broadly foUow the precedent estabof Ushed for other joint Commonwealth industry research schemes and wtil be used for scientific, economic or technical research into the oilseeds industry. quantiWith the expected commencement of the for legislation on 1 November and given the pattern of production involving peak deliveries in summer and autumn, the bulk of the season's levy money will become available of late in the currentfinancialyear. Accordingly, the program of research will not become fully until the 1978-79financialyear. The proposed research scheme is a logical extension the schemes already operating successfully for other rural industries. In the oilseeds industry there are important problems to be overcome. The industry is fully aware of the problems that exist and recognises that a planned research prowould assist in determining solutions to the these problems. I commend the industry for having initiated this proposal which the Government yields, comis very pleased to support. I consider that the industry has shown a reattitude in taking the initiative to bring are forward the proposals that are now incorporated in the legislation before the House. The Governhas conferred with all sections of the oilsame seeds industry concerning these proposals. I Trust commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) by the oilNITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS SUBSIDY AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first Second Reading",39
117,Mr FIFE,OILSEEDS LEVY COLLECTION AND," I move: The That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Bill now before the House is to extend the operation of the nitrogenous fertilizers subsidy scheme for a further year until 31 December 1978 at the present rate of $60 per tonne of nitrogen content. Honourable members will recall that the Treasurer (Mr Lynch), in outlining in the Budget Speech a wide range of rural industry support initiatives of the Government, mentioned the provision of an amount of $12m for continuation of the subsidy for a further year. Although the Government in 1976 indicated agreement in principle with a recommendation of the Industries Assistance Commission that the subsidy be phased out, it has decided that, in view of the difficulties at present being experienced by the rural sector, no reduction in the rate of subsidy should be made at thistime.Clause 6 of the Bill continues the Government's pohcy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decision which affect rights or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation. I commend the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) adjourned.",40
118,Unknown,OILSEEDS LEVY COLLECTION AND,"Sitting suspended from 12.59 to 2.15 p.m. NA Debate resumed from IS September, on motion by Mr Malcolm Fraser: That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of matters the Opposition) (2.15)-The Office of National Assessments Bill constitutes afirstand important step towards implementing the recommendaMinisters tions of the royal commission into the ties. intelligence and security services of the Ausis trahan Government. The Labor Government in August 1974 appointed Mr Justice Hope of the Supreme Court of New South Wales as the royal commissioner to conduct this inquiry. The inquiry was intended to cover the whole range Australia's intelligence and security services. constituted the first comprehensive review of those services undertaken since the relevant organisations were estabUshed during the 1940s. NaturaUy, a good portion of the report and tinguished findings of the Hope Commission is classified. However, the abridged findings and Office. recommendations which were tabled in the House demonstrate that Mr Justice Hope has fulfilled his terms of reference thoroughly imaginatively. All members of the House are grateful to His Honour for his efforts and those his staff. This Bill establishes the Office of National Assessments as a separate statutory authority. conformity with the recommendations of the icy Hope Commission, the Office will be independent of any government department or authority and will be free of any external direction or control with respect to the substance of its reports and assessments. It is of critical importance to recognise that the Office wtil not be mvolved in the coUection of intelUgence by overt or covert means and that its assessments will relate to international not domestic questions. It is axiomatic that the formulation of government policy in areas of international, poltiical and economic relations will be only as good as the data on which it is based. It became clear to the Labor Government that the gradual proUferation of departments and organisations with interests in vitalfieldsof international relations had given rise to duplication of effort and, at times, unproductive competition for influence. This view was broadly supported by the Hope Commission. As a consequence, its basic recommendation was for the consolidation of Australian intelligence assessments into the Office to be estabUshed by this Bill. BILL 1977 The Commission recommended that the efficient and objective performance by the Office Second Reading of its functions required that it be estabUshed under what the Commission called a charter of independence. The key elements of that charter are set forth in the present Bill. These are that the Office is to prepare reports and assessments on of current poltiical, strategic or economic significance to Australia and that it should bring these reports and assessments to the attention of and all other departments and authoriAbove all, the Director-General of the Office to have the sole statutory right to direct its work. The Bill states specifically that the Director-General is not subject to direction in respect of the content of or any conclusions to be reached in any report or assessment under the of Act. Naturally, the Director-General and the It Office will be subject to normal administrative and accounting procedures so as to ensure that his and the Office's use of pubUc funds is monitored; but such oversight is absolutely disfrom any external direction or control over the substantive work and assessments of the These arrangements are consistent with the recommendations of the royal commission. They are welcomed because they provide a strucand ture within which objective assessments on important issues can be made available to the of Australian Government and thus can strengthen its abitity to formulate poticy. The Bill is largely silent on the day to day In working relationship between the Office and poldepanments. It is imponant, therefore, that it be read in conjunction with thefindingsof the Hope Commission and the second reading rent speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm tunity Fraser). In both cases it has been asserted out qualification that it is not the function of Office to comment or to give advice on pohcy. function is to provide the vital support to pohcy making and policy consideration which flow from the provision of objective assessments relevant data and situations. This is the correct relationship. It should serve to put an end to past ambiguity and dissipation of sometimes characterised the relationship between the assessment and policy-making organs port of the bureaucracy. Given the importance of this new Office and the functions it will perform, the staffing of Office becomes a matter of fundamental imporwith tance. The Bill provides a sound structure for the recruitment of competent staff to the Office. It also of particular importance that the staffing provisions of the Bill are consistent with the for the Office to be independent. The Bill assigns to the Director-General exclusive control over the recruitment and instruction ofhis staff. It also assigns to the Director-General a status and ure consistent with his responsibilities. The tralian Labor Party supports this Bill. The plicity of its provisions should not be allowed detract in any way from its important effects. purpose is to estabhsh an office which will provide the essential and objective national assessnote ments required by any Australian government. also should serve to clear up a situation within the bureaucracy which had become confused the and increasingly inefficient. When the appointment of Mr Furlonger to director-generalship of the Office was announced in May I stated that his appointment was in every respect a proper one. I repeat that assessment. Needless to say, my assessment has been arrived at independently, free of external direction without the benefit of covert intelligence. I hope that I use the correct terminology and to this debate. phraseology in such matters. I am confident that Mr Furlonger will carry out his duties objectively, diligently and thoroughly. I am certain, too, that he is aware of the essential need for recruitment to the Office of talented and dedicated staff. The establishment of the Office of National Assessments will constitute a first step towards implementing the recommendations of the royal commission. The Prime Minister has undertaken already that further steps to implement those recommendations will be taken during the cursession of the Parhament. I take this opporto urge him to adhere to that undertaking withand to press on with it. The work of the Hope the Commission was important. It affects not only Its Australia's national interests but also the interests of all individual Australians. In particular, the Government should lose no further time of in moving to implement the findings and recommendations of the Commission with respect to the methods of reviewing decisions adversely affecteffort which ing citizens or migrants.",41
119,Mr NEIL,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS," I certainly supthe Bill and welcome it. To the extent that honourable members are allowed to know about any of these matters, I understand that the of Government has had a comprehensive report. the No doubt Mr Justice Hope went into the matter his usual diligence. There are only two matters at which I wish to look in particular. The first is one is the composition of the Board of National Assessments. The honourable member for Isaacs need (Mr Hamer) has some specific views on that matter. I agree in substance with much of what he will be proposing in the near future. Under clause 6 of the Bill the composition of the Board tenhas to include an officer of the Department of AusForeign Affairs, an officer of the Department of simDefence, a member of the Defence Force and an to officer of the Australian PubUc Service not being Its an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs. (Quorum formed). It is particularly interesting to that members of the Labor Party seek to It take up the time of the Parliament when it is dealing with a Bill drawn up on the initiative of Labor Party. That initiative was taken by the Labor Party sometimeago. This matter is dear to the heart of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr the E. G. Whitlam) and he made an important speech on it only a few moments ago. I suppose that this is another indication of the lack of confidence that members of the Labor Party have in their Leader. They are prepared to spurn an and important matter originally proposed by him, a matter on which he has just made a contribution I draw the attention of the House to clause 6 of the Bill. The nature of the National Assessment the Board, if properly assessed, would be likely to include a preponderance of pubUc servants, those on the civilian side of matters who are not necessarily fully familiar with the military side of things. The officer on the board from the Department of Defence might be a public servant. Indeed he would be. Of course there would be one member of the defence force. However, one would have thought that an officer such as the Director of the Joint Intelligence Organisation might best be the person named in clause 6 (2) (b) in Ueu of an officer of the Department ofDefence. Another matter I want to draw to the attention of the House is a statement on page 2 of the printed second reading speech on this Bill. It states: The Office will be concerned with assessing intelligence about international developments and not with domestic situations. That is reasonable. That is the particular purpose of this Bill. However, I hope that in the future we will turn our attention to the domestic situation because obviously that was the subject of some investigation by the royal commissioner. Further on in the second reading speech these words appear: The Office will not be organised to collect intelligence by clandestine or other means. That sentence is a little hard to follow. The word 'other' could include any means whatsoever. Presumably that sentence means by some other means similar to what are understood ordinarily to be clandestine means. If this Office is merely collate and assess reports from the various other agencies, this point needs to be clarified because one would imagine that in some cases the agencies would use what hitherto have been conappear sidered to be legitimate aspects of covert action that ordinarily apply. I do not refer to anything that could be considered improper. But what happens in a case where one of the agencies lects some information that becomes part of a report and subsequently the National Assessments Board has to consider it? Does it reject information because it may have been collected by covert means or does the Bill relate only Board itself? The Bill appears to be silent on point. Authority for the statement that there be no organisation to collect information by clanfrom destine or other means is in the second reading speech. In my view this point should be clarified. I want to refer the House to what is probably the latest situation in the United States of America on this question of covert action agencies acting outside their own country. It is be remembered that the Central Intelligence Agency in the United States was set up in Presimatter dent Truman'stimein office because so many reports were coming in from so many different agencies that the American Government was suffering from confusion. The President was faced with a huge number of reports daily. Obvistatute ously it was necessary and desirable to have some collation of them so that as simple a set conclusions as possible could be put before the President each day. So the CIA was developed. I remember a recent controversy. I do not want to re-open it but I think some members of the Labor Party, including the Leader of the Opposition, did the country no good by saying some of the things that they said at that time. (Quorum formed). Again it is unusual tofindwhen we are dealing with such an important matter, especially one dear to the heart of the Leader of the Opposition, that there are only five Labor members in the House, or is it unusual? Indeed, hardly any members of the Opposition were here to listen to their Leader when he made a speech on a most important matter affecting the security of the nation. They do not support him at all. They walked out and left him in the lurch. They are not even prepared to be present during the remainder of the debate. I think there are only about half a dozen members of the Opposition present now and they are disruptionists. The honourable member who has caused some of these disruptions is well known for this kind of behaviour. to Mr LES JOHNSON - I take a point of order. For the last three or four minutes the House has been harangued by the honourable member for St other George. What he has been saying does not to have any relevance to the legislation before the House. I am sure if he was an Opposition member you would be reminding him of the situation. I ask if the honourable member is colin order in continuing this irrelevancy?",42
120,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,I would suggest to the the honourable member for St George that he return to the subject matter of the debate. I to the would suggest to the honourable member for this Hughes that if he looks at Hansard he will find will that on many occasions irrelevancies have come the left of the Chair. The Chair has been as tolerant of honourable members on the left of the Chair as it has been of those on therightof the Chair.,43
121,Mr NEIL,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"I noticed that the honourable by member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) was not to present in the House when I was speaking before the last quorum was formed. I was dealing with a mentioned in the second reading speech, the question of whether the Office is to be organised to collect intelUgence by clandestine or other means. It is not to be so organised. In America the Murphy Commission, authorised by in 1972, discussed the whole question of covert action in its report 'The Organisation of of the Government for the Conduct of Foreign Policy'. One of the conclusions it reached was this: Coven action should not be abandoned but should be employed only where such acdon is clearly essential to vital US purposes and then only after careful high level review. The history of covert action is as old as warfare itself. It has been said by some people to be a legitimate part of foreign pohcy. It has been said by some people that secrecy itself is not sinister or incompatible with democratic government providing the aim is to ensure that the security of the nation is maintained. However, the matter needs clarification because I think that many people object to the use of covert action on the ground of morality. They think that it is immoral and beneath the dignity of any nation. On the other hand, we have to recognise that friendly countries often use legitimate forms of covert action to find out trade secrets or to obtain information on economic and other matters. This action is not illegal even though they do not disclose what they are doing. Diplomats often use covert action in a proper and legitimate way. I suggest that we must look again at some of the words of the Murphy Commission. It said: Many dangers are associated with conven action. But we must live in the world we find, not the world we might wish. Our adversaries deny themselves no form of action which might advance their interest of the world a prohibition on our use of coven action would put the US and those who rely on it at a dangerous disadvantage. I suggest that we should obtain a clarification of the relationship between the office and the other agencies which it is drawing together. In other words, although the office itself will not collect intelUgence by clandestine means, what is the situation if another agency obtains information by covert means? I assume that those covert means would be legitimate and legal. Is the information then obtained by that agency not to be used by the Office of National Assessments when it comes to review, assess ortietogether the proceedings of that agency in the whole intelligence assessment that it will provide from time to time?Those are the two matters I wished to raise-the question of the clandestine action and the question of the constitution of the National Assessments Board. I suggest that the Director of Joint IntelUgence be substituted for the member from the Department of Defence.",43
122,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS," I support the Bill but I want to pick up the comments made by the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil). His suggestion means that if we are to obtain intelligence assessments of the highest quality-the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) says 'that Australia needs intelligence of quaUty, timeliness and relevance' - w e need to look at what is envisaged in the Bill. It is perhaps worthy of note that the Prime Minister is not present in the chamber for the debate. I guess that he has other commitments. But there could be no more important matter from Australia's point of view than that we have the type of intelligence assessment that Mr Justice Hope envisaged, for the elementary reason that if this country is to survive in the present day ctimate it has to make efficient and effective use of its resources, and it is in the interests of the Australian people that they be so utilised. If one looks at the abridged version of the Hope report, which is the only form in which it is available-quite understandably, the report itself is still on the secret list-on e sees that intelUgence is really the assessing of information or the E rocessing of information and there should not e clandestine operations. One would have thought that in the Bill there should perhaps have been some limitation on what the intelligence groups cannot do. In this legislation we are dealing with a function which has not only a strategic significance but also political and economic significance. As has been said, we are creating a group that is to assess and advise Ministers who have the responsibility at the executive or undercut ours. In many pans level to act in the best interests of this country. For some time now there have been groups throughout the world assessing intelUgence. One must say that on occasions in many cases they are an embarrassment to the governments on whose behalf they are allegedly working. Dr Kissinger made the point that anybody interested in intelligence must be concerned with a national poticy and must also be able to guide but not necessarily follow national policy. That is not really the issue concerning us here. We would not be anxious to have intelligence guiding national policy. We ought to have nauonal poUcy assessed as a result of the intelligence available, because personalities intrude into the way in which policy should be guided. If we look at our own assessment of intelUgence and address it particularly to clause 6 of the Bill we see that the group comprises an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs, an oflicer of the Department of Defence, a member of the Defence Force and officers of the Australian Public Service. One wonders whether such a group embraces all intelligence areas and can assess them properly. I draw the attention of the House to some of the findings of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, with particular reference to what is called the career service. Honourable members will recall that the Prime Minister himself is placing very great emphasis, as he should, on a career service. But a lot of emphasis must also be placed on the intelUgence avadable to the nadon. If one looks at the report of the Royal Commission one sees the following finding: The present characteristics of the 'career service' the administration to function to some degree as tained elite group exercising significant power generally the interests of the status quo but without effectively accountable for its exercise. This is the worry that I personally type of group that is being created as the supreme body, known as the National Assessments Board. One would think that when dealing with an assessment of intelligence we would also look at other intelligent Australians who are in competitive world, bearing in mind that this is assessment on an international basis and not domestic basis. We need to have Australians who are well versed in what is happening overwhich seas-virtuall y exclusively in what is happening overseas. I think that we need people actively associated with foreign trade, actively interested in foreign exchange activities ana certainly interested in the political affairs of other countries. Let us look back at some of our assessments international pohtical matters. For a number of years some of those assessments were quite outallow rageously wrong, not the least of which was our pohtical assessment of the People's China. If one looks at the problems of that great community one sees that there was a need for the Chinese to own their land and to exercise politithe cal control over it. That could not really have been deemed a threat to this nation but we based the whole of our defence structure on the assesswould ment that there would be a downward thrust by China. Mr Hamer-That was not our intelligence.",44
123,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"It was virtually the and intelligence of John Foster Dulles. The point am making is that this led to the Vietnam tain situation as it was thought that China must be contained through Vietnam. If one looks at situation in Vietnam one realises that a lot of pohtical activities there were based on the that the people wanted to exercise control over their own country. They had been subservient French domination for years and one could see national spirit awakening. The peasants had no land ownership at all, and one could see that there was to be any stability in Vietnam it would have to be related to the fact that the people worked the land should own it. That was far from the situation. One notices also that the American intervention in Vietnam did not take place until the battle had been virtually French had been ousted. It was only then that the Americans were involved. One did not see any involvement by Canada, Great Britain, Japan or any other country. We see that the enable assessment of intelUgence in that area was fala self-conlacious. The honourable member for St George in should not shake his head. He knows that we being were wiped out in the arms struggle in Vietnam and there was no poltiical assessment of the have about the situation. The peace accords of January 1976 had no chance of success, as one realises if one looks at the way in which they were drawn up. The peace the accords were drawn up on the basis that there an would be full, free, democratic and independent on a elections in Vietnam. The problem was that Australia was not even represented in the group was discussing these matters in Paris. I should have thought that, applying this sort of intelUgence, we would have been advised of the particular lirhitations that were then in force. Then when we went to Vietnam in that false peace situation we could not see a political solution on the basis that had been agreed upon in Paris. Why? It was because President Thieu was of not prepared to agree to hold an election which did not provide for a president and which did not for him to remain. So what were we doing in this country from the point of view of assessing Republic of that intelligence? If one looks at clause 6 of the Bill one sees that sort of personnel mentioned there would not dare to mention matters which I have mentioned. If they were to have done that their actions have been deemed to be against the political interests of this country; certainly they would have been deemed to be against the interests of the United States. But the inevitable happened. The intelligence services of Japan, Great Britain Canada were not involved in this. Of course, I Canada was one of the trustees obUged to mainthe then Truce in Vietnam. One can envisage that our political assessment of the present situthe ation in South Korea, where we have lost a the number of men, would be that there is going to fact be rapid improvement and peace and democracy there. However, I doubt that that will be the situto ation. But if we were to rely upon our Departa ment of Foreign Affairs we would be told: 'Yes, things are improving in that area'. Every honourif able member knows that the poltiical opponents of the present incumbent in South Korea have who been incarcerated; in fact, they have been kidnapped from another country. We can see that there could be further troubles there. We should understand this situation from the point of view lost. The of Australia's intelUgence. I have dealt with the polidcal assessment we have to look at the strategic assessment. are telling the Austrahan people that they have to spend a lot of money on resources which will protect them. We are telling them be the situadon. But they certainly have some doubts about this position when they see Taiwanesefishingboats able to come across ourfishingwaters at any time. We do not seem to have an intelUgence complement to deal with nation these problems. In the hearings of the Joint mittee on Foreign Affairs and Defence we do not hear anybody saying that there is something wrong with that approach. This is because a son who appeared at the hearings would be thinking that it might bring upon him the ire his Minister if he were to do so. What we need in a strategic assessments boardclose is independent advice as to what is happening in the intemauonal arena and not to be married totop. a situadon which will exist in the proposed com-frailties position of the National Assessments Board. One have of the weaknesses of the Coombs report, ifi may cause mention it in this way and not as a personal criti-while. cism, is that in the hearings preparation of that report no evidence was taken from any Minister to ascertain how he thought he would be able to assess the intelligence offered to him. If one looks at the hierarchical structure of the Public Service one sees very clearly that it is too inbred to be able to give impartial assessment of a situation. I had some involvement with government facour tories which support our defence forces. We found that these factories could not get sufficientAustraUa. work to enable them to produce reasonable weapons effectively on a marketable basis. For example, the Lithgow Small Arms Factory produced a very effective small automatic weapon. But it was promptly swamped by American intelligence indicating that that weapon was not to be produced anywhere else.their So we are not able to function on an intelUgence basis to determine how our government factories can support our defence forces. How ridiculous it is, from an intelUgence assessment point of view, for us to have bought Leopard tanks. We bought them because they were deemed to be the best tanks. There was no facility in this country to manufacture the nition. When one looks at this from the point view of an intelUgence assessment on a strategic basis one has great fears that there is too much foreign intelligence in this case. Any normal son in this Parliament would immediately ask: 'How in the name of fortune were you going Now provide the ammunition if you were not designWeing the capacity to produce it here?' This was not done. It harks back to the time when we bought Centurion tanks which could not even cross the that that has tobridge at Wyong. We see in Australia this failure to grapple with the problems which can bring down govern to ments. Unless a government is efficient and intelligent and able to assess the needs of a the nation will vote against it. But the disCom-tinguished gentlemen who will comprise the Assessment Board provided for under clause 6 will not change with governments. They will per-have continuity of employment because of the promotion situation which exists within the Puboflic Service structure. Any Minister who has looked at the structure of the Public Service will have seen in many cases that the people very to the top feel that they ought to be at the They have all the inhibitions and the normal of any member of parliament but they the cloak and cover of respectabiUty bethey have been in the Service for a long That is not good enough in the competiwhich led up to thetive stakes. We come then to the economic significance of intelUgence. I think it is imperative that we have people in the private enterprise sector, who are closely associated with effective competitive trade, to advise how we ought to look at the aneconomics of a situation. For example, it is quite clear that an intelUgent assessment of Japan's economics would show that there is no hope of penetrating its beef market and that its sugar market has a very Umited potential indeed for So, from our economic point of view, we ought to be talking about whether we should not change our structure or look for new markets. We should consider whether Australia has a motor vehicle base which will last only for a short time because the Americans, who own the motor vehicle industry, are prepared to move technology to where there would be a lower labour cost component. We have all these problems in Australia at the present time. We are fast reaching a crisis situation. If we talk to any Australian we are told that what is wrong with the country is that we have a crisis on our hands. We have this not only because of bad economic management by the ammu-present Government but because world forces ofare using their intelligence to talk about their markets and where they can get outlets and to stifle Australian inventiveness and production. per-What we want in boards which are dealing with national assessments or economic assessments toare not only well meaning, devoted, intelUgent public servants, but also people from the comwill munity. It would be very helpful indeed to use the expertise of such people and to obtain ond opinion. This is not provided for within this legisladon. That is the limitation I find in Bill. If we have this career structure of the Public Service whereby perhaps the ultimate for the pubhc servant is to retire at 60 years of age on superannuation and to have no obhgations as far as decision making is concerned, we have opted out of a very essential aspect of should be asking: 'How did you fare in competitive area, whether it be pohtical, strategic economic? How did you fare in the international stakes? What is your track record?' The best people to consider are the successful Auswe traUans-the leaders in those areas-and to see whether they would not assess the situation differently. If this were done we might not have been involved in a number of the disasters which we have been involved. The future is not so clear either. We have situation in Papua New Guinea and the probAustralia. lems there have to be intelligently assessed. situation in Indonesia has to be intelligently assessed. This is important not only in the tegic sense but also the political and economic sense. The situation in America has to be of intelligently assessed, particularly in relation South America. We have to make our own way in the world as Australians. The big crisis in country has occurred because we do not yet have a national identity. We are all deemed to be somebody else's preserve, whether it be Great Britain or America. IntelUgence comes into this problem. It would follow in certain cases that if we not let some of the foreign interests own part our resources those foreign interests cate clearly that there would be no market for our resources because those foreign interests conIt trol the international market. We ought to an inteUigent assessment of these problems. could help our nation by making an intelUgent assessment when we talk about commodity conI trol in respect of Third World countries. But are up against other forces in the world which wouldfindit not at aU difficult to confuse the tinguished gentlemen who are provided for in clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill from the point of view of practical expertise, inasmuch as these apview pointees nominated in the Bill would not have had the same opportunities. We leaders in other nations being confined to a career intelUgence service. Of course, the that, although we do not want to say that be another strategic holocaust, there could be one and we will not be able to prevent it. The a secinteUigent assessment would be that we could not prevent it but we should be alerted to it. In this the poltiical context we ought to be able to understand some of the problems, particularly to our near north where there is autocratic control and where there are not necessarily continuing leaders. It is in that area that there could well be political instability. We can see that happening in countries which I have mentioned. I include intelligence. We among them South Korea. We then have to consider the economic sigor nificance to Australia. Monetary control, exchange rates, trading capacity and export markets all are associated with the difficulties which have debated here at length for weeks on end. Unless we get an intelUgent assessment of what is happening in the world we again will find ourselves being deemed to be a very inferior power. in Australia is well endowed with two magnificent resources, natural and human, and it is about the time we co-ordinated them in the interests of It is well known that we can do a lot The more towards obtaining an intelUgent assessment of where we ought to be heading not only strafrom the nation's point of view-w e have to do that politically-bu t also from the point of view international strategy. We have to do that with to policies such as those which have been announced against apartheid and other discriminatory this measures. The Opposition gives praise for those poUcies, but there is a lot more to be done. It is at the economic level that we really have to be well informed, because if we fail at that level the other two levels do not count at all. If we lose our economic capacity and work force, we really do not have any political or strategic capacity any did more and we are no influence in the world. We of want a guarantee that the Australian intelligence would indiis accurately assessed. is for those reasons that I would like to see in have the clauses which establish the assessment We boards provision for the appointment of additional personnel of the type I have mentioned. think it is mandatory that they be there. We just we cannot accept that the Bill is good enough to be left the way it is. I would like to think that the disGovernment and the Prime Minister would have another look at the Bill, not from the point of view of its basic structure but from the point of of its internal structure and the type of people most needed in Australia to advise on the do not see best use of intelligence.",45
124,Mr HAMER,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS," I find the danger is speech by the honourable member for there Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) almost undiscussible because it is quite obvious that has not the faintest idea what intelligence about. He has his own definition of'intelligence' which has the merit of originality but no other merit because his definition is completely divorNational ced from reahty. What he has done intelUgence with the pohcy which should stem from that intelligence. In so doing, in the concontinue fusion of mind which that reveals, he is indicatexcept ing very clearly to us why the Whitlam Ministryintelligence of which he was a member was such an adminis-I trative shambles. I can calm him a little on point he raised. His suggestion of additional people being appointed to the National AssessAlthough ments Board is covered by clause 6 (1) of the Bill. The Mmister can appoint additional memcern bers if he so wishes. I turn now to more serious matters. I welcome this Bill to estabUsh an Office of National Assess-processing ments. It is a step forward in our intelligence arrangements. Mr Justice Hope, in the brief tracts which we have seen from his no doubt voluminous report, correctly divided the cause intelUgence cycle into four sections-direction coUection, processing and dissemination-and I hope that the honourable member for tion. Kingsford-Smith has noted that definition of 'intelUgence'. In my view, probably the only areamaterial in which our existing arrangements working reasonably well has been in dissemination. This Bill tackles part of the problem of processing. In a speech last May the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced arrangegenerally ments to improve our organisation in terms of the direction of intelligence by setting up a comthink mittee of seven Cabinet Ministers assisted by seven permanent heads of departments. That way of improving our direction, but I must say frankly that Ifindit fairly cumbersome. It could be effective if they are prepared to meet often enough to achieve some expertise, but if they meet infrequently they will not improve the rection of our intelligence services. In thefieldof processing, which is what Bill is all about, there is no doubt that reform needed because our national assessments were particularly weak in the economicfield. Mr JusUmitations tice Hope undoubtedly was correct when he of criticised our past assessment arrangements as being too much under the influence of the partment of Defence and the Department of are Foreign Affairs. I assume that the Joint track IntelUgence Organisation will continue to be rearmed sponsible for scientific intelUgence and geographic intelUgence-geographic , in its widest sense-as well as its purely military functions. he This is not quite in accordance with the recomis all mendations of Mr Justice Hope. He recommended that most of the Joint Intelligence Organisation be transferred to this new Office of Assessments. In his speech last May the is to confusePrime Minister said: Consequently, the Joint Intelligence Organisation will under its present tide and with its existing functions, those in the area of national assessments and current which will be transferred to the new Office. do not disagree with that, but I draw attention one to this as an area where the recommendations of Mr Justice Hope have not been followed. I approve of the establishment of the Office of National Assessments, I have some conabout its membership. I have a great admiration for our officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs, most of whom are people of considerable ability. However, skill m intelligence is not conspicuous amongst their abilities. Processing-the third link in the chain exof direction, collection, processing and dissemination-require s a special type of brain beit is properly defined as the process by , which information becomes intelligence through evaluation, analysis, integration and interpretaAs Mr Justice Hope put it, 'assessment calls for a quaUty of refined judgment on a mass of about international matters very Uttle of have been which is clear fact'. I have not been able to put myfingeron why officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs are not very good at this. It must stem from their training and departmental approach. I it comes partly from their habit of trying to back every horse in the race so that no matter is awhat happens they can say they predicted it. Anyone who has had the task of reading the voluminous and extraordinarily verbose reports which come from our overseas embassies will know exactly what I mean. Winston Churchill dionce said that the only way to read a Foreign Office document was to omit every second paragraph because those paragraphs always started with 'On the other hand'. I do not know whether this that is fair, but our Department of Foreign was Affairs certainly is modelled very closely on the British Foreign Office. Anyone who doubts the of the intelUgence processing abihty the British Foreign Office should study the history of its intelUgence assessments over the interDewar and Second World War years. The records becoming available now. Over those years its record was markedly worse than that of the Services on political and strategic matters. I should Uke to make it quite clear that I am not criticising the incumbents of the positions of Director-General of the Office of National relatively Assessments and Director of the Joint age. Intelligence Organisation, both of whom are former Foreign Affairs officers. They are disThis, tinguished officers and appear to be exceptions the general rule that Foreign Affairs officers do not make good intelligence officers. However, the rule remains true. What concerns me is under the Bill before us, of thefivepeople who will comprise the National Assessments Board three will be from the Department of Foreign Affairs. I have been assured by the Prime Minis-such ter that the posts of Director-General of the Office of National Assessments and Director the Joint IntelUgence Organisation will be filled by the best qualified persons available and those posts will in no way be Department of Foreign Affairs. This is in accordAustralia ance with the recommendation of Mr Justice in every Hope who said in his report: No depanment should have arightto appoint its nomineechoosing as Director-General. It is important to draw that to the attention of interchange this House, because when the old Joint to allies in the IntelUgence Committee was formed ment of Foreign Affairs agreed to co-operate something to offerfields only on the basis that it provided the chairman ofintelUgence. the Committee and, most regrettably, it was alsed intelUgence lowed to get away with it. The chairmen it provided were sometimes good and sometimes not so good, but seldom did they have any intelUgence experience. The post became merely one of the routine, rotating Foreign Affairs jobs. Our intelUgence suffered seriously as a result. If the key jobs in the intelUgence community open to all departments, of course Department of Foreign Affairs officers will sometimes be thewith most suitable, but for the reasons I have adUnited vanced I believe this will be the exception rathernot than the rule. In relation to the appointment of a disthe tinguished individual as Director-General of Office of National Assessments the Government and the Prime Minister, must beware of using him as an instant adviser on every intelligence matter. The Director-General is only as well informed as the staff which supports him. He is no instant genius in intelUgence matters. Using him for snap judgments on intelUgence matters would be a very dangerous misuse of his ition. When we look at intelligence I think we have to accept the explanation given by fessor Trevor Roper, who stated: Intelligence, in fact, is indivisible. The greater must always be acquired by open or official methods. small area requires secret penetration, or espionNevertheless that small area may be vital . . . it must always be continuous with 'open' intelligence. of course, is the area in which the Departtoment of Foreign Affairs has an important input role, not an assessing role. It should also play a key role in the direction of intelUgence, and a sigthat,nificant role through its post reports in intelligence collection. Although it is true that these post reports are probably less important in the secret area than other methods of intelligence as electronic intercepts, code breaking, clandestine agents and satelUte observations, of nevertheless they have a part to play. I make one other point about the Office of thatNational Assessments. Mr Justice Hope in his a preserve of the report stated: cannot hope to know everything that is going on pan of the world. But we can try to keep informed about what people are doing and planning in areas of special significance to us. That requires us to be discriminaung in subjects for intelligence, collection and assessment. I add a point to that. We rely heavily on the cessed, with of intelUgence, both raw and profriendly allies. We have a lot to offer form of raw intelUgence. Our the Departexpertise in some is such that we have in the form of processed However, the quaUty of our proceswill be good only if our alhes f rovide us with their relevant raw intelligence, urther, it would be very uneconomic for us to try to produce processed intelUgence on the full range of our interests. For these reasons our relations with our alUes are of key importance to the efficiency of our intelUgence. The Leader of the areOpposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) did a great disservice to our continuing relations in this field the United States by his unjustified slur on States intelUgence officials in Australiaall of them from the Central Intelligence Agency by the way-for the Leader of the Opposition well knows that these officials are here with knowledge and approval of the Australian the Government for the valuable and appropriate role of the exchange of information. Of course, no one in the Parliament is in a position to deny absolutely that the CIA had any hand in the downfall of the Whidam Government. The record of the way in which the CIA for some years was virtually out of control is well known. But it is a wildly improbable hypothesis. posThe Whitlam Government needed no external assistance to destroy itself. It was doing a very Progood job on its own from sheer muddle and incompetence. It is typical of the Whitlam parapan of it noia to blame someone else, anyone else, for his Only afaults. What is regrettable is the way in which, seeking to absolve himself, the Leader of the Opposidon does not mind how much he damages important relauons with our allies. As usual, talks first and thinks second. That is enough about the Leader of the Opposition who is coming increasingly irrelevant. I support the Bill because it provides a valusome able step forward in our intelUgence organiscoUection ation, although I shall move a small amendment at the Committee stage which I think will better effect to the intentions of the Government, or what I believe should be the purpose of the Government.",47
125,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS," A debate about security is traditionally fairly bipartisan debate in the House but, Mr starting Acting Speaker, you will pardon me if i feel freed of any of those constraints after the contributions of both Government supporters. We are conAustraUa's sidering four basic materials in this debate. and by far the most helpful, are the abridged findings and recommendations of Mr Justice incide Hope as part of his third report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security. Along with that we have the tabling statement of Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of 5 May, his second reading speech on the Office of National Assessments Bill, and the Bill. I attention to elements involved in all four and inconsistencies between them. Another matter which attracted my attention was the question the participants in the debate. Like the honourable member for Kingsfordand Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) I am rather staggered that the Prime Minister did not think this important enough matter to involve himself in the debate on the second reading and at the Committee stage. In saying that I in no reflect on the Minister for Veterans' Affairs Garland) who is at the table. I would have thought that this is an important subject. I He stated: thought the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) leant over backwards to be far too fair .ments. . in his assessment of the Government's response ticular to Mr Justice Hope's findings and recommendations. Nonetheless, this is one of the debates at which we look with more than usual interest the advisers' benches in order to see some of our intelUgence community unmasked. We look too at some of the participants in the debate. We see two Government members blowing their They are two members with defence backgrounds and I assume, therefore, that they have some kind of intelUgence background. I deal firstly with a couple of the points made by both Government supporters who have parhe ticipated in the debate. Not unusuaUy, the one who was least able to comprehend what the Bill beurported to do was the honourable member for t George (Mr Neil) who, when I heard him, talked about his concern that there seemed to be sort of abandonment of covert action in the of intelligence. Concern about those matters misses the whole point of this assessment give agency whose purpose is merely to assess intelligence collected by other Government security bodies. The collection of intelUgence is no part of the charter of the Office of National Assessments. He then went on to talk in the simplistic terms of the 1950s and the worse part 1960s in which he played no small part. He a talked about our overseas adversaries. Our best point in relation to the security interest in this country is one of the statements made by Mr Justice Hope in which he talked about national security interests. In Part C First, ofhis findings and in paragraph 45 he stated: Australia's intelligence interests do not, and cannot, cowith those of any other country. That cannot bear repeating too often because in the the Parliament and outside it members of the Australian Labor Party have constantly asserted the need for an independent Australian assessdraw ment of world situations and have been condemned as unpatriotic and traitors. Yet here is a judge of the Supreme Court of New South of Wales, a man commissioned by the Australian Labor Party Government, whose commission has been continued by the Fraser Government, making that assessment as one ofhis key findings as one of the assumptions upon which he goes on to make every other finding in his abridwas an ged report. He has said that Australia's intelUgence interests can never of their essence coincide with those of any other country. I comway mend to honourable members the statement (Mr which appears in paragraph 40 of Mr Justice Hope's abridged report which we have before us. it would be naive to imagine that overseas governwill always tell us eveiything they know about a parmatter. That has to be our starting point in relation to the at way in which we structure not simply the intelligence collection functions of the Australian Government, but more importantly, also the matter we are discussing here today which is the cover. assessment of that intelligence. The honourable member for Isaacs quoted from the report of Mr Justice Hope, without attribution, the words of Professor Trevor Roper. He went on to draw the distinction between open and covert intelligence, the usefulness of both and their distinct inter-relationship. No one disputes that for a moment. But we are dealing in this debate with the assessment agency which has been established. The honourable member for Isaacs was at pains to criticise the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith for his constant references to the word 'intelligence' but we are talking about intelligence in this debate. In the Bill which establishes the Office of National Assessments the word 'intelligence' is used in sub-clause (1) (d) of clause 5. That sub-clause deals with international intelligence. But at every other level it talks about information. While the Bill attracts no opposition from the Labor Party in this House, to my mind it is somewhat less than adequate in giving effect to Mr Justice Hope's recommendations. One of Mr Justice Hope's specinc findings-it is a specific finding which the Government felt it ought to make public-is to be found in paragraph 48 of his report. It reads: At present, the intelligence assessment process from too great control by the Defence Department fence Committee on the one hand, and the Department Foreign Affairs, on the other. That was his finding. Mr Justice Hope made no recommendation for the establishment of an agency which had to report to two boards. It is that point that the Prime Minister once again has been far too coy with the Parliament. In the statement that he made on S May he said that there were variations in the decisions reached the Government and the recommendations of Mr Justice Hope. It would be much more, useful to legislators if the Government went on from that to show us in what respect the decisions varied from those recommendations. But in fact the Government has left it to us all to do it. But one does not have to look too far to that Mr Justice Hope's report is a very tique of the role played in the intelligence community in Australia over the last couple of decades by the Joint Intelligence Organisation. He went on tc suggest the establishment of a new intelligence assessments agency because of the deficiencies that have been shown up in the formance of the JIO. What is the Government's response to that? Is the Government's response to ensure, since it insists on setting out the tions of the Office, that it concerns itself with itical, strategic and economic matters of sigto nificance to Australia? I think all honourable members would agree that those three matters are inter-related. No, the Government consult roceeded to constitute quite artificially two oards-the National Assessments Board and the Economic Assessments Board. It proceeded quite artificially to draw a distinction between the kinds of assessments that can be made in the present world situation for Australia. Proposed section 6 of the Bill establishes a National Assessments Board. It will be seen that that Board, which is to be dominated by the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs, has to concern itself with matters not primarily involving economic considerations. I suppose, by a process of elimination, that means that it has to concern itself with political and strategic matters. Political and strategic matters go to the essence of economic matters, but now they will be considered by the Economic Assessments Board. An examination of the Bill reveals that the Economic Assessments Board is to be composed of members of the Austrahan Pubhc Service and an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Prime Minister in his second reading speech went on to refer to the sorts of departsuffers ments that he felt would contribute to the perand Desonnel on each of those boards. That seems to me of to overlook completely the conclusion reached by Mr Justice Hope, namely, that there must be an integrated approach to the intelUgence assessment function. That cannot be achieved while it on is insisted that there be established two boards whose interests are artificiaUy seen to be quite separate. The Prime Minister was at great pains in both of his statements-that of 5 May which by was made when he tabled Mr Justice Hope's abridged report, and his second reading speech when introducing this Bill-to talk about the independence of the Office of National Assessments. The Bill provides that the reports of that Office are not to be subjea to any direction in relation to their contents or their conclusions. That is very carefully set out in the Bill, and I see think it is to be commended. I do not argue, strong crinaturally, with that provision. But if one looks at the way in which the Office is supposed to work, one sees that the functioning of it will be much more complicated than that. The matters to be assessed by the DirectorperGeneral are ones on which he must report to each of the boards after he has made his assessment. Also the Director-General must consult funcwith each board in relation to each assessment. polWhat that means is that each of those boards is be given two bites of the cherry. The Director General of the Office of National Assessments is told that when he makes an assessment he must with the appropriate assessments board in relation to that assessment. That puts the Director-General in a somewhat invidious position. Let us face it; it is the Parhament which is laying down that direction. The Government is not doing so, but the Parhament is saying to the Director-General: 'You must consult with the appropriate board'. But how is he to make that assessment? How is he to say that it is a matter which concerns the Economic Assessments Board and not the so-called National Assessments Board? What nonsense! What an absurd duplication of bureaucracy to inflict upon this new Office and the head of this new Office! We lay down in the Bill which is before us that, having consulted with those boards, the Director-General is not to be subject to any direction in relation to the contents or conclusions in a report that he makes. But we then say that he must submit that report to the appropriate board once again. It is of no use our saying that we are estabUshing this Office of National Assessments as an independent assessment agency while at the sametimewe hamstring it in this way by writing into the legislation directions to the Director-General which are so vague that he will be cautious in going about his duties. The effect of that will be nothing less than to imperil the security of this countiy, if we hamstring him in that way. Honourable members on both sides are agreed that if the Joint IntelUgence Organisation is not functioning correctly and if we are to establish a new intelUgence assessment agency which is to command the respect and support desired by both major political parties in this country, it must attractfirstclass personnel. The Leader of the Opposition has said that we for our part applaud the choice and character of the person appointed as Director-General. Equally important, of course, is the quaUty of the men and women appointed to the Office. Proposed section 17 of the Bill deals with the staff of the Office. I think the honourable member for St George had some reservations which I would share about the fact that the Director-General may appoint, with the approval of the PubUc Service Board, persons from outside the Public Service. If we are serious about intelUgence and security in this country, we ought to insist-the appropriation for that Office is voted by this Parliament-that the Director-General not be subject to any scrutiny by the Public Service Board. I agree that to an extent he should be subject to the scrutiny of the Auditor-General. Hopefully one day the Parliament, by means of a parUamentary committee, will be taken into the confidence of the security services in this country, in the same way as the United States Congress is taken into the confidence of the security services in that countiy by means of its Congressional committees. I believe that it is quite unreasonable that the Director-General should be hamstrung by being subject to the veto of the PubUc Service Board in relation to the quaUfications and the numbers of people he appoints to the Office. I come back to a very alarming statement in the second reading speech of the Prime Minister. It is one with which the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith took issue. The statement was: The Office will avoid comment or advice regarding policy, although its assessments should obviously have relevance to, and assist in, policy formation. The Office will be subject to policy control and managerial oversight through the Committee of Ministers on Intelligence and Security . . . We do not see that mechanism set out in the Bill. With the greatest respect to the honourable member for Isaacs, whose bonafidesin this issue I do not dispute for a moment, that is standing the issue on its head. Assessments of intelUgence ought to have regard to policy but ought not to be dictated by policy considerations. Policy is formulated as a result of those assessments. This is the point that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith was making. In relation to the collection of intelligence, of course, all security services in Australia will need to have regard to policy directions given by the government of Australia. In relation to the assessment of information received by the Office of National Assessments, the Office and its Director-General must not feel constrained by the prejudices of the government of the day. They must offer their advice fearlessly so that the best policy can be developed as a result of that assessment. I think the honourable member for Isaacs, to the extent that he was critical of the intelUgence of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith on this issue, did the Parliament something of a disservice. I refer now to some of the meaningless jargon which is incorporated in this Bill. It should have no place in a legislative measure considered by the Parliament. Clause S sets out the functions of the Office and refers to the furnishing of reports 'to appropriate Ministers and other appropriate persons'. I have had occasion previously to refer to the constant use of the word 'appropriate' in the rhetoric of the Prime Minister. In that context it might be forgiven as being a loaded subjective judgment that conservatives can use when it suits them; but to put it in an Act of Parliament such as this is absolutely meaningless. If it means 'to persons as directed by Ministers', let it say so. To say 'appropriate', and to insist that we have our bureaucracy persons who somehow, by an objective standard can be determined as being appropriate to receive intelUgence assessments and reports from the Office of National AssessThe ments, is, of course, a nonsense, and we ought to poorly have nothing of it. I conclude by paying respect to Mr Justice serve. Hope for his very worthwhile report. The report has exposed to me, as I think it has to most other members, the workings of the intelligence agenother cies in a very clear fashion, in a way which sets out what ought to be a clear view of the national interest. It is something which has been neglected for too long in Australia. The Prime Mmister, in his 5 May tabUng statement, skated over the question of the briefing of Leaders of the Opposition on security matters. Honourable members opposite may not be aware that for many years that had not been a standard practice in Australia, contrary to the practice pursued other countries in the Western world, particularly the United Kingdom. We ought to hope that this tradition continues. To the extent Mr Justice Hope was able to bring fresh Ught bear on an area that has remained too grey, area about which too many members of this Uament have had to learn from informed leaks in newspapers, he is to be commended. However, feel it is regrettable that the Government has that it has had to buckle under to the foreign affairs-defence estabUshment and to establish quite unnecessarily two boards to assist, supposhaven edly, this Office of National Assessments.",50
126,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,Order! The of the honourable member's time has expired.,53
127,Mr CALDER,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"Northern Territory) (3.30)Before I deal directly with this Office of Nationalhappening Assessments Bill, I wish to say a few words about off, what has been said by previous speakers. I notice that several Opposition speakers criticised the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for not ing part in this debate. I know that the Leader the Opposition took part. He spoke for some minutes. What he said was pertinent and what indicated with regard to this Bill was very relevant. I will go so far as to quote what he on 5 May. He said: I believe that nothing but benefit to the nation can come from having governments fully and responsibly apprised matters of sucn great nauonal concern. He adopted a thoroughly bipartisan attitude towards this Bill which, I am afraid Opposition speakers who followed did not do. I think a pity, although I am sure that in principle Australian Labor Party would support this Bill, as I am sure everyone in this House would. It in quite obvious that in the past Australia has not been well served by its intelUgence services. I think Mr Justice Hope summed it up very well and somewhat brutally when he said: Australian intelligence community is fragmented, co-ordinated and organised. The agencies lack proper guidance, direction and control. They do sot have good or close relations with the system of government they should That is a very bad state of affairs for any government to face. I hope that our intelUgence services, than the Office of National Assessments which is to be formed, have learnt from that. I imagine that they have, and that they are doing their homework much better now than they did when Mr Justice Hope wrote those remarks. I also take to task the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) for taunting honourable members on this side-par ticularly the honourable member for St George in (Mr Neil)-for continually parroting the phrase 'the downward thrust of China'. That is completely wrong. It is a misquotation. The honourthat able member for Kingsford-Smith might be contocerned about the downward thrust of China, but an what everyone should be worried about is the Par-downward thrust of communism. I ask him to look at the present situation in Vietnam. I also I ask him to consider the number of refugees who felt have been streaming out of that country and going to other countries and the great number of refugees who probably have failed to reach the of a country that will look after them. Why are they leaving? The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith criticises members on this side House for even expressing the opinion that they could be endeavouring to escape from the communist oppression. I also ask him: What is in Cambodia now? He shrugs all this and takes not the slightest notice of it. In fact, he could well be on the side of those people who are oppressing the unfortunate natives of Viettaknam and Cambodia. I ask him: What is happenof ing in Thailand? He is criticising us, and he has six misnamed it. I am criticising the honourable he member for Kingsford-Smith for naming the Chinese in this respect. Obviously he and not us said is against the Chinese. But we are against the general downward thrust of communism. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr of Antony Whitlam) again criticised the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Mr Bourchier-He criticises everyone. that is Mr CALDER-That could well be so. But the the honourable member criticised the Prime Minister for not being in the chamber and for not playis ing a part in the debate. It appears from his remarks that he is not at one with the Leader the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) who, as I said, supports this Bill in a bipartisan manner and made the remarks about which I spoke on May. The Office of National Assessments will be concerned with assessing intelligence about ternational developments but not the domestic situations. It will make assessments on interrespect national matters which are of national importance. We have to realise that there are many should matters of international importance which cocommercial incide and interlock with matters of national made muchintelUgence. importance. I hope to be able to mention some of seem to haveimpression them later in my speech. Mr Justice that it would be naive to imagine that overseas is something at which thetheproposed governments, no matter whether they are our look. There are markets for our cattle close allies or represent governments with which we deal either in the trade area or diplomatically, the will tell us all the information. I understand that government the Office of National Assessments will not obtain and to gather information in an underhand I wonder whether it can operate in this way whenour near neighbours,be the people in the trade area, for instance, are always Indonesians, and monitoring any endeavouring to find out how the other side is their trading needs. We should be doing and what their marketing or technical mal intelligence and service intelUgence plans are. There are two forms of functioning. Thefirstis Australia the gathering of information in a clandestine manner and the second is the gathering and assessment of information for the benefit of whichever government is in power. That is what nations the real role of the Office is supposed Justice Hope, in the report of the Royal ComIsland mission on Intelligence and Security, said: The intelligence function is relevant to the formulation nauonal policies in a number of areas outside the fence and politics. Therefore that function can include the trade and culture situation. The Office could assess information in respect of these countries and collate it to the benefit of Austraha. I beheve that the establishment of the Office National Assessments is a tremendous step ward. In the past we appear to have been found lacking to a great extent in the approach of our intelUgence services to gathering information that should have been obtained. As an outsider one does not reaUy know what information is at this nation'sfingertips.But one wonders whether Australia was in possession of the information that we should have had. No benefit seemed to be derived from any assessment of such informaAustralia, tion which we should have. of The emphasis in this Bill is on a bipartisan approach. As I pointed out earUer, the Prime Minister joined in this bipartisan approach and briefed 5 the Leader of the Opposition on the legislation. The Leader of the Opposition responded by supporting the Bill. The Office is to be non-political. I hope that it will be. I am certain that Mr Justice inHope's recommendations are aimed at attaining the introduction of a non-poltiical approach in of the assessment of intelUgence material. Let me mention some of the areas in which we be assessing inteUigence. One such area is We do not seem to have in this area. We do not any sort of policy in respect of Hope said information concerning export of cattle. This Office should throughout world. I know that one can say: 'Oh yes, but that is a trade matter.' Should not all areas of activity work closely together to assess information on overseas manner. But markets? We should assessing the attitudes of Timorese or the movements in obtaining normformation. I believe that the Office of National Assessments could render great assistance to by assessing information and giving advice to the Government in respect of countries to our north. Benefits could accrue to those and to us. A 200-mile offshore territorial to be. Mr zone extendsAustraUa zone around has been established. The to Ashmore Reef and Cartier off our north-west coast. We should be in possession of information regarding what of Indonesia and various other nations are thinking area of deand doing and what sorts of actions we should take. We need more than just defence information. At the moment our Defence Forces are very thinly spread. But we should be assessing these attitudes, especially with regard to the 200-mile areas in other fishing zone. It is regrettable that a special branch involved of in intelligence gathering was done away with forduring the period of the Labor Government from 1972 to 1975. I know that it was only a small branch but it supplied a great deal of most vital information and played a very important role. Yet, virtually at the drop of a hat, it was completely wiped out. I think that any Australian government of any political colour should welcome any intelUgence information, whether that information relates to drugs, people coming to birds being exported from Australia and so on. Therefore, I suggest that the gathering and assessment of military, civil and cultural intelligence should be inter-related. Before resuming my seat, I commend Mr Jusdce Hope on his able effort in producing the report which the basis of this Bill, which I support.",53
128,Mr GARLAND,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"Today I represent the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who has carriage of this Bill. He apologises for his inability to be here as it was important for him to attend certain meetings. However, I make a point which may have been overlooked by one speaker in the debate. The Prime Minister deUvered the second reading speech on this Bill. On behalf of the Government I thank the Opposition for its general support of the Bill. I acknowledge and thank the Opposition for many of the remarks that were made. I shall bring to the attention of the Prime Minister the major arguments put forward by speakers in the debate. But I want to say that I know the Government has given most careful consideration to the reports of the Hope Royal Commission in coming to its conclusions which are embodied in this Bill. While the Government did not take up all the recommendations made in the Hope reports it considered the matters, and it received advice from its advisers. Nevertheless, the Bill certainly embodies the three major principles of creating independence, centralising the role of the National Assessments Office and giving it a wider role, particularly in the economic held. The honourable member for St George (Mr Neil) made a number of comments to which I will respond briefly. He was particularly concerned about clandestine intelUgence. I am advised that the Office of National Assessments is not authorised to collect intelligence by clandestine means. I make that clear. The Prime Minister foreshadowed this in his statement intelligence and security arrangements on 5 May and reaffirmed it in his second reading speech 15 September. The Office will, of course, information obtained by others, sometimes by clandestine means. I emphasis that this Bill must be read in junction with the Prime Minister's two statethe ments of 5 May and 15 September. This was acindependence knowledged by the Leader of the Opposition Anyway, (Mr E. G. Whidam). The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) spent good deal of his speech referring to the sition of the Nauonal Assessments Board. said he believed that others should also be on In another part of his speech he referred to Umitations he found in this Bill. I draw his tion to the provisions in clause 6(1) which states: . . . such other persons as the Minister directs. Sub-clause (2) mentions specific people who must be on the National Assessments Board. I is make it clear that there is provision for the Government- I am not foreshadowing what its action may be-to make such appointments as it seesfitbut it is bound to appoint at least those persons who are specifically referred to in subclause (2).",55
129,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,I made the point that they were aU pubhc servants.,55
130,Mr GARLAND,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"I understand that. I repeat what I said a moment ago. I will communicate to the Prime Minister the major arguments put forward in the debate. In particular, the force of argument of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith will come under his notice. The honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Hamer) foreshadowed that he will move an amendment to this Bill in respect of the appointment to the Board referred to in clause 6 (2) (b). In order to save a little time. I must indicate at this stage that the Government is not prepared to accept that amendment. The Joint IntelUgence Organisation is not a statutory body. The Government does not believe that it ought to be mentioned specifically in a Bill. It would need to be mentioned if the Director was in every case to be a member of the Board. However, it is the Government's intention to appoint the most senior civilian in the Joint Intelligence Organisation. As long as the Joint Intelligence Organisation remains a section of the Department of Defence as it is at present it would be expected that the Director would fill the position referred to in clause 6 (2) (b). The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam)- I thank him for his kindness on to me-seeme d to find considerable faults with the Bill. He offered considerable criticism of it. I on was left wondering whether he proposed to vote use against it because his criticisms were far-reaching. But I understand that that is not his intention. To some extent he seemed to be at concross purposes with the speech of the Leader of Opposition. Perhaps that is commendable but not, therefore, Labor policy. I shall leave that for others to consider. The Government commends this Bill to the a House. I should mention that not long ago I compolearnt that the honourable member for He Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) also proposes to it. move an amendment. For the record I should say the that I learnt of that at 3.27 p.m. Because the attenGovernment regards this as a most serious Bill and has given it very lengthy consideration I could not accept such an amendment. For that reason the Government shall oppose it. Quesuon resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Clauses 1 to 4-by leave-take n together. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader the Opposition) (3.53)-At the I direct attention to a small piece of pretentiousness which is not essential to the Bill or it creates but is characteristic of Liberal legislation and bureaucracy. The Bill creates the post (a) of Director-General of the Office of National Assessments. The Bill provides no directors. Mr Justice Hope's Royal Commission report and the second reading speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) did not envisage any such of director. I had something to say on this matter move: when I moved the second reading of the Australian Security IntelUgence Organisation Bill propriate 1975 on 8 October 1975.1 said: The Bill provides for the official title of the head to be changed from 'Director-General' to 'Director'. November fast year, the Government agreed that, tralian Government organisations, the title 'Director' ordinarily be used in preference to 'Director-General'except in the case of organisadons with significant State offices headed by'Directors'. I interpolate that these are as the Department of Social Security. I went on: Expression has been given don-for example in the course of the passage of the Australian Development Assistance Agency Bill through House in December 1974 the tide 'Director-General ever appearing was changed to 'Director'. This was to without division. On 25 February last year, in speaking to same Bill when it was introduced by the present Government, I expanded my comments thus: My attention was first directed to itThat is the use of the term Director-Generalwhen I looked at the draft Bill. The post provided for in that Bill was Director-General of the nauonal gallery. I thought this was a bit pretentious because the head of the Nauonal Gallery in London never been more than a director, the head of the Gallery in Washington has never been more than a director. I might interpolate to say that both collections are quite good and a mere director is able supervise them and augment them. I went on to say: I thought we were promoting ourselves a bit excessively saying that the head of the Australian National Gallery should be a director-general. I notice, of course, at time that the head of the Australian National Library director-general. There were no other persons employed in the Gallery or the Library who had the title of director. I thought I would direct attention to this matter once again. I do not believe that Mr Furlonger or any of his successors, equally distinguished as they may be, would be one bit less effective or impressive if they were to be given thetitleof director. I do not see what we gain by making In Committee people directors-general when in fact there are no directors under them. I do not propose to of move an amendment. Committee stage .

Our enemies, particularly our communist enemies, this are moving in the domain of pubUc opinion. It is wherno good having namby pamby reports put out to agreed Ministers that do not reach the public because all over the world the communists are taking our the people away from us gradually by means of propaganda and our Department of Foreign Affairs will not oppose it. The Department will not even let us know what is happening in Russia. Time and time of the Australian Nauonal Gallery again I have asked Ministers to give us factual reports of what is happening in Russia and have been told that this would not be done because it has would offend the Soviet authorities. This is absolNational utelyridiculous.It is in the domain of public opinion that the damage is being done. This snide propaganda war is going on all the time to and we do not retaliate because we have no access to the Soviet people. We cannot tell the Soviet people what is happening here, and the by Soviet Union continues to tell uslies. The Soviet is lying continuously about conditions in its own the same countiy behind the Iron Curtain. We hear all this is a nonsense about their adopting freedoms and so on and we are fallingforit. Here in Australia and in England and America-in fact all over the world-w e are falling for this nonsense. We need publication of the facts. We are talking about a proposal to set up a 'think tank', if you like to call it that. We are discussing the setting up of an apparatus which is eminently suitable for letting our people know the real facts and to correct at least to some extent the continuous dereliction of duty on the part of the Department of Foreign Affairs, under Labor and Liberal-Country Party governments alike, in trying to cover up the sins of the Soviet and to allow the Soviet to mislead our people by a campaign oflies. I recall the 1930s in the days of Intourist. Everybody was going to Russia and upon their return they were saying how lovely everything was there. That was the time of the Stalinist purges and the murder of millions. All that was going on and it was all covered up. We are covering up now and it is damn welltimethat this stopped. It istimethat the Government got off its tail and did something about it. Unfortunately I have to say that this Government as well as past governments has been sitting on its tail in this regard. For heavens sake, stop it. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 6. (2) The National Assessments Board shall include(a) an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs; (b) an officer of the Department of Defence; (c) a member of the Defence Force; and (d) an an officer of the Australian Public Service, not being an officer of the Depanment of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Defence, who has expertise in economics.",55
131,Mr HAMER,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS," I move: In sub-clause (2), omit paragraph (b), substitute lowing paragraph: ""(b) the Director of the Joint Intelligence Organisation;"". The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Garland) has answered the point of this amendment to some extent, but if he has given us the brief as supplied by the Government I think the Government has misunderstood the value and the purpose of my amendment. Therefore I would like to explain it again. According to the second reading speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Bill itself, membership of the National Assessments Board is evidently to consist of the Director-General of the Board, with members from the Defence Force the Department of Foreign Affairs and an officer with expertise in economics. That leaves uncovered the areas of scientific intelligence, geographic intelligence and industrial intelUgence. These are part of the functions of the Intelligence Organisation. Evidently that gap is to befilledby the person referred to in clause 6(2) (b), as an officer of the Department of Defence. Normally it would be the Director of the Joint IntelUgence Organisation who at the moment is a Foreign Affairs officer. I do not want to re-open my remarks on the intelligence role of officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs; I merely want to make the point that the Director of the Joint Intelligence Organisation should be on the Board. I believe that more often than not that officer will be a member of the armed forces. Therefore we should not constrain the members of the National Assessments Board. It is constrained at the moment because it excludes the Director of the Joint Intelligence Organisation from being a member of the National Assessments Board if he is a service officer. Therefore I have moved the amendment so that that position is to be held by the Director of the Joint Intelligence Organisation instead of a member of the Department of Defence. I do not accept as valid the reason given by the Minister-that to put the Joint Intelligence Organisation into an Act is bad. I regard it as good because if and when the Government wishes to change the structure of the Joint IntelUgence Organisation it would have to bring an amending Bill into the Parliament and this House could discuss the new organisation. I regard the argument advanced by the Minister not as being an argument against my proposal but rather as an argument in favour of it. In view of the fact that the Government is not prepared to accept this amendment, although I think it is the folimportant I would be prepared to accept an assurance by the Minister that this matter will be considered by the Government and, if necessary, I will endeavour to have it raised in the Senate.",57
132,Mr GARLAND,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"The Government when it received notice of this amendment only a few hours ago had an opportunity to consider it briefly. The Government came to the conclusion that it should not be agreed to for the reasons I mentioned in replying to the second reading debate. If the honourable member is asking me to ask the Government to have another look at it, I certainly am prepared to do that; but I would not like him to think that I was holding out any hope that the Government is likely to agree with it. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Remainder of Bill-by leave-take n as a whole, and agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.

Department of the Treasury Proposed expenditure, $241,! 18,000. Department of Finance Proposed expenditure, $23,592,000. Advance to the Treasurer Proposed expenditure, $118,000,000.",57
133,Mr HURFORD,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"In speaking to the estimates for the Department of the Treasury I want in particular to devote some attention to the Australian Taxation Office. It is now eight years since I was elected to the House of Representatives and therefore it is eight years since I earned a Uving as a taxation consultant. I retain from those days an admiration for what seems to me to be a well run taxation department operating in a very difficult and sensitive field. When I was a taxation practitioner I never ceased to marvel at the helpfulness of officers of the Taxation Office. They often were put under great provocation by dissatisfied clients-this plied m particular to members of the assessments and investigations branches of the Office-ye t they seemed to go about their tasks with courtesy, and they retained a politeness and good manners which so often are missing in the modern world, even in less difficult circumstances and in much less sensitive departments than the Taxation Office. I know that my views were shared by many colleagues in the profession with whom I was in contact in those days, and I have no reason to believe that that does not apply today. With a twinkle in my eye, I own up to that being a bit of honest softening up for what I am about to say. As good and as efficient as the Taxation Office is and as polite and as courteous as its officers are, it is not nearly good enough that virtually aU the research and policy formation in this intricate and difficult field is going on in that Office. I use the word 'virtually' because I reatise that policy formation is supplemented by the thinking of a few officers in the Department of the Treasury and also in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The point is that it is not good enough, in my opinion, to allow taxation policy formulation to go on virtuaUy solely in the Public Service. There must be much more input at an earlier stage from outside the public Third Reading sector. At the present time. I know of only two people from outside the public sector who are making any substantial contribution to the taxation debate in our community. I refer to Mr Eric RisIn Committee strom of the Taxpayers Association based in Victoria and Associate Professor Peter Groenewegen of the University of Sydney. They would be the first to agree with me that it is not good enough that they would be the only ones who are making any substantial contribution. With their limited resources, I am sure that they also would agree with me and would be the first to admit that they are mainly reacting to what has been done-seekin g changes, sometimes successfully-rathe r than having an input into promoting changes in advance of those coming forward to this Parliament. On 7 October 1971, six years ago tomorrow, I spoke on this subject in this same Treasury estimates debate, and I am proud to say that I do not withdraw one bit of what I said then. I am glad to notice that the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) is quickly turning to his Hansard to check what I said on that occasion. One of my main points on that occasion was to advocate the establishment of an Australian taxation foundation. It should and must, for success, be financed by both the public sector and the private secap- tor. This foundation should be charged with the task of commissioning research into taxation and the economic and social implications of taxation policy. My concept and the concept of those who support the establishment of such a body is for a small secretariat to be commissioning research in very many different areas and by different people, such as scholars from the universities, appropriately qualified pubtic servants, tax practitioners, and lawyers and accountants who are in tax practice. These are the sorts of people outside the Taxation Office who should be commissioned to carry out various tax research projects. There should be an interesting and valuable public debate arising out of theirfindings,which should be published regularly. This advocacy of mine, now spanning six years in this Parliament alone-althoug h I remember that I had something to say about these matters long before coming into this Parliament-is nothing very revolutionary. There has been a Canadian Taxation Foundation, which provides a model for what I want, which has existed since 1945. There is the Institute of Fiscal Studies in the United Kingdom which has existed since 1971. We have here in our own country the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research operating in a similar format to the one I envisage but of course hardly touching the important subject of taxation because, as its name denotes, it is commissioning independent research into apphed economic subjects other than taxation and social research. Mr Crean-It receives $2,900 in these changes estimates.",58
134,Mr HURFORD,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has said, it receives $2,900 in the very estimates that we are debating. I scales: know that the honourable member will be entering into this debate later. He will understand that, much as I would like to discuss the Melbourne Institute and the valuable work it has tive for done, in the shorttimeavailable to me I intend concentrate on the setting up of a similar body the taxation field. We also have some encouragresearch ing developments in the private sector the type of taxation foundation envisaged. I refer to the fact that three taxation practitioners Sydney have set up a body called the Austrahan Tax Research Foundation. However, as I underbe stand the position, it is lying dormant while view the fortunes of a project recently estabchanges. Ushed by the Taxation Institute of Australia. I believe that the Institute has appointed a research officer and that some work is under way. I make the bold assertion that relatively Uttle will be done until government takes an interest and carries some of the financial burden, as does in the case of the Melbourne Institute. This will encourage corporations and individuals in the private sector to back the foundation-firstly because they wtil realise that the Government interested in its findings and, secondly, because they will be aware that it is a body of substance with a continuing existence. To me the registered organisation of the three Sydney practitioners will be a satisfactory startfollow ing point. I have not viewed its constitution, but from the report that has been conveyed to me by one of its founders it would seem that the three practitioners have the same ideas as the ones have expressed. I hope that with the Government's imprimatur or backing the Taxation Institute will come in behind this particular foundation with the resources of that worthwhile organisation. It would have to be a separate foundation with its own constitution and with adequate government representation. It would not be possible, in my view, for the Government to subsidise a separate research section of an independent body like the Taxation Institute. It is so much clearer to us after the recent Budget announcements that there is a desperate need for such a taxation research body. Bills which still have to be introduced and which are E art and parcel of the Budget will give legislative acking to some extraordinarily unwise tax contained in this Budget. I refer in particular to the changes in the tax scales. Let me read out what the 8 September 1977 edition of Church Scene, a Victorian AngUcan newspaper, had to say in its editorial about the new tax . . . a community which passively allows a maximum benefit to the very rich is being callous not tough. Widening the gap betweenrichand poor may be an incentherich,but it reveals a complete lack of interest into the problems of the poor amongst us. in I cannot believe that, if there were a proper foundation in the community, such towards slovenly tax changes would have been introduced. I am not putting this blame in any in way at the feet of the public servants who have had to come up with the details. The blame must laid at the feet of the Government, which had they the poltiical wtil to make these extraordinary Surely most of us can agree that, apart from the growing number of unemployed who are also harshly treated in this Budget, those amongst taxpayers who need most help are lower income group citizens who are bringing up families. Yet this Fraser Government has substituted family it allowances for the old tax rebate for dependants-quite rightly and with our support-and did not then index family allowances. Even after , the changes to the tax scales on 1 February famis ilies are going to be worse off.",59
135,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,Mr GILES) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,59
136,Mr DOBIE,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS," I am pleased to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) in this debate. I was pleased to hear of the twinkle in his eye. I must confess I did not notice it. He will accept my apology when I say I that the details of his speech in 1971 have not come readily to mind. I basically agree with what he said in his speech, but do not agree with the details. One of the tragedies of tax examination in this country is that we are falling into the trap of beheving that only the legal profession can give a true interpretation to the tax law. I beheve that the accounting profession, of which the previous speaker was an honoured member in Adelaide, has to be much more prepared to be part of the public debate on taxation than it has in the past. If any profession is expert in the ramifications of the tax law and tax practice it is the accounting profession. I think it is a disgrace-i strong a word as that-that over the years the accounting profession has not been part of the pubI lic debate. This is not to say that people such Mr Risstrom, to whom reference was made preSRD viously in this debate, are not most eminent actotal countants. Indeed, Mr Risstrom is an eminent man in thisfield.But in basic terms I believe this is something to which the accounting prodown fession has to direct its mind. I think also that accounting profession tended to allow the legal profession to take over action before the Prices Justification Tribunal in the same way. there are some areas in which the accounting profession must look at itself very closely. know, Mr Deputy Chairman, I had some associreport, ation with the profession in the three years durfactor ing which I was not in this House. I should hke to remind the honourable memcontrol. ber for Adelaide that I too spoke on this section of the Estimates last year. I know that he will call with a twinkle in his eye what I said then. will recall that among other things I advocated that the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) should consider changing the interest rate imposed on statutory reserve deposits held on behalf of the trading banks. I recall having said then that the operatI ing rate of 0.75 per cent, which had applied since 1941, appeared to have been enshrined in some archaic attitude held by the Reserve Bank that the Treasurer should have talks about achieving a more viable rate of interest to be paid on funds held on statutory reserve deposit. Unlike the previous speaker, it gives me great delight to know that my speech last year had effect and that the Treasurer did move in this matter and the interest rate paid on statutory reserves was increased upwards to 2A per cent from 10 November last. Admittedly, this was cause for great celebration, but it was a step ward. After all, it had seemed as though the Reserve Bank had been 'asleep in the lap of legends old'. The action taken last November was only a step forward. I beheve the rate of interest is still not adequate. I make another request of the Treasurer, namely, that he consider making the rate closer to the market rates. I hope that the 2Vi per cent will not stand for as long as that which previously apphed. However, it would seem that the Reserve Bank has not moved away from its equally ancient rite that 3 per cent of bank deposits should be permanently locked up in a statutory reserve deposit. From my knowledge it would seem that whenever SRD levels fall below 3 per cent the banks are required to borrow their own deposits back, at penal rates of interests, to f I may use as meet liquidity crises. see no value whatsoever in this convention. If as it is possible for the Reserve Bank to vary the level from, say, 5 per cent to 10 per cent of deposits held- I believe it is about 6V2 per cent at present- I see no reason why statutory that reserve deposits should not be allowed to run to zero when occasion demands. If it is to the be a tool of liquidity control there is no sanity in the convention of a 3 per cent lock-up, even with the newly increased but still not satisfactory level I think of interest paid to trading banks. I do not agree with members in my Party As you organisation in New South Wales who, in a advocated the removal of the SRD as a in liquidity control. I believe it is a vital aspect of Reserve Bank management of those credit facilities which it is constitutionally able to But I believe it must be looked at closely for it would be a brave man who forecast with reany degree of confidence that our banking sysHe tem deposits are going to see any large replenishment from external account during the current financial year. I do not believe this debate is meant for discussion fully of this important topic. Though I do not wish to appear to be pessimistic, believe that an intelligent and vital reassessment of the management of statutory reserve deposits should be a vital part of this Government's and monetary policy in the months ahead. I repeat: I beg the Treasurer to reconsider liquidity forecasts arising out of a lack of large replenishments from external account, the constant pressure that will follow the quarterly payment of company tax and the residual effect of the size of the Budget deficit as predicted, and relate these factors to a new approach to the as management of statutory reserve deposits. I ask l not him to move away from the unnecessary convenfortion that SRDs should never fall below 3 per cent of deposits without banks incurring penal rates when they borrow back their funds. I put this very serious suggestion not so that it might be seen as a means of helping the trading banks plan their budgets more effectively, although this would follow, but rather so that such a new approach will help to even out some of the Uquidity hiccups which I suspect wiU be our lot during the rest of this financial year. This is not a politically popular subject, but I believe it should be raised in this House at this time. I hope that the Treasury officials will take this matter very seriously and that the Government will view the problem of ironing out Uquidity movements in this coming financial year and will look at it in a new light. I put it to them the reassessment of managing statutory reserve deposits and their bottom rate of 3 per cent should be re-examined. In the short time remaining at my disposal not having spoken on the Budget. I make comments on the economic scene as I see it. Though there may seem to be evidence that cerJune tain sectors of the economy are still drifting, looking for a stimulus to help them along, lieve that there are signs of a gradual Australia. improvement all over. I take some comfort from the continuing downward trend of the savings ratio, that is, the rate of savings compared with total disposable income. Honourable members posits. will be aware that the figure went to an astronomical 18 per cent in 1974-75, 15.1 per cent in 1975-76, while it dropped to 14.1 per in 1976-77. I have reason to believe that the figure is continuing to drop. If we as a govern the ment continue this downward trend in the next months and providing we see a continuing conof tribution to stability by maintaining the Governopinion ment's successful anti-inflation policies, we should see a consumer-based recovery during the course of the rest of the financial year, certainly thetimecovered by the Budget under review. With little comfort coming from overseas sources as a stimulus, with scant hope of much stimulation coming from the Federal GovernparUamentary ment if we are to maintain our goal of a continument. ing drop in the rate of inflation, we shall have continue to rely on consumer spending to lead our recovery. Despite the protestations of the economic gurus who sit opposite in lefty fanthis tasyland, the name of the play is building fidence. Devaluation speculation by responsible members of this House, election speculation those folk who operate above us in the Press lery, industrial anarchy and speculation as pracman's tised by the left wingers in the trade union ment, all contribute to the feeUng of uncertainty which must be overcome if we are to see a has healthy consumer-based recovery in the Australian economy. As Plato, in relation to the role of a government, once wrote: Our object in the construction of the State is the greatest happiness of the whole and not that of any one class. I believe that that is what our current Budget is all about.",59
137,Mr CREAN,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"I would Uke to follow my friend the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) down the path of statutory reserve deposits but I am afraid that I take quite a different view. I believe, candidly, that that trading banks ought not get any interest at all on statutory reserve deposits, let alone the rate being increased as it was recently from three-quarters of a percent to 2.5 per cent. I suggest that what that has been done is found in the and item which appears on page 22 of the document a few 'Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure for the Year Ending 30 1978' where, under the heading of Department of the Treasury, some $216m wiU be paid I beinto the Treasury from the Reserve Bank of That sum may well have been greater and therefore the deficit less had this Government not been so generous to the trading banks in upping the interest on the statutory reserve deBut that is not what I want to talk about. I draw attention again to the document 'Esticent mates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure'. On page 159 details are given of various sections in the Treasury. I have had 6 and still have a very high regard for the quality the work which is done in Treasury. It is my that it was silly to divide the Department of"" Finance from the Department of the Treasury, but I suppose that is a technical matter about and which opinions can well differ. One of the sections contained within Treasury is described as General Financial and Economic PoUcy Division. To begin with I say that Treasury should not and cannot be the maker of economic policy. Economic policy, as far as it is controllable at level, is a matter for the GovernI think too much is expected of what to governments can do in the totality of economic policy. Certainly Treasury ought not be responsible for the totality of economic policy. I take opportunity to at least amplify, as I said yesconterday, what seems to be the only statement attributed to me while I was Treasurer. I said by that one man's wage increase can cost another Galman's employment. I did not say that every wage increase could be responsible for all move the unemployment. I am afraid that that is the great folly into which the present Government fallen. The disposition is to blame the totaUty of unemployment on what is called high wages. I think it is sometimes interesting to get an opinion which is different from one's own. I shall read from what I regard as not a highly radical journal and that is the Quarterly Review of the National Westminster Bank, which is an English bank, for February 1977. In an article entitled 'A Monetary Model of the British Economy 1880-1975' the author speaks about the British economy. I beheve that to a great extent this is also relevant to Austraha. The article states: In particular, the nationThat is the United Kingdomis currently being asked to accept a series of major infrinchange gements on traditional personal freedoms largely basis of an unproved economic hypothesis-that the cause of inflauon is trade union cost push. However the results suggest that, on the contrary, for most of the years it is possible to explain movements in the price quite satisfactorily in terms of the money supply. Despite efforts it was not possible to give the concept of labour tancy any significant operauonal meaning, while the push vanable finally constructed made no significant tribution to explaining the rate of these results, it can be argued that both the inflation the chronic balance-of-payments difficulties of the have been the quite predictable result of excessive creation. I suggest there is too much of a disposition Australia to evade rational economic thinking slinking behind slogans. A Swedish journal states: In an economy as open as Sweden's, the country's exchange rate is, in some ways, just as 'important' wage rate or the consumer price level. I submit that those things have to be looked at concert rather than looked at separately. I said here, two or three times recently, present unemployment problem in Australia is not being reduced in any way by any of the measures which have been taken by this Govern the ment. I heard my friend this morning saying-I do not basically disagree with him-that a lot the unemployed in Austraha are unemployable. That is a very hard thing to have to say. I think went on to say that they are unemployable beis cause they have no talents that anybody wants at this time. I do not know whether the fault theirs, whether the fault is that of the education system or whether the fault is that of the indusman's trial system. I remind the people in the comtain munity that the situation in 1977 is far different from the situation which existed in 1927 or Lord Beveridge described unemployment as problem of industry'. I am not so sure that that any longer the case. When he referred to he meant manufacturing industry basically. I employment. think the situation is different in Australia in 1977. Employment opportunities are not available in Australia at the moment for those are currently unemployed. The numbers of unemployed are being added to both by immigrants and by school leavers. I think it was said this morning that we have to create more opportunities in tertiary occupations or that we have to create more quaternary-that is the term I heard used the other day-employmen t opportunities. The old pattern has changed. So far we have not in any sense adapted our thinking to meet those changed circumstances. That is why I beheve that the Parliament should put pressure on the Government to its attitude, to seek the sort of inquiry that on the has been hinted at, namely, a close examination main of the situation in Australia in 1977 so that a depast 95 cision can be made in relation to the cause of the level unemployment that exists. Surely it exists in our numbers far larger than any of us would hke. At milileast there is a social cost. There is an economic costcost. No longer do we allow people to starve. We contransfer funds from those who work to those who of wage increase. On the basis and do not work via our social service system. Those 1970s people have to be paid something anyway. I said monetary the other day that at the moment we pay them two-thirds of a wage for doing nothing. Would it in not be more sensible to pay them an adequate by wage for doing something? However, we have not yet found what that 'something' is. The opportunities for employment do not exist. Maybe there has to be an investment led as the recovery but that has not happened yet. I suggest with all respect that there has been little but in scratching to ascertain just in what areas that have investment should be made and from where the that the lead should come.",61
138,Mr HYDE,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS," I can agree with honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) when he says that there is a limit to of what governments can do in the totality of economic policy. But just what that limit is and how he far we ought to go and how we ought to define it the matter I wish most to discuss. However, before I do so I shall take up something said I think is by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. He seemed to resile from his statement that one pay rise is another man's job. I am not cerwhether he meant by that statement that marginal wage rates did not affect marginal em1937. ployment. The honourable member shakes his 'a head; I am glad of that. Surely there is an is interaction-it is probably not a one for one industry interaction-betwee n wage rates and Mr Crean-It is by no means the whole explawho nation for current unemployment.",62
139,Mr HYDE,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"I took up that point because, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports expenditure expressed it, it was not clear to me whether he intended that it should be the whole explanation. I for one would not suggest that it was. Any government faced with managing the present ought economic situation would have difficulty in draftgest, ing a budget. The deficit would of necessity problem; levels of taxation, because of the disinIf centive effect, would also necessarily be a lem. A government of any colour would face that problem, although different governments might see the problem at a different level. I suggest that part of the problem stems from the nature of the process of government and the tendency for politicians to pretend that they can offer a free lunch. That they cannot do. In fact, this tendency of pohticians to compete for power by trying to be nice to everybody is the cause much of the economic problem that we have and much of the budgetary problem that we have. There is much argument about the level of government intervention and what that level ought to be. I agree with the Opposition to the extent that what is important is not merely the uantum of government intervention but also S le nature of it. However, when I to what would be the appropriate nature of it, I think I would part company markedly with my socialist colleagues opposite. The type of interthat vention that has been occurring, for instance, been costing the wheat industry a great deal. Maybe there are some unmeasured amounts, but a calculation is $ 1,250m since 1950. The quanhave tum of government activity did not increase. Nonetheless, government intervention in the market place and government intervention in the processes of the economy are the sorts of governmy ment intervention that I would sooner not see. would sooner see the market forces deterrnine the flow of resources in the community. I beheve that those market forces are likely to do it more accurately and with less serious side effects. I return to the estimates under consideration. If we are to reduce public expenditure and if we shorter are to reduce taxation-thos e together since ultimately governments only what they collect by borrowing or by taxahave tion-we have to look at the major areas of pubUc expenditure. We cannot pretend that that exowe ercise is taboo, that those major areas are not of education areas for consideration when contemplating a Might not tertiary reduction in government expenditure. areas of government expenditure are as follows: Defence, 8.7 per cent; education, 8.8 per cent; health, 10.5 per cent; social security and welfare, 27.2 per cent; and States and local government, transfer of payments, 21.8 per cent. CoUectively in those areas add up to 77 per cent of the total. Those areas, with the possible exception of defence are what have been termed the motherhood areas. I am not suggesting that there to be cuts in expenditure on defence. I sughowever, that we ought to be looking very be a hard at the other four areas. we are not to reduce expenditure in those probother four areas which provide benefits that people need- I refer to education, health, social security; and much of the money provided by way of States grants goes into those areas-w e have to be prepared to take away benefits from those who are not in need. There is no option but to do that, otherwise public expenditure will not be reduced. We have to distinguish between the needy and the greedy, and that is a distinction of which governments have not been prepared to make. We have to stop spending money on those people who could do things for themselves. We have to stop pretending that we are in some way conferring a favour upon them, because all we are doing is taking funds from them and giving them back to them. We should direct funds to the needy in the pubUc expenditure areas of health, drew my line as education and welfare. In the area of medical care, might it not be possible to provide the sort of insurance system picks up the major expenses but which does has not pick up the minor ones in such a way that we do not require an enormous and costly administrative machinery? Might it not be possible to a system which does not provide the same temptation for the hypochondriac to use up the system? Doctors would not have the same temptation to extract more than their just due. One of objections to the system is that it is impossI ible to measure their just due. Might it not be possible to provide education in such a way that people are assisted with education if they need financial assistance, but not assisted otherwise? Might it not in the long run be possible to provide a voucher to poor people? Initially, in the term might it not be possible to look at two things go few, andeducation, tertiary which is available to an eUte can spend majority of people in that recognise this is provided by the the community, who do not access to it; that it is paid for by the truck driver and the shearer? Might not those people in some way at least a proportion of that cost to the truck driver and the shearer? education aUowances be a The major loan and not a grant? Might we not look at pensions? A wealthy lady whom I know lives in a penthouse but is at the age at which she receives a non-means tested pension. Is it sensible that we tax her and then pay it back to her? It is not sensible. There is no point in handing out government welfare benefits to those who do not need them. If we do so, and continue to do so, two things will happen: We will never provide sufficient assistance to those who genuinely are needy and we will destroy the spine of the whole community. We will tax the pants off them, and the incentive to do more will thus at least be lessened. Further than that, there is no penalty for people not doing what they can for themselves. If the government will carry one's burdens, what then is the incentive to pick up those burdens? In controlling this government activity on behalf of people we will meddle in everybody's life, laying down common rules until we produce that brave new world in which all people are the same.",63
140,Mr HAYDEN,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"In recent times Prime there has been quite a deal of discussion about exchange the exchange rate of the Austrahan dollar. It is unfortunate that not a small part of the Government comment in that discussion has been intemGovernment's perate, and a considerable part of it has been pressure. personally abusive. That is no substitute for reasoned consideration of the issue, and it would be a shame if the intensity of some of the personal abuse should muzzle further constructive discussion on this matter. I propose that we now should be considering a managed floating exchange rate and that we also should be considering the introduction of an open forward exchange market. In doing that it is germane for me to point out that since May, excluding overseas borrowings, Australia lost nearly $ 1,500m from its overseas reserves. Whatever measure one uses, the effect of that is quite dramatic. What is equally significant is that that is evidence that the Government sat rigid with perplexity and indecision while this was going on. It is evidence, when one notes that the weighted exchange rate index wasfixedfrom February of this year to August this year, at 92.5, that the weighted exchange rate which was to be, according to the Treasurer (Mr Lynch), administered flexibly, in fact got iced over, it did not budge. Last year, after the devaluation in November, the Treasurer's words were stated in a Press release in the following terms: The pegging of the rate for lengthy periods was now discontinued; the level of the exchange rate in relation to the 'basket' of currencies would be kept underreview,and the Government would, in effect, be adopting a flexibly tered rate, somewhat along the lines of a managed float. That was in Press release No. 217, of 28 November 1976. On Tuesday, 30 November, in a parliamentary statement on the economy, the Treasurer said: The new pattern of management of the exchange rate will enable more frequent, moretimelyand smaller adjustments to be made to the rate; . . . is designed to avoid the build-up of an expectation of major changes at long intervals in the future . . . I thought then that that was a desirable innovation. I have noted since that the promise was never fulfilled. The Government has proved itself to be quite unskilful in the administration of our exchange rate. Do not take my considered opinion on that, but refer to the Economist- a rather conservative economic journal-whic h in its issue of 24 September 1977 stated: Capital is pouring out of Australia in anticipation of devaluation. Meanwhile, the three wise men who watch over the nation's currency (the chief civil servant at the Treasury, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, and the head of the Minister's Department) are looking foolish as they make tiny upward and downward adjustments to the rate . . . Currency speculators are encouraged both by the Fraser consistently poor timing on exchange rate changes and its impressive record for caving in under When one reads a comment such as that-that sort of comment has been replicated in recent months in several overseasfinancejournals-and when people overseas are writing in that way it is [itite obvious that they do not have any respect ! or or confidence in the way in which the exchange rate system is administered in this country. Because of the rigidities which the Government has allowed to seep into the weighted exchange rate system which was supposed to be flexible and, to use the Treasurer's words, 'somewhat along the lines of a managed float', somewhere along thetineit managed to sink. A system such as that is prone to large adjustments. Large adjustments inject severe shocks into the domestic economy. That is recognised in the comments which I quoted and in other comments in the same article. First of all, we have to get the economy in some sort of decent order. There is no evidence that that is being achieved with the present Government's economic pohcies. We have persistent stagnation, and we have persistent inflation. The honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) kindly drew my attention to the comment in the report on the 1977 inquiry into medical fees for medical benefit purposes, which was tabled in this Parhament yesterday. In that adminis- report Mr Justice Ludeke referred to a September quarter projected consumer price index increase of 3.25 per cent. He said in the report that the projection was supplied to him by the Department of Health. I know from my experience in government, from being involved directly in this area, that those projections which come from the Department of Health are provided on the basis of advice from other government instrumentaUties such as the Department of the Treasury. So, it appears that the Government is expecting a substantial increase in inflation in the September quarter. I must say that that is contrary to what I would have reasonably expected in September. I would have expected a more moderated rate of increase in inflation because of the restraint, short term though it was, from the abortive wages-prices freeze of earher this year. What does this mean? It means very simply that inflation will increase for the 12 months to the September quarter by about 14.6 per cent, as against 13.9 per cent in the same period last year. Inflation will be worse. Inflation for the year to the June quarter of this year, at 13.4 per cent, was worse than it was in the previous year, at 12.3 per cent. For the March quarter this year, on an annual basis, at 13.6 per cent, inflation was somewhat worse than it was for the same period in the preceding year, at 13.4 per cent. The trend is obvious. There is an escalation in the rate of inflation. I wonder what we will hear about the underlying rate of inflation. Increasingly I am suspecting that there is only a lying rate of tion when the subject is referred to by some Government spokesmen. Putting that to one side, what we need at the moment is capital inflow and some sort of confidence in the domestic economic management which will stem the outflow of capital from the country, which will modify the leads and lags manipulation which is going on at the present time by people who I think quite reasonably from their point of view are delaying the return of money earned overseas and hastening payments overseas. In short, what I am saying is that there needs to be confidence in government. There cannot be any confidence in government and in its administration when we have a situation where money should be coming into this countiy because interest rates are higher here. For instance, the rate on short term government securities in the United States of America is 6.62 per cent and in Canada about 7.64 per cent. In Australia it is in excess of 10 per cent. Money is not coming in. Foreign investment is not coming in. Money is in fact going out or that which should be coming in is being delayed overseas. The upshot is that we are facing a $ 1,000m balance of payments deficit this year. If we had money coming in we could at least alleviate many of the problems which are going to arise from the size of the deficit. That is why I am suggesting that we need a managed float so that moderate adjustments can be made regularly in our exchange rate. Accordingly, we would not suffer the destabilising shocks from substantial adjustments as we have seen in the past. I trust we can avoid them in the future. I beheve we need an open forward exchange market because by providing insurance for people who want to bring their money here or who have it here we can minimise the cost of risk and therefore modify the sorts offlowswe have been seeing at the present time. There are many benefits I believe to be obtained from an open forward exchange market- a more competitive and more efficient banking system and cheaper foreign currency. Unfortunately I do not have enough time to indicate the large difference in the spread between buying and selling rates quoted in Australia as against those rates quoted overseas. But they are substantial-abou t 5 points difference between an exchange rate transaction quoted in United States dollars and Deutsche marks as against a 48 point spread in Australian dollars and United States dollars. Clearly there is some cosseting and some protection in the Australian banking system which allows that very broad spread to exist to the disinfla- advantage of people who want to exercise the holding of Austrahan money from overseas.",64
141,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,Mr GILES) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,65
142,Dr EDWARDS,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) has done so much recently by irresponsible, not to say subversive, statements to undermine the Australian dollar. He is at it again today in the guise of making a suggestion about a forward exchange market. I will not raise again the issue of whether I might call him an economic traitor but the sort of talk we have heard comes close to it. I will come back to the honourable member for Oxley but in the few minutes available to me I would Uke to underline in the context of the estimates of the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance that the overall increase in government spending in 1977-78 shown in the Budget has been contained to 10.5 per cent. This is virtually the same as it was last year; so that for the second year in succession this Government has effected stringent restraint of its spending. Of course, in areas of greatest need the increase in spending has been higher than that. For instance, the provision for assistance to the handicapped is increased by 33 per cent on the figure for last year. The provision of funds for . aged persons homes and hostels is up nearly per cent. The provisions for overseas aid is up 12 per cent. But overaU the increase has been held to 10.5 per cent giving the second successive year of stringent, more stringent perhaps than anywhere else in the world, expenditure rehim, straint. This has restored the posidon after Labor years of unexampled profligacy, abandon in government spending. In 1974-75 we saw the level of government spending increase by 46 cent. Let me draw this picture for honourable members. In the 74 yean from Federation 1974 government spending built level; then in one year it was increased nearly 50 In per cent on top of that. Now this Government, as cial the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) reby the cently stressed, has re-established base. What that will enable is a sustainable reduction in interest rates and progressively greaterfinancialease and that is the stimulus, for Oxley. above all other sorts of stimulus, which this economy needs. I think it needs to be very clearly understood that reduced interest rates will be of very benefit to just about every section of the econrapid omy. For instance, take house mortgage interest rates. Every one per cent of interest rate charged for a housing loan adds $4 to $5 a week to the repayment of that loan. So getting interest rates down will help more than anything else to bringhigher home buying back within the capacity of the erage wage earner. It wtil do more than anythinginto else to stimulate home building and all the indus-interest tries dependent on it. I stress that point because the honourable member for Oxley-that prophet of gloom and despair, that false prophet-cam e here yesterday and again today and spread talk of a credit squeeze and higher interest rates. is simply not correct. There will not be a credit squeeze-interes t rates are to be reduced-not , courseMr Neil-They have started.",65
143,Dr EDWARDS,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"They have started to fall already. But they will not be reduced in one fell swoop. That, of course, cannot responsibly be done but they will graduaUy be worked down. The honourable member for Oxley disclaims that the gloom he spreads stems not from him but from a Reserve Bank prediction. Again, characteristically he misquotes or selectively quotes. The now famous leaked Reserve Bank features report published in the National Times, when turned to what it termed 'financial forecasts' states: . . the development of a set of financial forecasts for 18 1977-78 tends towards a leap into a void. byIn short, the Reserve Bank felt at that time it was impossible to say anything very specific. If only the honourable member for Oxley would leap into the void and take his whining voice with then the future of this country can be what the sound pohcy and confident achieving as Australians make it. That can be a pretty healthy Australian economy indeed. It is worth stressing per that in the same issue of the National Times which reprinted the report of the Reserve Bank  up to a certain MCGuinness stated: the longer term-that is, for the remainder of this finanyear and for next financial year-the prospects indicated Reserve Bank document are if anything relatively a sound fiscal optimistic.  time speech writer for the honourable member I think it is worth reflecting for a moment on how interest ratesfirstgot to their present high levels. Of course the initial upward boost came in great September 1973 with the Labor Government's acceleration of spending, when it hoisted interest rates and squeezed credit to pull back private sector activity to make room for bigger and fatter government. When the spending went to the extent of a massive deficit in the context of and higher inflation, interest rates got a avfurther shove upwards as the Government came competition to borrow funds. Now just as rates were hoisted because of excessive government spending and inflation, so the restraint of spending by this Government over two successive years and the lowering of inflation has set the stage for lower interest rates. The honourThatable member for Oxley had something to say a while ago about the level of inflation. But I point of out that the consumer price index for the March quarter was 2.3 per cent and for the June quarter it was 2.4 per cent. In either case this meant an annual inflation rate of the order of 10 per cent whereas the mflation rate under the honourable member's Administration was 17 per cent. As I have said, the spending restraint of this Government over two years and the lowering of the rate of inflation to its present level have set the stage for reducing interest rates to sensible levels. Again I say that that cannot be done in one feU swoop. The workdown must necessarily be gradual. Of course it must dovetail with other of the economic scene. In particular, the it balance of payments and the Australian doUar must be sound; and the wages-prices merry-goround must be contained. All these features of economic policyfittogether. When one apprecifundamental ates that, one can see why the deliberate underprinciples. mining of one area of pohcy-the exchange rate-by the honourable member for Oxley could prejudice all the others. The honourable member understands that. That is why I said on Tuesday-I repeat it on today-that what he is doing is deliberately versive of the Government's economic strategy and to the extent that he should succeed-he not-of the whole Austrahan economy. If conthe fidence in the exchange rate is undermined, the techmcal job of reducing interest rates is made much harder. That is a process explain but time does not permit. All the undermining by the honourable member for Oxley will not succeed. The Government has made it clear that it will defend the Australian dollar which not weak. Until that sinks in, thefirststeps in reduction in interest rates can be small only. Nevertheless they will be real. The other important factor is to contain price inflation. What the Budget contributes here is the tax cuts it provides for. Two tax cuts provided thisfinancialyear. The indexation cut from 1 July was equivalent to an increase in gross pay of 2.7 per cent. A further tax cut will place on 1 February next with the introduction the new standard rate scale. It is imperative in the context of the wage indexation policy implemented by the ConcUiation and Arbinature tration Commission those cuts be taken into account as representing increases in incomes. In that way we wiU get on top of the futility of the wage-price merry-go-round and set Australia back on the road to prosperity, renewed growth and full employment.",66
144,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS," out Order! The honourable member's time has because expired. I want to make my position quite plain. am not vastly interested in what other deputy chairmen or deputy speakers have done. I do intend to aUow in future references to demowill graphic traitors, economic traitors or any other such remarks. With regard to the lesser remarks which are made fromtimetotime,I think it fair that the Chair can expect some appeal for help if an honourable member takes exception any such lesser remark. On two occasions I can think of that has not transpired.",67
145,Mr HAYDEN,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"When the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards) speaks as a politician, he sounds Uke a bad econnot omist. When he speaks as an economist, he sounds like a poor politician. He stumbles over his words almost as often as he stumbles over understanding of basic economic It is a shame that the honourable member for Berowra sought to inject personal abuse into his references to observations I have made. I should have thought that it would have been a welcome opportunity to have encouraged constructive alternative views being put forward this fairly difficult matter. The views I put forsubward were personal. For instance, my colleague, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will (Mr Crean), certainly would not share some of views I put forward. I would have expected, however, that this was the most appropriate time so to encourage people to discuss this complex but I should like to important area. I move back to the point I was seeking to develop a httle earlier, namely, that I happen to is believe, on the basis of the evidence I have seen the at least to this point, that we would be better served,first,with a managed exchange rate-that is not so terribly contentious-and , secondly-this probably is contentious-wit h an open forward wageexchange market. At present because of the rigidities of the present system associated with are the exchange rate, the inefficient way in which the exchange rate has been administered and the crisis of confidence in the Government-that has take been manifested by die behaviour of so many of people- we are experiencing problems. Howthat ever, I believe that with a managed exchange rate we could have avoided a great deal of the of those problems. The availabiUty of forward exchange cover could have minimised the actual destabilisationflowswe are seeing. A balance of payments deficit of the order of $ 1,000m which is what the Reserve Bank projects for thisfinancialyear is a particularly worrying prospect. The Reserve Bank analysis points that we have a healthy balance of trade but of the outflow of payments on invisibles I we will have a substantial deficit on our current account balance. There will be negligible foreign not capital investment in the country. What there be wtil be largely provided from retained profits earned in this country. The overall effect will be that the balance of trade surplus will be is overwhelmed by the other negative movements so that we will end up with a balance of payto ments deficit. A balance of payments deficit of that order impUes tight domestic economic conditions. Substantial borrowings overseas do not change that proposition. When a government borrows overseas it does necessarily follow that it has to release an equivalent volume of money within the domestic money supply of this country. For this Governhis ment to do so would be inconsistent with the monetary targets it has set itself. Government spokesmen have indicated that they have no intention of changing those monetary targets allowing the money borrowed from overseas to be released domestically to increase the money supply. If we are to have a situation in which payments on invisibles lead to a substantial deficit in our current account, an absence sufficient offsetting surplus on our balance trade and sufficient capital account surplus, the Government will be faced with the predicament of maintaining fairlytightcondiuons in the domfrom estic economy so that the balance of payments situation will not be aggravated further. I think that is obvious. Because we do not have the sort of capital inflow we need, because of the leads and lags problem being manipulated at present with people taking out money where they can and as result of the absence of a managed exchange rate and a forward open exchange market, the five country will have a particularly tough year. That is a simple proposition which flows from the information which has been provided in the Reserve Bank report. The situation should not like that. I have indicated, for instance, that interest rates on short term government securities in this country are much more attractive than they are in other countries. But people are not bringing money to this country to invest and to earn more generous interest rates. They do not have confidence in the state of the economy. As evidence of the problems arising from our balance of payments situation in the course this year, I am reliably informed that the Government has already frozen all overseas profinely curement for government. It has made no pubhcneeds statement on this. What it is seeking to do, obviously, is to artificiaUy restrain the balance ments deficits problem to present, I expect, someresult monthlyfigureswhich it can release publicly, should there be an early election, and then claimreduction that there has been a substantial turnaround the situation, that it is bringing it back under trol, and that it is only a matter oftimebefore corrected. We have been hearing that it will be merely asideration matter oftimebefore many things are remedied. Minister (Mr For instance, unemployment, which is worse earlier now than it has been in half a century, will be much worse next year. Another is inflation on the basis of thefiguresI quoted from official Government sources, it is getting worse rather than better. The economy is on the edge of nation, as indicated by the Reserve Bank of Australia report which showed that the economy has faUen considerably below the level projected by the Government for this year in its Treasury documents, and much below the level achieved by last year, uninspiring as that was. So I come to this proposition of a managed float in the open forward exchange market. I mentioned that it would tend to minimise the cost of risk and therefore modify the sorts of of flows which we have seen in recenttimes.The of managed float would be helpful in avoiding large disturbing destabilising adjustments in that exchange rate. There are benefits which flow this proposal, such as a more competitive and more efficient banking system and, I repeat, cheaper foreign currency, a point I wanted to develop earher. If we take, for example, a $3m United States foreign exchange transaction in United States dollars and Deutsche marks we find that the spread quoted on the London aForeign Exchange currently between buying and selhng is 2.3230 as to 2.3235. That is a spread of points. The Financial Review today, quoting the spread between the Australian dollar and the United States dollar on spot rates, related that the spread was 1.1082 to 1.1130. That is a 48 bepoint spread. It is true that with larger transactions better rates can be negotiated with the trading banks but not much better than a 24 point spread. If we had the same percentage spread as applies between the United States dollar and the Deutsche mark then the selling rate in a deal involving Australian dollars and United States dollars would be 1.1084 and not 1.1130 as is presently quoted. That represents substantial savings on big transactions, savings of tens of of thousands of dollars. That alone suggests that the banking system is not as efficient and as tuned as it ought to be in responding to the of the capital market in this country. of payI beheve that what I am proposing would in an inflow of capital to this country once the economy started to get into better shape, a in short term interest rates and a much in healthier balance of payments situation. To my con-mind that is a not unimportant result. Accordit isingly I recommend the proposition to honourable members for at least some reasoned conhonourable free of the personal abuse in which the member for Berowra and the Prime Malcolm Fraser) engaged on occasions. and, Mr MCVEIGH (Darling Downs) (5.18)Untike the Opposition, and particularly the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), the stag-Fraser-Anthony Government is committed to the future of Australia. Our commitment is not a warty old approach of sociaUsm by destroying the will of the people to work, but a ceaseless, earnest desire to provide an economic and social climate where every Australian can achieve work which is satisfying and which expands his or her own self-respect and dignity. We aim to achieve our objective with goodwill and a real consensus. We want to conserve the character, tenacity and common sense of the people. We want all Australians to be able to plan, secure in the knowledge that if they apply themselves diligently they will be able to do a litde better this year compared with last year. The estimates for the Treasury allow one to comment on certain persuasive arguments advanced by the Melbourne Institute of Apphed Economic and Social Research, a grant for which is provided by the allocation of $2,900,000 in division 670.3.05 of the Estimates. The amount is the same as for the previous year. The Institute this year advances the argument- I submit that it is accurate in substance and in fact-that a program to slash sales tax, excise duty and payroll tax, linked with a pohcy of wage indexation, will not only contain inflation but will also control it. Its plan calls for cuts in the excise duty on petrol and other goods such as beer-the excise on beer is already far too high compared with that on wine-and cuts in the sales tax on motor vehicles and consumer durables. Cuts in these items will act as a spirit level which will even out fluctuations in the consumer price index. In some CPI quarters it would not be too optimistic to anticipate that the CPI would approximate zero growth if one apphed these proposals. It is appropriate in this debate while we are dealing with these estimates to emphasise and reiterate that the Budget brought down in August by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) contained the greatest personal taxation reform in the hfetime of Federation. Tax indexation, plus the new rates of personal taxation, will result in a $l,371m in revenue being forgone by the Government this year and there wtil be substantial additional amounts in a full year. Personal income taxation is now at a reasonable level. However no Government can stand still. Non est progredi est regredi-yo u either go forwards or backwards. We have to plan for the future. The suggestion of reduced sales taxes and excise duties by the Commonwealth and payroll tax by the States must be the next hurdle to be overcome. Inflation occupies the front line in the measures we must attack to control our way of hfe. Sales tax contributes to inflation. This tax revenue is estimated in the Budget to increase by 13 per cent in 1977-78 to $ 1,865m. Sales tax revenue is dependent on the price and volume of taxable goods sold. This year sales tax revenue will approximate 4 per cent of total consumption expenditure. For the sake of argument, if sales tax were abolished it should theoretically reduce the consumer price index by about 3 per cent-the difference being due to the fact that sales tax is not applicable to the fixed retail margin. If the States aboUshed payroll tax, and every State usuaUy is able to balance its budget because of the generosity of the Commonwealth, the CPI would be reduced approximately 2Vi per cent. The revenue forgone by the States would be of the order of $ 1,500m as payroll tax is levied at 5 per cent of the total wages bill. These statements raise some interesting observations. We often hear of the States blaming the Commonwealth for not giving them sufficient tax reimbursement. One can quite easily be popular by representing everyone's pet prejudice and pandering to insatiable demands but the fact remains that if we are to control inflation we have to have the co-operation of the States, the Commonwealth and the individual. It is a joint exercise and responsibiUty. On the personal side, and as a matter of my own political philosophy and conviction, I fully support the proposition that all of us should pay less taxes and, conversely, demand less services from the varioustiersof government. I note that the National Country Party members for Riverina (Mr Sullivan), Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), Capricornia (Mr Carige) and Mallee (Mr Fisher) endorse that proposition. If we reduced government expenditure and paid our own way with our own real money we could expect massive reductions in government taxation and control of our way of Ufe. Parallel with total of this, the problem of inflation would be minimised. The Treasury traditionally develops a stonewall defence mechanism to any suggestion of reduction in sales tax and excise duties. On behalf of the Australian people, particularly those in the Darling Downs electorate, I reject this approach. There is nothing wrong with Austraha that work will not correct. The work ethic can be encouraged only if the worker and the entrepreneur have real wages to spend as they, not the Government, seefit.Sales tax and payroll tax have to be reduced and I suggest to the Treasurer that he investigate how this can be done in the next Budget. Reduction in these spheres wold trigger off real growth for all Australians. Our economy would be based on confidence-the greatest foundation of aU. Sales tax and payroll tax add to the unemployment queues, and these queues are already far too long. Under subdivision 2, administradve expenses, certain sums are allocated for the payment penses associated with Department of the losses Treasury officials connected with the technical committee established to work on detailed aspects of the proposal to set up a national aster scheme. One cannot but be extremely disappointed that, although the Government announced in March 1976 that it had agreed in principle to introduce a national disaster scheme in association with the insurance industry, nothbe ing has really materialised. There are no bricks and monar. Are we going to wait for another Darwin or Townsville cyclone, Toowoomba hail storm disaster, Tasmanian bush fire disaster, the greatest of all disasters-drought-befor trigger off the establishment of a scheme? I also include the recent disaster in the Sunraysia area in the electorate represented by my colleague honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher). Thetimefor an ad hoc approach is surely passed. What confidence can we inspire Austraha where many areas are in the vice-like grip of drought? Are we ready to give help now- expired. not when it is too late-to drought-stricken grain growers? We have no immediate plans or coordinated system of action. We appear to be always in the rearguard, never the vanguard. Legislation to introduce a national disaster scheme has to be implemented with the States. What has been done? Almost nothing. Plans have to be evolved to meet likely disaster situappears ations. There is a need for the control and counder ordir ation of rescue and rehabilitation operand ations for the outset. But I do not want to dwell on all facets in debate. I want to concentrate on financial aspects-to get the scheme off the ground. Droughts, cyclones, fires and floods constitute far the largestriskin Austraha. Between 1975 and 1976 the total Commonwealth payments to the States for natural disasters were $224m, which $110m, or 49 per cent, was drought my related. Drought and cyclone losses are larger risks than floods, bush fires and storm damage. Our history indicates that there is a need for national disaster insurance. We have not been keen about this. I submit that we need to conmakes sider two schemes to compensate for damage caused by natural disasters: Firstly, a scheme cover capital losses; and, secondly, a program compensate for income losses. There are certain conditions necessary to support insurability of risk, such as demand for the coverage so that a premium on a large number of risks can contribute to the individual claim; a spread ofrisksas to their nature and location; the of exevents covered must be fortuitous in nature; must occur neither too often nor too seldom; the frequency and magnitude of losses must be assessable; the circumstances of the ocdiscurrence must be capable of dennition; the amount of premium must be acceptable to the insured from the point of view ofhis capacity to pay; and statistical data covering sufficiently long periods must be available. People need to educated that they cannot opt in and out of a national disaster scheme if they desire premiums to remain at a reasonable level. Additionally, insurance compames cannot be expected to meet ora total payout for a mammoth disaster. It is e we reasonable, therefore, to suggest that in a national disaster scheme the Government acts as a lender of last resort to the underwriting reserve. the This should allow the scheme to get off the ground. It would avoid the possibility of private insurance having the very serious problemin rural The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr GILES) Order! The honourable member's time has",67
146,Mr INNES,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS," I rise in this debate on the estimates for the Department of the Treasury to raise a number of issues concerned with - the question of communication. In particular I refer to the appropriation for printing, binding and distribution of papers, which on page 7 of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) subdivision 2 item 03, for both this House the Senate. The range of communications that has suffered as a result of this Government's Budget strategy goes to the very areas of my rethis sponsibility as spokeman for the Oppositionsuch areas as bilingual education, the education of migrant women, the Pubhc Service and miby grant services generally. There is one other point which I would hke to put to the Government and which I think is of major concern. For some time of I have been concerned as to the means whereby researches into the various problems facing a member may be facilitated. Looking at the estimates and comparing them with the situation which arose last year, one realises that there is obviously something wrong with a system which economies in the very areas where priority should be given-that is, therightof members to to have information available to them. If a member to is to deal with the problems of his own electorate, and more particularly those problems which are near and dear to his heart, the facilities to be made available to bim.

When we are in our electorates we are supported by researchers who are not the Parhament, and we need the information. Let me quote some figures.

The fact is that this goes to the question of human civil liberties, which ought to be very much his concern. ought When we look at page 14 of the Appropriation Bill we find that the amounts for the Gazette and that other publications, which show what this Government has done, were all spent last year and that greater amounts are to be spent this year.

It goes to the point of the general pohcy of the Government, which is to restrict public expenditure to the detriment of the individuals concerned.",72
158,Mr BRADFIELD,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"In speaking to these Estimates for the 1977-78 Budget, I think the Government is to be congratulated on the way in which it has been able to contain expenditure in those departments which we are discussing at the moment. When one looks in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) at the expenditure allocated to the Department of Finance, the Advances to the Treasurer and the expenditure associated with the Department of the Treasury, one finds that the cost increases have been well contained and are extremely marginal. This is one of the reasons that this Governmem is containing costs at the level at which it has in these Budget Papers. This is why it has been able to hand so much back to the people. A lot of this money has been handed back to the people in the form of tremendous tax reforms undertaken by this Government last year and this year. In two years of personal tax indexation and reform over $2 billion has gone back to the people. As I said, this has been achieved because the Government has been able to contain costs and to cut out waste. I know that there is some confusion about the explanation to the Australian people of the tax reforms in particular. Some people have been incorrectly stating that the benefits which are rightfully to go to individuals are not forthcoming. I can assure honourable members that tax indexation and the new flat rate tax scale which will be brought in will benefit all people in Austraha. Once again, this has been made possible by the containing of costs. As was outlined in the Budget, people in Australia will benefit also from the indexation of dependent allowances, which is also very generous and will go a long way to help Australian families. I stress that it will help families because we need to help those people with young children. We need to give them more money in their pockets to spend on their families-o n education, food and clothing. The Government will continue to watch expenditure. It will continue to do so because the money belongs to the people. Too often the people form the opinion that it is allrightto rip off the Government. Often people do not realise that the money which the Government has is their money; they have contributed to it. I think it is about time that a lot of responsibiUty came back to the people and that sense returned. I return to the matter of the generosity of the tax system introduced by this Government. As has been mentioned previously, under the new flat rate tax scale of 32c in the dollar and also with the exemption of an income of up to $3,750 a year, 225,000 people who formerly had to furnish tax returns and pay some tax no longer will have to do so. Much has been written about these figures. People have tried their hardest with figures to suggest that there are some flaws in this system. But there are no flaws; everyone will be better off. There are manyfiguresto prove that this will be so. On thefiguresI have before me, every one will benefit regardless of his income. This is a tremendously generous move by the Government. Through tight budgetary controls by this Government much achievement has been gained over the past two years in getting the Australian economy to a base stage where further action can shortly be taken to stimulate the economy a little more. Inflation is now under control. Through the Government'stightmonetary controls inflation is down to a level which is running at a Uttle over 9 per cent. Also through itstightcontrols we have stabilised what was an increasing rate of unemployment. The Government has brought the economy back to a base where it can now move ahead with more stimulus. I think that in the months to come we shall see the Government moving to assist further people in small businesses and the man on the land. This stimulation will do a lot to bring down the high rate of unemployment and at the sametimemake allowance for the just over 100,000 school leavers who will come onto the market in December. To those people, including members of the Opposition who claim that the Government has achieved nothing in the time it has been in office, I say that the Government has achieved a tremendous amount and the people of Australia will benefit",72

163,Mr UREN,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"I thank the House. The Fraser Government is playing a devious role in its approach to the Indonesian military invasion of East Timor. In saying that I stress that I am aware that there are honourable members who support the Government and who also are gravely concerned about aspects of Indonesia's mvasion ofEast Timor. The Fraser Government has opposed the proposal that there should be a Senate select committee of inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the invasion of East Timor and of the atrocities which were committed during the mvasion of that country. The Government has given and still continues to give military aid to Indonesia. It has gone along with Indonesia's refusal to allow the International Red Cross into East Timor. It has supported Indonesia's decision to channel aid through the Indonesian Red Cross which is a notoriously partisan body. This means that the Government has violated one of the four poUcies laid down by the  The Government has abstained from the United Nations resolution condemning the Indonesian invasion of East Timor which was passed at the last Umted Nations General Assembly in 1976. As well the Government has acted in an extremely harsh way to harass the East Timorese independence movement in this country. Fretilin bank accounts in Australia have been frozen. Its supporters in Austraha have been subjected to indignities. Strenuous efforts have been made to close the radio link between the patriots in East Timor and those in Australia who are giving them support. I recall how at a vital stage in his efforts at mediation Winspeare Guicciardi, the United Nations' envoy, was denied radio contact with the East Timorese people when this Government closed the radiotinknear Darwin. The Government frustrated legitimate United Nations attempts to intervene in the Timorese question. It is no fault of this Government that the East Timorese people have not been cut off completely from outside support. In total, the Australian Government has built up a sorry record of complicity with the extremist elements of the Jakarta Government which are trying to suppress therightof the people ofEast Timor to determine their own affairs. I stress these are the extremist elements in the Jakarta Government. This complicity shows up most clearly in our record at the United Nations. In 1974 in the General Assembly a resolution was carried which welcomed Portugal's acceptance of the principle of self-determination and independence for its colonial territories. The same text was put to the General Assembly in 1975. After the Indonesian mvasion a stronger resolution was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly condemning the Indonesian invasion ofEast Timor. It called on Indonesia to withdraw its armed forces from East Timor to enable the people of the Territory freely to exercise their right to self-determination and independence. At that time Australia supported the resolution. On 1 December 1976 Australia abstained from a similar resolution which censured Indonesia for not observing the previous United Nations resolution. This act represented the final betrayal. I stress that is as the final betrayal. The East Timor question should not be settled by force of arms. Our act at the United Nations was a collaboration- I stress the word-wit h the Indonesians. It was a betrayal of our ability to influence other nations which looked to Australia as a country which could be depended upon for a reliable lead in matters in our region. It created a powerful impetus which influenced Singapore and Papua New Guinea also to ignore Indonesian aggression in that small country. Another vote will be taken in the General Assembly of the United Nations during this present session. The question is: What will be the Australian Government's attitude to the General Assembly's resolution on this occasion? Will it be a further betrayal of the people of East Timor? The question of complicity with Indonesia emerges also in the cover up of the facts behind the murder of the Austrahan journaUsts in Batibo in 1975. The 1976 annual report of the Department of Foreign Affairs stated: Throughout 1976, the Government took all possible steps to pursue its inquiries into the deaths of the five Australian newsmen in 1975 at Balibo in East Timor. It proved impossible, however, to draw, from the mass of evidence collected, any reliable conclusions about how the newsmen had met their deaths. I stress that that is false; it is not true. I must say that I have been concerned for some time about the role of the Foreign Affairs Department in this whole business ofEast Timor and the role that it played in the Indonesia-Timor conflict. Reliable conclusions can be drawn about how the newsmen met their deaths. A Government back bencher has named the leader of the Indonesian that killers. An officer of this Parliament, Mr James Dunn, has prepared a comprehensive account of the whole history of the Timor situation. That account contains a detailed and dispassionate description of what happened to the journaUsts. We must conclude that the Australian Government has a callous disregard for how those Australians died. The view it takes is that it does not want to hurt our 'good relations'- I use inverted commas-wit h Indonesia. It does not want to take the responsibihty for the cold-blooded slaughter of Austrahan citizens. It has made no protest at Indonesia's refusal to let Austrahan parliamentarians into East Timor, even though the move came from its own ranks, its own supporters. That in itself was plain recognidon by the Fraser Government of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. It also showed that the Government was bent on concealing the facts about East Timor from the Austrahan people. I stress that we are not opposed to the Indonesian people; we have warm feelings of freindship towards them. The Australian Labor Government and the Labor movement backed to the hilt the struggle of the Indonesian people for freedom from colonialism. In the same way we now support the struggle of the East Timorese to establish their independence as a nadon. To summarise, the Labor Party and the Labor movement generally have a firm pohcy on East Timor, and they will be apphed strictly by the next Labor Government. The road to independence for the democratic RepubUc of East Timor wdl be long and hard. There will be setbacks. There will be reports of betrayals and defections. There is no doubt in my mind that the cause of the East Timorese is just. I believe that the people in this Parliament, the people of Austraha and the Government should really support the commitment to self determination by the people ofEast Timor.",74
164,Unknown,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,Sitting suspended from 5.58 to 8 p.m.,75
165,Mr NEIL,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"On the last occasion on which I spoke in this chamber about foreign policy, I referred to the global situation as it affected Australians in particular the situation in the Middle East. The situation there is the major threat to world peace, and that could affect Australia in some way. I referred to the refugee problem faced by Australia and caused by events in the Middle East. Tonight I want to deal with our region. In particular I wiU deal with three matters. The first matter is a short one. It arises out the report in the Daily Mirror on 5 October dealing with the United Nations fund for drug abuse control. A project is being conducted in the Goldern Triangle area of Asia from which comes a huge amount of opium derivative drugs each year. Part of it comes to Australia; the remainder goes throughout the rest of the world. The United Nations backed project is teaching hill tribesmen to grow crops other than opium. It is teaching then that more money can be made from crops such as vegetables, coffee and flowers. Apparently, villagers in the inaccessible areas have been persuaded to replace the opium poppy with other crops. The newspaper reports this, but then criticises the Australian Government on the basis that it does not contribute to this fund though it is said, other countries do so. I have had the benefit of advice from the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Sinclair) on this matter, and it appears that the report is grossly erroneous and does not represent the situation at all. Austraha values highly the work that is carried out by the United Nations fund for drug abuse control and has been a regular contributor to the fund since 1973. Our contribution since then has been $100,000 a year. A most important part of the estimates obviously is devoted to this fund. Australia is the seventh highest contributor in total terms. In addition to thisfinancialcontribution, Australia has provided practical assistance to special projects under United Nations aegis in Thailand, including the services of an Australian agricultural expert. (Quorum formed). The second matter with which I wish to deal is Australia's relations with Indonesia. I wish to make it clear that my position is simple-that Australia must have a strong and developing relationship with Indonesia. However, the question of East Timor is a specific matter, and I do not believe that Australia's differences with Indonesia, if there are any, or the statements made by individual members on the question of East Timor, will prejudice our relationship with Indonesia. I believe that the relationship is strong and viable and will continue, but there is no point in the perilous principles of appeasement. This country has not recognised the Indonesian takeover ofEast Timor, and I do not believe that we should recognise it. It was an invasion by one State of another. Such activities are wrong. The Australian Government has the task of balancing at alltimesbetween moraUty and reaUty, our attitude to foreign policy. Indeed, on balance we need to move slightly more towards moraUty in of our working out of foreign policy. This would be in accordance with President Carter's attitude on this matter.",75

It is allrightfor Labor members to talk about the posidon. intents and purposes, the takeover was completed when this Government came to taking power. The deed had been done and had been occasioned through the pohcy of the former Prime Minister. The shame that hangs over is clear and apparent. It is quite obvious from way in which his Caucus has treated him over matter that it holds him accountable also. It is most important that Australia makes that Indonesia understands our posidon. It most important that neither side gets any wrong ideas about our atdtude, one to the other. If maintain our posidon with the Indonesians we can, I am sure, obtain their respect, and we the future continue to develop a strong and proper relationship with them. I, for one, would welcome the opportunity to make a goodwill visit to Indonesia and a goodwill visit Timor. We do not recognise the takeover ofEast The Timor, but they say that it is part of Indonesia.

However, it was not given the right sort of military backing by the Americans. in The backing was enough to hold the day at the in time and enough to keep the communists somewhat at bay for a period. But we must learn careTo all fully the lessons from that loss.",76
169,Mr JACOBI,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"During the of evidence by the sub-committee on the Middle East of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, of which I was a member, I him pressed the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr the Peacock), because of the huge military arsenals the in some Middle East countries, for an answer as to why we had not one military attache assigned sure to any Austrahan embassy throughout the Midis dle East. On 7 September I put the very same matter to the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) we and the reply I received from both Ministers was that the matter was being considered. The subcan in committee received extremely important evidence in relation both to weaponry and its strategic and technical applications. Let me quote from the sub-committee's evaluation. The subto East committee in its report stated: committee commenced in some detail on the immense of modern weapons in the Middle East. The truth is there are as many combat aircraft and tanks in the trouregion as there are in the possession of NATO forces. Furthermore, the fact is that the weapons are periodically in short but fierce Middle East wars. . .

Furthermore, it was argued that the appointment of Australian Armed Services Attaches could arouse about our interests in the area and would perhaps false hopes for Australian assistance in military and supplies, without providing compensation most unenviThe report went on to state: Dependence on derived military information or misinfortime mation, however, can be disastrous. To appreciate the urgent need for Australia to be self sufficient in the evaluation of the most rapid modern advances in military hardware and its implications and why the Middle East is so important in the evaluation, let me briefly draw the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the problem currently facing the Umted States of America. The United States Administration assessment. has blocked plans to sell F18fightersto Iran on the grounds that the plane had not been deployed by United States forces, but seeks sell the airborne warning system which is not under deployment either. It is seeking to sell distant FISs-the most advanced fighter in the United States inventory-to Saudi Arabia which has also bought Sidewinder missiles. The planes and missiles are capable of destroying planes United States has sold to Israel and Iran, a rival of Saudi Arabia. I state that only to indicate type of weaponry being injected into the Middle East area. Let me give just a few examples of the apply information it might be possible for Austrahan military attaches to acquire were they situated the ground in the confrontation states of the Middle East. First, in the area, of equipment technologies, all branches of Australia's defence forces could learn much from the deployment are and use in the Middle East of conventional the weapons which are not only the most sophistidecision cated now in existence but which are also direcdy related to Australia's defence. For example, 1973 when Australia was deUberating on a choice between the American M60 and German Leopard tanks, an Austrahan military attache could have gained first hand information about the operational problems and design advanaircraft tages, or faults, of the M60 which was used the Israelis during the Yom Kippur war. We could hardly expect the Americans to pass on information to us about the M60 have helped us to decide on the German tank. However, the Israehs are now deploying a revolutionary tank known as the 'Chariot', Australian which incorporates the valuable, if unfortunate, lies combat experiences of the most recent war. Arab countries Among its interesting features, the 'Chariot' has from shell-resistant armour and an infantry carrying paratively capacity. We need to be able to talkfirsthand to shonage the people involved in designing the tank. We strategic need actuaUy to see it in operation and we need politics, to absorb the ideas incorporated in the tank which are relevant to Australian conditions. The Israelis also deploy the American Ml 13 most armoured personnel carrier. Austraha has over including 700 of them. They have modified their Ml 13s be according to the lessons learned from combat expersons perience. They discovered that by seating the who troops in the centre of the vehicle rather than on the sides, as we do, they were better protected from land mines. This is a simple modification, but one which could save Australian lives should we ever have tofightagain. Surely we have a responsibiUty to acquire and evaluate this type of On the other side of the conflict, Syria and to Egypt deploy Soviet tanks which could quite conceivably be supplied, even if it is in the far future, to countries hostile to this country. An Australian military attache in these countries could acquire important information about the capabiUties and problems of these tanks and the about Soviet methods of deployment. I might suggest to the Minister that one could imagine the that the Egyptians would be more wtiling to discuss the problems associated with Soviet equipment now that there is a rift between this protege and its former patron. The same arguments to aircraft and naval vessels. The Israehs now have deployed the F1S Eagle together with on the E2c Hawkeye early warning and control system. They are negotiating to acquire the F16 and and to produce some of its components. The Saudi Arabians are purchasing FISs and the Omanis purchasing the British Jaguar. Australia is in process, as I understand it, of taking a costly as to the most appropriate replacement aircraft for the Mirage. We could clearly acquire in important information from independent sources which do not have a vested interest in our decision if we had military attaches on the ground in the Middle East. This information could extend beyond the operational capabilities of the and early warning systems to the imporby tant issue of co-production arrangements. I would like to conclude my remarks by quoting again from the sub-committee's assessment. The which might sub-committee stated: Further, the Committee feels that objections to appointing Armed Services Attaches in the Middle East are outweighed by the fact that it would be unlikely that our alwould be assessing the military situation in Israel and the in terms of the lessons that need to be drawn an Australian perspective-the perspective of a comsmall power with a potenual military manpower as is the case with Israel. In conflict, or in a precarious military balance in peace, the valid assessment of and military factors is one key to understanding the the policies and the potential dangers in a region. During the Yom Kippur war in 1973, for instance, Australia would have had an excellent opportunity to obtain independendy up to date information on some of the world's sophisticated weapons and their tactical employment, information on Western equipment which might under consideration for Australian purchase. The only who can perform a thorough evaluation are those possess the relevant expertise; Australia would be unwise to rely completely on the assessment of our potential arms donors as it would be unrealistic to expect them to stress the shoncomings of any of their equipment that Australia may wish to purchase. I inform the Minister that it seems quite odd me that although one of the biggest arsenals and weaponry in the world is estabhshed in the Middle East we as a nadon have to rely on foreign embassies with military attaches to give us advice. To say the least, I think that is crous situadon. To sum up: There were very good reasons for the sub-committee of the Joint ParUamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to recommend that Australian ambassadors in States. Israel, Egypt and Syria should have available them Australian armed services attaches. Those reasons remain valid today. I trust they wdl not only be taken into consideration by the Departclear ment of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs but also will lead to action with the considered opinions of the Committee. Progress reported. APPOINTMENT OF MR JUSTICE R. W. FOX AS AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE Ministerial Statement",76
170,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS,"by leave- I wish to inform the House that the Government has decided to appoint Mr Justice Fox as Ambassador-at-Large for a period of 12 months. Mr Justice Fox's primary role wtil be to represent Australia overseas in interon national endeavours to secure a strengthened clear non-proliferation regime. He will represent the Government at international forums and in other initiatives dealing with nuclear nonperience proliferation and nuclear safeguards. Mr Justice Fox was the Presiding missioner of the Ranger Uranium Environindicated mental Inquiry established by the previous venture Administration. After the Inquiry completed its munity. toThe final report in May 1977, Mr Justice Fox, on my request, pursued inquiries overseas relating to nuclear non-proUferation and safeguards. He has liferation recently returned from this overseas visit during which he consulted more than 200 people be representing overseas agencies and individual interests in various countries, amongst others European Economic Community, Sweden, Austhe tria, Brazil, the United States, Canada and Japan, regarding safeguards against nuclear for weapons proliferation and has reported to me on those discussions. I regard Mr Justice Fox's advice as important in enabling the Government to pursue the most effective policy against the spread of nuclear weapons which is a matter of great international concern and the most effective arrangements to remove the international instabihty associated to with the spread of sensitive nuclear technology. It is clear from what he has told me that there is developing a greater international awareness of the importance of preventing proliferation of a ludinuclear weapons. There are many international initiatives being developed in which Australia must be prepared to play its part. One of the most important is the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation which is being undertaken on the initiative of the President of the United It wtil evaluate all parts of the present nuto clear fuel cycle with the aim of strengthening technology against diversion of nuclear materials to weapons use. It will also examine how the nupower industry might best be structured to procure this result and to operate in the safest in conformity possible manner. Mr Justice Fox as Ambassador-at-Large will be leading the Australian delegation to the opening meeting in Washington on 19 and 20 October of the International Fuel Cycle Evaluation. Mr Justice Fox's leadership will ensure that Austraha will contribute to the International Fuel Cycle Evaluation to the maximum extent that its international position and technical expertise in nuclear matters will permit. He will also give poUcy advice to the Government respecting bilateral safeguards agreements and the non-proliferation aspects of commercial nucontracts for the sale of uramum. Mr Justice Fox, with his background and exin thisfield-so well demonstrated by the breadth and quality of the reports of the ComRanger Uranium Environmental Inquiry-ha s that he is prepared to accept this task, a task which is most important for Australia and I say for the wider international comappointment demonstrates the tremendous concern which the Government has for problems relating to nuclear weapons proand its determination which I hope will shared by all honourable gentlemen in this House to do everything possible to ensure the the safest possible safeguards arrangements around world. The Government greatly appreciates the Judge being able to make himself available this most important international endeavour and is grateful to His Honour for accepting this appointment. In accordance with past practice where members of the judiciary have been appointed to executive office, for example, the appointment of Mr Justice A. E. Woodward when a Judge of the Australian Industrial Court to be DirectorAugust General of Security; Sir Owen Dixon, then a Jus-cables tice of the High Court, to be Austrahan Minister for to the United States, and Sir John Latham ChiefJustice of the High Court, to be Australian Minister to Japan, the Government proposes introduce legislation similar to that introduced on those other occasions to enable Mr Justice Fox to retain his judicial status and the rights which attach to that status while Ambassador-at-that Large. The Government also proposes to introduce Prime legislation to increase the number the Austrahan Capital Territory from three to four to allow the Court as necessary at its present strength during period of Mr Jusuce Fox's appointment as aging to a judge and his court to refer and Ambassador-at-Large. His Honour has advised one me that particularly having regard to the administrative nature of his duties as Chief Judge and indeed the doubt that this assignment will completed within a year he proposes to resign Chief Judge. I believe that that is consistent the high moral stance which His Honour has taken over a long period in many aspects of public duty. I beheve that the Government and Austraha are well served by His Honour being prepared to take this most important and national and international obligation. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of which the Opposition)-by leave-It is important that Australia should be represented at the national Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation which is having its opening meeting later this month. It important that Australia should be represented at and should participate in all international ferences and efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. There could be no trahan with a greater capacity, and now experiyears ence, to represent Australia and put Australia's case at such international conferences than Justice Fox. I know that His Honour would undertake a mission such as this lightly or inad-it visedly. I remember that when I approached him in July 1975 to be the Presiding Commissioner the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry and urged upon him how seminal and crucial it was that such an inquiry should be for all environare mental issues, particularly one which had such great national and international importance, gave very careful consideration before accepting the Labor Government's commission to conduct the Inquiry. I beheve it is proper that these arrangements should have been made, now that that Inquiry has concluded, to make his position both pubhc and regular. Last November and again last I sought to have pubhshed letters and which His Honour had sent to the Minister Environment, Housing and Community while Development (Mr Newman) and to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). On 18 August the to Prime Minister said that His Honour had requested that these documents be kept confidential. I would imagine that the request was no more than an indication on the correspondence it was confidential, using only that single word. However, I had misgivings when the Minister said in his written reply to me on of Judges of Governmentthat 18 August it would be unusual for the to make pubhc the advice that it reSupreme Court ceives from its to operate raised with the confidential Prime advisers. Recently I Minister the situation as I the saw it-that it would be compromising damofthe Government's confidential advisers. as to him I put the point of view that judges can properly be advise on pubhc issues if they hold statutory as appointments, for example, under the Commonwith wealth Grants Commission Act, the Austrahan Security IntelUgence Organisation Act or the his Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, or if they hold royal commissions. We are now informed that appropriate statutory arhigh rangements will be made-as were made for Chief Justice Latham and Mr Justice Dixon, and are still being made for Mr Justice Woodward. One might draw something of a compariInterson with Mr Justice Else-Mitchell. It is regrettable that his Honour Mr Justice Fox isis to resign as Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. It is a posconition he has held with great distinction. He came to it with great experience at the Bar and great Auseminence as an academic lawyer. For many he was editor of the Australian Law Journal. The Austrahan Capital Territory Supreme Mr Court is possibly the busiest Supreme Court in not Austraha. The smaU number of judges who man have an exceptionally wide variety of matters coming before each of them. I believe that at the of moment there is only one resident judge who can devote his fulltimeto the proceedings of the Court. It is therefore to be applauded that steps being taken I understand, to appoint four resident judges to that Court. A fortnight ago I he mentioned the difficulty facing the Court. The appointment of Mr Jusuce Fox is now pubhc and regular.

180,Mr KATTER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"In a period of 10 minutes it is extremely difficult to deal with any one aspect of our foreign affairs commitment and all that it entails. It is interesting to note that nearly $464m has been allocated for our role in international affairs. I would Uke to refer to one or two points that the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) made in relation to the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. That sub-committee did a rather splendid job and produced a very balanced and very valuable report. It would be obvious to that sub-committee, I think, that the only reason why military attaches were not appointed to Middle East countries prior to the reasonably new and rather refreshing era which seems to have opened up in that area was the extra sensibe one that existed in that area. I think that would reason which would have prevented what obvious requirement from being met. holds remains to be seen. I would hke to make some comment on one or I note two aspects of the United Nations and what it indihas to offer. That organisation has been somein thing of a disappointment to many people who, I do not really understand its role. I had the opportunity of being at the United Nations General Assembly for three and a half months. I attended the commemorative session when it was claimed that things were done in a bigger beand better way. The interesting thing about that the session was that an appeal went out for it to achieve the great objective of the United Nations-that is, greater understanding and a f enuine and profound approach to world peace, eople said that it was the 25th anniversary and that it should provide an example to the was interesting to note that two of the countries which showed complete lack of co-operation Mr MrDeputy were Iraq and Albania. Surprise, surprise! They honourable gentleman did not toe the line. So, that session was not what that a speaker who is on it was meant to be. In retrospect, I would think most valuable things that a delegate to the United Nadons can do is to try to encourage colleagues in the Parhament to get to that forum of international pohtics and international affairs generally. The Canadians have a splendid system which I suppose at first glance would not appear possible for us because of the great dissorts tances and the expense involved. They rotate their delegates. Every fortnight they send two new delegates and bring two home. I imagine that the system could work with the travelling lowances available to members of this Parhatwo-year ment and that we could send delegates, say, for one month of the three months and give them that tremendous experience. The accent in this nation at the moment, perhaps somewhat overdue, is on drug traffickmembers ing, on the searching out of those who responsible for the distribution of drugs and erally contributing to the appalling situation which exists in this country and in other counconclusively tries. I remember that about 20 to 25 years ago raid was made on the communist cells in most of the major countries of the world. who educated me in this particular matter was a man named Clarrie Fallon.",80

The circular describes a investigation into marihuana and the effects of the continuous smoking of marihuana. The investigation was conducted throughout the world and the evidence collected was not from one particular country but an aggregate of what had happened in most countries which were of the Umted Nations.

I ask the honourable member to try to that. I have a few minutes left and I like to enlarge a little on what has already Kenbeen said by the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil) and one or two previous speakers. I refer to the rather extraordinary tude of the Austrahan Labor Party. I think that the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) sent a telegram once when he was overseas but otherwise the Labor Party has turned a blind eye to the slaughter and carnage that is going on Cambodia. Honourable members opposite are constantly worried-particularl y the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) on my right-abou Fretilin forces and about the great injustices East Timor.

According to this report, and it is an excellent authority, USSR has been milder in its criticism of Jakardiplomacy ta 's East Timor venture. It goes on to explain Soviet Russia is not really interested but China and Hanoi have constantly been barraging world with the great injustices being perpetrated by the Indonesians. Indonesia is our bulwark buffer against any threat that might be offering.

191,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"Order! The This honourable member's time has expired. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of leaders the Opposition) (8.46)-The careful and and unsympathetic. thoughtful management of foreign relations has rarely been more important to Austraha's future than it is today. The Fraser Government's answer to this challenge has been growing fusion, ineptitude and dishonesty. It is sad and cause for deep concern to participate in a debate on the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs under circumstances where the Ausimportance trahan Government has no coherent foreign polEast icy and the Department itself is being turned into everyone's worse dream of an impotent paper pushing bureaucracy. Ever since the formation the Department it has pursued policies of recruitMinister ing officers to the highest standard available Australia and the development of the expertise leaders. essential to the conduct of a modern foreign pohcy. In December 1975 it fell on exceedingly times. Since then the Fraser Government has waged a systematic attack upon its role and its authority. It has cut down drastically the Departcountries ment's access to the essential tools of He diplomacy-staff , facilities and communication. In place of the Department of Foreign Affairs Fraser Government has sought increasingly to atticoncentrate the power to advise on foreign pohcy and to influence decisions in the hands of the Prime Minister's own Department. The result of this tragic and obsessional attack upon the Department of Foreign Affairs has been significant in losses for Austraha in terms of her international interests. The bureaucracy is only a part of the story and compared with the real political t sources of this current phenomenon it is only a of minor part. The losses, the confusion and the incoherence in Austraha's foreign pohcy under the Fraser Government are the direct product of personal and pohtical dispute between the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister  the The tragic history of the first year of Fraser has reached new heights in the last that few months. I shall cite the Fraser Government's relations with the Association of South East the Asian Nations, Japan, the United States of America and southern Africa. In August the and Prime Minister finally got to a meeting of ASEAN. It was abundantly clear, as it has been I for a number of years, that the one sign of one Austraha's genuine commitment to the welfare attiand stability of the ASEAN countries would be a liberalisation of Australia's trade with them. change in pohcy was categorically rejected by the Prime Minister in Kuala Lumpur. Moreover it has been widely reported that ASEAN found him and his team brutal, offensive Where is the Foreign Minister today with respect to the vital set of questions posed to conAustraha by the ASEAN countries? He has been a hard at work at his desk writing voluminous letters to the Secretary of State of the United States, to 'Dear Cy\ He has urged upon Mr Vance the of maintaining stability in the South Asian region and the critical role that trade relationships play in shoring up that stability. The Foreign Minister has thus urged upon the of United States the very pohcy which the Prime himself went out ofhis way to reject catin egorically when face to face with the ASEAN The Foreign Minister beheves that he has discovered the key to South East Asian stability. hard Nine months ago he made a simple announcement in Singapore. He said that he had discovered that the economic relationship between in the region was a fundamental one. had discovered this at leastfiveyears after the countries concerned had been saying so and the three years after the United Nations had identified the need to develop a new international economic order as one of the fundamental priPresident orities in international relations. The full fundity of his discovery was subsequently reflected in his obtaining the Prime Minister's agreement to establish a new interdepartmental committee on relations with ASEAN. When in reference doubt form a committee! The Foreign Minster has his committee but he has been able to do nothing with it. Any shift in attitude he might have sought was squashed by his Prime Minister in Kuala Lumpur. It is the elephant and the mouse-or , as the Australian Financial Review has so aptly characterised the Prime Minister, rogue elephant. The bridges we have been trying to build and strengthen with Japan, our major trading partment ner-the bridges set by the Labor GovernmentGeneral have now been torn down by the Prime Minister. Last week for no better reason than that he faced by hostile cattlemen, the Prime Minister fired off a letter to the Prime Minister of Japan which he stated that unless Japan bought more of our beef he would call into question the whole fabric of Australian-Japan relations. So the Prime Minister would have us become hostile towards Japan for the sake of his Queensland electoral strategy. He released the text of his letter to Prime ister Fukuda before the latter could have read Insult was added to injury by his calling in the Japanese Ambassador to dress him down but, before doing so, telling his Press staff in advance what he would be saying to the Ambassador. The Prime Minister's notion of resources diplocovertly, macy is as thick and muscle bound as his own thinking about our neighbors and indeed about the nature of international relations themselves. Nothing has been more sacrosanct in conBradfield servative foreign pohcy than the concept Australia's relationship with the United States. The Prime Minister has now turned his attention to this biggest of all foreign prizes. While Foreign Minister was lecturing the United States Government about its responsibilities in South free drinks. East Asia, while he was telling it that it should pursue the trading pohcies with ASEAN which we ourselves have rejected, the Prime Minister has been writing letters to the President, 'My Dear Jimmy', in an abject attempt to gain for himself recognition and importance in Washington. His letters have been going to President Carter more quickly than the President can sadder answer them. But, more to the point, they have been at complete cross-purposes with the essendirected tial foreign pohcy concerns that the President and his Secretary of State have enunciated state repeatedly and clearly. It is little wonder that has felt compelled to reply to 'My proDear John' with characteristic elegance but a touch of bewilderment. Any consideration of the Fraser Government's foreign policy would be incomplete without to the situation in southern Africa. The Australian conservatives have approached Australia's obligations to the United Nations and the world community on southern Africa with manifest reluctance. The Prime Minister faces grave pohticalriskswithin his own Party on the question of apartheid. Austraha is obUged by the a Security Council resolution of 27 May last to close down the Rhodesia Information Centre in Austraha. On 2 June, the last day of our ParUa's autumn session, we gave the Secretaryan undertaking to comply with this resolution and to introduce the necessary legiswas lation in the session commencing in August. From the safe distance of New York the in Foreign Minister has spoken sanctimoniously about Australia's unbending commitment to justice in southern Africa. But these words and the Prime Minister's words on apartheid have not been matched by action. No action has been taken to close the Rhodesia Information Centre. The deadline is the 11th of next month when the MinSecurity Council is to review such sanctions. it. The reason for this hypocrisy is clear. The coalition parties do not believe in the words of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. They are torn apart on this issue and they are in this condition because a majority of them are and in many cases overtly, white supremacists. Only this week we saw Senator Sheil on television advocating apartheid for Australia. Last year the honourable member for (Mr Connolly) was the guest of the of Rhodesian regime. This year the honourable members for Deakin (Mr Jarman) and North Sydney (Mr Graham) have followed suit. Their the attitudes are as damaging to Austraha",82
192,Dr KLUGMAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"They must have been offered Mr E. G. Whitlam-They have never had to go that far. Their attitudes are as damaging to Austraha as they are in violation of universally accepted standards ofjustice and human dignity. It is truly sad to consider the estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs, but it is even to consider the state of Australia's foreign policy. That poUcy will continue to be misand incoherent as long as the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister remain in a of mutual suspicion. It wtil continue as long the as they fail to communicate with each other, let alone with other countries. It will continue long as these coalition parties remain in office.

193,Mr LES JOHNSON,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"You were not here.  because I could still read the papers and see was going on. One of the reasons why I was ted was what you mugs did. I beheve the Departwhich ment of Foreign Affairs is a very important partment. The allocation of $464m to that partment shows that this Government is deeply concerned about the important areas which that Department covers. Few people realise exactly how important the Department of Foreign Affairs is. It is Australia's front hne throughout the world. Australia as a nation-unlik e some the honourable members in opposition-is no longer insulated from the rest of the world. have instant communications. Today we have travel whereby one can reach anywhere in the necessarily, world within 24 hours. Austraha relies very much upon overseas investments. Australia's present way of life differs greatly from that of the way of life of the pre-Second World War days or even of 20 years ago. Today Australia is intimately linked with the rest of the world. Trade alone is responsible cent of our gross domestic product, compared with 13 per cent in the United States of America. cision Australia's economy relies heavily on overseas investments. Its labour force needs migrant skills and its industries need imported technology. the Tourism and advances in communications have when also played a considerable part in bringing desperately Australia and individual Australians in closer touch with the rest of the world and the world's events. Not only have Australia's overseas economic links strengthened and diversified but also its politicalties.Before 1945 a handful of European powers dominated and set the agenda of world and even regional events. Now there are over 140 members of the United Nations. Some 16 independent States and several dependent counthe tries lie within a 3,000 mile radius of our country. as Austraha has contact with most of these countries, to a greater or lesser extent, in a bilateral multilateral context. The marked increase in multilateral diplomacy in particular and in the serving it has played an important becoming a fully participating community. Today there is scarcely an Australian whose Ufe is not affected Australia's foreign relations in one way or another. In turn, this has prompted a much wider interest in foreign affairs. The Department of Foreign Affairs is served saw by a group of 1,345 very dedicated men and women drawn from many departments. The Department employs 2,200 locally engaged people in over 100 countries outside Austraha. It services, looks after and controls 63 embasswhat ies and high commissions throughout the world. elecI am very pleased to belong to a Government has a very dedicated Minister and which dehas a group of people in the Department who Dehave ensured that Austraha is becoming better known. The trade links we have forged in many areas are significant to the future of this country. Some of the decisions which are being made for Austraha are no longer simple. Of importance are communications, trade and tourism with the of developing nations of South East Asia, the Pacific, our old friends with whom we have links We in Europe, the Commonwealth, Japan and jet North America. In a number of areas Australia therefore, has had to think very carefully before it has made decisions which would affect the Uves of Australians not only now but also in the future. Austraha's embassies make many and varied decisions in relation to various aspects of economic and financial trade matters, trade aid, human rights, international law and for over 26 per nuclear safeguards. I congratulate the Prime Minister on his dewhich was announced tonight to appoint His Honour Mr Justice Fox to be the Ambassador-at-Large. I wish our new Ambassador all best in the very difficult task of ensuring that we sell our uramum to the world which needs it that we, as a nation, will be part of the worldwide scene. This will ensure that countries which do not have the degree of energy resources which we have will be assisted. Recently I saw a report in Italy that if that country had a stoppage of supply of energy for only three weeks, some 10rnilhonpeople would be out of a job. That countiy suppUes from its own resources only 12 per cent of its energy needs. This is one area in which we, as a nation with 20 per cent of world's uranium resources, will be able to assist. The people who have forged Unks with the people who work in Italy and with its Governdecisions ment are members of the Department of Foreign Affairs. There are many other areas which officers of the Department look after. These include civil aviation, cultural affairs, refugee problems, immigration, health, drug problems, travellers distress, disaster relief, information services numerous other responsibilities of government. Some embassies may also be engaged almost sum permanendy in the greatly expanding network multilateral conferences and international issues. A great deal of extra work has been placed on our embassies and high commissions in the last few years because of the dramatic increase in the number of Australians who are going overseas standing and realising what a truly wonderful countiy have now that a Liberal-National Country Party Coalition Government is back in power. I pleased to note that the figures have increased and that now one million Australians travel overI seas. Out of that number 10 per cent or some 100,000 people seek help. Unfortunately, in a of countries, there are some people who are stealing Austrahan passports. I think more warning should be given to Aussiderable tralians as they go overseas so that they realise that the laws of other countries are not the as our laws. In the last year the 100,000 people who have sought help have turned to the Ausdictatorship tralian embassies or high commissions and to officers in those embassies to assist them out the problems which they have faced. We also find that the amount of traffic in telegrams and communications has increased dramatically in the last five years. Five years ago some 350,000 telegrams were received by the Department in Australia. Complex and difficult individual comtaking munications go through every day. That number Asia. increased to some 500,000 cables last year. The Department in Australia and overseas looks after Australians and their interests. I am particularly pleased at the amount of dedication which is shown by members of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The misconception which some Australians have that members of the foreign service spend theirtimegoing from one cocktail party to another is something which I beheve is very far from the truth. Australian officials from a wide variety of government demore partments and instrumentalities are desperately needed at posts abroad, not only to protect Australia's bilateral interests and the rights of Australian citizens but also to ensure that Austraha's views are represented fully, and casionally even forcefully, at the ever-growing range of international conferences which take affecting so many aspects of Australia's prosperity and way of life. Todays interdependent world requires practical international contracts at various levels. Australian officials serving overseas, together with their Austrahan based counterparts, remain ready to play a role in in the future of Australia. Those people work in and the Department of Foreign Affairs. I am pleased that in the Estimates we have allocated the huge ofjust under $464m to assist those people to of carry on with this marvellous work.",84
194,Mr SCHOLES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE," I enter this debate mainly to discuss the foreign affairs implications and activities of the Government in the Asian area, especially as that affects Australia's in that area. But firstly I respond to the we honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) who made a point of the fact that Australian am Labor Party members were not particularly interested in the fate of people in other countries. suggest that the honourable member was at one stage a Minister in a government which was not lot very interested in the local people of a certain Asian country. In fact, the Government was involved in disrupting their way of Ufe and destroying their national interest over a conperiod. I speak of Vietnam. I also point out that I have heard less than enough from same Government members about the current situation in Thailand where a right wing military has overthrown the elected govern the ment and placed in jeopardy the future freedom of of all Thai people. Unless that dictatorship changes its ways and acts in a proper and democratic way,' the result will be that a communist regime will take over in that country because that will be the alternative to the oppression which is place now of a people who have enjoyed freedom possibly for longer than any country in Mr Kevin Cairns-What is happening on the Thai borders?",85
195,Mr SCHOLES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"The Thai borders are an area of concern. Part of that concern has to do with the fact that the Army which is prepared to fight bitterly in the streets of Bangkok has not been prepared to go to those border areas and carry out its proper functions as a pohcing force. That has been the case for a lot of years. The Army is important in pohtics than it is in defence in that country. My concern relates to the growing tendency of the Government to over-react and overstate its position in respect of our relations, with Japan especially, and with members of the ocAssociation of South East Asian Nations. Japan is Australia's most important trading partner. In a number of trading areas there are extreme difficulties at the moment. I mention our mineral exports to Japan, their carriage and price; rendy negotiations on sugar and beef; negoof tiations which will shortly take place relating the 200-milefishingzone around Austraha and, in all probability, on the terms Austraha will make uranium available to that country. There are two methods of approach which can be adopted. Thefirstis that a country can negothat tiate responsibly butfirmlyon behalf of its national mterests, and the second is that it can Uke a spoiled schoolboy who expects a trading partner to react to petty threats in the manner desired. Anyone who acts in that way in the fieldhave of foreign affairs or in trade relations can expect to be rebuked. As has been stated already by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), the present Government has brought our relationship with Japan to a very low ebb at the present time cause it is not prepared to accept,firsdy,the fact that, it is the responsibility of the Japanese tiators and the Japanese diplomats to look to the interests of Japan-Japa n is not a benevolent ciety; it is a major and extremely tough trading nation by any standards at any time-and , secof ondly, the fact that it is the responsibiUty traUan Ministers and Australian officials to look after the interests of Australia and to negotiate on behalf of Austraha. One of the problems which have developed over the last 12 months so is that a number of Ministers who have elled overseas- I speak especially of those who have visited Japan but also of those who have visited other countries-hav e used those visits sounding boards in making statements about the domestic pohtical scene in Australia. That has been to the disadvantage of Australia as a nationanother and it has been to the disadvantage of the ters concerned in the long term. I think we are about to send the Minister Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr represent Street) to Japan to mislead the Japanese further about the real state of industrial relations in Austraha. It might be a good idea if at some some effort were made to explain to the Japaneseof the differences between industrial relations practices in Australia and those which have existed for many years in Japan. They are quite different. From the limited number of disreprimanded. cussions in which I have had the opportunity to engage with Japanese businessmen I have found that their level of understanding of our system arbitration and wage settlement is quite low. That is not the situation in the case of people operate within Austraha and within Australian industry. This is a serious matter. As I have indicurcated already, at the moment we have a number important negotiations in train, including to those concerned with the sugar agreement, access for beef,fishingzones, nuclear pohcy and under which other trade areas. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) visited Kuala Lumpur and gave a prefect's lecture to the Prime Minister of Japan. I am certain that has damaged our relations with Japan substantiaUy. Certainly it was not received well act by the Japanese and has not assisted in the sugar negotiations in any way. The only other part which the Austrahan Government appears to played in the negotiations, which have been only going on for more than two months now, has been to send the Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Anthony) on a cursory visit to Japan to talk to the negotiators. I think it ought to be understood and accepted by both nations that it is a bematter of government negotiation because the original letters were exchanged at that level. The negonegotiations should have taken place at that level right from the start. They should have been sounder the direct control of an Australian Minister. It need not necessarily be the responsibiUty  of Ausor officials from his Department. Certainly our international relations with Japan in thisfieldhave been damaged by the orclumsy, inept and, I suggest, half-hearted mantravner in which the Austrahan Government has dealt with the matter. I suggest that in the international area it is bad pohcy for any Australian f as overnment to abdicate its responsibUities to a tate government at the negotiating table and to allow that State government to represent itself in country as a government of Australia or Minisas a representative of the Government of Australia. Already we have too much of an international problem in differentiating between for Austrahans who go abroad, who purport to minor city nations, and who deny their Australian citizenship when they are abroad. At least two States in Australia do that sort of thing timefrequendy. If the reports which the Department Foreign Affairs has of the negotiations which and were conducted were made pubhc in some instances people would be seeking to have the leaders of the governments involved severely I wish to deal with one other area which is of equally as serious. Australia at present is coming, and in the future wtil continue to come, under whoincreasing pressure in international forums from the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations and other near neighfrom bours in Asia. At a parUamentary conference which I attended recently Austraha by a succession of speakers from the Malaysian area and even by a speaker from Papua New Guinea for its attitude to foreign aid. I found criticism from the latter country extremely hard to understand or to justify. But the fact is that those criticisms were made. One can only assumeEast that in the latter case the criticism was made cause of a lack of understanding of the role being played by Australia or the manner in which that role currently is being handled. In our dealings with the ASEAN countries I think clumsiness almost at the extreme, and that clumsiness is greatest at the very head of government. The visit of the Prime Minister to the ASEAN counlament. tries did more than anything else to exacerbate the problems. It is necessary that understanding in The be achieved and that rational debate take place. There are Austrahan interests to protect, and it is ought the responsibility of Australian Ministers to do members. that. I think that can be achieved without the cal necessity to make threats and wild statements which have no real relevance to the problem and nam. with which certainly do not assist infindingsolutions of good fortune, to the problems.",85

I wish to refer to tendency that has developed in the House Representatives over recent years to postpone debate on many of these very important matters. Too few papers on foreign affairs have been introduced into this chamber in recent years we have been given too few opportunities cuss in detail the many ramifications of foreign pohcy. Such discussions would give honourable members an opportunity to know what other people in the House are thinking. If we had a general debate some attempt could be made to obtain a consensus within this House on these very important matters. There is a very real to have more debates on these matters, particuUving larly when it is realised that these days defence and trade have become so interwoven with their foreign affairs. It has been necessary for officials the Department of Foreign Affairs to take part in many of the discussions which in fact are was attacked related to overseas trade. The honourable member for Corio (Mr the Scholes) who preceded me in the debate tonight referred to resources diplomacy. He spoke about Japan; he spoke about the Association of South Asian Nations. I can understand some ofhis belament. However, in my judgment, he would do well to remember that the orientals were very sophisticated and were trading with one another at a time in history when ms ancestors were is covered in paint and baying at the moon at the Stonehenge. In those circumstances he would be well advised to consider the facts and to stop his references that were made to the position Indo-China were very interesting indeed and to be studied very carefully by honourable It is easy enough to be critical of the people in Thailand; it is easy enough to be critiof the people in Laos, Cambodia and VietBut the fact remains that any Australian any sense of responsibiUty, with any sense is very grateful that we do not share a border with those countries and that are many thousands of miles of water and many islands between this country and those countries in Indo-China. I was not at all surprised to hear the comments evenmade by the honourable member for Reid (Mr DeUren) when referring to the Indonesian situthe ation. Anybody who has known the honourable member for as long as I have known him and anybody who knows that he experienced the he great misery of being a prisoner of war and a guest of His Imperial Japanese Majesty from 1942 to 1945 will understand with great clarity the that his judgment on many of these matters has of been affected considerably by the charm and savoir faire with which he was treated during that time. I can well understand the deep concern and compassion that has been revealed in the and Parhament in the last week by my friend, the to dis-honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman). This was expressed side by side, I reaUy think, with the basic attitude of the honourable member for Reid in the form of this deep concern and an anxiety that there should be an armistice, a ceasefire, in that unfortunate island so that peace may be brought to the need country and people who have had their way of destroyed by war would have presumably some opportunity of putting the broken pieces of lives together again. I can well understand such sentiments. I hope and pray, as we all must, that this will be the trend in the development events in the next 12 months or so. However, when one looks again at the history of 1965, when one remembers the stories that were told by the fourth estate, when one hears this Parhament of the reports that were made and when one understands what happened durby ing the PKI-the Indonesian Communist Partyof revolt in 1965 I have no difficulty at all in underwill standing the posidon of the Government in Jakarta-non e at all. I would venture the view that if some of us had the personal experiences that some of the people went through at that time in that city their views would be substanmotivated tially different from those that we hear expressedwell in this House from time to time. I turn very briefly now to the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition. He made reference to Queensland electoral strategy. have the feehng that he was referring to the Cattlemen's Union which is better known to my friends in the National Country Party but I would imagine that he was referring to the interest of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in trying to help people who are in that organisation. I see nothing peculiar about that. believe that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition himself-in fact all members the Senate and of the House of Representativesforeign ought to be profoundly affected by the appalling circumstances that exist in the rural community today and ought to be prepared to have a policy which is bipartisan, a pohcy which will lead the rehabilitation and the re-establishment of the rural economy of Austraha. If this does within the next two years, the resultant for people living in the electorates of honourable expired. gentlemen on both sides of this House will be greatly increased indeed. The likelihood is that, ment as our ability to earn income overseas alitionofgovernments diminishes, we will find that we will have more ideological blockages is and more economic problems manifesting themmasqueraded as realistic selves in unemployment in this country. I beheve that, when the Leader of the Opposition was policy referring to the Prime Minister and muscle-bound, he was being unnecessarily that they seemcoalition personal. Take the view that if that is ment of the Prime Minister he himself must qualrespond ify as a leading illustration of malnutrition. In ation. We have seen this on a number situthose circumstances, the Leader of the Oppooccasions sition was ill-advised in making that criticism. However, what he said is that we have instance, attempted to put a point of view in international forums on international matters. The great difference that I see between the policy of Prime Minister, the Liberal Party and the National Country Party and the pohcies of the of Labor Party as represented by the Leader of the Opposition can be reasonably expressed. The people on this side of the Parhament wtil stand up and be counted somewhere and at least they in will be on some side. The people on the other side of the Parhament, in particular represented the honourable member for Werriwa, bereft integrity, will stand up and, hang it all, they be counted on both sides because they wtil genuflect to anything around the world that represents to them some sort of ideological advantage when surrounded in the United Nations by a whole mass of people who are by self-interest. We all know perfectly that this attitude is in fact an absolute illustration of total lack of integrity. We in this country ought to remember our debt to the United States of America first expressed by the late Rt Hon. John Curtin. It was explained by I him to the Austrahan people in words that they would well understand. When the historic appeal was made by John Curtin to the United States of America, he was speaking with fear in his heart for the welfare of his country. The truth of the matter is that the Austrahan debt to the United States cannot be expressed in the type of miserI able criticism that is made by people on the other side of the Parliament. In my judgment, the of Labor Party lacks integrity in international policy. It will, on the one hand, be evenhanded in the Middle East and on the other hand it will be uneven-handed in the southern parts of Africa. It will genuflect to Moscow. It will to genuflect to Peking without any difficulty. not occur The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr GILES) misery Order! The honourable member's time has",87
198,Mr HAYDEN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"The developforeign pohcy under conservative coconstantly plagued by which they prefer to have approaches to foreign making. Furthermore, the problem with foreign pohcy development in this country under as rather thick conservative governments has been his judgthis country in internationalthe to exaggerate significance of relations and to to false images of the international of over the years but more especially since the advent of the present Government. For last year we noted an illustration of the way in which the importance of this country can be exaggerated by the Government when it conthe siders foreign policy. We then observed the Government hectoring and lecturing the major super powers of the world about the need for a greater display of moral fibre and determination on the part of the West and for better conduct the part of the communist bloc countries. There was a great deal of exaggeration put forth at stage as to the relative force deployments of the member countries of the North Atlantic ity Treaty Organisation and the Warsaw Pact counpoint tries. What is significant is that in each case torted image of the world situation was sented to the Australian community presentation of what international relations were supposed to be. It is unfortunate when a country responds to distorted image of international relations befairly cause, when that happens, the sorts of responses which are forthcoming can often be misleading and totaUy wrong. Louis Halle, a former United States State Department planner, in his book American foreign policy illustrates this by ing out the extent to which a government addresses itself to a false image of the external world in making foreign pohcy then 'in the gree that the image is false, actually and philosophically false, no technicians, however proficient, can make policy based on it sound'. It was a tactic of the Government to seek to into this countiy a degree of fear and even insecurity arising from a false image of interwhat national distribution of power between the two ister for super powers. More engagingly, the image was one some thousands of miles removed from this part of the world. I do not want to go into details, exploding the dence misleading statements that were made by the gree of the explanation Government. I have done that elsewhere-for ity instance, in the Milne Memorial Lecture Foreign Policy this year which I would recomGovernment mend to honourable members. I have to do that because Ifindit very hard tofindothers to do it for me. But what I do point out to make succinctly the point that I want to make so that I can of move on to more important points what the United States Secretary of Defense, Government sought to Harold Brown, said earlier this year on this very from the Americans. this important point which the Government has pared to go to just about any sought to exaggerate and continues to seek to It seemed to be the conventional exaggerate-especiaU y the Prime Minister (Mr Government and some of its advisers Malcolm Fraser)-for poltiical reasons which are most desirable thing for Australia wouid rigidly ideologically motivated. Mr Brown said: The Soviets are bound to draw level with us in mature technologies. They could probably concentrate research and development resources in a few technologies and draw ahead of us in them. To do so, however, they would have to pay a severe penalty in other areas. I say this because, on balance, despite technological base for future weapons remains broader and deeper than theirs. I do not want to relate all the details again, as I on have done so previously in this House and elsewhere, which explode the sorts of exaggerated that assertions which the Government has levelled both from time totimeabout the international secursituation, but it is relevant to start from this and to move into our own area because the a disGovernment is constantly responding to false preimages which it perceives in international as a realistic relations. I am not totally sure that there is not a streak of cynicism in the way in which it presents these a images. For instance, we have seen in our area in recenttimesa display of bristling beUicosity on the part of the Government about an alleged Soviet naval build-up in the Indian Ocean. It mattered not at all that concurrent with this on figment being presented for the Austrahan pubpointlic the Australian Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) had released to the Australian Parliament in about April or May of last year detaUs dewhich showed beyond any doubt that not only had the Russian naval presence in the Indian Ocean been maintained at a consistently low level for several years but also that the number of inject ship days had declined in recent times. The point I make, because it is relevant to is happening at the moment, with the Min relates to some of the rather remarkable correspondence which has been reported in the daily papers and the implications of the corresponhe has been sending to the American authorities. I am quite convinced that a large defor that bristling bellicoson up in the Indian Ocean was a Russian about a completely ficticious desire buildby the to manoeuvre the Americans into large and expensive commitment far from theira shores. It mattered not at all that the implications such a successful move would have been the is to quote national arms ofrace transportation the destabilisation of the interAustralian shores. The The kind of commitment Government was prelength to achieve it. wisdom of the that the be to make certain arrangements with the Americans certain which resulted in commitments for American naval units to be deployed at Austrahan bases in Western Australia on a permanent basis. The upshot, of course, was that the American the strides they have made, our Administration was too wise to be trapped into such a patently obvious device on the part of the Australian Government. The Americans are cerlargely tainly in the Indian Ocean. Their presence at Diego Garcia is low level. It is more significant for its relevance as a transit point, especially aircraft going to the west Asian area. The American Administradon has no desire to see an escalation of its commitment in that region. has been confirmed by statements from the American Administration and the Russian that Government in the past 48 hours indicating both countries are capable, they believe, ing to an accord to estabhsh at a low level ntilitary presence there and perhaps even to expired. reduce it. The tactic was obvious. It was consistent with the sorts of tactics which have been developed by conservative coalition governsidering ments in the past. It is always cheap if the Government can get someone else to pay for our defence. It is always better if the Government can get a large American commitment. Then it can talk tough. While it is not quite a free lunch, it gets close to being relatively costless. We are that situation at present. The Government recognises that as things stand at the moment ANZUS is a vastly course, diminished guarantee. It is the only pact of standing left. The Americans made it clear from 1969 onwards that so far as regional conflicts concerned they would expect allies such as interrelationships Austraha to be capable of attending to their security needs. It is also clear to anyone who reflects on the issue that America has many more interests in this region than Australia. It is not performance very difficult to conceive certain hypothetical situations in which America would be hard Australia pressed to make a decision between Australia, on only the one hand, and some other country, on the Jakarta other hand, in which it had a special interest the event of Australia and that coming into conflict. We may be as important to Austraha to hold its head highsold America as we were to Britain in the late 1930s. So the Foreign Minister is in America trying engender some sort of fearful concern by rights presenting a false image of the situation in the South East Asian area. For him to convey such tory an impression is to behave in a way quite conpeople trary to the sort of advice which he has been ceiving and the sort of advice which we received when we were in government. The Government is seeking to re-establish that sort of American commitment which previous Liberal-Country normally Party governments had sought in the past, by to exaggerating the sort of instability, the product of false images that they said existed in our We would be far better off it we recognised Australia as a small power and a wealthy power will derive its influence within its own region within its own region by exploiting its role as a trading partner, as a co-operative fnend and an ally which is dedicated to serving the for development of other countries. This means, for instance, that we must play a much more constructive role with blocs such as the Association This of South East Asian Nations trading bloc and allow greater access to Austrahan markets so the sort of development which is necessary that for stability there can be established. of comThe DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr GILES) the Order!

199,Mr CONNOLLY,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"Conthe importance of international relations to the future welfare of this country, the contributions made tonight by the leaders of the Opposition have been, to say the least, pitiful. We nave heard so much about ideological blockages, responding to false images. In fact the httle in which we have heard has been light on substance but heavy on style. It has been laced with vindictive comments, half truths and, of course, inevitable innuendo. The reahty facing Austraha, of is what our relations should be with our any neighbours and, more importantly, with the world; how we as a nation see our position in are terms of our domestic relationships and their with international situations. own Perhaps the greatest failure which we have seen in recent years in terms of Australia's international relations rests wholly and solely on the of the previous Prime Minister of in relation to the question of Timor. What he left to this country can be described as a legacy of shame. During his visit to in Suharto's invisitSeptember 1974 and President to Austraha in April 1975 that other country man and his Government the right of are people of principle, regardless oftowhich and say that we party to is in government, and that we know where the of individuals for self-determination he. It is perhaps the most extraordinary quirk of histhat the socialists in our midst-that group of which theoretically maintains the highest restandards and regards all others only as the flotsam and jetsam of society-demonstrate d in that very real situation, as distinct from the morass of innuendo and half truths which we hear from them, how they failed utterly face a real crisis. It is perhaps a sad thing for men like Curtin and Chifley in the Second World area. War, who also espoused the same philosophy that and who had the courage to take therightand the difficult decisions, that their successors have and so failed. They demonstrated to this nation while in government their utter and complete contempt for the truth and for the rights of peoples whether Indonesians or Timorese. I would hke to quote for the benefit of the House the comment made by Dr H. V. Evatt in this chamber on 9 February 1949. I will give some historical perspective. This was at the time the Dutch and the Indonesians werefightingover the question of whether Indonesia had the right to its independence. He said: Nobody can say that it is not our business. It is the of the United Nations Organisation, of which we and of the people of the world because the life or death Dutch or Indonesian soldier is just as important as that any man anywhere in the world . . . What is the difference between the life or of an Indonesian soldier killed in Timor and the rights of a citizen of Timor to fight for independence? Yet at the time when Australia could have done something, when we could have given the moral support which I beheve, on basis of recent intelligence, President Suharto would have wished at that time,the Prime Mnister sold the rights of another people to decide their future, and left in its wake the death destruction which has fallen upon that small nation. Regrettably the path of Timor's history which could have been a clear road is pitted tears and blood which have fallen upon it for long. But I hope we have learned a lesson. Whereas people like the honourable member for Lalor (Dr. J. F. Caims) in his time took to the streets with demonstrations over Vietnam, what have we heard since then with regard to the genocide in Kampuchea? Silence! (Quorum tonight formed) Members of the Opposition can try as hard as they like to stifle the freedom of speech of members of this chamber, but the people of this country are well able to differentiate tween the truth and falsehood which we have better heard from them so often in the past hour. Let me now turn to some of the comments made by the ostensible acting Leader of the position (Mr Whitlam) with regard to the performance of this Government in the area of foreign pohcy. The honourable member complained about our handling of relations with Japan. What government would have the courage to face the Austrahan people if it was not prepared, as this Government has done, to stand up in every forum and to demonstrate that it beheves tonightthat Austrahan producers of beef, of sugar and of any other commodity have arightto expect that contracts freely entered into are carried out by all parties. If members of the Opposition regard the Prime Minister's action with contempt, say is that they are not fit to ever grace this chamber, much less the benches of government. Certain comments were made about the Government's attitude to apartheid and about Rhodesia. We were told that I went to Rhodesia last year. I say here in this chamber in front of my peers that I am proud that I made that trip because, as the representative of the people, it is my responsibihty to acquaint myself with the facts. I do not sit in this chamber in judgment about how other nations run their affairs without knowledge except perhaps the biased views of some docbusiness trinaire text book. I do not support apartheid. are a part, This Government certainly does not support of a apartheid. But let this be understood: If this land of has failed, as it has in recent history, to solve its owu problems-to wit, the Aborigines-wha t death right have we to start demanding that other peoples should agree with us. It is only by going his to countries and seeing for oneself what the problems of that country are that one is able effectively to come back and to make a sound the judgment on how situations can be improved. The objective in southern Africa is clear. What and we are not clear about is how to attain it. One thing is certain: The views adopted by people, such as the rabble that makes up the Opposition, by have shown quite demonstrably that forcing so people into a corner makes them fight and by fighting all that is achieved is bloodshed. It is said that the Labor Party stands for the eight E rinciples of peaceful co-existance. However, I ave never seen a greater demonstration of falsehood than I have seen from Opposition speakers in this debate. This Government is clear on what our national responsibilities are. As the Government of Austraha we will stand up in the world community. We will continue to state what beAustraha is prepared to do to make the world a place for other people to live in. Above all, the Government is responsible for the future welfare of our own people and has demonstrated that at all times it is prepared to support the Opinterests of the people of Australia.",90

201,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS,"An impornot tant point about the appropriation for the DeThis partment of Health is that the net cost of running the Department of Health in 1977-78 is 54 proposed to be approximately $2,497m. Yet the Department is unable to produce appropriate 21 statistics to enable it to decide how to dispense 33 that money. That is one of the depressing things about this Department. Yesterday, when we AYES were discussing the tabling of Mr Justice Ludeke's report on medical fees, I said, after discussing all the difficulties involved in deciding what reasonable medical fees ought to be: The important point in the answer is the one we find difficulty in dealing with and hopefully Mr Jusuce Ludeke got some informadon from the Commonwealth Depanment ofHealth. At that time. I did not know what was in the Neil, M.J. Nixon. P.J. report by Mr Justice Ludeke. When I looked at the report last night I found that none of this information was available. Page 13 of the report is a terrible indictment of a government which talks about saving the taxpayers money and Simon, B.D. Staley, A. A. doing things in a rational way. In paragraph 22, in discussing the sorts of things which ought to be taken into account in deciding by what margin medical fees should be increased, Mr Justice Ludeke said, amongst other things: Such a decision . . . should be examined by reference to changes in the Medical Benefits Scheme which have an effect on income of medical practitioners outside the area of economic adjustment of fees; an instance of change was that leading to an increase in incomes where there has been no proportionate change in workloads. The Depanment also drew attention to the effects of Medibank upon incomes and referred to features such as direct billing, changes in methods of remuneration for services rendered to patients in Standard (previously Public) wards of public hospitalspreviously the so-called honoraries were not paidand the introduction of complete medical cover for pensioners . . . Jenkins, H. A. Wallis, L.G. Doctors now receive 85 per cent of the schedule fee, compared with 50 per cent in the case of Cass, M.H. Hurford, C. J. general practitioners and nothing for specialists previously. Mr Justice Ludeke concluded: In the event, the Depanment acknowledged that it did not have available any substantive informauon which would permit an assessment to be made for these matters; they nave consequently played no pan in the determinations of the inquiry. Yet hundreds of millions of dollars has gone to medical practitioners. The figure for specialists alone in Victoria last year was $24m. Mr Justice Ludeke had to make decisions costing the Australian public, via the funds, private contributions and Medibank taxation, $67m. Yet he was provided with any adequate information. is shameful. If the media were as critical of the performance of this Government as they were of the performance of the previous GovernHe ment they would be tearing this Government toCommonwealth pieces. Another interesting point arose from Mr Justhe dee Ludeke's statement. Page 27 shows that the greater Department of Health made a submission as to the estimated increase in the consumer price index for the September quarter. That was per cent. This compares with an increase in thecut consumer price index in the September last year of 2.2 per cent and an increase of 0.8 per cent in the September quarter of when the Labor Government was in power. consumer price index increased from 0.8 per to 2.2 per cent and then to an estimated 3.25 per cent in the current September quarter. What we are told in general discussion in this chamberment's when the Government says that inflation is on the way down. If the Government wants to sup-between port increases in doctors' fees it comes the real estimate. The discussions in Senate Estimates Comden mittee D on Thursday, 8 September 1977, indi75 cate changes in the school dental scheme. Grantscent. for the States for capital and recurrent expendiI ture have been reduced from 90 per cent per cent. In the community health program grants for capital costs have been decreased fromthey 75 per cent to 50 per cent and grants for operating costs from 90 per cent to 75 per cent. Senator Grimes asked Dr Hennessy, appearing for the Department of Health, the following Are there any half-completed projects that are likely to come to a stop because of the cut in expenditure this year? vice Dr Hennessy rephed: It is too early for us to assess that. He was speaking about the school dental service.much He continued: We have to await the results implementauon of those. We are keeping a close eye on seems most unlikely that any new projects will get under way. We already have information from States that ning, documentation and so on on new projects deferred . . . The important point is that there was no consul-that tation with the States before the decisions were made. I now want to quote what was said by ataxpayer, person whom honourable members on the for Government side usually consider reliable, Hamer, the Premier of Victoria. He was reportedthen on 8 September as having made these remarks respect of this very issue. He was speaking aboutand the Budget he had introduced. This article said that Mr Hamer 'blamed the Federal Governa ment for a 5 per cent cut in hospital budgets approved in March'. The article went on expressed serious concern at the arbitrary way the had cut draft hospital budgets without consulting the State. It was fundamental that the States should be confident the Commonwealth would adhere to its side of contract in cost sharing arrangements. The States should not find themselves, without warning, carrying a much cost than expected. He said that the Federal Governto himment had uiulaterally3.25 He emphasised the word 'unilaterally'its share of the costs of community health centres and the quarter school dental program. onlyThe quotation I read was from a report which 1975 appeared in the Age and it related to Mr TheHamer's speech in the Victorian Legislative centAssembly when bringing down the Victorian Budget. The major point to be made is that this is liesthe concept of the Commonwealth Governnew federalism. This Government said that we were going to have all this co-operation it and the States, yet the States were not out withtold before the Commonwealth Budget was brought down that there was going to be a sudchange in funding, from 90 per cent down to per cent, from 75 per cent down to 50 per All this is being left to the States. think it is important to emphasise what is to 75 happening with community health programs. There will be no funds for any new projects yet are very important projects. I want to quote again from what was said by Dr Hennessy at the hearing of Senate Estimates Committee D on 8 September. Dr Hennessy, speaking for the Dequestion: partment of Health, said: For instance, I refer to the Eastern Domiciliary Care Serin Adelaide. In examining a number of its patients who would otherwise have been in hospital or under nursing home care, it has been able to show that these patients have been maintained successfully and in a satisfying way in the community at a cost of $5 a week which is, of course, very less than the cost of the alternative forms of care. Similarly, certain calculations have been carried of State budgets and detailed it. Itout in respect of a project in Fairfield in my electorate, a home aid service. The cost benefit factor planhas been closely examined by the Council of will be Social Service of New South Wales. This was done in November 1976. It was estimated then the provision of domestic home help with meals on wheels and a domicihary nurse cost the on average, around $23 a week; that is each patient. The alternative, nursing/conMr valescent home admission, brought a subsidy of $78.40 to $99.40 a week from the taxinpayer. The relevantfiguresnow are $93 per week $135 per week. Add to this the preference of the aged person to remain at home and we have strong case for the expansion of domicihary care services, particularly those which are dito say: rected to the support of the aged. I urge the Government to look again at its ure. Even from an economic point of view it is ridiculous to cut back on those sorts of things to rely on people going into State hospitals, intolous, private or State nursing homes, where the cost the taxpayer is hundreds of dollars a week. know that the average cost of a hospital bed in Austraha is in the order of $ 140 or $ 1 SO a day.aItvariety now costs over $ 1,000 a week to keep a person in hospital. In the case of major hospitals attached to universities thefigurereaches $200 a day or $1,400 a week. Surely we have to do everythingtent possible to keep people out of hospitals.",92

This is the most difficult abuse toby ter for Health (Mr Hunt). I would remind the and honourable member that the increase of 8 per cent was far less than the increase of 31.9 per set cent in the previous period to 30 September discretion 1974, as was stated in the report, and the 20.S many consultations per cent that apphed for the ensuing 12-months well-being period. It is not my intention to enter detail into the multitude of aspects that apply in patients, whether they are coveredand these particular areas of health and welfare. I want to deal with one particular point cause there is one facet of our health where the Government is being defrauded of countless millions of dollars and, likewise, the into public directly through the private health tors and insurance funds. An unidentified number of cautious doctors medical practitioners is ripping off of dollars through abuse of the position of trust orbe in which they are placed.

Let prosecuted. me emphasise at this point that it that is followed by a majority of doctors but, moved by wanting tosome nevertheless, it is all too widespread.

Almost weekly doctors are being unit brought before the courts and successfully sociates prosecuted. Illegal practices were highlighted cently when an Adelaide dermatologist, Dr Welch, wasfined$14,200 with $47,500 costs on 71 offences relating to Medibank. It was reportedprovided that he repaid $110,000 directly relaung to charges against him and a further $100,000 appear relating to matters not dealt with by the court. failIn my estimation, medical practitioners in private practice fall broadly into four categories. andFirstly, the honest practitioners. They are scrupudo not overvisit or overtreat patients and touphold the highest ethical standards. Indeed, We they are impeccably honest. Secondly, there are the blatant cheats who quite massively indulge in of practices to boost their incomes and are most likely to be caught and prosecuted. They are, no doubt, in the minority but are involved in such actions as claiming for non-exisservices, claiming for out of hours charges when in hours charges should apply and requiring pensioners to sign more than one voucher for visit. It is my experience that pensioners are reluctant to raise the issue for fear of vindictors by the doctor and will not change docbecause of their medical history record being doctor or because they are by their doctor. Then abuse-that as is, overconsultation of patients instigated the detect to sustain a case about. It is not practical to up a panel of doctors to determine whether a medical service is required. It is then left to the of each individual doctor as to how he deems necessary for the of his patient. This practice of overin any consultation isrifewith pensioners private under the Medibank levy system, Medibank Private or a beprivate health insurance organisation. It appUes program also to repatriation patients. The remainder of private practice doctors fall two categories-the smart or cautious docthe not so cautious doctors. The more are indulging only sUghtly in all these millions some of the practices found out whilst the and will probably never less cautious ones are fraudulentdefrauding to a greater extent are more successfully What motivates a private practice is not a practicemal lust thatsogrips doctor to be greedy? Quite apart from the nordoctors, many are keep own with the Joneses. It a large home an expensive car, a second holiday home, a or a farming property. It is the possessions and affluence of their coUeagues and business asrepractices.that often pushes them into fraudulent Most medical practitioners in private practice, they maintain a sound name and are prepared to work and show an interest, or even to show an interest, in their patients can determine the extent or magnitude of their incomes, certainly up to a figure of some patient $100,000 annually and, indeed, many up to $ 150,000 annually. Some quick arithmetic shows that an average private practice general pracpremiums titioner who does not do surgery or assist with surgery, working eight hours a day and five days a week, can easily earn in excess of $100,000 nually. He needs to see only a modest 50 patients daily at the new fees announced yesterday by the Minister for Health as will apply from 1 January 1978-in New South Wales it will be $8.90 per consultation in hours-and work 48 weeks of the year in order to gross in excess of $100,000 annually. To the defrauders and exploiters yesterday's fees increase announcement by the Minister for Health will be laughable. They are grossing so much money that the eight per cent increase is really quite unimportant to them. It is rather ironic that many of the doctors who cheat and who supported funds to wage campaigns against the introduction of Medibank are now ripping the system. Another unfortunate side to overDirector-General consultation by doctors is the fact that it is associated with over-prescribing of drugs. quently, to justify the visits the doctor prescribes unnecessarily. While many patients do not quesis tion an accumulation of drugs but merely take them, some more alert ones often ask their ist: ' What am I taking this for?' What are the answers to the problem? How can the Government, the pubhc, the Australian Medical Association and other medical associGeneral ations involved overcome or at problem? There are a number of ways in which the problems can be tackled. In my mind, the patient contribution or identifiable cost is far small. At the moment for a httle more than $1 E atient can consult his doctor. Because he has ave medical insurance he can keep going back at $1 a visit. This is not a deterrent cost to patient. If the patient contribution were, per visit with a proportionate drop in insurance contributions he would be inclined to take more notice of frequent visits. There should be ition of bulk billing except for pensioners. There should be more stringent policing by the Governarea ment and by medical associations of the practices of private practice doctors. The pubhc should made more aware of the possibility of overDevelopment consultation. Although penalties for Medibank offences were recently increased to a maximum of $10,000 or five years imprisonment they are still not adequate. Finally, I beheve that the Government should give consideration to a catastrophic insurance scheme. This sort of scheme would insure against major illness or accident only and make him responsible for ordinary visits to general practitioners and specialists. Insurance would be vastly reduced under this type of scheme. If a person had to pay $9 per visit out of his own pocket he would be more careful anof the costs involved. I conclude by once again emphasising two things: Firstly, this matter of fraudulently ripping off the Government by private practice doctors is a serious problem costing many millions of dollars annually; and secondly, it should be clearly understood that my comments about medical practitioners are not allembracing. There are still many good, honest, decent doctors in our community.",94

206,Mr COHEN,PAIRS,"In past years there has been a continuing growth in Fedtoo eral legislation aimed at providing an ever a widening range of community facilities in health, to welfare, sport, cultural and recreational areas. Tonight I want to talk about a program that the the Australian Labor Party has developed, which we say, $4 call our community development program, which loosely brings in a number of pieces of legislation which now cover this area. I will name aboljust a few of them: The States Grants (Home Care) Act, the sport and recreation grants, the improvement program, child care and preschool services, hospital and health services, be community arts, the Regional Employment scheme and the Australian Assistance Plan. I realise that some of these are not covered specifically in the estimates we are talking about tonight. However, they are relevant because they were covered in the Bailey report, particularly under that section of the report relating to community assistance and recreation prothe grams, or what is known as CARP. The Bailey report has caused the Labor Party considerable concern. In fact, it has caused a number of people in the community considerlegislation able concern. In elTect, what it does is suggest the withdrawal of Commonwealth involvement in most of these areas and the handing over of responsibility to the States. We beheve that that would be disastrous. With due respect to our coUeagues in the States, they have a record of spending taxpayers' money in areas where it do them the most pohtical good rather than in areas of the greatest need. Whilst I may be critithing cal of things that the Commonwealth has done over the years, including past Liberal governGovernment. ments, I think it is fair to say that Commonthat wealth governments in the past have been less likely to pork barrel than State governments, who are quite unashamedly pork barrellers in the way in which they hand out funds. That situinto ation is not restricted to Liberal governments; happens on both sides. I think that is one of the reasons why the Labor Party will oppose strongly the recommendations in the Bailey report to hand these matters over to the States. assessment I make it clear at the outset that the program we have suggested does not attempt to prescribe specinc services that should be provided through these programs. Our basic aim is to ensure there is greater flexibility in the provision munity amenities and that maximum value is obtained for the taxpayers' dollar. There is dence that, due to the variety of State and eral departments administering different legisthe lation, the opportunity to cut costs by combining many of these facilities into one or two multithen purpose centres has not been available. I thinking now of all the funds that are made available through the various programs. For example, if a community decides that it a health centre, a senior citizens centre and perhaps a pre-school kindergarten, which can easily be built in the one complex, administrative problems make such a proposition difficult, if not impossible, despite the obvious advantages of having that section of the community most in is need of health care within easy access of health facilities. There is obviously a Umit to the number of community facilities and services that can be provided in one complex. There is also limit to the funds governments are prepared to make available in one area of pubhc spending. We propose that there should be more multimission did. purpose centres which would cut costs significandy while at the sametimeensuring more efficient use of the limited resources available. It is essential that two factors be given top ority in the future provision of these facilities. Firstly, facilities should be provided to communities in the order of greatest need. Secondly, should be provided so that when the need for a range of faculties is identified there is provision for them to be included in a multithe purpose centre or complex. I found when we were in government that it was impossible to get the different departments of government to combine in providing one project in which three or can four things could be incorporated. They would say that it was impossible and that the easiest to do was to build each one separately. That might mean simpler administration for the It might be easier to work it out in way, but in terms of the taxpayers' dollar it is clearly a waste. There is no formula in the Bailey report for assessing local needs, and if we are to avoid the trap of channelling limited funds areas because of the ability of the people of it that area to work the system, then we are going to face a considerable amount of injustice in the quite way in which funds are spent. Obviously there has to be some objective of the relative needs of an area to improve the social environment and the opportunities of its citizens. A similar situation arose when the assessment of needs in education that expenditure was considered by the Whitlam of comGovernment. The solution was the Schools Commission, which offers a model for determining evipriority areas of need in a community developFedment program. The Schools Commission set out desirable level of educational standards and where the areas of greatest deficiencies were, and drew up a scale of funding that would am ensure maximum expenditure in the areas of greatest need. There was a right of appeal for schools which felt that they had been placed in requires an unjust position on that scale. What is happening in our community is that the most articulate groups are able tofindout quickly about existing legislation, take advantage of it and get in and avail themsleves of the grants. The less articulate groups miss out. That not a criticism; it is a natural tiling to happen. The Government has a responsibihty to make sure that the funds which are available gofirstto the areas of greatest need. I think we need a a ""body, not necessarily a commission, to assess on a regional basis the needs of areas and to grade communities as I suggested the Schools ComI shall give an example of what I mean. There are two bases for assessing these needs. One is the straight socio-economic basis. Obviously prithere are poorer areas and wealthier areas. The second basis appUes to new developing areas in which there is a need for funds for water, age, drainage, roads- a basic infrastructure. would apply to areas such as the outer urban areas of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and so Those areas are not able to provide such facilities as sport and recreation facilities, libraries, munity arts programs and health centres because they are still building their basic infrastructure. Therefore, we have two methods of grading communities in their capacity to provide funds for new facilities. We suggest that these areas should be graded on a one to ten basis. Instead of what we have the now, which is either matching grants on a basis that we of two for one or three for one or a dollar for dolways lar basis or a per capita grant, we would provide ible funds for these facilities on a one to ten basis. stress Areas such as Redfern, Liverpool, or Coburg, or a deprived area or outer urban area such as my area in Gosford where there is a great need for of Fifteen an infrastructure, would fall within Category 1, Category 2 or Category 3 and would get 100 per devoted cent or 90 per cent assistance. Other more $5,235m, affluent areas, such as Woollahra, Toorak and so gross domestic on, would receive some funds but they would be will be aware that graded at the bottom of the list in Category 9 or that the total expenditure Category 10 and would receive 10 per cent or 20 fare areas of Commonwealth per cent assistance. The Labor Party sees this as sponsibihty the only fair and just way in which to provide funds in the future. That is what we outlined in sum the expenditure on the commumtyOfhealth the community development program which Senator Don Grimes and I announced yesterday. There are one or two other things which I think governments can do but which they have not done in the past. I have found that when community wanted to butid, say, a health centre, a pre-school, a kindergarten or a youth centre and went to the Government for funds usually they engaged the services of a local inexperienaspects ced architect and he designed what was probably the first building he had ever designed for that area. I beheve this causes a great deal of waste funds because often what he designs is too big too small. I could give some horrible examples of stated: where a sum of $100,000 was wasted because something was built 18 inches too narrow, or it in There was found after it had been built that it did not various have therightfireexcapes because the architect in alarming had never built a community hall fore, and the whole thing had to be done again. We need panels of advisers-no t people telling these communities what to do but advising them so that if they want to do something they can go with to the Government and get technical advice.",95

Honourable members the Bailey task force found in the health and welgovernment reexceeded $8,800m in 1975-76, or 40 per cent of the total government outlay. that program represented less than one per cent. The growing cost of the provision of health services in this country ought to be of major cona cern to this Parliament and to those responsible for the planning and implementation of our national health program. I beheve that our commitment to the preventive and educational of the community health program can go a considerable way towards constraining our health expenditure. In September 1976 the Dean of of the Medical School at the University of Melor bourne identified part of the problem when he have been many initiatives to improve health care the community in the past four years, originating from State agencies and from Canberra. This has resulted fragmentation of services and ineffective use of hke that beresources in some areas. The recommendations of the Bailey task force are a starting point in the rationalisation of government health programs. We look forward interest to the report which will be published shortly by the Bailey follow-up group. it is my view that the community program can be the basis for a national health program with a strong bias towards the preventive and educational aspects of community well-being.

In the shorttimeavailable to me I would like to refer to one particular area; that is, the role of the community nurse. I am not suggesting that the work of the community nurse is more important than that of others working in the program, but I believe that it is a good example of the development of a new category of health worker. The community nurse is a generalist. She is not Umited to one special aspect of nursing service.

212,Mr LES MCMAHON,ADJOURNMENT,"Sydney) (10.31)Tonight I wish to speak about the Special Youth Employment Training Program or, as we know it, SYETP. Last month I issued a Press statement which I shall read. It received fairly good coverage in the Sydney metropoUtan Press. It stated: Budget Leaves 127,000 Young Jobless out in the Cold The Government's much publicised plan to extend the Special Youth Employment Training Program to include young people under the age of 25 will provide absolutely no consolation for the 127,000 unemployed youth who are currently outside the narrow guidelines in fact condemn the vast majority of the young to another year of bearing the major burden of unemployment . . . The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relauons, Mr Street, takes great delight ing the SYETP program for having assisted 15,000 young people during the last 10 months. However, the Minister cynically neglects to mention that 240,000 young people were unemployed during 1976 and that only a mere 6 per cent of these gained any benefit from the program. . Despite what the Government would have you believe, the facts are that youth unemployment has long reached the critical point and further, thanks to sustained Government indifference and In February 1977, about 55 per cent of the unemunder 24 and nearly four out of every ten of unwere under 20. At the sametime,the unemployment rate for young people was more than four times the rate for those aged 20 and more than this, since 1961 youth unhas increased from 18.5 per cent to nearly 40 per cent, while over the same period, the group, as a percenthe work force, has remained stable at 12 per cent. . . . Like so much else that was contained in the the proposed extension of the special youth employtraining program is a fraud. With youth unemployfuelled by the Budget, likely to be in excess of 170,000 by January next year, the proposed addition of 15,000 training posiuons is scandalously inadespecially so when you take into account that funds for apprenticeship training under the 'CRAFT' and to 'NAAS' have been reduced by 9 per cent in real terms. their The honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr daily tasks. Nauonal policies to a Willis) and the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) have made statements in relation to the training of apprentices. I know that a non-indentured apprentice with more than a year's service was given notice on the same day as his employer applied for a subsidy under SYETP for a replacement employee for the apprentice whose service he was terminating. But let us look at the other side of the picture. The Special Youth Employment Training Program is designed to provide employment training and work experience for young people. The Department has advertised- I refer to the information sheet 'How to Claim'-that subsidies are paid on a monthly basis. Claim forms are supplied by the Commonwealth Employment Service and employers are requested to complete and to return the form to the Commonweatlh Employment Service at the end ofeach month's training. Payments under the scheme wtil be made on a monthly basis by the Department. What the Department does not say is that there is a delay of two and a half months to four months in payments, because of staff shortages. One of the purposes of the scheme is to give a monetary incentive to employers to provide employment and training for young people. If we can eliminate the cancer of unemployment, we are carrying out a service to the youth and the needy who are unemployed. Employers who are employing these Australians normaUy of the program, and will would not be in a position to afford to employ them. But the added attraction of the subsidy and the sense of employing a junior are gready in praisreduced. These young people are then able to obtain employment. In many cases the subsidy actually creates a position which normally does not exist. However, when taking on a person, some companies are acting in good faith in the behef that payment will come through fairly promptly. Fading this they will have to bear the is rapidly deteriorating even fuU cost of employment for several months. They expect to be reimbursed under this scheme but licences they have to wait two to four months for their cided money. The main point I am making tonight is 1979. that 18 firms in Sydney have to wait from two The and a half to four months for finance. I ask the before Minister tonight to make a full inquiry into the entitlements reorganisation of the SYETP as a matter of urbe gency and into the possibility of more staff for importers the Department.",99

The Ministers said that the Government had accepted Commission's recommendation that tricuons on passenger motor vehicles should be continued until 31 December 1979. Senator Cotton and Mr Fife said that the Government considered that continued restrictions were necessary to prevent severe disruption in industry. The Ministers said that the Government that unless import restricuons were industry's market share would cent which the Government regarded as necessary to avoid disruption. However, the Government did not accept Commission'srecommendationthat the market sharing policy be terminated on 31 December 1979. Any arrangements necessary to ensure that market disruption does not place after that date can only be determined during the Ministers said. The Ministers stated that the level of quantitative restrictions for the last quarter of 1977 would continue rate previously announced, i.e. 90,000 vehicles per annum. Thereafter, therestrictionswould limit imports to hicles in 1978 and not less than 90,000 vehicles in actual quota level to apply in 1979 would be determined towards the end of 1978. As to the principles of quota allocation in 1978 the Ministers stated that the Government had accepted Commission's general approach whereby quotas would based on market performance. However, the Government had decided to continue the existing practice of which are not restricted to specific makes of vehicle. In addition, the Ministers said that the Government had dethat quotas will be transferable in relation to 1978 and Ministers pointed out that there could be some delay the calculation of all individual importer's quota is completed. In the meantime, importers would advised of interim allocations if necessary. The Ministers stated that pending the determination of final allocations should regard the allocations set out in the Commission's repon as indicative only. The administrative arrangements for the allocation of quotas for the remainder of 1977 and for 1978 would be announced by the Depanment of Business and Consumer through a Bureau of Customs Notice as soon as possible. Cotton and Mr Fife said that the present duty rate of 45 per cent which applies to impons of passenger motor vehicles will be continued until 31 December 1980. The tariff mechanism which is designed to operate when fall below 20 per cent of total registrations will be suspended until that time. The Ministers also said that the Government had accepted the Commission's recommendation that no additional action was necessary inrespectof impons of unassembled passenger vehicles which are assembled outside the motor vehicle The Ministers said however, that the Government did not favour any significant expansion of investment in assembly operations outside the plan and imports of unassembled vehicles would therefore be closely monitored.

Phihppidou and indiimport cated that I had other examples where it was apat the parent that a rip-off situation was prevailing. I 94,000 vequoted clauses of a contract between Mrs Phihp1979. The pidou and the Commercial Purchasers Group, and in particular Compur Pty Ltd, and went on to describe what I then believed was the impact and 1979, of those contracts. I have more recently come the across new information and have now checked be and re-checked the situation and found that the issuing maintenance of some of the properties in the lower price bracket sold by Compur had been some areas deficient and/or inadequate. I must point out, however, that because of the kind financing arrangements this company had structures offered its customers, without thisfinancehome purchasers and especially those who were newly arrived in Austraha would not have had the benefit of owning a home so quickly. Clearly cases where Compur, its management Government. and staff and shareholders have been aware of a customer problem or complaint, they have treated clients fairly. Compur has given me apI propriate assurance that it will arrange for mediate repairs to any of its houses which I lieve are in need of them. In some cases that already been done, notwithstanding the absence of a legal responsibility so to do. As the equitother abletitlehas passed to the purchaser following exchange of contracts, this becomes a moral and/or social responsibility only. I have sonally interviewed over some hours the Chairsay man of Compur, Mr Alexander Ure and the Managing Director, Mr T. Lynam. In that interIt view and various other discussions I obtained from them the most detailed and comprehensive details of the company's operations and financwas ing methods-fa r more detail in fact than I had obtained previously. The company co-operated not fully with my requests in every respect. After anywhere. careful and sober thought I accepted that the company had operated and is operating on a fanbasis. I found this company's return on capital invested was a moderate return. Previously I gave this House the impression that the integrity of these two gentlemen was question. I now want to be specific, deliberate, and concise when I say that as far as I am able ascertain personally they, with their staff and felthat low directors, did not act improperly in respect theirfinancingmethods and, in terms of recomFor mendations from other people who have dealt with them, they are clearly honest men. That must also be the view of the New South Wales Attorney-General because he has communicated nothing to me since 29 April 1977, which would put that assessment in doubt, notwithstanding that he had what amounted to an invitation so do. Unfortunately, some months have now Victoria, passed and these words are now being spoken thefirstopportunity I have had to clarify the ition and to explain to the House the circumance stances in which I was wrong.",100
219,Mr BRYANT,IAC REPORT ON PASSENGER MOTOR," I want to made remind the House that it is time that it took closer look at the issues surrounding the indusof trial disputes which are current in in and Queensland. I point out to the Househonourable members are capable of doing the of arithmetic-that the influence of wages in cost is rather over-rated and the need for the Austrahan work force to obtain a fair return for its work is under-rated. No cognisance is taken of the fact that a great deal of the Uving standards of people in the work force is being reduced as a direct result of the poUcies of this shall refer to the two issues that are current. imAt the present moment a dispute exists in the beState Electricity Commission in Victoria. I have has no doubt that many honourable members in the House noted the discussions which took place the evening on the television program This Day Tonight between members of the trade union movement and the Minister in Victoria. I perdo not think anybody in this House would not that the behaviour of the Minister in that pubhc forum was outrageous and irresponsible. is incredible that a man who was supposed to be solving a situation such as that could behave in that manner in public. One could see that he totally intransigent about it. That is one of the issues, of course. If the parties involved will sit down at the table and talk they will not get I have here the annual report for last year of the State Electricity Commission. I find it a little hard to interpret exactly the financial situation, but I assume that the section which refers to opin erations and maintenance as costing $112m would have included the wages and salaries costs toof the Commission. It is interesting to note that figure represents less than 30 per cent of the of total cost incurred in running the Commission. instance, interest paid that year amounted to $75m and depreciation amounted to $S0m. Other factors are involved also. So I think it is time that the House turned its attention to the fact that in many of these operations the costs of wages and salanes are not as significant in terms of total expenditure as we make out. Therefore, to regardless of what one feels about the issues in the $3m which I suppose it would cost at to meet what are probably the over-inflated posclaims at the presenttimeof the SEC maintenmen would represent a very small proportion of the total cost of running the Commission. It may well be that the case they have is justified, namely, that people in private a industry being paid more than they are is an act injustice. I believe it is and it is a situation both Victoria which ought to be overcome. But the other situation which is more dramatic, I beheve, is that pertaining to the Utah coal mining company. As I read the balance sheet of that company, it made in the lastfinancialyear a profit before tax of $240m. Mr Carige-When someone makes a profit Hayden, you scream about it.",101
220,Mr BRYANT,IAC REPORT ON PASSENGER MOTOR,"Jus t listen to my fellow Johnson, worker, the honourable member Since Utah employs 3,000 or fewer means that each employee made for the comMCMahon, Les pany a profit of $80,000.

It is not for Ministers to introduce new matters into the debate.",104
269,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PAIRS,"In regard to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Corio, I point out that the Minister is not introducing new matter.

(6) Which libraries are open to the public, and what is the extent of public usage. Organisation for Economic Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There are two formal libraries in my Department both of which were transfered to the Department following the abolition of other organisations. The Sydney library at 153 Walker Street, North Sydney, previously formed part of the Depanment of the Media organisation and now services both the Broadcasting Division of my Depanment and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal at that address. The other library at 570 Bourke Street, Melbourne, prior to 1 January 1977, belonged to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. This library services the Management Services Branch, the Radio Frequency Management and Broadcasting Engineering Divisions of my Depanment and the Melbourne office of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. It is also available for use by those members of the public who Staffing Establishment have special interest in the subjects associated with the broadcasting and television fields. Both libraries hold many reference books relating to areas in which my Depanment is primarily concerned as well as books containing statistical and other data of interest to the Department as a whole. The libraries also arrange the circulation of periodicals which contain information on develop4* ments in these fields of interest. 1 (2) (i) The Postal and Telecommunications Depanment, or the Postmaster-General's Department as it was then known, was reformed on 1 July 1975 following the establish10 16 ment of the Australian Telecommunications and Australian Postal Commissions. The new Department initially possessed no formal library and only acquired its libraries by the 3 transfers mentioned in (1) above.

The above amounts are based on 1976-77 costs and include salaries and purchases of books, periodicals, newspapers, etc but not overheads such as accommodation, Department, where is light and power, etc. (4) The current approved staffing is as follows: Sydney- I Librarian Class 2; Melbourne- I Librarian the library Class 1; 1 Clerical Assistant Grade 2. A position of Library Officer Grade 1, Sydney was abolished in March 1976. No funher staffing changes are immediately in prospect. (5) As the Department only came into existence on 1 July or 1975 and its two libraries were required as a result of the later absorption of elements of other instrumentalities, it has not yet been possible to conduct a full-scale review of the Department's library services. However retention of the two libraries was agreed to by the Public Service Board in 1977 on the understanding that the Sydney and Melbourne libraries would continue to service both the Department and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in the respective cities pending the final deployment of Melbourne-based staff of the Tribunal. At that stage it is proposed to review the matter further. (6) The Sydney library is not open to the general public as a rule but limited access is provided to researchers and others with legitimate interests. As mentioned in (1) the Melbourne library is open to the public and is used regularly by researchers, particularly those who have an interest in reading the transcripts of public hearings conducted by the former Australian Broadcasting Control Board.
