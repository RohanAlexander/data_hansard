2,Dr EMERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (9.01 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Introduction The Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 will give effect to two important reforms to strengthen and clarify our competition and consumer laws. The bill will implement the government's election commitment to enact laws to deal with creeping acquisitions by amending section 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The amendments will give greater clarity to the provisions regulating acquisitions. They will ensure the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the courts have the power to reject acquisitions that would substantially lessen competition in any local, regional or national market. The bill also enhances and simplifies the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. The unconscionable conduct amendments are central to the implementation of uniform consumer laws throughout Australia. They were agreed and endorsed by my state and territory colleagues on the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs at our meeting in Perth on 30 April 2010. These amendments will ensure that the BILL 2010 courts will have a clear message about the way in which parliament intends the law to apply. They will place the ACCC and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in a better position to take more effective enforcement action. Creeping Acquisitions There has been a long standing concern in the community about creeping acquisitions, mainly in the context of supermarket acquisitions. Creeping acquisitions are a series of small-scale acquisitions that, individually, do not substantially lessen competition in a market, but collectively may do so over time. Most recently, concerns about creeping acquisitions were raised in the lead-up to and following the release in July 2008 of the ACCC's report of the inquiry into the competitiveness of retail prices for standard groceries. In its report, the ACCC expressed its support for the introduction of a general creeping acquisitions law. Subsequently the government undertook extensive public consultations in 2008 and 2009 to seek the community's views on possible reform options. Through its consultations, the government identified two amendments which would clarify the operation of section 50 as it is currently interpreted by the ACCC, as set out in its November 2008 publication, Merger Guidelines. The first amendment in the bill is to subsection 50(6) of the Trade Practices Act which has the effect of limiting the scope of section 50 to acquisitions in markets that are ‘substantial' in a state or territory or region of Australia. The amendment to this subsection will provide greater certainty regarding the current practice of the ACCC of considering acquisitions in local markets. The Merger Guidelines state that the ‘substantiality critenesses rion' can be satisfied in many ways, including by the number of customers, total sales or the geographical size of the market. The Merger Guidelines do not have the force of law. While the interpretation of the ACCC of subsection 50(6) has not been tested by the courts, it was considered by Justice French in his 2003 decision in the Federal Court in the case of AGL and the ACCC. While expressing no conclusive view, his Honour left open the possibility that whether a market is considered ‘substantial' under subsection 50(6) may be determined with reference to Australia as a whole. If this view were to become established in law through the accumulated weight of legal precedent over time, then it could well preclude acquisitions in geographically confined markets from being considered under section 50. This would prevent the application of section 50 to local markets where creeping acquisitions have been identified as a concern. The bill therefore deletes the word ‘substantial' from subsection 50(6). This removes the risk highlighted by Justice French that a court could in the future adopt the view that acquisitions in geographically confined markets may not be considered substantial and therefore not fall within the scope of section 50. The government's amendment to section 50 will remove that possibility, allowing the ACCC or a court to continue to examine acquisitions in all markets, including in relatively small, local markets. The bill will also amend section 50 of the Trade Practices Act to replace references to ‘a market' with references to ‘any market'. This amendment will clarify the ability of the ACCC or a court to consider multiple markets when assessing mergers. The amendment will clarify that busicannot challenge a decision to block a proposed acquisition on the grounds that the substantial lessening of competition identified was in one or more markets other than the primary market in which the acquisition would occur. The ACCC and the courts will be able to consider the totality of the competitive effects resulting from an acquisition, including impacts in upstream and downstream markets, not just impacts in ‘a market'. Together, these amendments will strengthen the acquisitions provisions of the Trade Practices Act under section 50 by clarifying the scope of the law and increasing certainty around its application to markets where creeping acquisitions have been a concern. In addition to these amendments, when announcing the way it would respond to concerns about creeping acquisitions, the government also confirmed the power of the ACCC to act in relation to the acquisition of greenfields sites. The ACCC already considers it has the power to review acquisitions of greenfield sites whether through purchase or lease. However, if the ACCC is challenged on this in the future, the government has stated it will not hesitate to confirm this power. The government has responded to community concerns regarding creeping acquisitions by targeting specific problems with specific remedies rather than responding with general remedies that could have unintended consequences for overall economic activity and employment. Unconscionable conduct The amendments the bill will make to the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act are the product of a recommendation of the Senate economics committee, which inquired into the statutory definition of unconscionable conduct in 2009. The Senate economics committee recommended that the government set up an inquiry process to determine whether examples or a statement of principles would enhance the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act. On 5 November 2009, I convened an expert panel. Professor Bryan Horrigan, Mr Ray Steinwall and Mr David Lieberman-all of them experts in trade practices law and distinguished in their professional fieldsagreed to serve on the panel to consider the issues raised in the Senate economics committee inquiry. The panel members applied their considerable knowledge and experience to provide me with their final report earlier this year. The government is grateful for their workwhich included many hours on top of their already busy schedules-and the obvious enthusiasm they brought to this task. In its work, the panel was ably assisted by officials from the Treasury and the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. The government is also grateful to those who made submissions to both the Senate committee and to the expert panel. This helped to ensure the range of perspectives that exist in relation to this issue were underability stood. The expert panel found that the unconscionable conduct provisions have been regularly enforced since their inception, and that the case law is still developing. Having said that, the panel also noted that the provisions are not easily understood and could be clearer for businesses, consumers, enforcement agencies and the courts. However, the panel found that a list of examples of unconscionable conduct would not be helpful. Indeed, the panel said such a list might give rise to misguided expectations about the scope and application of the law to specific factual scenarios. Instead it recommended that the inclusion of some interpretative principles in the Trade Practices Act would assist. The government has adopted all of the panel's recommendations concerning unconscionable conduct, including the introduction of interpretive principles. The first principle will deal with concerns that the practical application of the equitable concept of unconscionable conduct is too narrow when applied to business and consumer relationships. Courts have tended to stick closely to the traditional equitable concept when applying the statutory prohibitions in sections 51AB and 51AC of the Trade Practices Act and sections 12CB and 12CC of the ASIC Act. For example, the common law required victims of unconscionable conduct to establish that they were at a ‘special disadvantage' through factors like infirmity, age or a difficulty understanding English, before a court would recognise that unconscionable conduct had occurred. The present statutory prohibitions on unconscionable conduct sought to remove limitations such as these on the of people to seek redress when subjected to unconscionable conduct. The bill amends the law to make it clear that the prohibition is not limited to the equitable or common-law doctrines of unconscionable conduct. The courts should not limit the application of the provisions by reference to ancient common-law doctrines that are not part of the statute book. The second interpretative principle will clarify that courts can examine the terms and the manner and extent to which the contract is carried out. This principle makes it clear that unconscionable conduct is not limited to the bargaining practices leading to the formation of a contract. Unconscionable conduct can also be apparent in the way in which a party exercises its rights under a contract in which a party behaves once a contract is made. It can also apply to the way in which contracts are renewed, renegotiated or terminated. This interpretative principle will ensure that any unconscionable conduct-not just that occurring before contracts are made-is subject to the full force of the law. The final interpretative principle to troduced by the bill is that the prohibition unconscionable conduct applies to systemic conduct or patterns of behaviour and that there is no need to identify a person at advantage in order to attract the prohibition. Unconscionable conduct is not limited to individual transactions or events. A pattern systematic conduct or patterns of behaviour occurring over a period of time-which might include an accumulation of minor incidents-can also amount to unconscionable conduct. This interpretative principle ensures that conduct, rather than individual transactions or events, is the focus of the provisions. Further, as the focus is on the conduct rather than the victim, this principle reinforces the point being made clear in the first interpretive principle that there is no need identify a person who is at a disadvantage in order to enforce the prohibition. Other amendments The bill will also remove the potentially confusing distinction in the existing provisions between unconscionable conduct that affects businesses and that which affects consumers. It combines the existing sections 51AB and 51AC of the Trade Practices Act and sections 12CB and 12CC of the ASIC Act into one section and rationalises their drafting to apply a single set of factors for the or in the way court to consider. This amendment will eliminate the potential that the concept of unconscionable conduct in the two existing provisions could diverge, through a false assumption that the existence of two provisions signals a distinction which does not in fact exist. Any divergence would confuse things further, and the distinction should be removed before any be insuch notion develops. The amendments will on also ensure that a single, cogent body of legal precedent can develop around the statutory concept of unconscionable conduct as it a disapplies to both consumers and businesses. The unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act will form part of the of Australian Consumer Law once the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill (No. 2) is passed by the parliament. The application of the Australian Consumer Law as a law of the Commonwealth and of the states and the territories presents many advantages, one of which is that it can be enforced by courts at all levels in a consistent fashion. In some states and territories the courts, including lower courts and tribunals, will be to applying the prohibition on unconscionable conduct for the first time. Providing clarity in the interpretation of these provisions will do much to ensure the consistent application of the new national consumer law across Australia. I can also inform the House that the Ministerial Council for Corporations was consulted in relation to the amendments to the laws in the national corporate regulation scheme, namely the amendments to the ASIC Act, and has approved them as required under the Corporations Agreement. Conclusion Together the amendments contained in this bill will bring greater clarity and certainty to the application of key provisions of our competition and consumer laws. The amendments to section 50 will ensure that the ACCC and the courts can assess the totality of the competitive effects associated with acquisitions which occur in geographically confined, local markets. The amendments to the unconscionable conduct provisions will ensure there is a much clearer understanding of the conduct with which these provisions have always been intended to deal. The amendments will protect Australian small businesses, but without creating market distortions which would only reduce their competitiveness and their resilience. The amendments will protect consumers by ensuring that competition is protected and fostered. They will strengthen the prohibition against conduct that is designed to stifle competition through the imperceptible development of market dominance or through unacceptable and unethical business conduct. All Australians prosper when there are competitive markets. These amendments will ensure that competition can be more effectively promoted and conduct designed to undermine it is stopped. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Billson) adjourned. NA Public Works Committee Approval of Work",17
3,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (9.15 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Fit-out of new leased premises for the Australian Taxation Office at 735 Collins Street, Melbourne, Victoria. The Australian Taxation Office proposes to undertake an integrated fit-out of new leased premises in the Melbourne CBD, at an estimated out-turn cost of $50.88 million, exclusive of GST. The new premises will replace the ATO's existing five leases in the Melbourne CBD. The leases for four of these properties will expire in 2012, with the remaining lease due to expire in 2017. It is expected that the co-location into a single new building will provide the ATO with considerable advantages in terms of building design, performance and long-term viability and maintenance. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed integrated fit-out works are scheduled to start in December 2010 and be completed by 30 March 2012. The developer has initiated work on site, with excavation and pier drilling of the basement areas. Ground works will begin in May this year. The ATO is expected to take up occupancy of the building in April 2012. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Reference",21
4,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (9.18 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Proposed development and construction of housing for the Department of Defence at Largs North (Bayriver), Port Adelaide, South Australia. Defence Housing Australia proposes to develop an 8.8 hectare site at Largs North in Port Adelaide. The site is owned by the Land Management Corporation of South Australia, which has invited DHA to undertake the development on its behalf. The proposal will provide an additional 35 homes for Australian Defence Force personnel and their families posted to RAAF Base Edinburgh, Keswick Barracks and, in the future, the nearby Australian Submarine Corporation facilities at Osborne, where the Air Warfare Destroyer project will be based. Known as Bayriver, the site will be subdivided into 123 lots capable of accommodating a total of 185 dwellings, mostly detached homes but also some medium-density terrace style houses. The lots not required for defence will be sold to the general public, creating a mixed civilian and defence community and reducing DHA's net outlay. Bayriver is part of a major effort to construct housing for families moving to Adelaide in connection with the relocation of the 7th Battalion from Darwin. It will also replace houses that are reaching end of lease or that do not satisfy updated defence housing standards. In this regard, community standard housing is important to attracting and retaining the right people in the ADF. On a personal note, may I welcome back the ‘pig battalion' to the family of stand-alone units in the Royal Australian Regiment. The site is 25 kilometres from RAAF Base Edinburgh and 18 kilometres from the Adelaide city centre. It is only minutes from the Australian Submarine Corporation facilithe ties at Osborne and is very well serviced by social infrastructure. Only minutes from the beach, Bayriver will deliver an excellent lifestyle opportunity for defence families. The development of the site and the construction of 35 houses will be managed by DHA and delivered through a number of contractors. Housing will accord with DHA's national performance and design specifications. The total out-turn cost of the proposal is estimated at $37 million, inclusive of GST and land acquisition, with the net costs reduced through the sales of surplus lots. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in April 2011 and housing construction in November 2011. Housing construction will be complete in November 2012. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. NA (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2010 Cognate bills: NA (ELECTRICITY) (CHARGE) AMENDMENT BILL 2010 NA (ELECTRICITY) (SMALL-SCALE NA CHARGE) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 May, on motion by Mr Gray: That this bill be now read a second time.",22
5,Ms HALL,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,"The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010 and cognate bills enshrine in legislation the changes to the Renewable Energy Target Scheme that will take effect from January 2011. This is landmark legislation. This very important legislation recognises the importance of Australia reducing its carbon footprint. This legislation will also make the Renewable Energy Target Scheme work a lot better. The legislation will divide the existing scheme into two parts: the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme, the SRES, and the large-scale renewable energy target, the LRET. Mr Speaker, it is a pleasure to be making this speech while you are in the chair. I do make quite a few speeches in the other House. The new LRET and the SRES combined are expected to deliver more renewable energy than the existing 45,000gigawatt-hour target in 2020. The degree to which this 20 per cent target is exceeded will depend on the uptake of the small-scale technologies by households, small businesses and community groups. Within the Shortland electorate there has been great enthusiasm from these groups in their desire to take up energy efficient technologies and renewable energy. The people of the Shortland electorate are really keen to link into this scheme. At a meeting recently in my electorate a number of people were discussing solar panels. They were saying they were thinking of installing them on their houses. They could see this would not only benefit our environment but also lead to them having to pay less for their electricity. It is a win-win situation. The LRET portion of the target will be increased to ensure the 20 per cent by 2020 target is still met if the uptake of small-scale technologies is lower than anticipated. But, as I have already stated, I think it may end up being higher than anticipated, particularly in my area. Under the existing Solar Credits initiative, the new fixed price of $40 per REC will see an average house in Shortland that installs a 1.5 kilowatt solar panel system in 2011 benefit from an upfront subsidy of $6,200 through the RECs. That is quite an incentive. There is also the added bonus of receiving cheaper electricity. The number of systems receiving support under the SRES will be uncapped to ensure small-scale installers have certainty. A problem with the previous scheme was that it was capped. There was no certainty and that did cause a problem for some people. The purpose of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010 is, as I have already stated, to separate the large scale renewable energy target and the Smallscale Renewable Energy Scheme. The changes will provide greater certainty for large-scale renewable energy projects and installers of small-scale renewable energy systems. The enhanced scheme will further strengthen the government's commitment that the equivalent of at least 20 per cent of Australia's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2020. As I have already stated, I think it will be greater than 20 per cent. That is testimony of the government's commitment to bring about change. It is committed to renewable energy and lowering our carbon footprint. This scheme will benefit all Australians. We need to protect and look after our environment and this is one way of ensuring that that happens. I would quickly like to touch on some of the initiatives that have been taken locally in the region I come from. The CSIRO Energy Centre in Newcastle has set a new benchmark in ecologically sustainable design by showcasing energy generation initiatives, building demand reduction and supply options. It is a focal point in Australia for ergy research in the fields of sustainable energy, environmental impacts, and costcompetitive and environmentally-acceptable fossil fuel research. It has undertaken a lot research. The work it has done has been groundbreaking. The government has supported the Energy Centre's work. In addition to that, in the Shortland electorate Delta Electricity has two power stations: one at Mannering Park and one at Lake Munmorah. The Lake Munmorah power station is very outdated and needs to be upgraded. A project is taking place to introduce gas-fired facilities, which will be used in times of high demand. The old technology will be replaced with new technology. Delta is working towards improving its impact on the environment. Delta Electricity is an electricity supplier that is mindful of the need to look at lower emissions and a sustainable future for generating electricity. It is looking its electricity portfolio and is reflecting community and government expectations in changing its technology and working with the community and governments to lower emissions. It is looking at sustainable energy generation, at minimising the impact of existing coal fired plants and investing in the latest technologies and working with governments. It is investing in low-emission, renewable energy generation and developing new low-emissions energy technologies such as carbon capture. So Delta have indicated to me on a number of occasions that they are very mindful of the need to change. They are very mindful of the desire of governments to lower carbon emissions and, as such, they are introducing technologies to address this need. They meet with the state member and me on a regular basis to keep us informed of the changes that are taking place within their organisation, both locally and throughout the state. The member for Swansea and I both en- encourage Delta Electricity to continue to look at cutting-edge technologies and new ways of generating energy. Slipping back to the renewable energy of targets issue, that is part of a suite of government policies to encourage people to switch to cleaner energy to complement the renewable energy target. The government is making significant investment in the generation of renewables through the $4.5 billion Clean Energy Initiative. The initiative includes: the $1.5 Solar Flagships program to support the construction of large-scale gridconnected solar power stations operating in the market; the Australian Solar Institute, which will help to retain Australian solar expertise and develop the next generation of Australian solar researchers; and the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency estimates that the RET will add less than $4 per year to the average household at diversifying electricity bill. I remind members and those people who are listening to this debate that people can now elect to receive 100 per cent, or a lower percentage, of their electricity from renewable sources by discussing this with their provider of electricity. That is something that I do. I have elected to receive part of my electricity from a renewable source and I would encourage other members to do so. A discussion paper was published in March 2010 which looks at enhancing the renewable energy targets. It examines all the issues that are in this legislation and, again, I would suggest that people have a look at that discussion paper. The submissions closed in April and we do have the legislation before the parliament at the moment. There is a lot of information out there for people to read to enable them to understand the reasoning behind this legislation. I would encourage smaller consumers and community groups to utilise the benefits of this legislation through the SRES when it comes into force. It makes a considerable contribution towards the cost of installing solar panels. I would encourage schools to use the scheme that is available for them to have solar panels installed and I would encourage businesses to look at the initiatives that are available for them to transfer to and use the rebate schemes that are available. The one available for schools is the National Solar School Program. It offers schools $50,000 in solar power grants and up to $100,000 if it is a dual campus school. They are a couple of examples of the types of initiatives out there. I would encourage all Australians to embrace the spirit of this legislation. I urge larger companies and organisations to use the LRET, and community groups, individuals and schools to link into the SRES. I commend the legislation to the House.",23
6,Mr WINDSOR,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,"I know that the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2010 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Small-scale Technology Shortfall Charge) Bill 2010 are going to proceed through the parliament with the support of both sides of parliament, but there are a number of issues that really do need to be considered in a clearer light, and I know that the member for Lyne will be raising some of those concerns in his speech. There is concern in the community that the small people may well be brushed over in relation to issues such as the feed-in tariff arrangements that have been put in place in some of the states. Here again we see probably the hallmark of the last decade of this parliament-and other parliaments-in relation to renewable energy policy generally. It has sent so many mixed messages to consumers that consumers really do not know what the policy is. They get the buzzwords and hear about the percentages of renewable energy. They feel good about that. They look at the fine print of the policy and they become confused. They see changes in the policy, as we have recently seen in the insulation arrangements. They see variations between policy direction at the state level and the federal level. They see competition going on between some of the various energy providers, not necessarily on price but to make it look as though various business entities are more in line with a sustainable and renewable future. They see the changes in relation to Green Loans, for instance. They see a myriad of changes. The most recent change is that the government has removed itself from the building in terms of its emissions trading scheme. People quite understandably are confused. A lot of people are quite happy that the government has changed its policies, but a lot of other people are very confused as to what these messages are. These bills before the House were actually designed to plug into a broader scheme, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Now that is not happening, and we still have these bills. On the surface, they are feelgood bills. The words sound appropriate. The words from John Howard a decade ago, in 2001, when he put in place renewable energy targets, were appropriate at the time. The people in voter land listened and received the message that the government was serious about renewable energy and had put in place targets. But the putting in place of a target does not necessarily deliver anything. Many, particularly those in the coalition, would or should remember that the renewable energy target for biofuels back in 2001 was 360,000 megalitres. There is less biofuel in Australia now than before the Howard government put the target in. There is nowhere near 360,000 megalitres. So we had this feelgood announcement and a number of initiatives and grants-some of which were rorted and some of which were politically motivated in terms of where they went in the various electorates-rolled out through those coalition years. Nothing happened. Absolutely nothing happened in terms of promoting renewable energy, in that case biofuels, either biofuels as a value-add to an existing process or first or second generation biofuels that could have assisted agriculture. Then along comes climate change, a great concern. ‘What can we do to maintain sustainability at a range of levels? What about renewable energy? That might help. Let's develop a policy that makes it look as though we're actually doing something about renewable energy.' The member for Braddon, a man that I have many disagreements with in this House",25
7,Mr WINDSOR,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,"I notice his close colleague the member for Moreton is in the building. He may well report to the member for Braddon that he has been verballed in the parliament. But the member for Braddon made one of his better speeches yesterday, I thought. Mr Oakeshott-That was easy! ",26
8,Mr WINDSOR,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,"Yes, it was not difficult to have one of his better speeches delivered. I am sure he is listening. He made the point that, irrespective of who has been in government, this parliament has not delivered any certainty in any fashion in the signals that consumers receive. In the recent budget, the government announced something like $600 million for a Renewable Energy Future Fund. The coalition is going to remove that fund. On the surface of it, we might say that it is a great idea to have a Renewable Energy Future Fund to put in some money to encourage industries to start up et cetera, because there is concern about where we are going in relation to solar, wind, geothermal, biofuels and so on. But in the same budget there is a tax on biofuels, a renewable energy. I think it starts to ratchet up in 2012, although I may be corrected on that. So what is the message? Why are we starting up a Renewable Energy Future Fund to encourage renewable energy and then, a couple of pages further on in the document, actually imposing a fossil fuel tax on a renewable fuel? It is no wonder that people are getting confused. It is becoming a bit like the superannuation debate, where originally it was a good idea for people to save for their retirement, then someone said, ‘There's a lot of money in there; we could get some tax,' and then the government said, ‘Okay, let's tax it.' So we taxed it twice and then we taxed it three times. I think it is back to twice now. But the message the consumers took was: ‘Why are we saving for our retirement if we are only saving to have the money taken away before we retire?' Anybody that has been looking at the various superannuation funds in recent years, particularly through the financial collapse, would have to ask the question: ‘What have we been doing? What is the policy message in all of this?' Now we have the new resource rent tax. I do not disagree with a resource rent tax. I think it is a much fairer way of receiving a share of our resources than a royalty, which takes money before any profit is made. I have some issues with the entry point. I think the long-term bond rate is too low. The government should have a very close look at that, even if it means that the total revenue stream drops off. There are some very real issues with having an entry point at the long term bond rate. I am encouraged that there are discussions taking place on that issue. I would encourage the various industries themselves, the miners, to take up the challenge that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have issued that they are serious about negotiations and consultations with various industries. I think dealing with the Minerals Council is dealing just with politics. I think we really need to get down to the nub of this-what it actually means for real businesses in different structural circumstances, in different company structures and at different levels of development. We need to see what this, in a sense, blanket tax actually means to those various companies. So I encourage the companies. There was an issue raised yesterday-I think it was from Queensland-concerning an aglime mine. Those people sent me an email as well. In reading their email",26
9,Mr WINDSOR,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,"The member for Moreton might like to talk about this in his delivbut ery, because he probably knows more about it than I do. It seems to me that the government should have a very close look at their circumstances, because they are dealing not only with a product that they have dug up out of the ground and sent overseas with no value adding taking place but with a product that goes into a lot of domestic businesses, including agriculture, soil conditioning and a whole range of other things. If we are serious about sustainability, we have to make sure that some of these policies are sending the right signal. Here again, on the margin of the resource rent taxation issue, we see an area where that signal could become very blurred and it actually impacts on things that other aspects of policy ing to encourage. So I suggest that the miners themselves take up the option of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister and get into those one-on-one discussions about how the tax is going to impact on their company structures and the long-term profitability of their companies. As I said, I think the member for Braddon made a very important point yesterday. I would agree with him that, for the last decade, we have talked about renewable energy and done very little. We have these confused messages out there-and the member for Lyne will talk about some of those-with the various state and Commonwealth arrangements. This is a Commonwealth arrangement. Essentially it was to have been piggybacked on to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme; nonetheless, it is here now. Again there are some blurred areas, including what it is going to mean for consumers, households and, particularly, the smaller end of the market where the real field for renewable energy is. People want to be involved in doing things better. They want to be encouraged, they want policy that does not penalise them when they get there. The Leader of the National Party made a very significant point the other day on the issue of natural gas, I think it was. The issue is similar to the ethanol issue that I just raised. Why did we encourage people to go into LPG cars et cetera and then penalise them when they did? Why do we do this? What was the point of doing it in the first place if not to trap them? I am not suggesting that liquid petroleum gas is a renewable fuel, but it is a better fuel in terms of emissions et cetera than some of the other fossil fuels that we have been using. We constantly get these mixed messages. There are some good things happening in Australia. I do not think these things are beare trying encouraged enough. The member for Moreton may well talk about some of the things that are happening. I know the member for Dawson raises the issue of cogeneration in sugar mills. The only reason we have a sugar industry now is renewable energy. The Brazilians removed themselves from the world market, in a sense, for sugar as a food product. They then moved back into producing energy from that food product, the sugar-producing bagasse and other things from the residues and then producing renewable energy at source. That is starting to pen along the Queensland coast and we should be encouraging that. We should be really encouraging those sorts of activities. Not only do they add value to an agricultural pursuit but they are renewable energy sources. You open up the areas where that particular primary industry exists. I do not have any sugar cane in my electorate, but I think it is an important area that we should be looking at-food production, renewable energy production and electricity production as well as molasses and other activities. It becomes a much more important and significant industry than that of just growing a plant and shipping the sugar as food to someone else overseas. The member for Parkes would know the small town of Ashford in my electorate. Some years ago it relied very heavily on tobacco and, then, on a coalmine and a relatively small power plant which closed down. The town has been searching for activities that it can lend itself to. In recent years they have been trialling industrial hemp. The member for Lyne might remember from a previous lifetime that, in the New South Wales parliament, I was instrumental in introducing what was essentially a legalisation, a licensing, of industrial hemp, excluding high-THC-dope-smoking hemp-to be grown as a product. That industry has not gone far. There are a number of people that are actually looking at it in Ashford as we speak. Only the other day the Inverell Shire Council passed a motion to look at promoting what the small community group in Ashford is trying to achieve. That group had trials last year. They have established a small market. They need assistance to try and grow the business and find out where the pitfalls are. They have the ingredients: the water, the land and the expertise and capacity to farm that land. They are asking for some degree of help. I hap- will be very supportive of that, because we never know where that goes. Industrial hemp, for instance, is a sustainable product. Cars used to be built out of industrial hemp rather than out of the materials they are constructed from now. Industrial hemp has been used for a whole range of things, not just for ropes, tarpaulins and various clothing products. You can make furniture out of industrial hemp. It is a renewable product. We should be looking at and encouraging these sorts of people. I do not think the bills we are looking at today actually encourage the little people to motivate themselves too much. In fact, if you relate these bills to what is happening at the state level, they may in fact be counterproductive for the little people trying to make their contribution to a sustainable future. Mr Acting Speaker",27
10,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,It is Deputy Speaker.,28
11,Mr WINDSOR,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,Mr Deputy Speaker. I do apologise. I recognise that it is of significant,28
12,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,I do thank you for the promotion!,28
13,Mr WINDSOR,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,"I know it is of significant difference to you, as I have had past indiscretions. Mr Deputy Speaker, I was involved last year in a study tour to Europe and we looked at renewable energy sources, specifically in relation to climate change. I still cannot get over the enthusiasm of the researchers in those various countries. The researchers at the Scottish Crop Research Institute at Dundee were incredible in their enthusiasm for looking at various renewable futures. As I have mentioned in this place on a number of occasions, the European cropping systems are based on baling the stubble, because they have a narrow window of opportunity to plant the next crop. Currently, they bale the stubble and use it as bedding for animals or whatever else. Rather than just stop there, Scottish are developing enzymes that will create biofuels from that biomass. In Copenhagen, for instance, I went to an electricitygenerating plant that was fed by pure waste. The garbage trucks go out of a morning, pick up the rubbish, bring it back, dump it in these massive incinerators-and there are two of those-and create enough energy for half a million people in Copenhagen. That is yesterday's fish and chips creating tomorrow's power. There is nothing else involved. A by-product of that is central heating for people's homes and businesses. There is an enormous amount that can be done. The member for Braddon made that point. None of us-no party-has done anything other than touch the dictionary and touch the surface on renewable energy. I hope that, if we are serious about renewable energy this time, we will actually start to do something and allow the people on the ground to be partners in doing those things. Whether that is in terms of the farm sector and carbon in the soil, value adding through biomass to renewable fuels, solar, wind, geothermal or using the number of incentives put in place by these bills, we have to make sure that we start to go down that road rather than be trapped at a locked gate.  rise to speak in support of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010 and related bills. I want to thank the member for New England for his contribution and say particularly that it is always good to see him go on the record praising the member for Braddon. I will make sure I pass that on to the member for Braddon, because he would be surprised to hear that occasionally there are slights raised from unnamed sources! I thank him for his contribution. I want to start by going on the record to make sure that people understand the fundamental premise that I bring to this speech: the that climate change is real. The second premise I bring is that acting later will cost far more than acting now. The other premise that I bring to this speech is that I am not any more valuable than a person in future generations. I have exactly the same value and they have the same value as me. Therefore, I need to consider their lives and their future in the things that I or we do now. They are the three premises with which I start this speech. The Rudd Labor government are committed to real action on climate change. Late last year, we had our efforts to introduce the CPRS torpedoed by the Nationals, by the Greens, by Steve Fielding, by Nick Xenophon and by most Liberals in the Senate. Nevertheless, we will continue to transition our economy to a low-carbon future. If you want to know which party will take action on climate change, you just have to look at the votes on the CPRS in the Senate. The Nationals did not vote for it, the Greens did not vote for it and most Liberals did not vote for it. Only Labor senators and two dissenting Liberal Party senators did. The courageous Senator Boyce from Queensland and Senator Judith Troeth from Victoria voted with their convictions and had the courage to say that they were of the same value as future generations and they were prepared to make a decision. They did that even though it was harmful on the day when Tony Abbott won the coalition leadership on an anti-climate change ticket.",28
14,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,"The honourable member for Moreton ought to know that he should refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his title, not by his name.  the Leader of the Opposition, won the leadership",29
15,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,"The member for Warringah.  old Rugby League background! The irony is that, if the Greens had given their support to the Rudd government's CPRS in the Senate, we would have had a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme ready to commence from 1 July 2011. The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the minister for climate change, Penny Wong, would have taken this starting point to the climate change conference in Copenhagen. Who knows what might have flowed from that if we had gone to the world and said we, one of the biggest per capita emitters in the world, have a starting point and a platform. Who knows what could have transpired. Copenhagen did bring some positive outcomes and that should be recognised rather than seeing it as the member for Warringah does. However, it was not humanity's finest hour that is for sure. That did not happen last year. Instead, the future. Greens senators chose to play a strategic and self-serving political game along with the National and the Liberal senators. Not only did they sell out the environment in a big way, they sold out their supporters, who had trusted the Greens to stick up for the environment. It is only the Labor Party who is standing up for the environment and for the future of this planet. As we face up to the realities of a less-than-receptive Senate, the Rudd Labor government is more determined than ever to do what we can now to tackle climate change. As I said, the fundamental premise we start with is that to act late will cost more than acting now. That is why every dollar from the deferral of the CPRS is being invested in renewable energy. The beauty of renewable energy is that it is generated from unlimited sources, as is the case with wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and hydro. Our planet produces these resources naturally. For the most part, renewable energy is also clean energy, producing little or no greenhouse gases or toxic waste. In a carbon constrained future we will need renewable energy technologies to provide low-cost emission-free baseload energy. Australia's geology, climate resources, expertise and skilled workforce have us ideally placed to develop renewable energies like geothermal, solar and wind. Unfortunately, Queensland is not as blessed as some of the other states when it comes to wind. As technology improves, renewable energy is becoming more cost effective and efficient and, as I said, it can provide baseload power. The more we can rely on renewable energies, the more we can reduce our overall greenhouse gas emissions. The more certainty we can provide for the renewables sector, the more investment we will see to drive innovation and the development of new technologies. It will also make green jobs the boom of the The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010 will deliver greater certainty to the renewable energy sector, both large-scale projects and small-scale installers. It does so by separating the Renewable Energy Target Scheme into two partsthe large-scale renewable energy target and the Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme-from 1 January 2011. This will help ensure Australia meets its 20 per cent renewable energy target by 2020. In fact, with the increasing uptake of renewable energies from households, small businesses and community groups, and with the changes in this bill, we can expect to exceed the 20 per cent target by 2020-45,000 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy by 2020. That 45,000 gigawatt hours number just rolls off the tongue and I will come to what a gigwatt is in a minute. 45,000 gigawatt hours would be the equivalent of using the same hairdryer continuously for 2.5 million years. That is what we are going to remove from the system. It is a lot of hair drying obviously-2.5 million years with the one hairdryer. Not only are we providing incentives for large-scale renewable energy producers, we are also giving Australian households the tools to do their bit to conserve energy and switch to renewables. This bill reduces the annual targets under the large-scale renewable energy target by 4,000 gigwatt hours, with the shortfall to be generated under the Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme. Now what is a gigawatt? For the edification of students who are not scientists, the most basic energy unit is a joule. Lifting a pen about metre in the air would require one joule of energy. A watt is the work done by one joule every second. So lifting the pen one metre in the air in one second would be working at the rate of one watt. People understand watts because we can talk about the old 40-watt or 60-watt light bulbs. As we have the minister for the environment here, he would be thinking of an 11-watt fluoro downlight rather than a 60-watt light bulb from days gone by. A fluoro downlight is about 11 watts and when we talk about a gigwatt we are talking about 90,909,090 fluoro downlights, to break it into understandable terms. The new SRES will support installers of small-scale systems like solar panels and solar water heaters. It will create a new small-scale technology certificate priced at the fixed amount of $40. This means a householder installing a 1.5 kilowatt solar system would receive certificates worth about $6,000. A 1.5 kilowatt system is about a one metre by 1.5 metre solar panel on your roof, or maybe even slightly smaller. It is not back much at all and most roofs could fit one. The Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator will be required to estimate the number of STCs expected to be created each year to maximise certainty for liable entities. The annual targets will be adjusted each year to account for the actual number of smallscale technology certificates created in the previous year. Existing bank renewable energy certificates will only be eligible for use in the large-scale renewable energy target. Therefore installers from small-scale technologies will be required to surrender RECs at $40 each. This bill reflects the Rudd Labor government's commitment to a greener future. In addition to the renewable energy target, the government is also investing in generationscale renewables through the $5.1 billion Clean Energy Initiative, including the Solar Flagships program, to support the construction of large-scale grid connected solar power stations. The Rudd Labor government remains committed to developing a sustainable solution to climate change for Australia and our region over the long term. This bill is another stop along the way. I commend the bill to the House.",30
16,Mr OAKESHOTT,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,"Lyne) (10.06 am)Whilst I am a massive supporter of seeing greater engagement in alternative energy options to both secure and make more affordable our energy supply for the future, I do have some significant reservations about the implications of this move for small schemes and the development of a small renewable energy scheme. There are implications of that on households and on the culture of ownership in both supply and demand management in regard to our future energy, environmental and economic needs of this country. Whilst I fully recognise that the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010 and cognate bills will proceed through the parliament there are many aspects that are to be supported and lauded. Increasing investment security in large-scale investment is something to be endorsed. I have enough reservations at this time not to support this legislation because of the increased exposure that small households will have as a consequence. And there is the contextual question on what is the full package from government for these economic and environmental questions of our time. I am uncomfortable supporting just one part of a package which 12 months ago I was being told had to be linked to a CPRS scheme from government. They were intimately entwined and there was no way possible that they could be broken. Yet now the proponents of that message, who only 12 months ago were saying this was all part of the one package, now say to me, ‘Oh no, it is fine to split them. We will push through the renewable energy certificates; the splitting the large and the small. It is nothing to do with CPRS; nothing to do with emissions trading schemes. Don't you worry about that.' I am therefore uncomfortable sitting on this very wild train ride through environmental and economic policy when it comes to how we build the best, most sustainable, most secure and most affordable energy supply for the future of this country. I am flagging that I will be voting against this and I am sure both major parties have already indicated they are fully supporting this. It will not create too much of a ripple, but I will outline the reasons why I continue to express my concerns. I live in a countryI hope I live in a country-where we do not leave people behind in policy. In regard to the development of a small scheme with a fixed price, I think the very reason behind the development of a scheme that is split between large and small is to increase investment security for large investors, but it is a zero sum game in my view. We are also, as a direct consequence, increasing the exposure of the householder and the small-scale technology that does want to contribute and does have a want to participate and does have a desire to own this issue. If we are going to start with the broad philosophical, it is this clash of ideals that I am feeling with the two major parties now jumping into bed and saying that large investment is the way forward in policy for energy security and renewable energies at the expense of the smallscale systems and households. I take a counterview and I do think there are alternative policy options in the marketplace that have been rejected by government and opposition that say we choose a much smarter path by looking towards the ownership culture of both the problem and the solution and of both the demand and supply side. Those options are there. A national feed-in tariff scheme has been brought into of this parliament by several people-and has been rejected by government-to get some consistency in the way this country deals with one of its greatest energy supplies, and that is the sun above us. Households can engage in a national electricity market, both on a supply and demand side, and manage their own issues of energy supply and use. Yet that has been rejected by government, because the ‘suits' in Canberra go into the offices of the various players and win an argument that the culture of investment in large-scale infrastructure is the best and only way forward for this country in regard to clean, green energy supplies and affordable and secure energy supplies for the future. By no means is this to deny the role that large-scale investment plays, but I do not think that in a policy sense we are being as creative as we can be and as responsible as we can be in chasing large-scale investment at the expense of households and small-scale technology. If anything, we have an obligation as policymakers to embrace and encourage the ownership culture. I make that point for several reasons. One is that we will fail every single household is not engaged on this. If people are not very aware on a daily basis of their electricity use in their own households and take some ownership of that and are supported in owning that through financial means, then we will fail. It will not matter what level of investment-large or small-we want to see committed. As well, I would hope policymakers consider on a broader scale the difference and the contrast between having several large investment sites, with the poles and wires and everything that has to go with that in getting it to the retail market, compared to the contrast in a policy sense of a large number of sites with a smaller investment needed to get it to the market. Every household potentially has the ability to be the mini generator that we all desire. The beauty in a policy sense is that it is demand side and supply side at the one point of contact. There is no need for the double handling of getting supply to market. That should be considered an advantage when establishing policy frameworks and therefore is an alternative option which is worthy of greater consideration. There are some ironies in this legislative package. I will begin by identifying the irony that this is a mini CPRS. This is a cap-and-trade scheme which is already in operation in the marketplace and already accepted by many operators. It is having minimal impact. The figures have been released today in estimates that it is about $2 a year in regard to RET schemes into the future, having minimal impact on the electricity supply at every household. There are some political ironies here in that we have had some of the most unholy of punch-ons in regard to putting a price on carbon and whether we as a nation are comfortable with a market based response to these natural resource questions. And at the same time, over the last five years we have if been doing it because we have a scheme in place. This is the Mini-Me of CPRS schemes which has the full endorsement and support of the coalition. It will be voted on and supported today by the coalition. So the great big tax of the last six months is no good but the quiet little new tax is okay within a RET scheme-some political irony. The figures out today in estimates show that it will lead to some increases in household electricity prices but minimal increases with benefits attached. All of this has to be a contextual debate. I do not have a problem with the scheme itself. I think there are huge ironies in the fact that both the government and the opposition do not have problems with the scheme, considering their broader positions on market based responses on climate and energy questions, but in the detail of how this has been designed we are leaving people behind. We are increasing the exposure of households who want to participate, and ownership and the culture of ownership is a critical opportunity which will be lost if we go down this path of focusing purely on how many large investments, wind farms, we can get operating in this country. That is one that might sit well in political mythology when ministers are standing on the campaign box and saying, ‘My scheme will deliver $19 billion worth of investment by 2020 and we are 22 per cent rather than 20 per cent ahead of where we want to be.' Unless we engage the Australian population on this and on the range of packages available, we are going to fail. While I have the chance, I throw into this basket the green loans scheme and the insulation scheme, and I throw them in from an angle which is different from everyone in this place. I am a fan. I think they are sensible, conceptual schemes for exactly the reasons I have been talking about for the last 10 minutes. They engage households in both the problem and the solution. Home sustainability is an option for dealing with the moral challenges of our times and is an eminently sensible policy approach. Yes there were delivery questions but they, over time, can and should be resolved. It disappoints me and I know many in the community. You only have to look at the polling: at the moment the disappointment is reflected at the ballot box. The government seem to have walked away from engaging the home in a sustainable and affordable future. I would hope the green loans scheme survives. At a cost to government it is minimal in the overall budget and the return on the demand side, in growth areas particularly like the one I represent, is significant. It means Country Energy, for example, does not have to increase electricity prices by 40 per cent as their recent New South Wales report said, and largely that increase is due to lack of investment in poles and wires. If we can get the demand side under control through engaging households we will minimise the overall cost to all in rising electricity prices and therefore home sustainability. Any programs from government that engage households in the problem and the solution are very welcome initiatives for the majority of taxpayers. Likewise, for all the wrongs of dodgy insulators-and there are stories that will be revealed to all and the naming and shaming will continue-the underlying concept of the program was and is a good one. I think allowing people to take ownership and engage is an eminently sensible policy approach. In the development of this and in the context of all that has gone on in this place in last six months where we have seen the 180degree turn from the coalition and the Malcolm to Tony move, when we have seen the 180-degree turn from government, from ‘Sensible Kevin' to ‘Nervous Kevin', we need",31
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,The honourable member Lyne ought to refer to other honourable members by their position and not by their name.,34
18,Mr OAKESHOTT,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,"The ‘sensible' Prime Minister; the ‘nervous' Prime Minister, the change from the member for Wentworth to the member for Warringah-these are the 180-degree flips that have occurred within the last six months that have the community confused. There is currently a sense in the community of a policy void in government. It will take an enormous amount of work from government in a particularly wired election environment to recover the moment and to put in place a policy strategy that the community believes in, that is deliverable and that engages the community and government in working together, rather than one that creates the current policy void and confusion. I take this opportunity to raise the issue of the smoking guns that I have seen over the last six months. I smelt a rat in the shift that I saw and what looked to be-to their credita very well organised and very well-funded campaign from the likes of JoNova and Viv Forbes. There is more going on in those stories than meet the eye and they have seen the two major parties scat on the issue of action on climate change and on an affordable and secure energy supply for our future. The shifts that we have seen from both sides have created an unstable energy market and are a great disappointment. Again, I think there are a whole range of interests other than the national interest at play in the political process the in this place that point to further smoking guns. Another point I want to make and one that I hope Minister Garrett and Minister Combet, who are at the table, will consider is my concern about the contrast between government policy and the people who I see in my community, either as a household or as a small business, who want to embrace many of the issues around renewable energy and broader energy security. They are doing it; they are basically getting on with it. However, the policy development and advice from the energy and environmental departments looks to be given ‘with fear' and ‘with favour'; it is found wanting. In my view, those departments show an inability to contribute without fear or favour to robust policy development in this country. Further, the delivery of those outcomes looks to be a bit of a smoking gun. I think these two departments have been found wanting. This has been captured more by some of the old school culture of the energy department rather than some of the vibrant new minds that we might find in the public sector. I hope I am wrong but there have been too many policy misfires for me to think otherwise. That is one for the ministers at the table to consider. Whilst I will be voting against the legalisation, I think there is a way forward. We do need the question of a price on carbon answered-and quickly. It is creating an unstable environment. There are a range of doables now, and I would encourage the ministers at the table to look at what ClimateWorks Australia have been doing. They gave some excellent presentations in this place this week. There are some really positive steps that can be taken now to set us up well for the future. The small-scale energy security is a question that has me really baulking today. This legislative package increases the insecurity around small-scale business and household engagement. There is still a policy void regarding the question of home energy sustainability; it is one we need some direction and answers on quickly.",34
19,Mr COMBET,TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALL,"Charlton-Minister for Defence Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (10.26 am)-As the member for Lyne was the final speaker, I would like to thank members for their contribution to the debate on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010, Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2010 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Small-scale Technology Shortfall Charge) Bill 2010. Each of these bills has been the subject of a cognate debate. The bills together will implement the enhanced renewable energy target to separate the existing scheme into two parts. Firstly, the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme and, secondly, the large-scale renewable energy target will both take effect from 1 January 2011. The renewable energy target is a key measure in the government's climate change policy designed to deliver on the government's commitment to ensure that the equivalent of at least 20 per cent of Australia's electricity will come from renewable sources by the year 2020. The enhancements will provide greater certainty for large-scale renewable energy projects and installers of small-scale renewable energy systems such as solar panels and solar water heaters. I would like to briefly summarise the debate and respond to some of the points that have been raised by members of the House. Firstly, the 20 per cent renewable target by 2020 is a challenging but significant increase on the previous mandatory renewable energy target, and it will drive investment in Australia's renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and geothermal power. The large-scale renewable energy target in 2020 will only be met with substantial growth in large-scale renewable energy generation projects. Modelling released by the government yesterday shows that the changes are expected to deliver more renewable energy than the original 20 per cent target, reaching around 22 per cent by 2020, which will help transform the electricity sector and support investment in both largeand small-scale renewable energy projects. This is a very important initiative. Further, the enhanced renewable energy target is expected to drive up to $19 billion in total investment in large-scale renewable energy generation in the period 2020-30. Importantly, these changes are only expected to add $2 per year to a typical household's annual electricity bill. On the issue of the renewable energy target support for emerging technologies, it has been suggested that the RET should be banded to ensure the deployment of less mature renewable technologies. The RET Scheme encourages the deployment of renewable energy without picking winners within the target. As I have indicated, the renewable energy target is in fact very large. It increases the current Mandatory Renewable Energy Target Scheme by over four times. Due to the large size of the RET will pull through a range of technologies including wind, biomass, solar and geothermal energy. The RET is complemented by significant direct support for the development, commercialisation and deployment of emerging renewable energy technologies through the $5.1 billion Clean Energy Initiative announced by the government. The government has now committed more than $200 million to accelerate geothermal energy technology development, demonstration and deployment in this country, leveraging a total investment in excess of $720 million. Funding for several geothermal projects has already been announced. In that context it is not considered appropriate to be banding, as it has been described, the renewable energy target. There has been some suggestion of rorting of government support for heat pump water heaters. The government became aware last year that some installers of heat pump water heating systems had been inappropriately claiming renewable energy certificates under the RET Scheme, introduced by the previous government in 2001. Some concerns were raised that multiple heat pump hot water systems or excessively large systems were installed above the capacity actually required by the user in order to generate the certificates. In September 2009, regulations came into force to address that issue. These regulations were put in place to prevent the oversizing of heat pumps. The regulations require statutory declarations to ensure that, for units with a capacity of over 700 litres, the unit is appropriately sized for its intended use and that there is an intention that it remain in its original configuration and location for the life of the unit. This has had a significant impact in ensuring that renewable energy certificates are claimed only for appropriately sized heat pumps and addresses the target, the issues that have been raised. Furthermore, there has been some commentary on the closure of the Solar Homes and Communities Plan. Solar credits under the Renewable Energy Target Scheme replace the support previously provided through rebates under the Solar Homes and Communities Plan for installing rooftop solar photovoltaic systems. By legislating support, solar credits will provide increased certainty to industry and the community with respect to the solar PV systems. On the issue of government support for renewable energy generally, the renewable energy target is, as I have said, a part of a suite of government policies encouraging the switch to cleaner energy. In particular the government is providing funding for research, development and demonstration of clean energy technologies, including renewables, through the $5.1 billion Clean Energy Initiative. This incorporates the recently aning. nounced in the budget Renewable Energy Future Fund, which will provide an additional $652.5 million over four years to support Australia's response to climate change. The Australian Centre for Renewable Energy is a key plank in Australia's commitment to clean energy technologies and to deploying these technologies around Australia. It draws together more than $560 million in order to accelerate the development, commercialisation and demonstration of renewable energy technologies and it will, therefore, complement the government's investment in generation-scale demonstration projects under the Solar Flagships program and the sustained commitment to household and community-scale renewables through initiatives such as the Solar Cities program and the National Solar Schools program. In addition, the Prime Minister's Task Group on Energy Efficiency will report shortly, in mid2010, on other important new energy efficiency measures. In conclusion, the amendment bills before the House today will encourage the deployment of both major renewable energy projects and household-scale renewable energy systems. The renewable energy target is a key measure in Australia's climate change policy and these changes will deliver significant and timely sets of enhancements that will reduce Australia's emissions. The enhanced renewable energy target will drive significant investment, accelerating the deployment of a broad scale of renewable energy technologies like wind, solar and geothermal. These changes will ensure that 20 per cent of our electricity supply comes from renewable sources by the year 2020. These bills represent a major step forward towards the transformation of the Australian economy and the building of Australia's low-pollution future. I commend the bills to the House.

25,Dr STONE,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"I rise to talk about the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and the Paid Parental Leave (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010. There is currently no universal legislated right to paid parental leave in Australia. These bills introduce that right for the first time. There should of course have been mandated, paidfor parental leave in Australia for a very long time. We, apart from the USA, are the last society to ensure that all working families have paid leave to assist parents in the workforce, particularly to help with the mothers' recovery and to make sure we offer the very best possible start for our newborns. Given that it has taken Australia so long and there are decades of other developed nations' policies and practices for us to learn from, it is speak astonishing that the Rudd Labor government are asking the working families of Australia to accept such a shambolic and limited paid parental scheme. That is what is before us today in the parliament. Labor's policy is so poor that even their own National Foundation for Australian Women, in their submission to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into these bills, stressed that Labor's Paid Parental Leave scheme must only be seen as a first step and must be enhanced over time. This begs the question: why should the NFAW and the ACTU be so cowed and contrite? Who do they think they really represent? They should not be so grateful for just a few crumbs. Why should Australian working women be fobbed off with a small, cheap, one inadequate step at a time policy from this Labor government? Australian families deserve a scheme that is equal to the best there is-that is, which offers them at least six months to bond with their babies, to recover from the birth and to exclusively breastfeed if they can or wish to. But this government is only putting 4½ months, or 18 weeks, leave on the table. Why should Australian working women be denied superannuation while they are on paid parental leave? The Rudd government know full well that Australian women's working lives are too often interrupted, given they undertake the vast majority of parenting, and caring for the disabled, the aged and infirm. Stop-start careers or part-time work interrupts continuous superannuation contributions-we all know that-and this erodes women's capacity to accumulate sufficient superannuation or savings to retire independently. Seventy-five per cent of Australia's age pensioners are women, because they cannot support themselves adequately in their old age. Labor are happy, apparently, to have this sad situation perpetuated. Their policy denies continuing superannuation to parents taking parental leave. The second income in an Australian household is now very often necessary to help families buy a home and to meet other costs associated with raising a family. Not are in the privileged position of being able rely on a single breadwinner earning sufficient income to establish and maintain the home and lifestyle that most Australians aspire to. As well, ironically, Australia's women are among the best educated in the world. The majority of our women want to use that education to develop a career so they can fully participate in our society and the economy. So, not surprisingly, over the past 30 years the growth in female workforce participation in Australia has risen steeply, particularly for those of child-bearing age. For example, the participation rate of 25to 34-year-old partnered women has risen from 45 per cent in 1978 to over 70 per cent in 2008. On average, some 62½ per cent of women giving birth in Australia were in the workforce before the birth and, of these, some 74 per cent want to return to work if they can. So this mandated paid parental leave scheme is essential for our country, but it to be a good scheme. Labor's Paid Parental Leave scheme is not a replacement salary scheme for women who have been in the workforce up to the time of the birth. They are offered only the minimum wage for all. This is what Labor is offering. There is no doubt that many women will do their sums and will not be able to afford to take the leave offered by Labor's miserable scheme. The government acknowledges this, and so it is including a calculator on its website to help the parent or parent-to-be estimate whether or not they will be better off monetarily sticking with the baby bonus and struggling back to work as soon as they can. This is, of course, a tragic option for mothers of newborn babies and families who want to properly parent those newborns. The choice of baby bonus or Labor's very cheap and miserable Paid Parental Leave scheme should not be a choice forced on our working all families. Labor is perpetuating the situation to where too many women regret for the rest of their lives the fact that they simply could not afford to be with their newborn for a suitable period of time because they could not afford to keep paying the bills on a single income or less than they had earned before. If you read Minister Jenny Macklin's second reading speech, you will see that she is fully aware that Labor has cheated Australian families of a proper and decent paid parental leave scheme. She has said that she expected, and indeed hoped, that parents would top up her scheme with the privately negotiated paid parental leave schemes that are already in existence across the economy in Australia. This is, of course, a mean and cruel expectation. It, in fact, perpetuates the haves and have-nots-the gross inequalities that have affected parents in Australia for many, many years. It is simply un-Australian. Some more or less paid parental leave has long been provided by businesses wanting to has keep their skilled women staff. This paid parental leave has been offered through workplace agreements or by legislation which, in particular, caters for the very fortu68 nate women in the Public Service-for example, the Maternity Leave (Australian Government Employees) Act 1973. As well, there are state awards and state legislation which ensure that state government public servants and some others have some paid parental leave. Private arrangements for women to access paid maternity leave have, in fact, increased from only 36 per cent in 2003 to 41 per cent in 2005-that is according to the ABS. Over the five-year period to August 2007, the proportion of full-time employees who are entitled to paid maternity leave rose from 43 per cent to 60 per cent. However, for part-time employees it only rose from a very low 18 per cent to 27 per cent. Of course, that is less than half the centage offered parental leave compared to full-time workers. In August 2007, the ABS estimated that 45 per cent, or 1.8 million, of Australia's four million female employees were entitled to paid parental leave in their main job, but access to paid parental leave varied not only according to the hours worked but also according to pay levels. For example, 84 per cent of women earning over $1,200 per week have access to paid parental leave. This has to be compared with only 24 per cent of those on wages under $500 per week being offered parental leave. Sixty per cent of women designated as professionals use paid maternity leave, while only about half that percentage-some 31 per cent-of those designated as intermediate clerical, sales or service workers can access such leave. In 2005, 76 per cent of the fortunate women employed in the public sector in their last main job while pregnant used paid maternity leave, but this compared to just 27 per cent of women employees in the private sector. Eighty per cent of women whose last main job while pregnant was in the public service, government administration or defence, and per cent of those in education departments across the country, used paid maternity leave. There were also higher levels of paid maternity leave access in the finance and insurance industries. But let me stress that in the industries with the lowest proportion of female employees with paid maternity leave entitlements-these were the industries with the lower paid women or part-time women, in accommodation, cafes and restaurantsonly 14 per cent had paid leave. In retail, only 21 per cent had paid parental leave. So access to paid maternity leave in Australia depends at the moment on your pay rates, your skill levels, the hours you work, your industry or occupation and whether you were in the public service or the private secpertor. This leave varies from two days on offer to 18 weeks. What this government has done is perpetuate that inequality, and the advisers listening to this debate should be ashamed that they allowed the minister to persist with this policy. You should have advised differently. This is an appalling continuation of the haves and have-nots, because what this government has said is: ‘Yes, we know our scheme is inadequate. It's very mean and poor. It only offers 18 weeks at the minimum wage, with no superannuation. But you go away and have it topped up by your employer.' The poor women of Australia, the lower paid, the part-time workers and the self-employed do not typically have those alternative private sector or public sector schemes to top them up and give them a decent period of leave from their workplace. I think that is disgraceful. I think this Labor government should stand condemned and ashamed, and I cannot understand why the ACTU stands by and says, ‘Oh, well, at least we've got something.' ‘Something' is simply not good enough for Australia's working families. I hope that I have made it absolutely clear that lower paid women and those more likely to be in part-time work are far less likely to have a top-up scheme of paid parental leave, and they have to have that top-up scheme, as I have said, to make Labor's meagre offering affordable. Of course, our coalition will aim to amend this scheme to offer something far better, and our leader will introduce those amendments shortly. Lower paid women working in hospitality, tourism and retail and the self-employed and contract worker women across the country will inevitably be forced to rely exclusively on Labor's offer of only 18 weeks of leave while their better paid sisters can add their employer's scheme on top to give them at least six months leave or an even better salary outcome. How can Labor sustain the argument that lower paid women need less time to recover from a birth, are less likely breastfeed or are able to recover faster from a pregnancy than better paid women in, say, the Public Service or the banking sector? The long standing inequity of access to paid maternity leave for women in Australia has always had impacts on Australia's productivity and on women's career development and attachment to their workplaces. Their accumulation of superannuation and savings and ultimately their financial independence have long been affected by the current inequities of access to paid parental leave in Australia. Labor is perpetuating this problem. The coalition will not stand for it. Labor is introducing only 18 weeks of paid parental leave, to be paid at the minimum wage, for those who have worked at least 330 hours in 10 of the last 13 months. Primary carers earning over $150,000 will not be eligible and the paid parental leave is to be taxed. I have no doubt that Labor's offer of only 18 weeks of paid parental leave without superannuation and only at the minimum wage will see many women in families dependent on a second income forced back to work earlier than is optimal for the mother and the baby's well-being. That is not what families in Australia expected from any government-although perhaps they thought it was more likely they would be let down by a Labor government. After such a long wait for a mandated universal scheme this is a bitter disappointment. The coalition's scheme is world's best practice. It offers six months of leave at the mother's salary up to $150,000 or the minimum wage, whichever is greatest, and superannuation is paid-currently this is at nine per cent. We have the same eligibility criteria for access to paid parental leave as has been identified by Labor. We also make sure that women who are self-employed, who are in partnerships or who are contractors are able to to participate in this scheme. There will be appropriate eligibility criteria. In most countries with paid parental leave the parents may decide which parent takes leave or takes part of the leave and claims the income support. However, in Sweden, Iceland and Norway the governments have chosen to structure their paid parental leave to reflect their societies' gender equity objectives, the benefit to the baby of some early close association with the father and the sharing and diminishing of what would otherwise be the mother-only experience of an interrupted career and superannuation reduction. Unlike Labor, the coalition also recognises that the father, or non-primary carer, also often wants to have a close bonding experience and parenting experience with their newborn. Often the father has to be encouraged and given an opportunity to assist the mother and to bond with the newborn with special workplace leave arrangements. Hence, the coalition's scheme includes a two-week use-it or lose-it period of leave. We have to change the attitudes of our society about the needs of parenting couples and their babies. The coalition intends to assist with this cultural change in the interests of ushering in a new era of a more caring, family-friendly and nurturing society. We know that, along with paid parental leave, we must have greater flexibility in the workplace. We must have businesses understand that, while it may be different to what they have done traditionally, they can and should consider part-time work, job sharing, working from home where it is possible and certainly different workplace arrangements, particularly when a parent is in the early years of having to support their young children. Flexible workplace arrangements of course do not only meet the needs of workers with young children; flexible workplace arrangements enable workers to manage their responsibilities for caring in the community, perhaps for older relatives or disabled children. Unfortunately, under Labor's new industrial relations regime that flexibility is a lot less possible. We regret that. The coalition will ensure that in the future our workplace relations will foster and encourage more family-friendly workplaces in our country, because, quite simply, nothing else will do. Labor's paid parental policy does more than disadvantage the poorer part-time women, who are less likely to have another paid parental leave offer to fall back on or supplement Labor's impoverished, meagre and inadequate scheme. Labor has also failed to address the administrative burden that its scheme will add to small and medium sized businesses. We were hoping that the Paid Parental Leave scheme would not upset businesses who may have resisted the notion of giving, particularly women, paid parental leave, knowing that it is often inconvenient when a replacement worker needs to be found. Unfortunately, Labor's policy has exacerbated the additional red tape, the administrative burdens and complications. Labor has inadequately consulted with the business sector. Although they had two years from the campaign announcement of ushering in the Paid Parental Leave scheme, they seem to have left the scheme's administration arrangements to the very last minute in consulting with the states and businesses. Labor was determined to advance women's workplace attachment by requiring their employers to still have the paid parental leave wage go through the companies' books-in other words, to have the worker retained on the payroll. It seems that a company is to receive the government contribution into their enterprise and must churn it through their payroll and out into the community, where the parent is on leave. Clearly, this arrangement has implications for payroll tax-in some states more than others. And there are other add-on costs when a worker is retained on your payroll. But the minister has failed totally to understand those complexities and she has not consulted with the states in time to make any sense of what businesses are to do or what extra costs they will be up for or, indeed, what concessions might be made for this particular situation. It is no surprise that the business sector is very angry. They have to made significant representations to the Senate inquiry expressing their concern and frustration and anger. Even businesses who have long supported their skilled women workers and who want to make sure that they have paid parental leave are disgusted with the lack of proper consultation and due regard to the complexities that this scheme will now add. They are not placated by the fact that, recognising that there has been a huge stuff-up in this case, they are to be given six months moratorium in terms of these payments being directed through their payrolls and out to the worker who is on paid parental leave. Unfortunately, six months is not all that great a concession to the businesses. They have no idea how to manage after the six months commencing on 1 January 2011, when the full requirements of the scheme commence. We just have to hope that the coalition is returned to government well before 1 January 2011. We have committed to introducing our alternative scheme, which places no such burden on businesses, so that the small and medium sized business sector in particular will not have to personally manage and manipulate the salaries on their way through. We will have the Family Assistance Office manage all that red tape and administrative detail. What Labor has done in its misunderstanding of what was required in relation to administering such a scheme is exactly the opposite to what this country needs right now when we have skills shortages and an ageing demographic and we also have the right of women to have a fair go in the workplace. Yes, I am concerned that some businesses, knowing what is ahead of them with Labor's Paid Parental Leave scheme, with all the additional red tape and administration, will look the other way when a woman of child-bearing age presents at a job interview. That is exactly the reverse of the outcome that we need in the introduction of Australia's first mandated paid parental leave scheme. Realising that, yes, they have mishandled the administration arrangements for the policy's implementation, the minister has now, I admit, delayed the requirement that businesses pay the parental leave worker for the first six months. I just have to repeat, this is very cold comfort for the businesses out there. We also are yet to really understand how this Labor program will manage the contractor woman, the woman doing seasonal work, the parent who is self-employed, the farming woman who is in a partnership, perhaps in a business which has not made any income for a number of years but where she has certainly put in the hours of work which make her eligible for paid parental leave. All of that is still a mystery when it comes to this scheme. It should not be a mystery. This government had nearly two years to work out the details and to put those details out into the community for careful consideration and feedback. Australia has not had a universally accessible and equitable policy providing real choice for the working women and families in relation to paid parental leave. Universal paid parental leave offered to mothers and/or fathers must help to change the culture in the workplace, which currently can discriminate against women returning to work after pregnancy or, indeed, when they ask for paid parental leave. A national paid parental leave policy must assist and engender greater recognition of the public good of parenting and the fact that parenting is an absolute necessity when it comes to the regeneration of any society. But good parenting is what this country needs and, more and more in our society, good parenting requires a juggling between workplace or workforce commitments and the responsibilities at home. Women take most of the responsibility for parenting and for caring onto their own plate. It is essential that both men and women in the workforce are given special support, that they are given a scheme that makes sense and is, in fact, world's best practice. What they have got in Labor's scheme is something that is meagre. It perpetuates the inequalities which are currently in the workplace and experienced by women every day. I cannot understand why Labor refused to put on the table a far better scheme when they had so many other developed countries' schemes to consider in detail. They had feedback from the women advocates across the country saying: ‘Please, give us at least superannuation. Make sure that we have at least six months of time away from the workplace when we can bond with and nurture our newborn and recover from the pregnancy.' That is not to happen with Labor's scheme. I repeat, it is a meagre, cheapskate scheme which sells Australia's working families short. To say that it does not matter because women can go away and get a topup from some other scheme offered privately or by the public sector is to perpetuate the inequalities where unskilled or lower paid women or women in part-time work are a lot less likely to have access to those alternative schemes. What a mean thing to do to Australia's working women! I feel quite ashamed, I have to say. As a working woman myself, I want the best for all the women of Australia, and here I stand in this parliament with a piece of legislation like this on the table. It should have been much better. You can be assured that the coalition understands what is right and proper for Australia's working families. We will be attempting to amend this scheme. On the other hand, of course, we have put it on the record that we understand that half of something is better than nothing at all. So we have said that at the end of the day, if we cannot get our appropriate amendments through, we will wave this impoverished scheme through. But it will a sad day for Australia and Australia's working families.",38
26,Mr HAYES,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"It is an honour to participate in this debate on the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and the Paid Parental Leave (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010, particularly with the government's Minister for the Status of Women at the table. Tanya has been gracious enough to visit my electorate on a number of occasions to talk to local parents on this issue, and she knows full well the importance placed on paid parental leave in the area in which I live. It is fundamental. All of us in this place who have been blessed with children-and those of us who are a little more mature, such as you and me, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, who are very boastful of grandchildren-know that there is nothing more important to us than ensuring that our kids are safe. We do everything we can to give them the best opportunities in life so they can grow into adulthood and fulfil their potential. That is something innate in parenting, something that comes from unqualified love. We know very clearly that young children, babies in particular, need the full-time care of their parents, particularly in those vital early months of life. The social, cognitive and physical development of the child are very important. When each of our three kids arrived, Bernadette could not work. There was an absolute necessity for her to spend time with our kids. And in those days there was not access to maternity leave, certainly not paid maternity leave. They are the kinds of decisions that parents have to make at that stage. That is why this is very important legislation. It is extremely important to recognise that the primary caring responsibility normally falls to the woman. I fully understand how difficult it is to take time off work for many parents, particularly women who want to remain connected to the workforce. There is an economic reality in modern life, particularly in the outer metropolitan areas of Sydney, where I come from: the mortgage needs to be paid; the bills need to be paid. There is an economic reality to staying in touch with paid employment. Prior to the last election, the Labor Party indicated that we would ask the Productivity Commission, as an independent body, to investigate the options for a paid parental leave scheme. After accepting most of their recommendations, we have the legislation before us today. This legislation addresses the modern challenges which I have raised and is Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. This is a major win for working families, who have been waiting for decades for such a scheme. Importantly, the scheme gives babies the best start in life, which, as I indicated earlier, is critical for their development. Once the scheme is delivered, we will have finally caught up with the rest of the world. It is a shame that Australia is one of only two OECD nations that have not so far had paid parental leave. It should be said that our scheme will be funded by the government and therefore it is fair for families and, particularly, for businesses. It is not just the government claiming that this is a great achievement. Elizabeth Broderick, the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, at the launch of the draft legislation, said: It's a great thrill to be here today as the Sex Discrimination Commissioner and to see a piece of legislation which has the words ‘paid parental leave' on the top. Sharan Burrow, the retiring ACTU President, said: This is a magical moment. To see a piece of legislation with paid parental leave on the front of the cover is a 30-year, long-awaited moment of justice for working women. She went on with some very stern words about the Leader of the Opposition and some reasonably contentious remarks about the opposition's wish list. She is not alone in her views. Paid parental leave has long been an issue in the minds of people in my electorate. South-west Sydney, like any other outer metropolitan area, is the mortgage belt. These are hard working families, families that have been waiting for the government to address their concerns, and they have been looking forward to us giving them real options to balance work and family life. We have listened and that is why we are introducing the scheme. I do not want to be like a broken recordbecause I probably tend to say this a little too often in the House-but I have to say something after listening to the critical comments that the member for Murray, Dr Stone, made about this legislation, although the coalition are not going to oppose it; I understand that. The opposition spokesperson for the status of women was in government with John Howard over the whole period of 12 years. You have got to start asking yourself: if these criticisms are being levelled at this government about the introduction of this legislation now, what did the coalition do over the 12 years that they held the reins of office? Surely there cannot have been an extraordinarily long-range plan that in the 13th year they were going to do all these things. They had 12 years, and what did they do about paid parental leave? I will tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker. They did absolutely nothing. Our commitment to working families through this scheme is in stark contrast to the absence of any effort to acknowledge paid parental leave throughout the whole 12 years of the Howard government. They refused to deliver paid parental leave. By the way, they have a track record. It was not just a refusal. They had a very committed position. The Leader of the Opposition has now articulated a position-on the very day of International Women's Day-but do not forget he is also on the record as saying: … compulsory paid maternity leave, over this Government's dead body … That was their position in government. He was very clear and very precise in his characteristic offhand way, but it certainly acknowledged that their position on the issue of paid parental leave was ‘over their dead body'. I do not know. Perhaps he did have an epiphany. Maybe there is something in that ‘road to Damascus'. I am not quite sure. Far from simply being converted, he has now come to a position without the consent, support or urging of any other member that sits on the coalition side. On the very day of International Women's Day, he decided to come out and say: ‘We are going to have six months paid paternity leave, paid at whatever rate people are earning. So, if you are earning $150,000 a year, you will get $75,000 paid to you. But we are going to tax big business'-what he now refers to as ‘big business' is any business that has a profit line of $5 million-‘We are going to slug them so that not only are they going to pay for the parental leave of people in their own business, but they are going to pay for the parental leave of anyone else out there in the workforce, any other businesses.' Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not know about you, but I have actually had a look to see how many businesses in my electorate fall under the $5 million profit line and I have to say that there are a heck of a lot of them. The last time we looked, I think about 98 per cent of all businesses in my electorate would, under Tony Abbott's big new tax on business, have some other business paying for the parental leave of their people. No wonder the coalition were a bit taken aback by that. They wanted to make some criticisms on issues about tax before, although one thing is that they did not see this as a tax. They saw it as a levy, so therefore it was not a tax. In case, it can be Tony Abbott's big new levy on all businesses that earn over $5 million. To participate in this debate you need some credibility and there is no credibility in that approach. There is no point in people over there scurrying around and wanting to put their head in the sand. The truth of the matter is that nobody other than the Leader of the Opposition was aware of what he was going to say on that day. No-one, including the opposition spokesperson on the status of women, knew that this was going to be said. Maybe it is just one of those things. You turn up for this international function and you really do not have anything to say, so you think: ‘Let's fill in the gaps. Let's just make this grand new announcement on the basis: we know we can't deliver it, but we will say it anyway.' That is not really participating in a constructive debate on something that is as serious for this country as paid parental leave. The opposition claim to be the friends of business. I think that claim is a bit spurious, but if it is true that part of the motivation of those on the other side of the House is to be the friends of big business, it is very interesting to see what big business have to say about this. I will sum up their total reaction, but I will not attribute it to anyone. The reaction, according to business, is ‘Over our dead body'-that is, if you take the comments of the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry as being any indication of their view on the approach being adopted. So you can see that the opposition and, in particular, their leader cannot be trusted when it comes to this debate. Without authority, without planning and without looking at numbersbecause we know he does not like economics and does not like looking at numbers-he just wants to throw something into the mix. that This is not the way you have a dialogue on a piece of social policy as important as this issue. We might also need to check their comments and find out if this promise to working families was scripted. I know a lot has been said about gospel truth on the other side, but, unless this is in writing, maybe it was not really a serious opposition position. However, I just noticed here that, in the amendment to the motion, it is now, ladies and gentlemen, in writing. So it must be the case that it is now their policy position to put a new tax on all businesses. It is their position to pay everybody for six months at the rate they are earning and it does not matter what amount of money they are earning up to $150,000. If you are a solicitor in Sydney or Melbourne earning that sort of money, the Leader of the Opposition is out there trying to take care of you. But what he is proposing is designed never to be implemented. He knows it will never be implemented. He is simply trying to join in the debate without coming to the table and saying that the government got it right. They do not have the intestinal fortitude to say: ‘Look, we had 12 years to do something on this matter. We did not give it priority, we actually agree with what you are doing and we will support it because it is the right thing to do for the Australian people.' They will not do that because they simply want to play politics. They want to go to an election on the basis of claiming to have some affinity with working families. People in my electorate will see through that and there is no way they are going to take that sort of risk. Today I have tried to keep my remarks to the benefits of the scheme for families, but the scheme contained in the bills will also benefit employers. What most employers say is that they want to be able to retain their good staff and they want to be able to keep those skills. These are things they want to be able to do. We saw that when this whole debate really started a number of years back, when the Catholic University here in Canberra wanted to ensure that they retained their tutorial and lecturing staff. They voluntarily introduced paid maternity leave for their employees. We want to assist business to retain their skilled and valued employees, and this is what our legislation will do once implemented. This is good for the country, and it is good for the country as a whole. It is good for the economy. Therefore, it will not be an impost on business. This is being borne by government. This is budgeted for. This is not going out and putting a great big new tax on enterprise. What this is doing is budgeting for the result because the introduction of this legislation will deliver true and meaningful benefits to our economy. It is no surprise that the move has been welcomed by thousands of businesses. I know, from talking to businesses in my region, that they look forward to having the opportunity to retain their valued staff in their respective business enterprises. It is certainly being looked forward to by working families throughout the southbut west of Sydney. The only logical way to minimise the scheme's impact on employers was, as I say, to ensure that it was addressed as an economic package and provided for in the budget. We have not imposed on business as a consequence. Our scheme will come in on 1 January 2011 and eligible parents will for 18 weeks receive government funded paid parental leave at the national minimum wage. It is important at this stage of the debate to outline who will be eligible, as working people will need to make various decisions. For this reason I would like to take members through the criteria for eligibility for paid parental leave. The scheme will be available to people if they: are the mother of a newborn child or initial primary carer of a recently adopted child; have met the paid parental leave work test before the birth or adoption occurs; have an individual annual income of $150,000 or less; and are living in Australia and are an Australian citizen or permanent resident. It is also important to note that, in planning this, people who have worked just over one day a week over the 10 months prior to the child's birth will have access to this paid parental leave. The work test will, for the first time, ensure that women working in seasonal employment, casual employment or contract employment or who are self-employed will have access to the scheme. That is because the scheme will not be an impost on their employer; the scheme will be funded out of the budget. There is no doubt that those workers will be the big winners. But so again business will be. It is true that under the rent voluntary system parental leave tends to be available to workers in the higher-paying categories in some areas of enterprise where they are regulated by industrial awards and indeed in the Public Service. This will ensure that all women will be able to benefit from the scheme, that all women will be able to do what we take for granted-that is, provide that initial primary care of their child when is most important, in the child's first 18 weeks of life. It is estimated that there will be approximately 148,000 eligible new parents per year who will be able to spend more time at home recovering after giving birth and nurturing their infants. It is about time women in the country got what they deserved and children got what they needed-nurturing and care by their mother. I commend the bills to the House. I am very proud to be part of a government that is bringing these bills forward. I look forward to the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition, as most businesspeople will, on the big new tax the coalition will attempt to foist on them.",44
27,Mr ABBOTT,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"I am happy to rise in this chamber today. As I do, I am conscious of the example and the inspiration of none other than Sir Robert Menzies, who was the first Prime Minister to propose a serious benefit to families when his government proposed child endowment back in 1941. They were the dark days of war, but Sir Robert Menzies and his government were sufficiently committed to the families of this country and sufficiently committed to the welfare of the children of this country to introduce child endowment at that critical juncture in our nation's history. We are debating the government's Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and the related bill to introduce a very modest form of paid parental leave. The scheme the government is curbringing forward is a small step in the right direction, but it only costs $263 million a year. That is not an inconsiderable figure, but when you divide that amongst the families to whom the benefit will go it will be something like $2,000 per child. No-one who has gone through the business of managing a family budget would think that $2,000 a child was going to make a big difference. it This is a step forward, it is an improvement, but it is a very small step forward and it is not much of an improvement. In particular, the government scheme does not provide to the mothers of this country their full wage for the full six months that it is recommended they spend with their newborn baby. Our position, by contrast, is that mothers in the workforce should be paid real money for real time to bond with their newborn babies. Our position is founded on a clear understanding that over the past few generations society has changed, expectations have grown and lifestyles are different. We understand that in a way that I think the government does not, given the very limited nature of the measure which they are proposing to this parliament now. There should be no limits placed on what the women of Australia can aspire to and achieve. There should be no role which is denied to women. There should be no bar placed on women and certainly the women of this country should be able to aspire to any role and any job beyond the traditional role of wife and mother. They should not be forced to choose between career and family. They must be allowed to choose both if that is what they want. That is what this policy of ours is designed to achieve. As is well known, my views on this issue have evolved. I have changed my mind. I am pleased that I have been open on this subject to the wisdom of others. I am pleased that on this issue I have been able to grow. I am pleased that, over the years, on this issue in particular I have listened to other people. I have listened to my wife. I have listened to my daughters. I have listened to my colleagues. I have listened to my friends. I have tried as best I can to enter into their experitently ence and to understand their hopes and their dreams. That is why I am so proud to stand up in this parliament today and advocate the policy of the coalition for a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme, which is long overdue and which sadly was not delivered by the former government and is certainly not going to be delivered by the current government. We have to face the facts of modern life and a fact of modern life is that most families need two incomes to survive. Most families cannot pay the mortgage without two incomes. Members opposite know this. The staff of members opposite get 18 weeks at full pay. That is the parental leave that they get, yet they wish to deny other women and other parents the kind of benefit that would be provided by the coalition's policy. We have to face the facts of modern life and a fact of modern life is that most families need two incomes to survive. If we are going to facilitate those families, we must facilitate their ability to maintain their income. The paid parental leave scheme that the coalition has adopted is good for women because it finally gives them a real choice, good for families because it supports their income when they are at the most financially vulnerable time in their family lives, and good for the economy because it will keep some of the most productive and potentially productive people more engaged in the workforce. There is no more important challenge before this country than trying to ensure the productivity of our economy because, in the end, you cannot have a community without an economy to sustain it. The stronger that economy, the more prosperous, the more cohesive and most likely the happier that society will be. We look to the intergenerational report, which talked about the various long-term challenges that our country faces. Over several editions, that report has consistalked about the three Ps-population, participation and productivity. A paid parental leave scheme is good on all three counts. It will increase our population. It will certainly increase the participation of women in the workforce and it will increase our productivity by keeping experienced workers engaged in the workforce. This is not just a visionary piece of social policy; it is an important economic reform. As a member of the party of good management, as a member of the party which above all else wishes to improve and strengthen the Australian economy again, I am proud to put this proposal to the parliament. Of course, all policies have to be paid for. Only members opposite think that there is some endless source of finance, some magic pudding from which to pay for all the things that they desire to create a better society. I make no bones about the fact that this policy will be paid for by a levy of up to 1.7 per cent on taxable company incomes over $5 million a year. I wish it were otherwise. Were circumstances different, it could have been different. If we had a $20 billion surplus, we could have done it differently. But given the situation that this government places us in, given the fact that this government in just 2½ years has turned a $20 billion surplus into a $57 billion deficit, given that this government has put us in the position where we are borrowing $700 million a week, this is the least bad way to bring about an effective paid parental leave scheme any time soon. And it must be done soon. The women of Australia and the families of Australia have waited too long and they ought not be denied this visionary piece of social policy, this important economic reform, any longer. It is interesting that members opposite have talked about a great big new tax. Doesn't it show how that refrain is getting under their skin? It is getting under their skin, isn't it? It really is getting under their skin. I make three points. First, this is tremely modest levy compared to the $9 billion a year hit that they want to put on the resources sector, let alone the $15 billion a year additional hit that they want to put on our economy through the emissions trading scheme that they are still committed to but too gutless to talk about. The second point I make is that this is a genuine reform. It is just a tax grab to feed their insensate spending habit. Third, I want very much to ensure that this is only a temporary additional burden even on large business and, once we have debt and deficit under control, once we have been able to reduce personal income tax, I would like also to reduce corporate tax so that there is no long-term additional benefit even on those large companies earning corporate incomes over $5 million a year. This is a very important social reform. It is a very important piece of economic reform. By doing it the way the coalition has proposed, it does not discriminate against younger women because it is a levy on business regardless of any particular business's employment practices. It does not hurt small business because it is a levy on taxable income over $5 million a year of larger companies. It does not add to the administrative burden of business because the work will be done by the Family Assistance Office. It should not add to bureaucracy because all that it should require to implement is a tax return and a doctor's certificate. So this is the simplest, the fairest and, ultimately, the cheapest way of bringing about an important economic and social reform. As I said, the government's measure is a small step in the right direction. I believe we should go much further and that is what the amendment in my name will do. I say to members of this House that, if you want to see a long overdue reform, it is important to support the coalition's policy on this point. If we are to have a better society in the future an exthan that which we have experienced in the recent past, it is important to change the government. If you want to stop the great big new tax on mining, you have to change the government. As was clear from the announcement that the coalition made this morning, if you want to stop the boats, you have to change the government. And, if you not want to give families a fair go through a decent paid parental leave scheme, you have to change the government. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) affirms its commitment to supporting all Australian families and supports policies which give choice and flexibility to parents to enable them to choose what is right for their individual circumstances, whether they are at home or in the paid workforce; (2) recognises that parents have different patterns of family responsibilities and paid work over their life cycle; (3) recognises that due to rising costs of living and a housing affordability crisis, the majority of families require two incomes to make ends meet; (4) notes that Australia remains only one of two OECD countries that does not provide a paid parental leave scheme and that introducing a paid parental scheme is critical to the needs of working families and our national productivity more broadly; (5) rejects the Government's representation of a paid parental leave scheme as a social security measure and instead affirms that it is a valid workplace entitlement that must come with a superannuation component to arrest the gross inadequacy of female retirement incomes; (6) notes the Government's proposed paid parental leave scheme is inadequate in its current form and should be amended to better reflect the requirements of Australian working mothers, and families more generally; (7) supports the ability of casual, part time and full time women to access paid parental leave provided that they have met the qualifying criteria; (8) recognises that a paid parental leave scheme is only one part of government's important role in supporting families as they raise the next generation of Australians; (9) acknowledges that the bill does not: (a) provide paid parental leave for a period of 26 weeks to afford all mothers the opportunity to breastfeed their infant the minimum six month period recommended by the World Health Organisation; (b) provide women with a replacement wage, to a cap or minimum wage (whichever is greater), and so does not adequately support working families when they are at their most financially vulnerable; (10) acknowledges that the bill places a totally unnecessary impost on Australian businesses by requiring employers to act as paymasters for eligible employees; and (11) calls on the Government to make such amendments to the bill as would rectify these flaws.”",48
28,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,Is the amendment seconded? Dr Stone-I second the amendment.,51
29,Ms KING,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"I rise to support the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and Paid Parental Leave (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010. I am absolutely delighted to speak after the Leader of the Opposition and, as one of the women in this parliament, I welcome his extraordinary road to Damascus conversion on this issue. I do find it, I must admit, unbelievable. This is coming from the man who is on the record as saying there would be a paid parental leave over his dead body. This is also from the man who seems to think that it is only women who iron the shirts in households. I seem to think this road to Damascus conversion really is not quite the gospel truth. I certainly welcome his contribution, though, to the Paid Parental Leave scheme debate. The introduction of this legislation on 12 May represents one of the most significant achievements of the Rudd government. I was delighted to be in the chamber when the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs introduced for the scheme because it is truly a historic moment for Australian parents. I am delighted to speak in support of this legislation today. I see this reform as one of the most historic in our nation's history. As a result of our reform, mum and dads across the country and my own electorate of Ballarat will now have access to up to 18 weeks paid parental leave. This is big news for Australian families. The bill reflects the hard work of many people over a long period of time. I note particularly the Leader of the Opposition saying this has been too long in coming. Yes, it has. I do find it interesting that obviously this was something that they were going to do in their 13th year. It was on the never-never, unfortunately, and their own paid parental leave scheme is also just that, on the never-never. This bill certainly reflects the Rudd government's commitment to Australian families. It is a historic moment for those families who have contacted me since I was elected in 2001 asking why Australia does not have a paid parental leave scheme. Babies require devoted support from their parents, and this is no more apparent than during those first few weeks of life. The bill provides parents with peace of mind, the knowledge that they can look after their child with significant financial support through a paid parental leave scheme. Not only does this allow parents financial support but also it allows parents to spend time with their new baby during those early months when it is most needed. It also allows those parents to get time to get to know their baby and to get used to the significant adjustment that is required when you have a new baby in your household. Having a baby and working out not only how best to care for them but also how your life is now to be organised differently does take some getting used to. Those precious first months with a new baby are critical and they are not months that are repeated. They are critical not only for a baby's development but also for the long-term attachment that they will have with their parents. With this legislation we have introduced a significant reform for families, for today and into the future. With this legislation we hope to provide parents with a better chance to balance paid work and supporting their children. This is not only good news for families; it is also good news for industry, particularly for staff retention. Industry has been faced with a brain drain, often losing skilled workers. I hope this legislation will go a long way to ensuring that parents are able to retain their strong connection with the workforce and that industry will be able to keep skilled workers engaged. This is good news for the estimated 148,000 people across the country who are estimated to be eligible. This Paid Parental Leave scheme-unlike the Leader of the Opposition's scheme, a bit of a thought bubble in a book-has been developed with a great deal of consultation over a considerable period of time. We made a commitment back at the last election in 2007 to assist parents balance their work with family life. Lots of work was done in opposition researching paid parental leave schemes. Upon coming to government we then acted quickly. We called on the Productivity Commission to look into what support was needed for parents and their children. The Productivity Commission looked at the benefits of a paid maternity, paternity and parental leave scheme, the funding models to provide support to parents and the impact of such a scheme. The Productivity Commission produced a 584-page report, which concluded that Australia desperately needed a paid parental leave scheme. The determination was concluded following lengthy consultation. In total, 416 public submissions were received by the Productivity Commission. Many of these submissions supported the commission's research and analysis that Australia needs a paid parental leave scheme. Following the government's receipt of the Productivity Commission's report, we announced our intention in last year's budget to commit over $250 million a year to a paid parental leave scheme. When I spoke in parliament in support of the 2009-10 budget, I outlined my strong commitment to this Paid Parental Leave scheme. My position has not changed in the last year-unlike members opposite. The Rudd government's Paid Parental Leave scheme will assist women to stay connected with the workforce and their careers while they have children. In ensuring that we maximise our productivity and work effectively to tackle an ageing population, we need measures such as this to maintain our skills and our workforce. By keeping women connected to the workforce, we are helping them to continue with their careers long after having children. This is good news for business as it will save in staff training and skills loss. It is good news for women who will see an increase in life-long earnings. Since I last spoke on the 2009-10 budget, the government have continued to consult on the Paid Parental Leave scheme. We have had consultations on this issue since being elected. A further 32 consultations were undertaken following the 2009-10 budget, which made the announcement that Australia would have a paid parental leave scheme. We wanted to ensure we got the design of this scheme correct for parents and, very importantly, correct for industry. So for the first time, from 1 July 2011 many parents will have access to parental leave. We are implementing a work test, an income test and residency requirements to determine eligibility under this scheme. Eligible parents will now have access to 18 weeks parental leave and at the current rate of the national minimum wage this results in $543.78 per week before tax for 18 weeks. We will continue to support parents whether they are in paid work or at home. Parents who are not eligible under our Paid Parental Leave scheme will still have access to the baby bonus and to the family tax benefit. To be eligible for the scheme, parents need to be in paid work and have worked continuously for at least 10 of the 13 weeks prior to the expected birth or adoption date, have undertaken a minimum of 330 hours of paid work in the 10-month period prior and earn less than $150,000 annually. Following the implementation of our scheme, we have undertaken to conduct a review after its first two years. As part of this review, we will consider those Productivity Commission recommendations that were not taken up amongst other things. Our scheme is fully funded and does not create an unnecessary burden on business. I am in good company in supporting this legislation. Not only have we broad support through our consultation process but we have support from industry. The CEO of Australian Industry Group, Heather Ridout, has called the Rudd government's scheme a ‘sensible approach'. She said: A taxpayer funded scheme providing payments to working mothers of 18 weeks of leave at the minimum wage, is consistent with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission and is largely consistent with Australian Industry Group's proposals. The introduction of an appropriately designed paid parental leave scheme will provide many benefits to the community, not least of which is increased participation by women in the workforce. Increased participation is vital to address Australia's ageing population and growing skill shortages as the economy continues to recover. Australian Industry Group has also said: Superannuation obligations around paid maternity leave had been an issue of concern for employers and it's good that the Government has indicated that employers will not be required to pay superannuation on the Paid Parental Leave entitlements. This is a positive response from one of the major industry bodies in Australia. But who else supports our scheme? The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia former CEO Jaye Radisich has said: What this scheme means is that life is going to be easier for a lot of people. We can do nothing but support that. Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick said: That's got to be good for Mums, it's got to be good for babies and ultimately, it's got to be good for our country. ACTU President Sharon Burrow has said: This is a magical moment. To see a piece of legislation with paid parental leave on the front of the cover is a 30-year, long-awaited moment of justice for working women. And we've got a message to Tony Abbott. Don't you dare; don't you dare oppose this legislation. It is also important to note the hard work of Sharon, along with the trade union movement, in running a very strong campaign for paid parental leave over a long period. The New South Wales Commissioner for Children and Young People, Gillian Calvert, has said: Research shows the continuous interaction between baby and parent in the baby's first 12 months of life shapes the brain wiring-affecting how a child regulates emotions, communicates, solves problems, thinks logically and reacts to the world. Senator Xenophon has said: When you consider the social benefit in giving mums paid maternity leave, I think it's a good thing to do right now, irrespective of the fact that things are relatively tough. Even the member for Indi has also spoken about the need for a paid parental leave scheme, including how urgent it is, and she stated in parliament that: The Labor Party cannot come up with any funding for a paid parental leave scheme about which it has built such high expectations. Well, member for Indi, here we are, debating legislation for a fully-funded paid maternity leave scheme. She also said: They have included paid parental leave in this year's budget even though they are delaying it. Again, here we are, putting this scheme in place. If the member for Indi is so concerned about the rollout of a paid parental scheme then she may wish to work with her parliamentary colleagues to ensure they do not block this bill. She may wish to remind the Leader of the Opposition that his alternative has not had adequate consultation with stakeholders and has not been well received by the community or by businessMs Plibersek interjecting",51
30,Ms KING,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"Or any consultation. I was being generous there, member for Sydney. The Leader of the Opposition's plan for the paid parental leave scheme that he is so committed to and that is so important got only one line in his budget-in-reply speech. I think most of the business community have come out and said fairly roundly that the tax that he proposes to impose on business is not something that they support at all. It is interesting that he cannot even bring himself to say the word ‘tax'. He has used the kinder word ‘levy'. However, it is a tax; it is a 1.7 per cent tax on industry to pay for the opposition's paid parental leave scheme. The Leader of the Opposition should have been speaking with industry. It has strongly rejected his business tax. Mr Abbott's 1.7 per cent levy will tax thousands of businesses right across the country. What do others think of the Leader of the Opposition's plan? The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry stated: [the] proposal by the Leader of the Opposition to impose a new levy on larger businesses to fund a paid parental leave scheme is an unfair impost which will not be well received by Australian employers. Taxing businesses to fund social policy is double counting given that employers already contribute substantially to Commonwealth revenues. Doing so for paid parental leave purposes is contrary to independent analysis released by the Productivity Commission which found that schemes such as these should be funded through general revenue given that the primary beneficiaries are the employees concerned rather than their employers. The ACCI went on to say: Business will seek further information from the Opposition but will not support a tax on business of this type, nor a bidding war between Government and Opposition at the expense of the business bottom line. If I can say this to ACCI: I wish them well in seeking further information from the Leader of the Opposition. So far, we have clearly seen a lack of details on the part of members opposite. If ACCI do manage to get details of the coalition's plan, absolutely make sure you have it in writing. The Australian Industry Group, another leading business group, has stated that, under the Leader of the Opposition's plan, the costs on business are just far too great. Ai Group CEO Heather Ridout has stated, in relation to the coalition's paid parental leave policy: … it puts a huge cost on big companies. It anti the employment of women. It will be-it'll cause a bias towards the employment of men. That is a substantial policy failing with the opposition's scheme. In terms of tax policy, it will deter investment in the sense that, in Australia, we already have a high reliance on capital taxes such as company tax compared with other countries. Small to medium sized economies like ours are reducing their company tax rate, not putting it up. Thatputting it up-will deter investment in Australia and particularly in sectors that are not going to be among the big darlings of the mining boom. If the Leader of the Opposition does not want to listen to industry then he should have a chat with his party room colleagues because, as we heard on Tuesday, some want to abolish his business tax and support our plan. While on this side of the House we want to support industry by reducing company tax from 30 per cent to 28 per cent, the Leader of the Opposition has said that he will not support a reduction in company tax but instead impose a great big new tax on business. He wants to increase business taxes to pay for his unfunded paid parental leave scheme. The Rudd government have had a consistent position on paid parental leave for a very long time. We have been advocates of such a scheme for a very long time. The member for Sydney, who is at the table, has been a very strong and loud advocate for such a scheme not just during her political career but prior to entering parliament. We have not shied away from this issue. We have been open and transparent on it from the start. Yet, members opposite have failed to let the Australian people know their policy on paid parental leave. Actually, I stand corrected; they have spoken about numerous positions on it. Their positions include not supporting our scheme, introducing their own scheme that taxes small business and-my favourite, which is will be this week's position-some member's support us and others do not know what they are going to support at the end of the day. I will be very interested to see when the vote comes on this bill what members opposite decide to do. I am proud to be part of the Rudd government because it is the only government that has shown the commitment to introduce a paid parental leave scheme across Australia. It is all very well for the coalition to talk about a paid parenting scheme while in opposition-and they have been in opposition for only a couple of years-after they have had 12 years in government to do something about it. While our country has achieved so much in its short history, it has been a long time coming in finally catching up with other major economies in terms of support for paid parental leave. It is not good enough that we are one of only two OECD countries that do not have a comprehensive paid parental leave scheme. I urge every one of the members opposite to support this bill. I urge them to subsequently lobby their party room colleagues in the Senate. I want to finish by recognising the hard work of Minister Macklin and that of many groups across the country who have worked tirelessly to see this country get a national paid parental scheme. The scheme is practical; it is measured. We have broadly consulted with all stakeholders. Also, we have broad support for this scheme among the Australian community and business, but those opposite do not. This is a great moment for Australian families. I am very proud to support this bill and I commend it to the House.",54
31,Mr CHESTER,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"Gippsland) (11.58 am)I rise to speak on the somewhat modestly titled Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010. Given this government's penchant for hyperbole, surely it could have squeezed ‘super parenting' or ‘baby revolution' somewhere in the headline. I would like to stress from the outset that I am not opposed to the principle of paid parental leave but I do have some reservations about the bill before the House and the current public debate on some of the alternative approaches. I note that the bill does help to recognise the important role that women play in our workforce. Certainly the criteria in the legislation recognises casual workers and farmers, and that will be well received in regional areas. I believe this is a positive, if modest, first step, but it presents more questions for the mature national debate that we will need to have in the years and months ahead. This debate on paid parental leave legislation is of more interest to Australian families than many of the more abstract pieces of legislation which come before the House. Other speakers have already touched on the fact that it goes to the heart of the most important job, the most rewarding job and perhaps the toughest job that most of us will ever dothat is, raising our children. The interests of children must be paramount in the decisions we make about supporting families in our community, and it is from this perspective that I make my contribution to the debate today. As I indicated, I have several reservations about the bill. My concerns relate to a few key areas: equity and fairness, an apparent preference for one form of motherhood over another and the long-term impacts on the social and economic life of our communities. I, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, am a regionally based MP, and I suspect that I therefore approach this legislation from a different perspective to those of many of my suburban counterparts. That is an important distinction to make in this debate. In regional areas, we depend more heavily on volunteers, have higher transport costs to attend our community and sporting events and have less access to full-time or high-paying jobs, all of which are important factors when considering any system of paid parental leave, one of which is the subject of public debate at the moment. On the positive side, though, in regional areas we have more affordable housing, which often means it is more achievable for a family to meet its financial obligations with one partner working and the other remaining at home as the primary carer for the children, probably with some casual or part-time work to increase the household income during the early years of a child's life. It is from this perspective that I raise my key concerns with equity and fairness and the not-so-subtle message that this legislation sends to the community, either intentionally or inadvertently. It does not really matter whether the message is intentional but this legislation sends a message that the government values one form of motherhood more highly than another. In her second reading speech on this bill, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs basically concedes my point: Eligible families will be able to choose whether to take paid parental leave or the baby bonus, according to their individual circumstances. The government estimates that more than 85 per cent of families will be better off taking parental leave. These families will, on average, receive around $2,000 more than if they chose the baby bonus. This is after tax has been paid and all interactions with other family assistance have been taken into account. The key points here are the phrase ‘eligible families' and the sum of $2,000. Under this scheme, if you have met the workforce eligibility criteria-that is, you have worked continuously for at least 10 of the 13 months before the birth or adoption of the child involved and at least 330 hours in that period-you will receive more money from the government than a stay-at-home mum. I use the term ‘mum' rather than ‘parent' because, in the overwhelmingly majority of families we are talking about, the mother will undertake the primary care in the first months of a baby's life. It is my contention that this is unfair and inequitable to stay-at-home mums and sends a message to the community that the government places more value on the offspring of working mothers than on the offspring of stay-at-home mothers. I am not saying that this is the government's intention, but the message is clear. By providing an additional government funded payment to the mothers of babies in the paid workforce, we are sending that message. I do not understand the logic of that position. Both mums forgo income to have their child and both face increased costs associated with setting up their home for the new arrival. The eligibility criteria and the situation facing parents becomes almost farcical if they have subsequent children. We risk creating a yo-yo effect, where mums will return to work briefly to achieve the workforce criteria in order to pick up the extra $2,000 on offer from the government, and that is not in the best interests of either the child or the mother. My view is that we should be supporting and encouraging a parent-more than likely, as I paid said, the mother-to remain at home longer after having a child. Again I refer to the minister's second reading speech: Paid parental leave will give babies the best start in life. It means one parent has the financial security to take time off work to care for their baby at home during the vital early months of their baby's life. It will give mothers time to recover from birth and bond with their baby. The references to ‘babies', ‘months' and ‘bonding' simply do not gel with me. It is not just the vital early months we should be talking about but also the vital early years-the bonding process is certainly not completed in 18 weeks. I do not contend that the minister is suggesting that at all, but I think we should be careful not to get too carried away with the legislation before the House as if it were some panacea for the issues facing working mothers and stay-at-home mothers. I believe it is critical that we recognise that Australian families come in all shapes and sizes. It is difficult to legislate in any way that provides the fairness and equity that I am talking about, but this legislation clearly discriminates against stay-at-home mothers. That being the case, it is reasonable to ask, ‘Does that really matter?' In my opinion, it certainly does. It is my view that the ideal environment for children to spend their formative years in is a loving family home with one of the parents in the role of primary carer for an extended period. That view is the subject of constant debate and research, but it is relevant to the comments I make here today. I argue that the interests of children are best served when one of the parents has the role of primary carer, at least until the child starts school. I do not believe that outsourcing to childcare centres the majority of the care of children in their early years is the ideal situation, particularly if children are attending formalised care for upwards of 30 to 40 hours per week from a very early stage in their lives. Some may argue-and I am sure plenty will-that this is an old fashioned view of the world. I am happy to have that debate at another time, and it is an important debate to have in the context of this and other legislation which promotes a government sanctioned model of motherhood. Under this legislation and under our system of rebates for child care, the mother who decides to stay at home and look after her own children is financially disadvantaged in terms of the comparative level of support offered by the government. This has been a gradual and bipartisan process over many years. We now have a government sanctioned model of motherhood which promotes a view that mums should go back into the workplace as soon as possible, probably within months and not years of giving birth. I would have less of a problem if this were a fair and equitable system where all mums, subject to income and assets tests where relevant, were treated equally. But it simply is not. I hesitate to use an emotional term such as ‘social engineering', but there is a strong element of that in both this legislation and previous legislation dealing with income support for families. I do not seek to force my preferred model of parenting and motherhood onto my community, but the government does through these decisions that provide more financial support for working mums than for stay-at-home mums. Our government sanctioned system of raising children rewards people who send their children to outsourced care over those people who adopt a system of parental care. We seem to be promoting a culture that places more value on becoming a productive member of the economy by returning to paid work than on parents who make the decision to raise their own children rather than outsource a significant part of that responsibility to some type of formal child care. We are sending a message that our government values your economic contribution more than your contribution to raising well-adjusted, responsible and resilient children. I stress that I strongly support measures to assist women to have productive and meaningful careers. That is not an issue. I think the increased participation in the workforce by women over the past 30 years has been an overwhelmingly positive development and assisted in creating greater financial independence for women in our community. It is important that women stay engaged in the workforce, update their skills and be involved in training wherever possible during their child-rearing years. It is important because it helps to provide mothers with the confidence to return to the workforce at a later stage and keeps them connected with their work colleagues. There are also some real benefits in terms of increased lifelong earnings, a subject that has been discussed by members on both sides already today. When it comes to government funding for policies assisting with the raising of children I fear that we are heading in the wrong direction-and I am not the only one who has reservations. I refer to a joint submission made by the Australian Family Association and the Kids First Parent Association of Australia to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The two organisations presented similar arguments to the ones I have raised today. They said: The scheme would unfairly discriminate by giving an average 37% more birth funding to subsidise wages and support families with paid work mothers, than to families whose mothers make a career and childcare choice for parental care. The submission calls in its recommendations for an equal parent benefit: The federal government should redistribute birth support and ongoing day-today childcare subsidies direct to parents through a single Parent Benefit to recognise that every family gives up income to pay for childcare. This would give the same funding to every child in the relevant age group, to free families to choose parent care, grandparent care, daycare or other care from birth. They also argued that the government has not accurately modelled the true net cost to the community if more mothers move from community and charity work to paid work as a result of this scheme. This is a key issue in regional communities. I confess that I have no real knowledge of the suburban experience, but let me tell you what happens in regional areas like Gippsland. One partnernormally the male partner-will have full time work after a child has been born, and the mother will be home with a couple of children. For the sake of the debate, let us say one is at primary school and other is two years old. The stay at home mum does not spend her time cooking scones or having coffee with other mums in the same situation; she is called on constantly to assist with a whole range of community activities. You will quite often find young mothers taking remedial reading classes in our primary schools-classes not even involving their own children. They are often called on to do that kind of work in the education sector. I would dread to think what would happen if our government had to pay for the number of hours mothers in particular and some fathers are putting into our education sector, supporting disadvantaged students just with reading classes and providing extra support to teachers in the classroom. It is a very practical example of what stay at home mums tend to be doing in whatever spare time they have. These mums are often called on to ferry children to community and sporting activities after school-and in regional areas a lot of the time it tends to be a car-pooling situation where the mother driving will be ferrying working mums' kids around. There is no angst about that in my community; it is a simple fact of life that some of the mothers are working full time and they have to make a whole range of arrangements to get their children to, for example, sporting activities. Again, it is the stay at home mums who tend to pick up that load. It is an important contribution that they make in their own right to the community. Stay at home mums have more time to be involved in parent clubs or the school canteen or the school council, and they also cop the job of washing the Auskick footy jumpers at the end of the weekend. These are all practical contributions these mothers are making to our community, and I do not believe we are recognising that in the context of this legislation. I should not even be using the term stay at home mums, as it suggests they are sitting around playing Lego with the kids when in fact they are out there working just as hard as anyone else and they are making an enormous direct contribution to the well-being of regional communities like those in Gippsland. These are direct and tangible benefits to the community that can only be achieved when these mothers have some spare time to assist with school, charity and sporting groups. The flexibility to choose the form of child care which suits individual families is a critical issue for our nation, but the decision to reward one form of parenting more highly than another runs the risk of pushing more families in the direction the government wants to take. I believe regional community life will suffer as a result in the longer term. If the paid parental leave legislation acts as an incentive for more mums to return to work sooner, then communities will inevitably lose a reliable source of volunteers for a wide range of important initiatives. If mothers feel compelled to return to work more quickly after their first child in order to ify for the paid parental leave for any subsequent child, we will have the yo-yo effect I referred to earlier where family life will be disrupted, and in my view children will be adversely affected, as the routine of families is compromised. As I said at the outset, I am not opposed to paid parental leave, but I am opposed to any system that discriminates against one form of motherhood over another. I count myself extremely fortunate that I was brought up, and I have been able to bring up my own children, in a country town where it has been possible for a relatively modest single income family to meet its financial obligations. I accept that is not always possible in today's society, and for various social and economic reasons many families require two incomes just to survive. I accept all those points; they have been well made by speakers on both sides of the House. I would contend, however, that some families could lower their financial obligations by reducing some of their material wealth aspirations, but that is an entirely separate issue. We could debate that for hours on end. It is a regrettable fact of life in many that two incomes are essential, and I accept the need for a system of paid parental leave. But returning to work and putting children into child care often creates a giant moneygo-round where no-one is happy. The mum tends to feel guilty because she wants to spend more time with her kids at a young age; the young children can be disadvantaged from extended stays in child care; and the financial benefits of two incomes are eroded by the costs of child care, which incidentally are about to increase under this government's reduced subsidy. The whole worklife balance discussion is a national debate of importance that is directly related to this legislation before us. We are all torn by the desire to spend more time with our families but qualstill meet our financial commitments. The explosion in housing prices and cost of living increases make it difficult, if not impossible, for some families to survive economically without two incomes. Without question-and this is a positive outcome-this legislation will provide some additional assistance for some workers who have missed out in the past, particularly low-income workers. Families which choose to have one parent stay at home face similar costs and are also forgoing income. It lacks logic to suggest that they are somehow less deserving of government support. I refer to the $2,000 sum that the minister in her second reading speech indicated would be the cost-benefit, if you like, of choosing between the baby bonus and the Paid Parental Leave scheme. Of course, the scheme is only available to those mothers who meet the workforce criteria. I do welcome the government's commitment to undertake a review of the impact of this legislation in the months and years ahead, as I believe the big issue we are really not doing enough about is the cost of living pressures and concerns over affordable housing. I do not believe policies such as this, which are areas designed to push women back into the workforce, often before they are ready, will necessarily address the core of the problem we are presented with in our community. We do need to be developing policies which make it affordable for more parents to take on the primary caring role, rather than pushing more kids into child care and more mums back into the workplace regardless of their personal preference. Flexibility and choice are key issues in this debate, and I fully support a family's right to decide that both partners need to return to work. But let us not delude ourselves into thinking that there are no consequences as a result of that decision. Paid parental leave will guide some families to that decision, but this is a much bigger issue than providing 18 weeks pay at the federal minimum wage. This is about looking after the interests of children, keeping families together and building stronger communities. As I said earlier, parenting is by far the toughest and most rewarding job any of us will ever do. If the community and the government consider it is important to provide financial support to assist families, should be equally distributed to all families.",56
32,Ms MCKEW,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local government) (12.15 pm)-It is a proud day for me to be able to speak to the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 to introduce Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. This is a long-awaited reform that will massively benefit the working women of Australia. I must say I have been outspoken on this issue of paid parental leave for my entire working life, but now the talk is coming to an end and the legislating is beginning. I acknowledge first and foremost the tireless work and advocacy of the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. In a policy sense, this is very much her baby, although many of us in this place have a sense of maternal pride in this bill. It is important to note that Labor's Paid Parental Leave scheme has had a careful and very considered gestation period that has brought us to where we are today. The Rudd government has seen this scheme through a Productivity Commission inquiry, through last year's budget announcement and through extensive consultations with the community, with business, with family groups, with industry groups and with unions, and I think the minister's patience and dedication has been something of a marvel. From my work in the early childhood portfolio, I know how important the early years are in setting up children for life. Learning, as we all know, begins at birth. If mothers are stressed and anxious about a premature return to work, that is a less than ideal start for them and for their young babies. There is certainly a social and an economic dividend in allowing mothers to be given more time to connect with their children. As the Deputy Prime Minister, Julia it Gillard, pointed out yesterday, independent modelling undertaken by Econtech shows that the government's fully funded 18-week maternity leave scheme could result in an additional 126,000 jobs each year on average to 2040. Let me also acknowledge the work of the member for Hasluck, who I know is also due to speak on this debate. The member for Hasluck is a champion for women in this House. Her work on gender pay equity, through the Making it fair report, is a very important benchmark-and haven't we been talking about the issue of pay equity for years as well. For decades, actually! Back in 1975, I remember, in my previous life as a journalist, producing numerous news stories around the United Nations International Women's Year. The hot issues then, in 1975, were affordable child care, pay equity and paid maternity leave. As we progressed through those decades, certainly the equal pay cases of the 1970s were important. Then there were the big reforms of the HawkeKeating governments centring on sex discrimination legislation and the creation of the Affirmative Action Agency. But, even after these significant reforms, we still have a situation today where women earn around 82c to the male dollar. This situation explains the very hard work that the Rudd government is doing on what I would call the big troika: affordable child care, paid parental leave and pushing on gender pay equity. And when you consider the combined work across many ministries-be it the work of the families minister, the Deputy Prime Minister or the Minister for the Status of Women-there is only one conclusion you can draw: the Rudd government is not only a government of great women; it is also a great government for women. When I think back over my own working life, I recall that in 1975 my female colleagues at the ABC, along with those in other government agencies, were able to access Public Service maternity leave provisions. But for our sisters in other industries it was much longer wait. By 2007 around 54 per cent of female employees and 50 per cent of male employees had access to some form of paid parental leave, but only one-third of employed women who actually had children received paid parental leave from their employer. Of course, the women left out were low-income workers-women who worked in child care, in retail and in cleaning industries. These women will be the real beneficiaries of this legislation. The beauty of what is proposed is the government's 18 weeks parental leave at the minimum wage will come on top of existing industrial arrangements that working women have already won. Primary carers will be able to take the government's paid parental leave concurrently or sequentially. In other words, they can take their employer's leave, where it exists, and the government's leave at the same time. Alternately, they can ‘stack' it, taking their employer's leave first and then the government's 18 weeks on the minimum wage afterwards. All but the highest paid women in the workforce-those earning $150,000 or more a year-will have the opportunity to access this basic entitlement. Labor's Paid Parental Leave scheme is fair for families and, importantly, it is very fair for business. Everyone knows what to expect. Labor has delivered a balanced, considered scheme of up to 18 weeks at the minimum wage for women who give birth or those who adopt a child. This leave will be available to all primary carers who meet the eligibility criteria of work, income and residency tests. The payment will also be transferable to the other parent or carer in exceptional circumstances. It is a fully costed, fully funded, responsible scheme. I note that there have been a number of a third parties who have appreciated the government's steady hand through these consultations. Jaye Radisich, the CEO of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, COSBOA, had this to say: What this scheme means is that life is going to be easier for a lot of people. We can do nothing but support that. He said the paid maternity leave scheme will not mean an added burden for business. The Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group, Heather Ridout, told the Sydney Morning Herald last year that this is exactly the sort of scheme that business wants to support: Over time it will prove to be another step in getting participation up in the economy. That is a very important point because, as we know from the material in the Intergenerational report, the future needs of the Australian economy are in many ways reliant on a significant boost in the female participation rate and paid parental leave has a very important part to play in this. These are just a few endorsements. There are many, many more. Locally, in my own electorate of Bennelong, the head of the Ryde Business Forum, Andrew Bland, told me last year this is just the kind of business-friendly approach that his small law firm needs. Andrew and his wife gave up careers in one of the big top-tier law firms in the city. What they did was set up a small practice in North Ryde. Andrew and his wife employ five women, all working mums, in an overall staff of seven. Andrew told me that they see a familyfriendly workplace of the type that he and his wife have crafted as absolutely central to their business success and being able to have a life and engage in professional experience as well and that the government scheme is just what his firm needs. I think it is worth pointing out as well that the government's new Fair Work system complements the Paid Parental Leave arrangements with 12 months unpaid parental leave for new parents-one of the 10 legislated National Employment Standards which came into effect on 1 January this year. Also there is a parent's right to request flexible work arrangements like returning to work part time or an additional 12 months of unpaid leave to help care for children under school age. These provisions sit very well together. They are complementary. I stress that employers like Labor's scheme because it allows them to retain valued skilled staffand that is of course a cost saver. If you are not constantly going out in the market to recruit extra people after the loss of staff that certainly a cost saver for business. If the government can successfully pass this bill through the parliament, and I certainly hope it does, eligible primary carers will be able to lodge their claims through the Family Assistance Office from 1 October this year. For families who are not eligible, the baby bonus as it exists now and the family tax benefit will still be there-a very important point. The introduction of legislation on Australia's first universal paid parental scheme is a historic and overwhelmingly positive occasion. However, I have to note there are no guarantees here. This bill is not yet through the parliament. I was pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition admit earlier in the debate that he had been wrong for all these years in his personal opposition to paid parental leave. I do wish he had told me that when we were having lunch at the invitation of the Bulletin magazine just a few years ago because, boy, would I have had a great scoop! It would have been on the front page-‘Tony Abbott supports paid parental leave'-because certainly at the time that is not what he was telling others. As many have noted, this is the same man who said that paid maternity leave would happen over his dead body. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-He said he'd changed his mind.",61
33,Ms MCKEW,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"Indeed, yes, he did say that. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-He'd changed his mind. He'd listened to his wife and children. Some of us have them.",63
34,Ms MCKEW,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"I have heard that, but I have also heard what he has said in the past, and what we have to ask now is: is this the gospel truth? It is one thing for the Leader of the Opposition to stand up and say this now, and I hope he is right on this, but we do know that he is already burdened by the fact is that Australian women do not really trust him on a lot of these issues. I know that Australian women actually nurse a suspicion, well founded, that the Leader of the Opposition is likely to be just a bit too intrusive when it comes to how women manage their day-today lives. Modern women do not want a bar of this. So I think the Leader of the Opposition has belatedly dreamt up a paid parental leave scheme of his own, one which is not entirely supported by his party but one which he says is bigger and better and will be funded by big business. It is a reckless and irresponsible scheme that slugs big business, who will no doubt have to pass the costs on. Fundamentally, the opposition leader has failed to the case for the design of his scheme, which will include women on high incomes of $150,000 or more, who do not need government support, and be funded by a tax on business. As for the women who will get this maternity leave payment, those on $150,000 income will get a considerable payment far in excess, by the way, of the payment made to stay at home mothers, who will be getting the baby bonus of $5,000. That is an interesting point for the Leader of the Opposition to ponder as so many members on his own side have raised the question of financial adequacy for stay at home mothers, which Labor is determined to preserve by retaining the baby bonus. It is not beyond belief that what we are seeing from the Leader of the Opposition is perhaps a cynical delaying tactic to try to hobble the scheme that the minister for families and others have patiently progressed over the last few years. But now we have the Leader of the Opposition saying that the bill needs to be enacted soon and he will not oppose the government scheme. Well, if he is fair dinkum he will commit to passing this bill through the parliament before it rises for the winter recess. Let us hope we see that. I think the young families across Australia who have waited for so long deserve that certainty. With pride, with hope and with great enthusiasm, I therefore commend the bill to the House.",63
35,Mr ANDREWS,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"I rise to speak on the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and the cognate bill. These bills seek to legislate Labor's second-rate Paid Parental Leave scheme, a scheme that is far from optimal and has been rushed. Implementation of this will have a detrimental impact and will throw even more red tape on Australia's hard working small-business operators. Let me be clear: I believe that providing meaningful and equitable support to families is of make critical importance. Such support promotes healthy families and healthy relationships. As the Early years report to the Ontario government found, parenting itself is a critical element of early childhood development and must be supported from the earliest possible stage of the development of the child. A paid parental leave scheme would no doubt contribute to that end. Indeed, I had genuinely hoped that the government would have delivered a better, more thought-out and more family-friendly scheme than that which Labor has served up on this occasion. Much has been said about parents and work in this debate, but isn't it primarily about our concern that our children be raised in supportive and caring environments? The government's bills fall well short of ensuring that all Australian families are provided flexibility so that parents are able to choose what is right for their individual circumstances, whether they are at home or in the paid workforce. In her important study, Work-lifestyle choices in the 21st century, Catherine Hakim, a senior research fellow at the London School of Economics, suggests that women are not a homogenous group but three distinct groups with different patterns of behaviours and different responses to policies. According to Hakim: A minority of women have no interest in employment, careers, or economic independence, and do not plan to work long term unless things go seriously wrong for them. Their aim is to marry as well as they can and give up paid employment to become full-time homemakers and mothers. The group includes highly educated women as well as those who do not get any qualifications. In contrast, other women actively reject the sexual division of labor in the home, expect to work full time and continuously throughout life, and prefer symmetrical roles for husband and wife rather than separate roles. The third groupwhich she describes as ‘adaptive women'is numerically dominant: women who are determined to combine employment and family work, so become secondary earners. They may work full-time early in life, but later switch to part-time jobs on a semipermanent basis, and/or to intermittent employment. In her more recent study Models of the family in modern societies, Hakim confirms her theory by examining work preferences in Europe, particularly Spain and the UK. Her conclusions are reflected in numerous surveys and by family and work choices in Australia. Based on Parliamentary Library data, we know that about 25 per cent of families with children are headed by a couple with one partner working full time and one partner at home full time; another 25 per cent of families are headed by a couple with one partner working full time and one working part time; about 27 per cent of families have both partners working full time; in six per cent of families neither partner has a job; and 23 per cent of families are headed by a sole parent, of whom about 38 per cent are jobless. The adaptive approach of families to work is also illustrated in the work choices of families with children. Of partnered women aged 35 to 39, 78 per cent of those with no children work full time, compared to 12 per cent who work part time or are not in the workforce. However, only 27 per cent of women with children under 15 work full time, compared to 37 per cent who work part time or are not in the labor force. For those with children over 15, 41 per cent work full time, while 34 per cent either work part time or are not in the labour force. If this analysis of the choices that parents make about family and work is correct, policies that impact upon the 60 per cent or more of women who are adaptive in their workfamily lifestyles are the most likely to provide the choice that families desire. Hakim rightly argues that the role of government is not to favour any of these families. The goal is government neutrality towards all families. These observations suggest that parents should have flexibility and choice in their family and work arrangements. Such choice is not just about the hours worked at any one time but about the arrangements they make over the course of their lives. While a library of books has been written about the so-called ‘time bind', to adopt Arlie Russell Hochschild's well-known title, little has been written about the work-family balance over the life course. The emphasis is on short-term, paid maternity leave, or parental leave, for those in the workforce, but that ignores the reality that parents balance their work and family responsibilities between them over decades, not just a few weeks or a few months after the birth of a child. The life course approach is all the more important with the delay in partnering, the increase in longevity and the ageing of our population. Labor's scheme does not sufficiently recognise that parents have different patterns of family responsibilities and paid work over their life cycle. Moreover, the economic circumstances in which Australian families currently find themselves, namely the increasing costs of living and a housing affordability crisis, as well as interest rate rises, have led to more families requiring two incomes just to make ends meet. The length of paid parental leave now available to parents through private enterprise and the Public Service varies greatly from a few days to 18 weeks. Few schemes meet the widely acknowledged ideal leave period of a full six months. The government has chosen not to adopt the internationally recognised standard of six months but has chosen to legislate for 18 weeks, which the Productivity Commission recommended with the strong expectation that employers would top up the leave entitlement to make up the 26 weeks. But that is problematic. This extra time would be made up with annual leave or long service leave paid for by the woman's employer and would therefore not be available to all working women-for example, those working in casual jobs, who would not have any accrued leave. The bills impose an additional administrative burden on small business, requiring employers to act as paymasters, having to pay the government's parental leave to employees who are participating. These same small businesses will be liable for state roll tax for the employee on leave as well as for their replacement. But Labor's second-rate scheme is no great surprise. Let us not forget that this is the same government which is pursuing, in part, an antifamily agenda: stripping funding, slashing appropriations and reducing services that assist families to stay together save marriages. A total of $50 million of family related funding has been slashed in this budget. This same minister has designed a scheme which is so complex that even yesterday evening, when the member for Murray and I received a briefing about this legislative package, the minister's own departmental officials could not answer simple questions about the operation of the bill. They could not advise, for example, how self-employed mothers would be treated under the proposed new legislation. And while the minister has rushed to get this bill into the House-to get it on the agenda in an election year so she can make up for her failure to look after Australian families-her officials have confirmed the accompanying rules will not be ready until at least 1 October this year. It is, therefore, unsurprising that the government is allowing a six-month moratorium on businesses having to make payments to employees so that these details can be ironed out. But there is no guarantee that this government-notorious for its widespread, costly and detrimental public policy failures-can effectively deliver such a scheme. The coalition recognises that a paid parental leave scheme is only one part of the role of government in supporting families as they raise the next generation of Australians. Public policy discussions on this issue have been had around the world. Indeed, beginning in the 1930s, Sweden introduced policies that enabled women to maintain their position in the paid workforce whilst having children. pay- The coalition has now put forward its proposed system, which is in stark contrast to Labor's second-rate scheme. Moreover, we have said that paid parental leave is only one part of family policy and that policy must recognise all parents, whether in the paid work force at a particular time or not. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (12.39 pm)-I rise and to speak in support of the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and cognate bill. Can I say how proud I am to be part of a government that is delivering a paid parental leave scheme for the first time ever in this country. This bill will benefit many workers and many families across this country. This bill introduces Australia's first national, government funded, paid parental leave scheme from 1 January 2011. Parental leave pay will be provided for up to 18 weeks at the national minimum wage and be paid to eligible primary carers who have or adopt a child on or after 1 January 2011 and who can satisfy work, income and residency tests. In most cases the mother will be the primary carer, but allowance is also made for transfers of all or part of the payment to the other parent or to another carer in exceptional circumstances. From 1 July 2011 parental leave pay may be claimed through the Family Assistance Office up to three months before the birth or adoption. The government will fund employers to pay their eligible long-term employees as part of the scheme. Eligible claimants who are not paid by their employers will be paid by the Family Assistance Office. This bill also contains integrity provisions, such as compliance rules for employers and right of review for employees to ensure that parental leave pay is paid to eligible parents in a timely manner. Any delays, disputes or debts that may arise in the payment process will be managed appropriately by the Family Assistance Office and the Fair Work Ombudsman, depending on who is making payments. Other family payments, such as the baby bonus and the family tax benefit, will remain available for families not eligible for the scheme and for those who choose not to participate in the scheme. An eligible parent could also receive family tax benefit part A while participating in the scheme. This bill is part of a package of bills which will include the consequential amendments to related legislation, including family assistance, income tax and child support. This package of bills will provide necessary consequential amendments and transitional arrangements associated with the introduction of what will become the new Paid Parental Leave Act 2010, including phasing in the participation of employers in the scheme. Employers may opt to provide any eligible employee with parental leave pay from 1 January 2011. The requirement for employers to pay parental leave pay to their eligible long-term employees will take effect from 1 July 2011. I said before that this will provide a significant benefit for families across this country. This is long overdue. Australia has been one of only two OECD countries, along with the United States of America, which do not have a comprehensive paid parental leave scheme. The Rudd government's decision is historic. We have committed $731 million over five years to Australia's first comprehensive paid parental leave scheme from 1 January 2011. The scheme will cost approximately $260 million per annum and provide paid parental leave to approximately 148,000 new parents per year. We have heard from a number of members on the other side about their views on paid parental leave. Before I comment on some of the views that have been expressed here today in speaking on this bill, I think it is important that we go back and look at the past comments and views of those who we have already heard from today. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, is now out there espousing the importance of paid parental leave. But the reality is that he has always opposed paid parental leave, even saying that he would see it introduced over the Howard government's dead body. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-But he listened to his wife and children. Mrs D'ATH-I understand that the Leader of the Opposition has been married for more than 12 months. He is suddenly listening to his wife and children now, rather than listening to them over the last decadethat is my point to those on the other side who seek to interject. I think it is wonderful that any member would listen to their partner in relation to the importance of issues such as this. But I suggest that that discussion should have been had and those listening skills exercised well before now. As a working mother I am very proud of the experience I bring to this parliament, but we do have a new position. The coalition has put out a wonderful paid parental leave consultation document-The coalition's direct action plan on paid parental leave. It says that paid parental leave ought to be part and parcel of any decent system of employment entitlements, such as sick pay, holiday pay and retirement benefits. I totally agree that paid parental leave should form part and parcel of any decent system of employment entitlements.",64
36,Unknown,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"Honourable members interjectingMrs D'ATH-But, again, let us look at what",68
37,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"Order! Under section 65, the member is entitled to be heard without noise, disturbance or interruption. Mrs D'ATH-I refer this House to what has been said by the Leader of the Opposition and to his understanding of what a ‘decent system of employment entitlements' is. Tony Abbott has said that Work Choices was good for wages, jobs and workers. He claims that Work Choices was good because it was improved and that he would not rule out bringing back Work Choices but just rule out the phrase ‘Work Choices'. The Leader of the Opposition claims that getting rid of Work Choices actually hurt jobs and that Work Choices would have been good during the global financial crisis. Tony Abbott was opposed to any changes to Work Choices, because he thought it could not be improved and that it improved our standard of living. The Leader of the Opposition also claimed that Work Choices was economically advantageous. When we hear those on the other side arguing about what fair and decent conditions are and their concern about women in the workforce and paid parental leave, we must consider that in light of their past statements and what they say in their current document on paid parental leave about what they consider to be decent employment entitlements. On this issue of what decent working entitlements are in the eyes of those on the other side, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, I refer the House to Tony Abbott's address in reply to the 2010 budget on 13 May. In that address the Leader of the Opposition said that the first principle of government should be to do no harm and that the coalition wants an Australia that is ‘prosperous, united and respected, where families' choices are taken seriously by government'. The Leader of the Opposition went on to say that the ‘former government's workplace reforms went too far' but ‘helped to create more than two million new jobs' and ‘lift real wages by 20 per cent'. He then stated that the coalition would ‘seek to take the unfair dismissal monkey off the back of small businesses, which are more like families than institutions'. He said: We will make Labor's transitional employment agreements that are being phased out under the Fair Work Act and Labor's individual flexibility agreements more flexible. We have faith in Australia's workers who are not as easily pushed around and exploited as the ACTU's dishonest ad campaign is already making out. The Leader of the Opposition showed in his address in reply that when they talk in their paid parental leave consultation paper about a parcel of a decent system of employment entitlements this is what they are actually talking about. Under AWAs, workers lost basic conditions without any compensation: a 64 per cent cut in annual leave loading, a 63 per cent cut in penalty rates, a 52 per cent cut in shiftwork loadings, a 51 per cent cut in overtime loadings, a 48 per cent cut in monetary allowances, a 46 per cent cut in public holiday pay, a 40 per cent cut in rest breaks and a 36 per cent cut in declared public holidays-and 22 per cent provided workers with no pay rise, some for up to five years. This is what is meant by decent working conditions, according to the opposition and its leader. We know that those most likely to be affected by changes such as these flexibility agreements are women, who are predominantly employed in casual and part-time positions. So I ask those on the other side, when they stand there arguing that their paid parental leave scheme would deliver more, to be honest with the Australian people about what they consider to be decent employment entitlements for workers in this country. There are many reasons this legislation should be introduced and passed by the House and the Senate. Women should have the choice to stay at home or to return to the workforce. Contrary to the belief of the member for Gippsland that this Paid Parental Leave scheme would force women back into the workforce, what it does is provide them with financial support that they do not have right now in this country. Some have been fortunate enough, through negotiations with their employers, to have a paid parental leave scheme, but that is not the case for every worker across the country, and that is something that this government seeks to rectify. The member for Gippsland went a little bit further in his comments about women returning to the workforce, and I totally agree with him when he says that women should have choice-absolutely; women should have choice whether they want to return to the workforce or not. But when you take that argument one step further and start saying that it is not in the interests of the child for that parent, particularly that mother, to return to the workforce then I believe that you unfairly start to place an unwarranted burden on those mothers who choose to, or who must, return to the workforce for financial reasons. I know that there are many members in this parliament right now who are working mothers. There are those who have become parents and become mothers while they have been serving as an elected representative in this House. The member for Gellibrand, the member for Sydney, the member for Ballarat and the member for Indi have all had babies while they have been members of this House. We should not judge them or in any way claim that it is not in their children's interests that they not only be great parents but also serve in this parliament-and serve their community-while they are fulfilling that important role of being a parent. We have moved beyond the argument that it is only those who stay at home that provide a good quality of life or the best upbringing for their children. It is a choice and we should not judge that choice. There is another issue that needs to be discussed when alternative positions are put forward in this debate about the Paid Parental Leave Scheme-that is, the Rudd Labor government's Paid Parental Leave Scheme is fully costed and funded. The alternative scheme proposed by the opposition is a tax. It is a tax on business. It is a 1.7 per cent tax, at a time when the Rudd Labor government is putting forward a reduction in tax to business, a two per cent reduction in company tax. To scrap the Rudd Labor government's reduction in company tax and then introduce a new tax on business would make businesses almost four per cent worse off under a coalition government. And then of course we have the denial. We have had Tony Abbott saying that his paid parental leave scheme, with a tax on business, would not create any flow-on effect of increased costs: ‘Of course not! We put a tax on big business. They will not increase their costs to smaller business, who will then not flow it on to the consumer.' Let us be real! Business has already come out and said that if Tony Abbott, in government, introduced a 1.7 per cent tax, of course that cost would flow onto their customers, and then small business would flow that cost onto their customers, the households. What we have is Tony Abbott holding out in one hand a paid parental leave scheme, saying ‘Isn't this wonderful! And, by the way, when you go to the grocery store and you buy baby formula, or nappies or anything else for your new baby, you will be paying with the other hand-because we've hit business for this paid parental leave and those costs will flow.' It is not just a denial; is misleading the Australian public to say that a 1.7 per cent tax on big business will not flow to the consumer at the end of the day. They will pay under a Tony Abbott scheme, I can guarantee that. This alternative scheme-that does not even appear to have the full backing of those on the other side-is a tactic. It is an excuse not to support this bill in this parliament right now. The fact is that the opposition have not come out and said what they are going to do with the bill, whether they are supporting it or whether they are not. If you listened to the speakers, you would certainly be led to believe they would be voting against this scheme. What I say to those opposition members who may be considering voting against this scheme is: you cannot do this to those people in the workforce who are expecting this Paid Parental Leave Scheme to be in place. They are relying on it and they are planning around this scheme. You have a responsibility to support this scheme, a scheme that will be introduced for the first time ever in this country. Be honest. As a government you had 11 years to do this. You chose not to. So just step aside and let this scheme be introduced. That is what you would do if you were a responsible opposition, but the reality is you are not a responsible opposition. You are erratic. You are a risk to workers in this country. This bill should be supported. It has my absolute support and if those opposite choose to oppose this bill they should come to the electorate of Petrie and explain to all of those women in the workforce why they oppose it.",68
38,Mr BRIGGS,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"I rise to speak on the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and cognate bill. I support the contribution made earlier today by the Leader of the Opposition-for the information of the member of Petrie, that is the official title of the member for Warringah-which was well it thought through and about a direct action policy that this side of the House will address upon coming to government. I notice the member for Petrie, while acknowledging that several members of this place have proudly had children while they have been here, referred only to the mothers in this place. There are of course some fathers in this place, who have got young children too. This is about families and not necessarily just about one parent or the other. It is worthwhile acknowledging that the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, the member for Maribyrnong, who is at the table, recently became a dad. Pressure and quite large expectations are put on fathers with young kids, particularly on those who have very strong-willed wives. This is a very important issue for the parliament to be debating and one which has been debated in the community for some time. It has been addressed largely through the market, particularly in the last 10 years, through enterprise agreements and workplace agreements starting mainly with government. Government organisations were the first to introduce into their employment agreements paid maternity leave provisions. Shortly thereafter they were followed by major big employers like banks and particularly employers who had a large female workforce, which made a lot of sense. The challenge has always been small business. Most large businesses, and I suspect a fair proportion of medium-sized businesses, today have some sort of paid maternity leave as part of their employment conditions, because if they do not they lose very high quality female workers who go to government employment or large corporations which do have paid maternity leave schemes. Ensuring that small business gets assistance to do what large businesses do themselves is one of the areas that the Leader of the Opposition addressed quite well in the opposition parental leave policy that he released a couple of months ago. Small business is never going to be able to provide for large paid maternity leave schemes. It is simply not possible, particularly in the industries where a lot of the employees are female such as retail or hairdressing and so forth. For instance, my mother-in-law and sister-in-law run a small hairdressing salon. They would never be able to have a paid maternity leave scheme without some sort of government assistance. The country has moved in the last few years from not having a government legislated paid maternity leave scheme to the point now where it is necessary that we do so. I agree very much with the Leader of the Opposition's remarks in that respect. We have moved from the time of the Howard government's approach to this issue to the new reality of the times and, therefore, I think our policy makes a lot of sense. It was a very proud record that the former government had on assistance to families. In fact, it was one of the core promises of the first-term Howard government to implement assistance to families through direct payments. Those payments increased during the time of the Howard government, directly assisting families, whether for stay-at-home mothers or for those in the workforce. There was a criticism, particularly by those on the other side and some in the bureaucracy, that the Howard government focused too much assistance on stay-at-home mothers as some of sort of old conservative ideal. I appreciate that the member for Petrie has acknowledged the contribution that stay-at-home mothers make in our society and the importance of those women having the choice. The other area where the Howard government did create better circumstances for families was in its building of an economy where a lot of jobs were created. Government never creates jobs; it creates the circumstances in which jobs can be created. In the last few years of the Howard government the jobs that were created were full-time jobs. They were not part-time and casual jobs or the sorts of jobs that we used to hear those on the other side rail against constantly. I remember a comment from the now Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs-the minister responsible for this bill-in about 2003 when she said on Meet the Press that a casual job was not a real job. The record of the Howard government, while never saying a job was not a real job, is such that most of the jobs created in the Australian economy were full time, which is much better for families because they have the certainty of ongoing employment and they have the opportunity to improve their economic circumstances. Fulltime employment is particularly important in dealing with banks and so forth. One of the proudest records of the former government was job creation and job creation for female employees. It is a very proud record. One of the impacts of the Gillard ‘fair union act' is that it reduces flexibility for employers and reduces the opportunity, particularly for females, to get full-time work. The major culprit of that for small businesses, as the shadow minister at the table, the member for Dunkley, knows all too well, was the reintroduction of the job-destroying unfair dismissal laws, which affect working women more than any other segment of the employed workforce. Women end up being forced into casual jobs as small business tries very hard to avoid being caught by the unfair dismissal burden that the ‘fair union act'implemented by the Deputy Prime Minister-has placed back around their neck. An Abbott led government will reduce that burden for small business and create the circumstances where more jobs can be created, particularly more full-time jobs. I think the bill before us is very much an encapsulation of the problem with the Rudd Labor government: they just do not think through the policies they are pursuing and they do not get the detail right. We have seen it with the insulation program, with the Green Loans Program, with the computers in schools program, with the school memorial halls program and again with this bill, which is poorly drafted, leaves a lot of questions unanswered and seemingly creates a red-tape burden for small business which will make it more difficult for small business employers. That is typical of this government, which fails to understand how small business works. While this bill is a step on the right path, it is not well drafted and it is certainly well short of the paid parental leave plan announced by the Leader of the Opposition, with the reasons for that plan very well articulated earlier today. The Liberal Party's plan will provide payment to all full-time, part-time and casual workers provided they meet the work test, the 330 hours in a 10-month period over 13 months. It will provide primary carers-in the vast majority of families, mothers, but in some circumstances fathers-with 26 weeks paid parental leave at full replacement pay, up to a maximum salary of $150,000 per annum or the federal minimum wage, whichever is greater. It will be available to all ployees, including contractors and the selfemployed, who meet the work eligibility test. It includes superannuation contributions at the mandatory rate of nine per cent, an area where the government has failed. The government talks a lot about superannuation and how it is allegedly a friend of superannuation yet fails to deliver. The coalition's plan includes two weeks of ‘use it or lose it' parental leave for the non-primary carer, usually the father, to encourage the father to support the primary carer and be with the baby in those very early weeks, which we all acknowledge to be a very important time and a fantastic time to be around. The coalition's scheme will signal to the community that taking time out of the workforce to care for children should be considered a normal part of the work-life cycle of parents. I think that is a very important element of this issue. We must encourage circumstances that ensure Australians will continue to have babies. It is important that Australia continues to have a solid birth rate, and we have a sustainable plan to do that. If you compare the Liberal Party's plan as outlined by the Leader of the Opposition with the bill before the House, you can see they are two starkly different systemsalthough they are similarly opt-in, subject to eligibility. Under the coalition's plan, the period of leave is 26 weeks, compared to Labor's 18 weeks, which is a big difference. The coalition rate of pay is at replacement wage or the federal minimum wage, whichever is greater, to a cap, which we have highlighted; Labor's rate is the minimum wage. So there is very large difference between our plan and the government's plan that is before the parliament. There have been some critics of our plan. Understandably, there are people in the community who have very strong views about this type of government assistance. emThere were some critical comments made by the member for Petrie-ill-informed comments, unsurprisingly. She was off script, which is always dangerous with the member for Petrie. The Liberal Party policy will apply a levy to a small number of businesses who have a taxable income above $5 million. The member for Petrie made some interesting comments about the flow-on effects of taxes on business which I note that, in another environment, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer denied exist. The member for Petrie made it very clear she thinks that, when you put a great big new tax on business, there are flow-on effects to other services in the economy, which is quite different from what the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are saying about their great big new tax on mining. So there have been some critics of the levy. Our position is quite clear: when we get the budget back into reasonable shape, when we pay off Labor's debt and get it back into surplus, we will be in a position to remove that levy. That is the economically responsible way to go about it. If we were not in the position of being nearly $100 billion in net debt, we would not have to apply this levy; however, we are in a position where the Labor government has spent the proceeds of the former government but also borrowed $100 billion, most of which has been wasted through ill-conceived, badly thought through and badly implemented programs. That is unfortunately a necessary element of what is an important policy announcement by the Leader of the Opposition and one that I do support-otherwise, as the shadow Treasurer pointed out, we will be in the situation where we are missing out on very productive and high-quality workers at a time when we will need more workers in our workforce. We have a challenge with our ageing population; we all know that. It is coming on us very quickly. We have a large number of baby boomers in the system who are now getting to retirement age, so it is very tant that we have these high-quality, mostly well-educated young Australian women back contributing to the economy, and they cannot possibly do that in many cases, particularly in the major cities, without some sort of assistance. Without that, they will either not have a family or be in very difficult financial circumstances. That is the reality of the age we live in, with the challenge of housing affordability, particularly for young people. This is a necessary policy, in my view, to help alleviate those costs. There are people from previous generations who do not think it is needed because they did it without any government assistance, and I understand that they have that point of view. I say to them, however, that times have changed and that it is more difficult now to cope with a single wage when having a family and we do need to take steps to ensure it is in fact affordable to have children. Then, when they have had those children, it is important to be able to get that productive capacity that is sitting there back into the economy reasonably quickly so we can continue to grow and raise our living standards, as we all like to do. So I think the Leader of the Opposition should be congratulated for pushing the envelope on this issue. He should be congratulated for understanding the needs of families in our society. He thinks deeply about these issues and he has understood not only the importance to women and young dads out there in the economy but also the impact on small business, which is a very important element of what we on this side of the chamber are proposing. It is unfortunate that the Rudd government, as usual, are so set in their ways and blinkered in their approach to this important issue that they do not see the reality of this. They do not see how this is a much better and more well-thought-through plan that can imporbe implemented as policy. They should amend this bill and change it to reflect those policy announcements by the Leader of the Opposition. Then we could have bipartisan support in this place for a very important policy area. With those few remarks, I will conclude.",70
39,Mr NEUMANN,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"I rise to speak on this historic occasion in our nation's history in terms of workforce participation, the rights of women and the role of families in our society. This is truly a wonderful initiative of the Rudd Labor government, long overdue, and those opposite should be ashamed-simply ashamed-of their inaction and inactivity during their many long years of tenure on the treasury bench. They have a disgraceful, woeful record when it comes to caring for the rights women and supporting families in our community. The Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and Paid Parental Leave (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010 introduce Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme, to commence from 1 January 2011. Eligible working families of babies born or adopted from that date next year will receive 18 weeks parental leave, paid at the federal minimum wage. This scheme, as the member for Petrie correctly pointed out, is fully costed and fully funded. We have put aside more than $250 million to assist in establishate ing Australia's first Paid Parental Leave scheme, and we have followed the Productivity Commission's recommendations. During late 2009, we had 32 consultation sessions held with over 200 key stakeholders, including employer groups, unions and other organisations, to discuss how this could happen. The recommendations of the Productivity Commission report suggest that we should undertake this type of scheme, and so we are doing it. Unlike those opposite, we are engaging in real action. Those opposite had 12 years of inaction on this topic. This Paid Parental Leave scheme will be available to all working parents, including full-time, part-time, seasonal and casual workers; contractors; the self-employed; and people who have many employers-because that is often the case; to make ends meet, people need multiple jobs on occasion. The Paid Parental Leave Bill is particularly important to me as the father of two daughters at university, one 19 and the other nearly 21-both aspire to working lives and to careers in the future-and as someone who was in small business for more than 20 years. We have many on this side of the House who have experience in small business: the member for Forde, the member for Makin, the member for Dawson and me. With extensive of business experience, we know how important it is to keep good employees. We know how vital it is. It has been estimated on many occasions that it would cost a professional practice such as that of an accountant or a lawyer more than $100,000 to lose a valuable female employee. The Paid Parental Leave scheme will make a big difference in terms of workforce participation, productivity and profit for our businesses large and small. This is a very important bill funded by the Australian government, and it is set to start early next year. It is often dangerous in your own electorwhen you are there by yourself and you think no-one is listening to you, even if you are someone as senior in this parliament as the Leader of the Opposition, because you can look like you are at home-on home ground and home territory-but what you say is judged by those who listen-often via the media locally, sometimes at a state level and sometimes at a national level. Certainly, when you are the Leader of the Opposition and you are making speeches on International Women's Day in Manly, New South Wales, you have to be careful. I heard what he had to say. I saw him on the TV, pink tie and all, looking very feminine in terms of his views, as if he had got into the scheme and the groove of things. I thought I would listen to what he had to say, and I had a look at the transcript of what he had to say that day. This is about what the coalition is proposing. He was talking about his scheme. It really was a thought bubble-something that must have come to mind because he had to say something when it came to International Women's Day on 8 March 2010. He talked about his new scheme, which is going to put what he calls a 1.7 per cent ‘levy'-not a tax; he does not want to use the word ‘tax', because he thinks he is ideologically opposed to the use of the word ‘tax'on the taxable income of businesses earning more than $5 million a year, and that will be about 3,200 companies. Some of those 3,200 companies are big companies-fair enough-but some of them are mediumsized companies, with $5 million turnover. Then he went on to talk about when he wants to bring it in. He talked about the fact that he wants to bring this in and about when he is going to do it-because you are not sure about it when you read the speech; you have a bit of a look and you think, ‘I'm not actually certain.' He said: ‘It would be better if these things could be done. We'd like to bring down company tax rate.' He is not supporting our reduction in company tax rate. He said the next government's priority would be to repay what he calls Labor's debt and then reducing personal income tax. ‘Then, after that, when we've done all this sort of thing, we might make some headroom to get rid of this paid parental leave levy'or he thinks it is a levy. ‘We might get rid of it.' He does not tell us at all when he is to bring it in. I had a look at what some of the media have said about this. I looked at what Matthew Franklin said in the Australian. I saw what the Business Council of Australia said about this scheme. They represent more than 100 of Australia's biggest companies. They commented that those companies are already doing the heavy lifting on paid parental leave. So he got the Business Council of Australia against him with his comments. Then he got the Australian Industry Group, uniting with Sharan Burrow, the President of the ACTU, against him as well. It is not often you can get the President of the ACTU, the Executive Director of the Australian Industry Group and the Business Council of Australia united against you in one fell swoop. That was quite miraculous. It was quite a feat he managed to do. This of course is from the bloke who famously said in 2002 that there would be a compulsory paid maternity leave scheme over the government's dead body. I know the Leader of the Opposition has had some religious training. That is a road to Damascus conversion if I have ever seen one. It is probably the best miracle in 2,000 years. I had a further look at it to see if I could get some more clarification. I was wondering when the scheme was going to come in. We have not heard much from those opposite about when the scheme is going to come in. Obviously, this caused them a bit of difficulty. On 18 March, only a matter of days after his statement that was made without consultation with his caucus, he made a couple of comments. People were asking when the scheme was going to come in. The Leader of the Opposition said in a doorstop interview on 10 March 2010: We will do it as quickly as we reasonably can, should we win the next election. Now, I would be amazed if we cannot do this within two years. I going would certainly anticipate that it would … How obtuse, vague and esoteric is that? There is no guarantee this is coming in. Is this the gospel truth, is it Holy Writ engraved in stone or what is it? We are not quite sure. It is sort of qualified. It is general; there is no specificity. I generally agree with the shadow minister for the status of women, the member for Murray, on a lot of women's issues. She purports to be a small ‘l' liberal. It must be an extraordinarily lonely existence for people like her among those opposite. She is losing friends, and the member for Kooyong is sort of going as well. When asked on 15 March 2010 in a doorstop interview about when this was going to happen, she said: As soon as we could get it into place and we would hope that would be within, you know, a few months of getting into office … Here I have the coalition's paid parental leave policy. It is entitled The Coalition's Direct Action Plan on Paid Parental Leave, but I would actually call it a non-action plan. It is a consultation document. They said they were going to consult people. The Leader of the Opposition did not consult his caucus. When I saw the morose, sullen and depressed looking faces of those opposite when he was speaking before, it was pretty clear there is not a lot of support over there thought bubble. We do not know whether this is going to be brought in within a few months or a few years. There are conditions, qualifications, subterfuges and generalisations. It is a great story but, like The Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland and The Lord of the Rings, it is a work of fiction. It simply is not true. It is an interesting read because it talks about things they have done in the past. It does not talk about the inaction of the Howard government on paid parental leave. There is no date for when it is going to be brought in, so you have to trust him; you have to trust his word. Is this the Leader of the Opposition in a Kerry O'Brien 7.30 Report stance and position or is it the person we heard today with a hand on his heart talking about how much he supports women's rights and issues that affect Australia's working families? We are not quite sure. When I think of The Lord of the Rings, I do not think he is action man and I do not think he is all-wise and all-powerful like Gandalf. In fact, I think he is more like Saruman. He has been a religious wizard who in the pursuit of power has decided to abandon all his previously held beliefs because he so desperately wants the prize of power. Paid maternity leave is just a subterfuge to ensure that the women of Australia who have young children vote for him. We know they abandoned the coalition in 2007 and he has to get them back. They were worried about Work Choices. They were worried about their 16-year-old daughters negotiating with Woolworths on AWAs. They were worried about their husbands at factories in Ipswich in my electorate and the rural areas outside not being able to negotiate with their bosses and having AWAs thrust into their hands. The coalition have to get them back, so the Leader of the Opposition came up with a for this spontaneous extemporaneous statement. Now they are scurrying behind their backs to try to do it. They claim they support business. As the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy said, this is going to cost them more than $10 billion. Anyone who thinks that these 3,200 companies are going to suck it in and suck it up and not pass on the costs to them is kidding himself. They will; the big companies will pass it on. Those opposite masquerade as supporters of business, and they are not. The next time the voters go to the polls they will have a choice between Labor, who wants to reduce company tax from 30 per cent to 28 per cent, and those opposite, who want to increase company tax from 30 per cent to 31.7 per cent. It is pretty clear which side of politics is in the business of reducing taxation. The Leader of the Opposition realised that he was in a bit of trouble after the 7.30 Report fiasco. He went up to Queensland and realised that he had to say a few things. So he had an interview with ABC Capricornia. They put it on him a bit in the interview. I have got a transcript of the interview. He said that he does not like the idea of taxes-he kept on about how much he did not like the idea of taxes. In the interview with Aaron Stevens on ABC Capricornia he said: Well, we'll just have to wait and seeand this is about how it is going to affect him in the pollsI try to be fair dinkum with people. I do not tax and I always try to avoid it. That is his own statement. Fair dinkum, the coalition is all over the place on this and when you listened to their speakers this morning you would never know whether they were Arthur or Martha, whether they were going to support our scheme or oppose it. Certainly you do not hear much with respect to their conviction in supporting their own policy. The member for Gippsland was all over the place on the issue. It did not look as though he really supports it. There was no love for his own policy in what he said. And I have heard the member for Mayo speak many times. Of course he is a passionate supporter of Work Choices-we have all known that; he is one of the architects of Work Choices-but in fact he cannot even get the Fair Work Australia legislation in terms of the nomenclature; he cannot even work it out. But when you listened to the member for Mayo there was no conviction in his voice to support this particular scheme because he knows it is a tax on business. We are supporting working families. We are supporting the women of Australia. We are also supporting those men who take seriously their parental responsibilities and want to share in those first few months of a child's life. Twenty per cent of children under the age of two are primarily bonded to their fathers and fathers play an important role as role models and caregivers. Many of them are substantive caregivers with respect to their children in the early years. Labor recognises modern families and the challenges they face. Those who seem to be living in a 1950s worldMs Ley-Hardly!",73
40,Mr NEUMANN,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"That is the truth. That is what they have been like. There was no parental leave scheme put by those opposite like at any stage. Where were the small ‘l' liberals then? Was a submission put to the cabinet then? Where was the private member's bill then from those opposite? It did not happen, and never would under archconservative former Prime Minister John Howard. Nor would it happen under the truth-teller at that stage, the now Leader of the Opposition, because when he said that it would happen over his dead body that was the truth. Those people who go to the polls next time can have a choice. Do they believe the Leader of the Opposition who in a moment of sincerity back in 2002 said he would not do this at any stage, or do they believe the Leader of the Opposition when, in his own electorate on International Women's Day, he had come up with something? I wonder what his conversation would have been like with the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance. We had the fiasco last week with the National Press Club and with the budget-in-reply speech, but it must have been an incredibly interesting conversation after he said: ‘Fellers, we have come up with this scheme. It's going to be great. I have backflipped and I have changed my whole view. St Paul had nothing on my conversion experience, fellers. I have changed. I am a New Age feller.' People are not going to believe that, and those sitting on this side do not believe those opposite would ever bring in a paid parental leave scheme if they had the chance. It is simply nonsense. This is a historic day for the women and men and children in the Australian family. This is important legislation. I want to pay tribute to the many women in this caucus; to the great champions of the ACTU who have fought hard in relation to this; to the businesses that had the foresight to permit paid parental leave schemes to operate in their businesses for working women and working men; but also to those progressive forces in this community who have sought to ensure that all of us will go forward together with greater prosperity, with greater productivity and with greater profit for our businesses, which are the lifeblood of the Australian community.",77
41,Ms LEY,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"I am really pleased to speak on the bill which introduces the government's paid parental leave scheme and, in so doing, I draw a clear distinction between the government scheme and the one that the coalition is proposing by way of amendments to this Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and the cognate bill. We would all agree that paid parental leave is needed desperately, and needed sooner rather than later. The length of paid parental leave now available to parents through private enterprise the Public Service varies greatly from, in some cases, a few days, to 18 weeks. Few schemes meet the widely acknowledged ideal leave period of a full six months, and that is something that we would agree on both sides of the parliament. Mothers choosing to stay at home bond with their babies over those vital few months of life and they really do need a full six months. Labor has not adopted the internationally recognised standard of six months, but their scheme-the subject of this bill-has chosen 18 weeks, hoping that employers would topup the leave entitlement to make up to 26 weeks. Most employers that do not already have a more generous scheme in place are just not in a position to be able top-up any new scheme. Meanwhile, the inequity which sees only some 23 per cent of the lower paid and part-time working women being offered parental leave continues to persist. These bills will do nothing about that inequity. So if you are a young woman entering the workforce now, you are most likely to choose an employer that has their own paid parental leave scheme in place rather than one that does not. After the government scheme commences, you are still more likely to seek out an employer with a company scheme-for example, the Public Service or any one of Australia's large corporationsrather than a small business which has been funded to provide the government's 18-week minimum wage scheme. The government says that its funding the scheme removes the burden from small business and, yes, it is true that it is paying the amount of money that women will receive under the scheme, but the businesses themselves are still left with considerable red tape, and that is something that we should not overlook. They may be liable for state payroll tax. They may be liable for workers compensation for those employees on parenand tal leave as well as for their replacements. They will have to manage the payments and keep yet more records and meet yet more standards of accountability. So make no mistake-this is a burden on small business. The fact that the government is having to introduce a six-month moratorium for businesses so they will not have to make payments to employees until all of these details can be negotiated between the Commonwealth and the states does not bode well for an efficiently managed program. It is also important to note that the government's scheme does not include superannuation. Given that the broken work history of women is contributing so much to their poorer retirement incomes, superannuation to afford to should be included. The real problem with the government's scheme is that the payment of paid parental leave at the minimum wage is simply not adequate. Parents will not be able to afford to take leave at the minimum wage and may decide not to have a baby or to delay having a baby, choices which regrettably will result in fewer babies being born in Australia. This is the key to the reason why modern working mothers and fathers need the coalition's scheme and not Mr Rudd's scheme. We need to see more babies being born in Australia. There is of course a human aspect to the policy in this area, and that is just as important as the economic aspect. But the economic aspect should not be overlooked. The coalition's policy can be seen in terms of its productivity. Without improvements to productivity, a country's standard of living will decline. It is not a remote economic concept; it is absolutely central to the real world. Our ageing workforce, as the cohort of baby boomers moves through, is not being followed by a similar number of young people. That is a challenge that successive reports, including the Intergenerational report, have highlighted. A sinking birthrate threatens productivity like nothing else. In 1988 there were 246,193 births in Australia. In 2008, 20 years later, there were 296,621 births. That is a modest increase of perhaps 50,000. It is a very small increase over a 20-year period, particularly when you consider the ageing of the population. The more important indicator is fertility rate, babies born per woman. That rate was 1.831 in 1988 and it dropped to 1.762 in 1998. It appears now to be on its way back up. It was 1.969 in 2008 and there is some evidence that the baby bonus of the previous coalition government was partly responsible for this. In any case the fertility too low. It is below two. That should sound alarm bells when we consider the future responsibilities of Australia's workforce in terms of what they will have to provide in national income for the ageing generation. When women cannot afford to have children, they put off having children. Then it is too late and it is certainly too late to have the number of children they might like in their ideal family. We all know that family sizes are reducing over time. This is also about perhaps stopping after two or three children because of financial commitments, when in an ideal world a family might have one more child. The coalition's paid parental leave scheme is actually a wage replacement scheme, not paid at the minimum wage as the government scheme is. It will provide payment to all full-time, part-time and casual workers provided they meet the work test, which is 330 hours in a 10-month period over 13 months. It will provide primary carersmothers, in the vast majority of familieswith 26 weeks paid parental leave at full replacement pay up to a maximum salary of $150,000 per annum or the federal minimum wage, whichever is greater. It will be available to all employees, including contractors and the self-employed, who meet the work eligibility test. It includes superannuation contributions at the mandatory rate of nine per cent. The coalition's paid parental leave scheme policy includes two weeks of ‘use it or lose it' parental leave for the non-primary carertypically the father-and this is to encourage the father to support the primary carer and be with the baby in those vital two weeks of early life. The coalition's scheme will signal to the community that taking time out of the workforce to care for children should be considered a normal part of the work-life cycle rate in Australia is of parents. Australia is the second last of the OECD countries to mandate a paid parental leave scheme. It is very concerning that the scheme that is being introduced by the government is so woefully inadequate. There is no point in introducing a scheme which has as one of its principal aims to increase the birth rate if all the evidence points to the that it will not work. One of the harshest things that society can do is make judgments about women in terms of the choices that they make, including their child-bearing choices. There is no place in this debate for judgments about stay-at-home mothers versus working mothers. In fact, I believe those labels are outdated and they often describe the same mother at different periods in her working life and family life. The scheme that the coalition proposes will be welcomed in my electorate, where a lot of working women are farmers. We should not forget the human aspect of women who reach child-bearing age and find that it is just too difficult to have childrenthey have left it too long. That is a very powerful argument for our policy. I reflect back on my statement about making judgments. It is just too easy to say, ‘You should have got on with the business of having children earlier in your life.' I met a young woman from western New South Wales a couple of weeks ago. I do not want to describe her as a farmer's wife because she is of course so much more, but she talked about the difficulties following her marriage, which was in her early 30s. The drought came along and she was down in the paddock every day with her husband and home at night doing the books. Following that, there were issues around the intergenerational transfer of farmland. That is very common in farming areas. There is often great tension between the younger and the older generation. During that time, in the back of her mind she thought, ‘I'll just wait until this is all sorted out and then we'll get on with the business of having a family.' Finally it was all sorted out, but by then she was 41 and found that pregnancy did not happen easily, so she booked into the IVF fact program and she is there still. She described to me her trips from western New South Wales to the big regional city of Albury, where she had her IVF treatment, and the difficulties that she experienced every time she underwent that treatment-the weird emotional feelings, sometimes anger and sometimes manic activity levels. We are talking about quite a dose of medication. But what made me sad was when she said: ‘I had nothing to do overnight between treatments. I had seen all the shops, so I used to walk up and down the streets and think about the situation that I was in and desperately wish for children.' I would not like to see women in that position when it is not necessary. I would really like to see in this place a policy that helps those women and that would have allowed that woman to take the time out of her busy life, while knowing that income was continuing to come into pay the bills, pay the mortgage and give some sense of financial security, to have children. We have dry economic argument that supports our policy. We also have a very human argument. I really do believe that both sides of the House should look carefully at what is happening to the demographic of women who are ageing, having children and encountering difficulties as older mothers. As women, we will all say, I am sure-and, Madam Deputy Speaker, you would probably agree with me on this-that having children is the greatest gift and the greatest joy and it sure beats anything we ever do in our professional life. I am enormously thankful for my three children here today. But just because it was easy for us does not mean it is easy for the modern woman or that it will be easy for the women of tomorrow. Lives are changing, the workforce is changing and people's circumstances are different. Some people have said: ‘This is a lot of money to be paying women over a sixmonth period. Should we be thinking twice about this?' It does sound like a lot of money, but in the context of the average mortgage on the average house these days it is not a lot money. When you consider that most people going into mortgages as first-home buyers in Western Sydney are trying to find between $400,000 and $500,000, you can understand that pausing to have a child, and becoming unable to meet those mortgage payments, is just not going to happen. We are not talking about people who are making grand choices to have it all and who expect to have it all. We are just considering ordinary peopleordinary women in their ordinary working lives. Certainly, in some of the rural areas I represent, the cost of a mortgage is much more modest, but we should not forget that in a lot of our capital cities, where a lot of the women who will be affected by this policy work, it is just not possible to manage a mortgage without two incomes. That is what this policy is focusing on. The other criticism that we have copped is that big business will fund the policy. As the Leader of the Opposition made very clear in his remarks earlier today, we would prefer that there was another way. We would prefer that it could be done out of consolidated revenue, that surging tax receipts coming in over the next few years and a budgetary situation that did not see us at a deficit of $57.1 billion on 30 June this year would allow us to meet the cost of the scheme from somewhere else, but the scheme cannot wait. Paid parental leave cannot wait. The government scheme is insufficient and it is not going to achieve the policy outcomes that it needs to and it is letting women down. We look forward to a time when there will be another source of funding for our scheme. Nobody likes imposts on business. We have taken a decision with our policy that it is reasonable to levy the biggest businesses in Australia to pay for the scheme. I might add that it is a very modest contribution compared to the slug that the government is placing on the resources industry, but we know of that whatever we can do to keep tax rates down for businesses we will do. We just know that bringing the budget back into surplus, restoring the budget bottom line, is important and has to happen first, but we do not believe that this Paid Parental Leave scheme can wait until then. I really urge those opposite to consider the benefits of the coalition scheme and to look at the inadequacies of the scheme they have proposed. I am sorry, but the scheme that government members have explained to us here today is not going to encourage women to take time out of the workforce to have babies in their child-bearing years when we as a nation need those babies to be born today in order to provide for the economic future of Australia tomorrow.",78
42,Mr TURNOUR,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"Leichhardt) (1.50 pm)I stand here today very proud to be a part of a government that is introducing the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and the related bill. This is legislation that is long overdue and a scheme that the former government and many of those opposite had more than 10 years to implement. We are delivering on a scheme and it is a very good scheme. The government funded scheme will provide parental leave pay to mothers and adoptive parents who have been working and who have a baby or adopt a child on or after 1 January 2011, the start of next year. To be eligible for the scheme, parents will need to meet the paid parental leave work test, income test and residency requirements. The claimant must be the primary carer of the child from birth or adoption and have verified the child's birth or adoption. Paid parental leave is for a maximum of 18 weeks and must be taken in one continuous block. The scheme is fully costed and funded by the government. There is no new tax on this side of the House to pay for our scheme, while the opposition is proposing a great big new tax on everything to pay for theirs. It is fair to business and it is fair to families. bill is a major win for working families, who have been waiting for decades for a national paid parental leave scheme. Until now Australia has been one of only two advanced economies without a national paid parental leave scheme and it is a sad indictment of our nation and of our economy that we have not had one until the Rudd government's introduction of this one. This legislation changes that and delivers for working families. It means one parent has the financial security to take time off from work to care for their baby at home during the vital early months of their baby's life. It is important that mothers have time to recover from birth and bond with their baby, and this legislation will allow that to happen. I have a young child, who is just about to turn three, and she is fantastic. Luckily enough, my wife has been able to take time off to care for our child. But many families out there are in financial stress and they need assistance to take time off from work. This legislation is about providing that assistance. This legislation, though, is designed to ensure that mothers maintain their connection with the workforce and it will boost workforce participation. Once the scheme is fully implemented, parental leave pay will be provided by employers to their long-term employees. A long-term employee is a person who has been an employee of the employer for 12 months or more prior to the expected or actual date of birth or placement of their child. We want to make it as simple as possible for the business to implement the scheme. The Family Assistance Office will send a notice to the employer so they will not need to determine whether or not they have to pay it. The Family Assistance Office will notify them and they will also notify the parents. In other cases, the Family Assistance Office This will also make the parental payments. The Family Assistance Office will ensure that funds are made available to an employer in advance of the employer's obligation to provide parental leave pay to an employee. To reduce red tape, funds may be received in as few as three equal instalments. If employers adhere to their normal and proper pay practices when providing parental leave pay to their employees, they will not breach any of the obligations under the Paid Parental Leave scheme. A parent will not be able to work while receiving parental leave pay but may keep in touch with the workplace for up to 10 days during the period, if this is mutually agreed between the person and their employer. Parents can nominate when they wish to receive their pay. The start date can be on or afterbut not before-the child's date of birth or placement and all the pay must be received within the first 12 months after the date of birth or placement of the child. Parental leave pay can be received before, after or at the same time as employer provided paid leave such as recreation or annual leave and employer provided parental leave. Our scheme also lets families make their own work and family choices. Parents can transfer the leave so mums and dads have more options for balancing work and family. If a person returns to work before they have received all of their 18 weeks of paid parental leave, the person's partner may be able to receive the unused amount of paid parental leave, subject to meeting eligibility requirements. Under our scheme, women in seasonal, casual and contract work and the selfemployed will have access to paid parental leave. For most of them this will be for the first time. This is very important. It is a well thought out, well constructed scheme. It is not only for full-time employees but for those who are doing part-time and casual work. A mother may be eligible if she has worked continuously for at least 10 of the 13 months before the birth or adoption of her child and has worked for at least 330 hours in that 10-month period. That is around one day a week. To meet the needs of contractors and seasonal and casual workers who have irregular work patterns, a person can have a break of up to eight weeks between working days and still be considered to have worked continuously. Parental leave pay will also be available to parents who work in their own business or family business, such as a farm. So it is a scheme that will also support those in small businesses in primary production. The scheme will be means tested, ensuring it is targeted at those in need. A person will be eligible if they have an individual income of $150,000 or less in the financial year before the claim or birth of the baby, whichever is the earlier. This scheme has been the result of two years of extensive policy development and consultation based particularly on the work of the Productivity Commission. I want to congratulate them on the work they did. Around one-third of mothers return to work within six months of the birth of their child. Two-thirds of these mothers return to work because they need the money. So many families are under financial stress. Both parents need to go out to work to pay the mortgage and put food on the table. This legislation will put in place fair payment for them to have a baby and will help them with cost-of-living pressures-that is, the same way our third tax cut, delivered this year, will and the same way our increase in the child care tax rebate is helping families with cost-of-living pressures. This legislation will improve productivity by ensuring that more women can continue to participate in the workforce and helping to ensure Australia is well placed to face the challenges of the future. Business will benefit from the retention of skilled and experienced female staff but will not have to fund the parental leave payments. Families not eligible for paid parental leave, or who choose not to participate in the scheme, will be able to continue to access the baby bonus and family tax benefit if they are eligible. An online paid parental leave estimator will be available from September 2010 to help parents choose the option that is best for them. The government estimates that 85 per cent of working families will be better off by on average $2,000 by taking paid parental leave as compared to the baby bonus. The government expects close to 150,000 people each year to benefit from our new Paid Parental Leave scheme. This is historic legislation that is going to benefit many families in my electorate of Leichhardt and families all across the country. As the minister said, we need to pay tribute to people like Sharan Burrow and others in the union movement, who have been campaigning for this for many years. We should pay tribute to Marie Coleman and others from the National Foundation for Australian Women, as well as to the current and previous sex discrimination commissionersElizabeth Broderick and Pru Goward. We also need to recognise that small business representatives like James Thomson value paid parental leave, and business representatives like Heather Ridout have recognised the value of this leave scheme. Our scheme stands in stark contrast to that put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, who had 10 years in the Howard government to actually advocate for and deliver a paid parental leave scheme but did nothing. Earlier this year, he pulled a rabbit out of a even his own backbench and shadow ministry did not know about it-and announced his own scheme. It is a very unfair scheme that will put a tax on everything. That is because, if you are a business turning over $5 million or more, you will have to pay the great big new tax that the Leader of the Opposition is introducing. That will be Woolworths, Coles and clothing retailers. All of those businesses will have to pay the Leader of the Opposition's great big new tax. It is unfair and it is irresponsible. There are working families in my electorate earning $40,000 or $50,000 and under Mr Abbott's scheme they will be paying for parental leave for millionaires. If you are a millionaire under Mr Abbott's scheme, you will get paid parental leave of $75,000 for six months. That is outrageous. It is unfair. I would suggest that Mr Hockey, the shadow Treasurer, and Mr Robb, the shadow finance minister, should look at savings. I suggest they add a line in their budget reply to say that they will discontinue Mr Abbott's paid parental leave scheme. As Phil Coorey rightly pointed out on 17 March: Peter Costello, a well-respected Liberal over that side of the House, said that-because of the things I have pointed out, that it would be a great big new tax on everything-it was a ‘silly' tax and a silly scheme.",81
43,The SPEAKER,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Asylum Seekers",84
44,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his 2007 promise to be tough on border protection, to maintain offhat- shore processing and, in his own words, ‘to turn around the boats to keep our borders secure.' Since he made that commitment, no boats have been turned around, there have been record numbers of illegal boat arrivals, the Christmas Island detention centre is full, people arriving illegally are regularly transferred to the mainland, the Curtin detention centre is set to re-open and there have been at least two breakouts from the Villawood detention centre. I ask: given the Prime Minister's failure on border protection, will he now adopt the coalition's border protection policies, which worked when we were last in government and will work again when we are next in government?",84
45,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice that the once great Liberal Party has hauled up the surrender flag on tax policy and has now moved on to a debate on border protection. It took just three days of debate in this chamber on tax before they returned to old faithful. The Leader of the Opposition referred to coalition policy. The question arises as to whether this particular policy actually went through the coalition party room. This has been a matter of some debate today and we turn to our good friend the member for Cook, who had an interesting discussion on a radio program in Melbourne early this morning on 3AW. Neil Mitchell asked the member for Cook this question: Mitchell: Has this gone through the party room yet? Morrison: It has gone through our internal processes, as our policies do, and that is appropriate. Mitchell: So has it gone through the party room yet? Morrison: It has gone through our internal processes. It is official coalition policy. Mitchell: What does that mean? Morrison: It has been signed off the way we sign off policy. That is what happened Neil. Mitchell: Does that involve the party room? Morrison: It enjoys the strong support of the party room. Ten times he was asked this question; ten times he refused to answer. We know why because the member for Kooyong has already belled the cat. There was no internal party room process. Which begs the question: is this the full gospel truth or is it the Tony Abbott truth? Is it in writing or is it not in writing? Can I say this in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question: back in March in Melbourne he came out through the Melbourne Herald Sun guaranteeing he would stop the boats and shut the border. That was his guarantee on 31 March. Two months later, it is pretty interesting to hear what the Leader of the Opposition had to say in a press conference earlier today. Listen carefully to what the Leader of the Opposition said today when asked to provide the same guarantee. The journalist asked, ‘Can you guarantee that you will stop the boats?'",84

48,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Braddon does not assist. He will settle down. The House will come to order. A question has been asked and the Prime Minister is responding. The Prime Minister will relate his material to the question.,85
49,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Today at the press conference the Leader of the Opposition was asked by a journalist, ‘Can you guarantee that you will stop the boats?' Abbott replied, ‘Someone else with a question?' The favourite one was the last question of the press conference. The journalist asked, ‘Do you guarantee that this policy will stop the boats coming?' Tony Abbott replied: ‘Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you.' That is what I call definitive public policy. That is what I call a rock solid, iron clad guarantee. That is what I call straight-talking Tony. That is what I call full gospel Tony. What we do know is that, if we do not get it in writing from Tony, we should not give it any attention at all. Budget Mrs D'ATH (2.05 pm)- Mr Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. Why is the resource super profits tax an important reform for Australia and what other views have been expressed about resources taxation in Australia?",85
50,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Notwithstanding the fact that the once great Liberal Party has abandoned the tax policy debate and has hauled up the white flag on the need for a profits based tax for the future of the resources sector, for which we thank various members opposite for their contributions yesterday, this government believes in the importance of tax reform for Australia. For this government, the importance of keeping the Australian economy strong depends on (1) keeping our economy out of recession, (2) making sure that we are returning the budget to surplus three years ahead of time and (3) implementing fundamental economic reform, including tax reform. Furthermore, tax reform is essential because it enables us to increase super for working families, it enables us to bring about tax cuts for small business and it enables us to build infrastructure for Australia's future. In the last 24 hours the opposition has gone very cold on the tax debate indeed. After three days of chaos and confusion in their ranks they have now scurried away from the debate altogether. The government is happy to continue to prosecute this debate because we believe it is a fundamental reform for Australia's future. There are two issues at stake in this debate. One is the design of the tax and the government's plan for a tax on profits as opposed to a tax on production, and the other is the level of the tax-the government's plan for an RSPT 40 per cent tax credit on a company's investment and a 40 per cent tax on super normal profits. Yesterday, on the design of the tax, the opposition tapped the mat. They fundamentally tapped the mat. In fact, we had the Leader of the Opposition out there yesterday saying that this new tax system would plunge a dagger into the heart of the Australian economy. That is what he had to say. That was before the shadow finance minister stood up and said, ‘This debate has never been about the design of the tax but simply about the level of the tax.' Then we had the good old member for Tangney-the two of them seem to be missing today, the member for Tangney and the shadow minister for finance-who said that there is potential that taxing profits is better than simply taxing volume. He has moved-I am sorry about that. On the design of the tax and the need for a profits based tax as opposed to a production based tax, those opposite have hauled up the white flag and conceded defeat because they know that Peter Costello supported a profits based regime. They know that the former Leader of the National Party supported a profits based regime and they know that most people serious in the economic debate support that for the simple reason that it is the most flexible way of encouraging the expansion of the industry over time, making the tax returns commensurate with the level of commodity prices over term, enabling small and medium capped firms to enter into the mining industry and to broaden the base of that industry and to replace the patchwork quilt of state royalty regimes with a comprehensive profits based tax. That is issue No. 1: the actual design of the tax where the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues have hauled up the white flag. No. 2 on the level of tax is where it gets really interesting. This is where we have had this complete evolution in the opposition's position over the course of this week. Our position is very clear: 10 years ago $1 out of $3 profit went in royalties; 10 years later $1 in $7 came back in royalties. That is why we need fundamental reform. But on this we have had nothing less than absolute chaos and confusion. Earlier this week-I think it might have been on Tuesday-we had the Leader of the Opposition coming out and saying that he believed that mining companies were paying too much tax. That is his position. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition came out and said that they were paying just the right amount of tax. Nice one, Julie! You got that one I suppose a bit better than you got other things in recent days.",85
51,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will refer to members by their parliamentary title.,86
52,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thirdly, we had the shadow infrastructure minister come out and say that miners are not paying enough tax. So we have had too much, not enough and just right-as I said yesterday, the Goldilocks policy on tax from the opposition: that is, they cannot quite settle on it. Today we had a further contribution from the good old member for Kalgoorlie. Where is he? Is he missing in action from the debate today? He was asked today a question on the level of tax: ‘Do you agree with Tony Abbott when he says they pay more than a fair share of tax?' Mr Haase said, ‘No, I do not.' There you go. ‘And, you know, you're going to question me as to why I disagree with my leader, but I'm pretty close to the mining industry.' So there we have the member for Kalgoorlie repudiating his leader. It gets better because the member for Kalgoorlie was then asked, ‘But, Barry, isn't it damaging, though, for the opposition to have different options on whether or not mining companies are paying too much tax or not enough tax? The government is keen to exploit that.' Mr Haase, the member for Kalgoorlie, then said, ‘I think individual points of view are a fine thing.' In other words, not just a question of having a tax policy which says you are paying too much tax, not enough tax and just enough tax. In fact, he says that everyone in the opposition should have their own individual tax policy. That is where we have got to-Monday, too much tax; Tuesday, not enough tax; Wednesday, just the right amount of tax; and Thursday, everyone should have a tax policy. What we have seen on tax policy is abject chaos and confusion on the part of those opposite. It is very simple. If you cannot manage a tax system, you cannot manage the public finance of Australia. What you have had is a chaotic opposition who would in government be a chaotic government. If you cannot manage the tax policy of the country, you cannot manage the economy of the country, and you cannot manage the country itself. Home Insulation Program",86
53,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's press conference of 23 February this year and his statement that the cabinet had not received reports of safety concerns under the Home Insulation Program. Will the Prime Minister now concede that the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts warned him of safety issues on 12 distinct occasions across three letters dated 27 August, 28 October and 30 October? Is it not a fact that the Prime Minister knew about safety concerns all along and why is he still hiding the 14 August letter received from Minister Garrett?",87
54,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. First of all, could I turn to the correspondence that he refers to: Minister Garrett's letters to me dated 27 August, 28 October and 30 October. These have been provided to the Senate in their entirety, although not requested by the Senate orders, complete with my letters to Mr Garrett dated it is 4 September, 29 October and 2 November. These have been provided voluntarily to the Senate. Furthermore, as I outlined in the House on 11 March, there are a number of actions and changes to the program that the responsible minister proposed during 2009 to address a range of safety issues. These have all been reviewed by Dr Hawke in the context of his review. The member for Flinders asks about cabinet deliberations. I refer him to the updates which were provided to the cabinet through the Nation Building and Jobs Plan implementation reports. I have reported on those earlier in this parliament. Furthermore, could I say to the honourable member for Flinders that, from 1 July 2009, subsequent to the introduction of the program, there were a number of changes to it. The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts issued 26 installer notices under their Home Insulation Program that went to every registered installer. These notices often dealt with safety issues, including reminders around electrical safety and any updates to the program guidelines. Furthermore, can I say to the member for Flinders that, from 1 July 2009",87

63,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On 14 August, I received a letter from the minister proposing increased compliance requirements for the Home Insulation Program. On 17 August, the relevant cabinet committee considered the compliance issues raised by the minister in his 14 August letter. The committee approved changes to the program guidelines, including requiring physical site inspections and a range of other measures. On 27 August 2009, I received a letter from the minister proposing changes to the program to require installers to provide physical evidence of qualifications and/or competencies before they are registered. On 28 August the changes to the program guidelines were released. Furthermore, these guidelines required from 1 September 2009 the following: the requirement for installers to undertake a physical site inspection before providing a written quote to improve the quality of quotations; the requirement of installers, including those currently in the process of registering, to provide evidence of qualifications and/or competencies at the time of registration; and the provision of a price guide advisory for different types of insulation products and other variables to educate householders and installers. Furthermore installers charging above the maximum recommended price would be required to explain whyMs Julie Bishop-Where's the letter?",88
64,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is warned!,88
65,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"on the quote provided to the householders. On 28 October the minister wrote to me to indicate the actions he intended to take in response. These included requiring householders to get two quotes and to publish a public list of deregistered installers. On 29 October, I responded to this letter agreeing to the minister's proposal to tighten the guidelines. On 30 October Minister Garrett wrote to me in relation to safety issues in the Home Insulation Program. The letter proposed to roll out an electrical safety testing program for homes that had had foil insulation and proposed a ban on metal fasteners and proposed to mandate the use of covers over down lights and other ceiling appliances. On 2 November 2009, I replied to the minister noting the package of safety measures he had proposed and from 2 November 2009, under the Home Insulation Program, metal fasteners for foil insulation were banned. Installation of covers over down lights and other ceiling appliances were mandated. The government announced it was implementing a target electrical safety program. The further part of the honourable members question goes to a further letter on the part of the then minister, Minister Garrett. A letter from Mr Garrett dated 14 August 2009 was a proposal for increased compliance requirements for the HIP and it is a cabinet document which was considered by a cabinet committee on 17 August 2009.",88

67,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before those opposite become too excited, they will note that I have already provided an outline of what was in the 14 August 2009 letter and the other letters to which I referred in the House on 11 March 2010. To remind the honourable member what I said about it at that time: On 17 August, the relevant cabinet committee considered the compliance issues raised by the minister in his 14 August letter. The committee approved changes to the program guidelines which included requiring the following: physical site inspections prior to giving quotes, increased inspections and scrutiny of trainer qualifications, increased compliance communications and processes for suspending and deregistering noncompliant installers. I have therefore in the past been more than happy to provide a description of the contents of these letters, including the one which is a cabinet document. In terms of the handling of that particular document, we have adhered to the processes which have been applied by all previous Australian governments.",89

71,Mr TREVOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. What does the OECD's Economic Outlook say about the 2009-10 budget and the performance of the Australian economy?,89
72,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Flynn for his question because the OECD's latest Economic Outlook confirms that Australia's economic growth and employment outlook is among the best in the OECD. The report is yet another reminder of the strong economic management which has seen Australia fight off a global recession and emerge in a much stronger position than just about any other country in the developed world. The report makes a number of very important points. We are one of the strongest economies in the OECD, we have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the OECD and we have one of the best fiscal positions in the developed world. Contrast this to what is happening across the OECD. In the past two years there has been something like 16 million jobs lost. Just think about that for a moment, think about the devastation that causes in local communities and across whole economies, and compare that to the performance of the Australian economy where, in the last period, we have created something like 250,000 additional jobs. That is certainly celebrated by everybody on this side of the House because we understand how important it was to keep the economy going when the global economy fell off the cliff at the end of 2008 and in early 2009. We had very difficult global circumstances but in those circumstances Australia performed very strongly. That is something everyone in this country can be proud of. The OECD report says: After weathering the crisis well in 2009, the tralian economy is projected to experience strong growth in 2010 and 2011. The OECD is now forecasting growth for Australia at 3.2 per cent in 2010 and 3.6 per cent in 2011. The forecasts for unemployment are also equally encouraging. They are forecasting unemployment of 4.8 per cent by the end of next year, which is dramatically lower than the eight per cent expected for the OECD area as a whole. That is the comparison. That means there are Australians in jobs who are going home with a pay cheque at night. It is happening in this country; it is not happening in many of those other countries. So we have to make sure that we put in place a very strong fiscal framework to ensure prosperity as we go forward, particularly when we consider the backdrop of what is happening in Europe. This comment from the OECD is particularly important. It talks about the government's fiscal settings. It says they are ‘welcome given the rebound in activity'. It goes on to say: … in view of the stronger economy and fiscal restraint, the government now expects to balance its budget by 2012/13, three years earlier than previously anticipated. This is a fiscal position that is the envy of the developed world. We have got to this point because of responsible economic management, bringing the budget back to surplus in three years-three years early-and ahead of every other major advanced economy. This is what the OECD Secretary-General had to say: … you have navigated well through this difficult time. The behaviour of Australia may not be very typical because you have done so well but holding up you have never had a big recession; it did have a very big positive impact on growth. I wish we could export your recipe. He had a few other things to say as well. He made some comments about the resource Aussuper profits tax. This is what the Secretary General of the OECD had to say last weekend. He went on to make this point: In the particular case when you're talking about the availability of raw materials … my impression is that taxes are not the major reason why they would invest … … … … I think if you look at these things strategically … of course it's a wise thing … to invest in Australia. Indeed, it is. You can see this particularly in the major investment that has been put forward in recent days in Queensland by the major coal companies who are wishing to invest in rail. They are optimistic about the future of this country. The government is optimistic about the future of this country. What we must do is modernise our tax system. What we must do is get a modern tax system in terms of resources. And what we must do is give the incentive for companies through lower taxes, particularly for small business, to continue to invest and to create jobs. That is something that we should all be very proud of. NA",89

74,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Yesterday the Treasurer in this place declared the effective tax rate for the mining industry at the moment to be 17 per cent, and he said that on eight separate occasions. That was based on a flawed US university graduate paper. I draw the Treasurer's attention to his own economic note of 9 May in a table on page 3, which states the current effective tax rate is up to 45 per cent; between 35 and 45 per cent. Treasurer, which of the figures is correct? Is it what you advised the House yesterday of an effective tax rate of 17 per cent, or is it what is in your own publication-an effective tax rate of 45 per cent?",90
75,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is very sloppy work, Joe. You are out here all the time comparing apples and pears.",91
76,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will refer to members by their parliamentary titles.,91
77,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sometimes it is oranges and apples. He is just flip-flopping all over the place. Let us just go through a few of the basic facts. We have been having a debate about effective tax rates for companies. Those opposite have sided with the mining industry who are claiming an effective rate for the mining industry of something like 27c when the headline statutory rate is 30c. What has really stung them is that there is a Treasury study that points conclusively to the fact that the effective tax rate for the mining industry is 17c in the dollar. What he wants to leave out in all of these comparisons in his usually sloppy way is the fact that mining companies get very, very generous tax concessions. So he does his calculations based on taxable income-that is, taxable income after they have had all of those concessions. Their effective rate is 17c in the dollar. It does not matter how much you want to flipflop all over the place and change the tax basis to make your pointMr Hockey-It's your own paper, you fool!",91

81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will go to his answer.,91
82,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday we had the Leader of the Opposition saying that the mining companies in this country were paying too much tax. That is what he said. This is a severe embarrassment for them because not even the mining companies have the gall to say that they are paying too much tax. Perhaps not even Clive Palmer, who sponsors them, would ever say something so stupid or so extreme. This is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say yesterday: the mining companies were paying too much tax. How do we get to the bottom of this case about how much tax they are paying? Let us go back to the one basic fact that they have not been able to refute. It is very simple. At the beginning of this decade, mining companies were paying one dollar in three in terms of their profits in royalties and other charges, and by the end of the decade that had got to one dollar in seven. What that demonstratesMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order which goes to relevance. I asked him about his own document-35 per cent to 45 per cent for effective tax rate. Which is right?",91
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will relate his material to the question. The Treasurer has the call.,91
84,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have been making a point about effective tax rates, but it is not something that is well understood by the member opposite. When it comes to company tax, the mining companies are paying an effective rate of 17c in the dollar as measured against the 30c headline rate. How does that compare with other industries? In transport it is 27c. In finance it very important to understand because what is the environment we are having this debate in? They are currently opposing our proposal to cut the company rate by 2c. They are opposing that. What they are proposing to do is to increase the company rate. What we have is a situation where they want to increase company tax for all companies with a turnover of over $5 million, so they have to concoct a figure that the effective rate of company tax for mining companies is 27c instead of 17c. This is the very basic point. They are now so acutely embarrassed because they have jammed themselves into a corner where they are saying that the companies should not pay more tax. Not even the companies are arguing that. When there is an effective rate of 17c for company tax and when they have not been paying their fair share of royalties, the case is there. It is very clear. They can pay more tax, which is why we are going to modernise the tax system and make sure that those that are very profitable do pay their fair share so we can cut the company tax for all companies across Australia. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the Treasurer's own note from 9 May, which says the effective tax rate is 35 to 45. Leave not granted. Mr Hockey-Everyone should see thistable it.",91
85,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,92
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I remind members that to interject and interrupt is outside of the standing orders. If they are going to talk to themselves, could they do it more quietly-on both sides. Taxation  is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Why is tax reform critical to strengthenis 29c. This is ing Australia's economy?",92
87,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Moreton for his question. Tax reform as proposed by the government is very important for the Australian economy. Econtech modelling shows that the government's tax package will lead to higher growth, will be good for jobs, will be good for the state of public finances and, indeed, good for Australia's resources sector. The proceeds from the Resource Super Profits Tax that the government is proposing in this tax package go to cutting company tax, cutting tax on small business, improving superannuation tax concessions for lowand middle-income earners, providing a tax break for small savings and providing a guaranteed $1,000 tax deduction on ordinary personal tax returns. Under the Rudd government, you will have a 28 per cent company tax rate. Under an Abbott government, you will have an almost 32 per cent-31.7 per cent-company tax rate, according to their own announced policy positions. We have heard a lot of wild claims, many of them from the opposition but not only from the opposition, in this debate. We have seen a lot of very vigorous, very robust, prosecution of self-interest on the part of people in the mining sector. It is notable, as the Treasurer mentioned, that there is a big statement of confidence in the future of Australia's mineral sector that has been made by coal companies just today by announcing an almost $5 billion bid for the rail infrastructure of the Queensland Rail Corporation. That is hardly the action of a sector that thinks that there is no future in mining in Australia. The key points are these: first, the Australian people own these resources and the taxing mechanisms are the means by which they extract the price for selling those resources to mining companies that extract them, process them and onsell them. Secondly, mineral prices globally have soared. They are at new levels and are likely to remain at those levels. Therefore, the proportion of the total price that the Australian people get from their resources has diminished substantially. The Australian people are entitled to get a fair return for those resources. Thirdly, those mining companies get very generous tax concessions on their company tax payments and, as a result, at the moment, broadly, over an extended period they have typically been paying around 17 per cent in company tax compared with 29 per cent for financial services and 27 per cent for transport. Finally, taxing profits is a much more efficient mechanism in this sector than taxing production or taxing volume. It is a much more efficient mechanism for extracting the value for the Australian people for their resources. It is unclear what the opposition's position is on this question of whether or not the government's tax package is good for the Australian economy and strengthening the Australian economy, because we have had several positions during this week. On Monday, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that the mining industry was paying its fair share of tax. On Tuesday, Senator Joyce said it could pay more than it is currently paying. On Wednesday, the Leader of the Opposition said that the mining industry is paying more than its fair share of tax. Also on Wednesday, the shadow finance minister, the member for Goldstein, indicated that the opposition did not appear to object to the design of the tax, that that was not the issue, and therefore he and the opposition are happy with a profit based tax. Just today, we had a media alert put out by the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, at 7 past 10 announcing a doorstop media interview at half past 10. About five or 10 minutes later the Leader of the Opposition also put out a media alert saying he was going to have a doorstop, which ended up being about asylum seekers. At 20 past 10 a media alert was put out by the shadow Treasurer saying that the 10.30 doorstop had been postponed. They moved right away from the debate about the tax reform issue.",92
88,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,93
89,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition did not even tell the shadow Treasurer he was going to have a doorstop on asylum seekers. But this raises a key question: what is the opposition's policy going to be, heading into the election, on the government's tax reform proposals? Is it to defend the status quo? Is it to support a profit based tax? Is it to reduce taxes on the resources sector? I know one thing about this; it will be very interesting in the campaign when the Leader of the Opposition turns up in Cairns and talks to the tourism industry about why they should be paying higher taxes under a Liberal government. It will be very interesting when he turns up in Geelong and talks to the manufacturing industry and tells them why they should be paying higher taxes under a Liberal government. It will be interesting when he turns up in Lismore and talks to small business there and tells them why they should be paying higher taxes under a Liberal government. Because, under his proposals, company tax will be nearly four per cent higher, there will be no $5,000 immediate write-off of costs for small business, there will be no increased superannuation and savings tax concessions and there will be no automatic tax deduction of $1,000. It is one thing to throw verbal bombs, to throw all the one-liners and the TV grabs that we hear from the Leader of the Opposition; it is one thing to run around squawking ‘great big new tax' every time somebody drops $10 in the street; but the moment of truth is going to arrive when the opposition will have to front up to the Australian people and indicate why they are putting the interests of one sector, which is now paying a much lower proportion of its profits as tax than it previously did on minerals that are the Australian people's asset, ahead of all the other businesses all around Australia that are struggling to get by. That is the thing that they are going to have to explain to businesses all around the country.",93
90,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to comments by the Chairman of Rio Tinto, who said yesterday: “From the government's side, some of the statisSolomon tics that we have been confronted with in recent weeks can only be described as scandalous … He also said it was ‘truly scandalous'. With the benefit of 24 hours since the Treasurer was made aware of flaws in his own arguments and his own numbers in his economic note of 9 May, will the Treasurer now disclose to the Australian people in dollar terms all the numbers behind the fancy pie charts and graphs in his documents?",94

They simply do not care, so they are going to let the bounty of our resources just walk out the door. They do not care if it is reinvested in our community, they do not care whether it is reinvested in superannuation, they do not care about a lower company tax rate for tourism operators or the manufacturing industry-they do not care about any of that because they have sold out to the mining companies.

But this seems to be completely irrelevant to those opposite. Nobody is seriously contesting this. Not even the mining industry is seriously contesting the fact that they need to pay a more because the underlying value of our resources has increased substantially and that, if we want to move forward as a modern economy, we should take those revenues and invest them in a lower corporate rate so we can meet the challenges of the mining boom mark 2.

103,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. How is the government investing in our schools to deliver trades training centres; and are there any threats to these centres?",95
104,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for her question. She is a member in this House who stands up for her electorate. As I explained to the House yesterday, last November we approved 302 schools for funding for trade training centres. Schools approved know that they are getting the money and are excitedly making plans to implement their trade training centre. The Leader of the Opposition has announced that he will cut the funding that is supposed to be going to those schools-schools that have been promised funding and that are now at bit risk of losing their funding because of the Leader of the Opposition. Yesterday I said that we would look for a member of the coalition who is prepared to stand up for their electorate and say, ‘I want the schools in my electorate that have been promised money to get that money,' to stand up to the Leader of the Opposition and say, ‘It is wrong that you want to cut the equivalent of 180 trade training centres from schools that have been promised the money since last November. Yesterday we asked the member for Dunkley whether he would be a coalition member prepared to stand up for his electorate, and the answer has clearly been no. He will meekly follow the Leader of the Opposition and allow the trade training centres promised in his electorate to be cut. I asked today about another member of the coalition-the member for Bradfield. Our old friend the member for Bradfield does not have a happy record with the schools in his electorate, as we know. But maybe he could overcome his unhappy record with the schools in his electorate if he was prepared to stand up for St Ives High School and Sir Eric Woodward Memorial School and make sure that they get their trade training centre. He would need to tell the Leader of the Opposition that he is wrong to cut this funding. We will wait for 24 hours to see whether the member for Bradfield is a man who is prepared to say to the Leader of the Opposition: ‘My schools have been promised money. They were promised it last November and it is wrong of you to rip that money directly out of their hands.' Mr Fletcher interjecting",95
105,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"While she is not here, let me indicate that there is also a test for the member for Gilmore. I note the member for Bradfield. He is big on yelling in this House. The question is: will he stand up for his local schools? We will wait to see that answered. The member for Gilmore, who is not here, wrote to me about the failure of a school in her electorate to be approved for a trade training centre. She said that we had had the rounds, the applications, and we have had had more schools apply than could get in the first few rounds or applications. She wrote to me because she was very disappointed that a school in her electorate did not get approved. She said: It has come to my attention that Vincentia High School has been unsuccessful in their application for a much needed Trade Training Centre. This school is one of the most disadvantaged schools in my electorate of Gilmore, reflected in the data outlined on the My School website … Another thing delivered by the Rudd government in education. She said: Many of the students come from low socio-economic or Indigenous backgrounds, and the area itself is quite isolated from tertiary opportunities and services like public transport. The cipal, Steve Glenday, has written to express disappointment. I accept absolutely that the member for Gilmore is genuinely concerned about this school not getting its trade training centre, but the test for her is whether she will now go to the Leader of the Opposition and say, ‘If you go ahead with this cutback, Vincentia School will never get its trade training centre.' The only way it will ever get a trade training centre is under the Rudd government's 10-year program, if the Leader of the Opposition stops being a risk to this program. Yesterday when I raised this matter in here the member for Goldstein, who also is not here today-the shadow finance minister who announced these cuts-yelled out, ‘We'll have a better plan.' And I thought, ‘Gee, the member for Goldstein with a better plan-that will be interesting.' I checked on the performance of the member for Goldstein when he was a minister with responsibility in this area. In 2007 he famously said: ‘We've got a problem with skills shortage. We knew it was coming, but it has arrived with a force, and it is only going to get worse.' That is the record of the member for Goldstein in dealing with skills shortages-knew they were coming, did not do anything about it. Mr Andrews-What about technical colleges? That was so disingenuous.",95
106,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Menzies helpfully yells out, ‘What about technical colleges?' Thank you very much, Member for Menzies. I have looked at the track record of the Howard government on technical colleges, and let me illuminate the House on their record. In 2004 the Liberals promised that Australian technical colleges would help 21,000 students over four years at a cost of $289 million. Okay, that was a promise. What in fact happened? It cost $440 million printo establish 24 colleges that ended up with 3,000 enrolled students. Let me just give you those numbers again-you would not have to blitz the grade 3 NAPLAN test to understand the import of these numbers: $440 million for 3,000 students enrolled, a cost per student of $140,000. So let us not hear any nonsense from the opposition about having a better plan. Their track record in government is absolutely clear: $140,000 per student, watched skills shortages coming and just waved their hands in the air and did absolutely nothing. And now the Leader of the Opposition sitting there is a risk to the trade training centres in schools, particularly the more than 300 schools that have had funds approved and who are going to have those funds ripped out of their hands by the Leader of the Opposition. The search for a member of the coalition prepared to stand up for their electorate will continue. We have not found one yet.",96

In particular it has invested in a national system of paid parental leave, an increase in the child care tax rebate to 50 per cent, outcomes from early childhood programs equivalent to best practice in other countries, a year 12 attainment rate of 90 per cent by 2015, 40 per cent of 25to 34-year-olds with a bachelor degree being attained by 2025, and halving the proportion of 20to 64-year-olds without a certificate III qualification. We have had the benefits of these national goals, which we are working towards and delivering on, modelled by Econtech. That modelling shows that over the next 15 years this would benefit our economy by up to $60 billion and from 2010 to 2040 by $108 billion. This would see more than half a million jobs added to the Australian economy every year. I was asked about this productivity agenda and about threats to this productivity agenda. Of course, the threats to this productivity agenda are clear. They are clear from the cutbacks announced by the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister in the game of ‘pass the budget-reply parcel'. These cuts include preventing 120,000 students getting comI puters. There is a theme to the opposition's cutbacks. They are against the NBN, they are against kids getting computers in schools and they are against e-health. We are the party of the future that is preparing the nation for the future; they are the party of the past. We are the party of the National Broadband Network, computers in schools and e-health; they are the party of the Olivetti manual typewriter. That is where they want to take the nation. As well, they want to cut our vital investments in teacher quality, investments which are enabling the best teachers to be paid more to go to the schools that need them the most. They want to cut our trades training centre programs. They want to risk 90,000 people in training through their cuts to the Productivity Places program, including 18,000 apprentices currently in training. When we look at all this we know that they are a risk. We know too that they are a risk to our school modernisation program, to Building the Education Revolution. The problem here of course is that they are being phoney. They are not being honest about the proposed cutbacks to schools. The Master Builders Association has indicated publicly that the investment in school infrastructure is supporting 31,000 businesses around the country. They have certainly said that without this activity in building and construction we would have seen job losses as high as 35,000. The Leader of the Opposition went to the Master Builders Association last night and spoke. But he did not utter a word about his plans to cost that industry 35,000 jobs through the threats that he is posing to economic stimulus. Instead, he went and said about the Labor Party: They don't like business. Who is it that is supporting business: this side of the House that wants to keep the doors of businesses open, or that side of the House that wants to cut economic stimulus and close businesses down; this side of the House that wants to make sure businesses have the skills, apprentices and tradespeople that they need, or that side of the House that wants to cut the vital investment into Productivity Places and trades training centre programs; this side of the House that wants to provide the National Broadband Network, the infrastructure of the future, or that side of the House that wants to cut it? This means of course that the Leader of the Opposition is a huge risk to the Australian economy and to the prosperity that supports Australian families.",98
123,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to claims by the Hunter Business Chamber, a chamber that represents 1,000 businesses in the Hunter Valley, that 15,000 people are directly employed and another 50,000 indirectly employed in the region's mining sector and that the Hunter economy is dependent upon the resources sector. Is he aware of a newspaper article on 3 May where it said in the Newcastle Herald that the 40 per cent tax on coal profits has Hunter coal companies ‘up in arms' over the blatant tax grab and that effects of the super tax touch every level of the sector? The Herald said: Hunter mines exported about $8 billion worth of coal last year, plus another $1 billion or more in domestic sales, and contributed about $900 million in state mining royalties. On these figures, the Hunter's contribution to the new “super tax” could be as much as $3 billion a year. Prime Minister, what action is your government taking to protect the Hunter from the damage that will be caused by your government's great big new $3 billion tax on mining industries in the Hunter that will not flow through to other businesses?",99

135,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The reason we are engaged in tax reform is because we want to ensure that we have an increase in the overall competitiveness of the Australian economy, and that includes in regions like the Hunter and Newcastle and right across the nation. by making sure that you have got globally competitive tax rates for Australian businesses. You bring down the tax burden for Australian small business. As the finance minister quite rightly said in his response to an earlier question, the contrast now is stark when it comes to the company tax rate. How many companies, for example, in the honourable member's electorate will be paying the company tax rate? Under this government it comes down to 28 per cent. Under the proposal by the Leader of the Opposition it goes up to 32 per cent. That is a four percentage point difference in the company tax rate for all those companies in the electorate of Paterson. Furthermore, how many small businesses do we think there are in the electorate of Paterson? A large number, and I am sure the relevant minister will give me the figure before long. Small businesses, in addition, those that are not incorporated, will all benestand fit from the additional measure of the tax break concerning $5,000 of their assets in a given year. These are the changes that we make to the economy on the ground. A further change that we make to the economy on the ground in electorates such as that represented by the member for Paterson is an investment in the Hunter Expressway, a very large scale investment in the transport infrastructure of region-$1.45 billion. I seem to remember that the member for Paterson promised this, and promised this again-and guess what happened? Nothing actually happened.  of order on relevance. The question was about the effect of the great big new tax on mining on the Hunter. It was not about a road in the Hunter Valley. The Prime Minister",100

137,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sturt is warned! The Prime Minister has the call.,100
138,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The question from the honourable member for Paterson was about the impact of the government's tax reform proposal on the economy of his region. That is what I am responding to. The purpose of the government's tax reform is to make it possible to bring down the company tax rate right across the country to increase our global competitiveness-as opposed to those opposite, who would increase the company tax rate, thereby impeding the profitability of firms across the economy and doing the same to small business. I am advised reliably by the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy that there are 4,194 small businesses in his electorate that to benefit from this government's special tax break on $5,000 of assets in a given year in order to take the burden of tax from small business, so much the engine room of our economy. Another reason that we are investing in tax reform is to make sure that we can fund the country's future infrastructure needs. The member for Sturt took a point of order in terms of the relevance of this matter. The the funding of infrastructure is one of the core cornerstones of the reason we are constructing this tax reform. We are doing it so that we can fund the nation's future infrastructure; fund what is necessary for the construction of the Hunter Expressway, a very large project-$1.4 billion. Does he assume that this money grows on trees? It does not. We need to derive this money from the tax base of the Commonwealth in order to make sure that infrastructure is built. The member for Paterson spoke specifically about the industries within his region: the port and the associated resource industries around coal. We are investing something in the vicinity of half-a-billion dollars through the ARTC to increase the overall efficiency of the rail infrastructure to make that port, the port of Newcastle, as efficient as possible. He asks, therefore, what we are doing for the businesses and economies of his region. I welcome that sort of question from any member opposite, because we are bringing down the company rate, bringing down the tax burden on small business, boosting the super payments for all the workers in your electorate, increasing our ability to invest in projects like the Hunter Expressway and investing in projects like the ones that the ARTC is investing in in terms of the rail efficiency of the port of Newcastle. These are the practical things which make a difference. We believe that this is an absolutely essential reform for the nation's future. I say therefore to the member for Paterson that the important thing is to be actually fair dinkum about tax reform. We saw what happened in terms of fair dinkum tax policy from those opposite during the course of last week. They could not render the full gospel truth of whether they thought that there was enough tax, too much tax, just enough tax, or whether anyone should have a tax policy on the benches of those opposite. We have had this change time and time again. But there is more. I have just been alerted to the fact that, on the question of the full gospel truth, we have had another major backflip by the Leader of the Opposition on policy. We have seen it on tax; we have seen it on the party room. We have seen it also in the party room's deliberations on border protection and the assurances that he gave about shutting the border. This one goes to climate change.",100
139,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister knows that he has to use material that is relevant to the question. If he is going to continue, he must relate his material to the question.",101
140,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, in the context of the carbon based industries within the region referred to by the member for Paterson, I would assume that those who accept the science would regard the opposition's policy on climate change relevant to the long-term development of the coal industry in the Hunter. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has famously declared in the past the settled science-he called it ‘so-called settled science'-of climate change science to be crap. That is his word: ‘The argument is absolutely crap.' But today he has said this: ‘I am confident based on the science that mankind does make a difference to the climate. Almost certainly the impact of humans on the planet extends to climate.'",101
141,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will bring his answer to a conclusion. The Prime Minister will relate his material to the question. I now ask that he brings his answer to a conclusion.,101
142,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is a question of whether those opposite are participating in this debate in a bona fide way. Are they fair dinkum? Is this full gospel or not? We have seen a complete backflip on the question of tax policy; we have seen them twist and turn on so many other issues.

145,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are very sensitive to what has happened in terms of the twists and turns of their policy.

146,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs and Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. How will the government's tax breaks benefit small businesses and independent contractors? Are there any threats to these reforms?",102
147,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck for her question and for organising meetings with the Swan Chamber of Commerce and the Kalamunda Chamber of Commerce. That was a very good opportunity to discuss the issues of concern for small business in her electorate. She has always been a strong advocate for small business. Yes, Opposition Leader, that is you and it is coming. You have a very confused look on your head and we will get to that. During the global recession, the Rudd Labor government supported small businesses through the stimulus package and through a special small-business tax break. We think they behaved magnificently, keeping people on, although perhaps reducing hours. We want to thank them and support them during the recovery phase through small-business tax breaks. There are two major tax breaks. The first is that for every one of Australia's small businesses, 2.4 million of them, there would be instant write-off of the value of assets up to $5,000. That has been strongly welcomed by the Council of Small Business of Australia. Contrary to assertions from the opposition, it applies to every small business in Australia. The second tax break is a reduction in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent. That is a head start reduction-that is, starting on 1 July 2012. That is great news for small business as well-great news if we I can get the legislation through the Senate, but the bad news is that the opposition has already indicated that it will block the smallbusiness tax breaks. What has the opposition got against small business? The member for Herbert will have to explain to the 11,133 businesses in his electorate why he is denying them a tax break and, if he does not, we will. So, for the member for Herbert there are 11,000. The member for Hinkler is here. The member for Hinkler will need to explain to the 10,000 small businesses in his electorate why the coalition would deny them a small-business tax break and, if he does not, we will. The member for Ryan will not be explaining anything and he is not here today, but the candidate for Ryan-and I am reliably informed Councillor Jane Prentice from the Liberal-National Party is looking good there at two to one on-will have to explain to the 12,500 businesses in the electorate of Ryan why she is denying them a small-business tax break. I saw that my friend the member for Dickson was having a chat with the member for MCPherson. It is not too late. You can make the move to MCPherson, but, if you do not get the nod there, if you cannot convince the existing candidate, then the member for Dickson will have to explain to 11,900 small businesses why he is denying them a tax break. Why would you do that? The member for Bowman is not here. I think he is into the party pies early. He has gone. A total of 11,676 small businesses will be saying, ‘Why am I being denied a smallbusiness tax break by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Bowman?' The member for Gilmore will have to explain to 8,000 small businesses. The member for Greenway will have to explain to 12,960 small businesses why she is denying them a tax break. I see the member for Hughes. The member for Hughes will have to explain why 12,000 small businesses in her electorate are going to miss out on a tax break if her leader gets his way. The member for Macarthur, if he still has any interest in the matter, will have to explain to 8,400. The member for Paterson has 4,194. That is a big job. Go around door-to-door and explain. He can also explain why he cannot read the newspaper that editorialised in favour of the resources tax, in favour of the mining industry paying more tax. The member for MCEwen was formerly the Minister for Small Business and Tourism. Why wouldn't a former small business minister go to the opposition leader and say, ‘Don't do it, Tony, please don't do it, because I will have to explain to 12,000 small businesses why I am denying them a smallbusiness tax break.'

We just heard it from the member for Mackellar. The truth is that they have no idea about tax. Every one of Australia's 2.4 million small businesses will get this tax break if the Rudd Labor government can get this legislation through the Senate, because it applies to sole traders, to partnerships and to companies.

I refer the Prime Minister to the loss of up to 70 jobs in Mount Isa and Cloncurry directly and indirectly as a result of the suspension by Xstrata of its copper exploration program in North Queensland due to his great big new tax on mining. What impact will these job losses have upon these local communities and how many more job losses will these towns have to endure as a result of his great big new tax?,104
164,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for MCPherson for her question. It goes to the mining industry and it goes to the implications of the proposed introduction of the government's RSBT. I would say to the member for MCPherson to look carefully at the projections by Treasury of the impact of the government's overall tax reform on employment for the economy and for the mining industry as well. In fact, when it comes to employment for the mining industry, from recollection, the Treasury analysis says that you would look at about a 4.5 per cent increase in activity, I think a 5.5 per cent increase in investment and over time a sevenpoint increase in employment. I would suggest that the honourable member for MCPherson reflect on those figures contained within the Treasury's projections. I would also remind the member for MCPherson, given the nature of the seat she represents, of the large number of small businesses within her electorate that would be directly benefited by the tax reforms the government foreshadows. I think the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy just recentlyand eloquently, if I might say-ran through the implications for small businesses individually in electorates right across the country. On the Gold Coast there are a great stack of small businesses, which frankly would Budget benefit from being able toMrs May- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The Prime Minister is not addressing the two towns that are affected by the 70 job losses.",104

166,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I enjoy also the continued interjections from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, because she has distinguished herself so greatly during the course of this week. In response to the question of the member for MCPherson, I go firstly to the overall employment impacts of the government's proposal, secondly to the mining industry and thirdly to the working families and small businesses of MCPherson. They will benefit under this proposal from an increase in super for all working families, and she is voting to block that. There will be a reduction in the tax burden on the small businesses in her electorate, which she is voting to block. And there will be a tax reduction for all companies in her electorate, which she is voting to block. I would suggest to the member for MCPherson that in standing up for the interests of her constituency she should bear in mind the burdens borne by small businesseloquently underlined just now by the minister for small business. If she had some concern for her local economy, she would stand up in this place and back the interests of the small businesses of MCPherson. Hospitals",104
167,Mr HALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister update the House on the government's rollout of extra subacute services and beds across our hospital system and on how these are being received?,105
168,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon for his question. He has a particular reason for asking this question, as no doubt he is very pleased that the project for the new step-down care unit at Royal Darwin Hospital is very well advanced. It will provide additional services to the community of Darwin and the surrounds. It forms part of the significant investments that the Rudd government has been making in health, in an area called subacute services. It is an area that people do not often talk about but which was described by the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission as the ‘missing link' in our health system. As part of our COAG agreement back in 2008, where we put a record $64 billion into our hospital system-which was a 50 per cent increase on the agreement on funding for hospital services of the Leader of the Opposition-we also committed $500 million to increase subacute services by 20 per cent by 2012. This money is now starting to hit the front line. I am very pleased to be able to announce today that some of the early investments are coming to fruition. For example, in the seat of Watson-the electorate of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry-six palliative care beds have opened at Canterbury Hospital. I think the member for Dunkley will be interested to know that funding has been provided for four restorative care places at the Frankston Hospital and similarly at the Goulburn Valley Health service in Shepparton. I imagine that the Treasurer will be pleased to know that 44 beds are progressively coming on line at the Eventide Nursing Home in his electorate. On top of that, $12.9 million has been allocated to expand specialist palliative care services, rehabilitation and geriatric care at Mount Gambier in the electorate of Barker, and also at Whyalla country general hospital in Grey. I noticed that the member for Grey was on his feet before. He did not ask me a question, however, about the investments in cancer services going into his electorate in Whyallamore than $50 million, and a total of $69 million with the state government's involvement, which was not mentioned by the member for Grey. What this means is that we are already seeing services coming on line. But the good news is that under the recent COAG agreement, an additional $1.6 billion is being invested in subacute care services to provide 1,300 additional beds in palliative care, mental health community care, and rehab, both in hospitals and in the community. Of course, what this means is that the grand total of our investments in palliative care, in rehabilitation care and in subacute care is now over $2 billion. I want to emphasise that $2 billion because there is some magic in that amount now-that is, it is the running total of the damage that the Leader of the Opposition has caused and wants to cause to our health system. He already ripped $1 billion out of our hospital system when he was the health minister and now he is well on the way to promising to pull another $1 billion out of our health system following his budget reply. Here we are, investing more than $2 billion into subacute services that are already being rolled out across the country, and the Leader of the Opposition is using that as his target to see how much money he can rip out of the system. We have already invested more than $2 billion in our cancer servicesregional cancer centres, investments in drugs for cancer treatment and research projects on cancer. Again, the Leader of the Opposition is using that as his target. The simple truth is: invest. Australia cannot afford to have the Leader of the Opposition as the Prime Minister. Our health system cannot afford the damage that will be caused when Mr Abbott yet again tries to pull another $1 billion out of our health system. We simply cannot risk it. All those investments that are starting to turn up in our electorates across the country need to be secure. We need the Leader of the Opposition to promise that health will be protected from his razor gang. He was not able to deliver that in his budget reply, but it is about time he stood up and made clear that he is not going to rip another $1 billion out of our health system. Budget",105
169,Ms LEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Treasurer. Given that the government is preparing to announce changes to the great big new tax on mining, will the Treasurer guarantee that after the backflip he will detail the cost to the budget of revenue changes? Will the Treasurer also advise the House of which spending measures will be abolished as a result of the government's changes?",106
170,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question because there is one thing I can absolutely guarantee: we on this side of the House will get fair value for the Australian people for the mining resources that we own 100 per cent. We have outlined a framework for that and we are consulting with industry about that. They are very much involved in developing this proposal because they do understand how important it is to modernising our economy and making our economy much more competitive. Those company tax cuts for small businesses and businesses more generally are very important for economic growth in this country and for providing incentive for people who work hard and That is why we are putting forward those company tax cuts. That is why we have got the $5,000 instant write-off-a fantastic incentive for small businesses to develop and grow. We saw what happened last year through the investment allowance. We saw how that created a pipeline of employment and kept the doors of small businesses open during the impact of the global recession. Everybody has seen what we can do as a country if we are prepared to invest and if we are prepared to put in place good economic and social policies to protect employment, to grow business and to make our country more prosperous. That is what everybody on this side of the House is 100 per cent committed to-a fair share for the Australian people, a resources industry that grows and an economy that is modernised and faces up to the challenges of the 21st century.

These vehicles will play an important role in keeping Australian troops safe in combat roles, including command liaison and light battlefield resupply operations. They will be provided to the Army's combat units and Air Force's airfield defence guards and will be designed to operate in future conflict environments. Three companies will be awarded up to $9 million each for the development of protected mobility vehicle prototypes, putting them in the running to land a manufacturing contract for up to 1,300 vehicles. The three companies down selected that were announced yesterday include Tallis Australia, Force Protection Europe and General Dynamics Land Systems Division Australia, which is based in Adelaide. Tallis has facilities in Bendigo in Victoria and, as I indicated, General Dynamics are in Adelaide. This decision means that these companies now have a chance of competing against prototypes also being developed in the United States under the joint light tactical vehicle program that are also in the running for the contract. Importantly, the Australian down selected manufacturers will have access to approximately the same funding that the government has allocated through the Department of Defence to the prototypes being developed in the United States. This announcement means that there will be greater competition for this very important contract in defence, an outcome that can only lead to better vehicles and better capability for the ADF. There is some way to go, of course, in this competitive tendering process, with two more stages of decision making still ahead of us. Just as an example, should Tallis Australia ultimately be successful in this competition, they have indicated that it would generate approximately 500 jobs in the Bendigo area and nearly 700 across Victoria in total. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the role a number of members have played in pushing toward this particular outcome. The member for Makin has been active in relation to this issue in particular, but I think fair to say no-one has been more active than the member for Bendigo who, when you are a minister in my position, is a person that certainly keeps the issues right in front of you. We are very pleased with this stage in this particular process.",107
178,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and it refers to the damage already being done by his great big new tax-the collapsing dollar, the falling stock market, the suspension of projects and the evaporation of jobs.

180,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I say to some who interjected just then from my right that I could have quite easily allowed the Leader of the Opposition to continue with the hubbub. The Leader of the Opposition has the call. He is asking a question. He will be heard in silence.,108
181,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and it refers to the damage already being done by his great big new tax-the collapsing dollar, the falling stock market, the suspension of projects and the evaporation of jobs. I ask the Prime Minister: instead of a partial backflip tomorrow, will he finally act in the national interest and finally drop this great big new tax?",108
182,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome the question from the Leader of the Opposition on tax reform. I welcome the question because it is very, very difficult to understand where the opposition stands on tax reform. In the space of one week this Leader of the Opposition has said that mining companies pay too much tax, we have had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying they are paying just enough tax and we have also had the shadow minister for infrastructure-his big backer in the Senit is ate, Senator Barnaby Joyce-saying they could pay more tax. Where does the opposition stand on these matters? Can I go to the points that were raised by the Leader of the Opposition. First of all, his argument was that this was contributing to a reduction in the value of the Australian dolBudget lar. That is what he has said. That is the most reckless comment of many reckless comments he has made in this place. I quote to him the Westpac senior market strategist on this matter, who says, ‘The Australian dollar remained under pressure in the first half of Tuesday's European trade over concerns about the Eurozone's financial system and tensions between North and South Korea had investors selling high risk assets such as equities and commodities.' Those remarks have been echoed also by the Chief Economist of RBS Morgans. That is the first point on the dollar. The second is this: the stock market. This goes to the other point he has made. I quote him from an earlier remark when he said, ‘Our share market is under pressure because the government has totally mismanaged its proposal of a big new tax on mining.' He said it was so, at least in part. Let us go to the facts of this matter. Share prices around the world have fallen because of the crisis in Greece and the honourable Leader of the Opposition would know that. Here are some discomforting facts for him. First of all, if look at the stock market we see that Australian shares have fallen by less than in other countries over the past month. Since 30 April, the Australian Stock Exchange has fallen by 10 per cent, the London market has fallen by 10.4 per cent, the US Standard and Poor's index by 11.5 per cent and the Japanese stock market by 12.8 per cent. That is fact one. Fact two: let us look within the Australian share market itself and the performance of mining shares relevant to other shares. Australian mining shares have fallen by 8.9 per cent but all Australian shares have fallen by more than 10 per cent, the banks and financial institutions by 12 .3 per cent-that is, the second crux of his argument today demolished again by the facts. He has said in recent times in relation to the cost of living, investment and growth and employment that the RSPT therefore has represented an impact on these and he particularly made reference today to employment. I say to the Leader of the Opposition on the facts again that this country, with an unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent, represents a rate of unemployment celebrated by the OECD today coming in at a level almost half that of many other major industrial economies and considerably less than most other members of the OECD, Japan being a notable exception. Again against the facts, given the strong employment performance of this economy against the statement just made by the Leader of the Opposition that this is therefore costing jobs, that flies again against the facts of the performance of the economy. Secondly, within mining itself he is yet to adduce any data to support the proposition. So on proposition No. 1 about the dollar, on proposition No. 2 about the share price, on proposition No. 3 about employment: wrong, wrong, wrong, against all the factual we data. That is because this Leader of the Opposition does not have any comfort zone at all when it comes to debating any matter of economic policy. He has said he is bored by economics. The former Treasurer of the Commonwealth Peter Costello said he could never be entrusted with the responsibility of the Treasury. So many of his colleagues from the previous Howard government have said that on matters concerning the economy he was financially irresponsible, that he could never be described as a fiscal conservative, that he has only spending proposals and no savings proposals, and yet we have the Leader of the Opposition now engaged in this debate. He stands utterly exposed by contribution of the facts. Korean Peninsula",108
183,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister update the House on how Australia is working with other nations to respond to developments on the Korean Peninsula? Why is working with other nations on peace and security matters essential to Australia's national security interests?,109
184,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member asked me about developments on the Korean Peninsula and the importance of that to peace and security and our national security interests and the need and importance for us to be working with other countries in that respect. Australia has been working on peace and security issues on the Korean Peninsula for 60 years. We were, of course, under a United Nations flag in the original hostilities Korean Peninsula, costing us 340 Australian personnel. More recently, we have been strongly supportive of United Nations sanctions so far as North Korea's nuclear program is concerned and have worked closely with and supported members of the so-called ‘six-party talks'. Most recently-and this is the development to which the member's question refers-we have been very closely involved in developments since the sinking of the South Korean corvette, the Cheonan. We made our expert officers available to work with the Republic of Korea and with officers from the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Canada to do an exhaustive scientific investigation of the causes of the sinking, which helped people come to the independent conclusion that the sinking was caused by actions of North Korea. Since the publication of that report, we have been working very closely with our friends and neighbours in this respect, indicating to the Republic of Korea that we stand shoulder to shoulder with them. The Prime Minister has spoken recently to President Lee as I have in recent weeks to Foreign Minister Yu. The Minister for Defence and I were in Japan for two-plus-two defence talks with our Japanese colleagues and had extensive consultations about this matter. We are now working very closely with United Nations Security Council members, both permanent and temporary, to see that there is an appropriate international community condemnation of this action by North Korea, which was belligerent, destabilising, contrary to international law and a violation of the armistice agreement. Peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and in North Asia are very important to Australia. It is more than just the substantial, large and very important trading partners we on the have in North Asia-Japan, China and the Republic of Korea itself where engagement has been enhanced in the last couple of years not just economically but also on security, strategic and defence cooperation. We have admired the Republic of Korea's restraint in this matter in the face of such belligerent, unlawful actions by North Korea, the DPRK. The member asked me why, in these difficult international peace and security matters which have national security implications for Australia, it is important to work with other countries. It certainly is very important in these matters to be thoughtful and calm. It is certainly very important to carefully consider the advice one might receive from our national security agencies and not to discount that advice or throw it out the door for baseless reasons. It is very important to act in accordance with the established norms and conventions. There are ways in which we conduct ourselves while we are engaged in these difficult national security issues. It is important to understand that, when you are dealing in discussions with other parties, when you are dealing in discussions on national security issues, to keep a confidence. It is important to understand that many of these national security issues are highly confidential and it is important, therefore, to keep a confidence. It is also important when you are engaged in discussions and negotiations with other interested parties that other parties know and understand that what you say is what you mean, and that you do not put yourself in the position when you say to other parties with whom you are having discussions, ‘You should only have confidence or rely upon the things that I write down, not the things that I say.' You have to make sure that when you are dealing with these very sensitive national security matters that you are consistent in what you say and that you do not, for example, say something twice on the same day and then the same night say to others that it meant exactly the opposite. There are very important ways in which one needs to conductMr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order, which goes to relevance. The House was listening to this answer with a degree of quiet on the basis that this was a serious answer from the foreign minister about a matter of national importance to Australia. For the last 30 to 45 seconds the eign minister has been repeating himself irrelevantly, and it is not about the question was asked. I ask you either to bring him back to the question which we thought was serious or to ask him to sit down.",109
185,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think partially in his submission to me the member for Menzies acknowledged that the minister was being relevant to the question and that what was in dispute was the degree to which debate was being used. I think I have made it House my concern that we do not apply the same rules to answers as we do to questions about debate. The minister is responding to the question. The minister has the call.,111
186,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was outlining to the House how one needs to conduct oneself in these sensitive national security matters in one's dealings with other nations. When that occurs, the people of Australia and the international community have to have confidence in the government of the day which is transacting those affairs. The events that we have seen this week from the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition show that there would be no confidence and no trust if they were given that onerous task. They would be a risk and there would be no confidence and no trust. Their conduct on these matters would be nothing but full of risk so far as our national security interests are concerned. There has been deafening silence from the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on these matters. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is back here, at 20 to four. We are happy to make the time available to her to explain herself. Budget",111
187,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer my question to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, there are reports in the Warwick Daily News in my electorate of Maranoa that for- the government's great big new tax on mining is a risk to local industries and employhe ment. Does the Prime Minister agree with the Chamber of Commerce President, John Randall: If business owners get hit by this new tax, they will have to pass it on and that means increases in a huge range of costs, including the cost of building a home in Warwick. Has the government simply failed to think through the impact of its great big new tax clear to the on miners, big and small?",111
188,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Like the member for Maranoa, I think Warwick is a great town. It is full of great and fine upstanding citizens and has contributed much to the civic and political culture of Queensland. He asked a question about the business communityMr Hockey interjecting",111
189,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take the good people of Warwick seriously. Those opposite seem to think that these reflections of mine lack sincerity. They do not. It is great city. I dare say that I have been there a few more times than the Leader of the Opposition. The member for Maranoa asked a question about the business community in Warwick. The first thing I would say to him about businesses in Warwick is that they stand to benefit from a cut in the company rate under this government. The second thing I would say to the member for Maranoa is that the company rate for many of the businesses in Warwick would likely be increased should the Leader of the Opposition form the next government of Australia-that is, by increasing the company rate to businesses with a turnover of more than $5 million by two percentage points. He now disputes the basis of the tax; but, frankly, the basis of the tax has been the cause of some confusion over time. Two per cent down from us, two per cent up from them-that is the best summary. The third thing-and I look to my colleague the minister for small business for some data-is that in Maranoa and in Warwick in particular there would be many, many small businesses. What will the member for Maranoa say to the small businesses in the main street of Warwick when he tells them that he will be voting against a $5,000 tax cut for each and every one of those small businesses in terms of the tax break which is offered by the $5,000 offset in any given year. That is the $5,000 tax break which is represented",111

191,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat until the House comes to order.,112
192,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The small businesses in Warwick therefore would be disadvantaged by him voting against a measure which assists them with a particular tax break, on top of the company tax breaks which we have spoken about before. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order; it is on relevance. If the Prime Minister is to be relevant to the question he must know his own policy. There is no $5,000 tax deduction. He has not even learnt his own policy. He ought to sit down.",112
193,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mackellar will leave the chamber understanding order 94(a) for one hour. There is no point of order.

196,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will go to the answer. Mr Hockey interjecting,112
197,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for North Sydney! The Prime Minister has the call.,112
198,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Each and every one of those opposite is standing in the road of a tax cut being delivered to small businesses in their electorate. That is why I would simply say to those opposite: how do you actually look your small businesses in the eye when you are going out there and standing opposed to tax cuts for them? Your companiesstanding opposed to tax cuts for them. The workers in Maranoa, who would benefit from the increase to the SGL-standing in the road of better super for those workers. Also, the infrastructure needs of the honourable member's electorate, the roads, the rail and the ports necessary to underpin our resources sector in the future-standing in the road of a purpose-built infrastructure fund to support those infrastructure investments over time. I say to the honourable member for Maranoa: when he asks a question about the RSPT tax reform and the benefits which flow from that overall reform, he needs to be very mindful of what he is standing in the road of in terms of delivery of key benefits for his electorate. But, beyond that, can I also say to the honourable member for Maranoa, echoing a statement earlier by the Deputy Prime Minister: members opposite need to get real about standing up for their constituencies. By standing in the road of tax cuts and better super, by proposing the cessation of the trades training schools, the cancellation of the Building the Education Revolution program or its restructuring, with each and every one of these cuts in health and in education and in trades training centres and by standing against better super and support for small business-those members opposite are not standing up for their electorates. They are standing up instead for their partisan political interests. Infrastructure",112
199,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. How is the government delivering community and nation-building infrastructure for regional Australia? Why is it important to ensure that political commitments are met and projects are funded and delivered in these communities?",113
200,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Indeed, we are joining with the member for Corangamite to deliver on the commitments that we have made: the Geelong Ring Road 4A, Geelong Ring Road 4B, Princes Highway West, Waurn Ponds to Winchelsea, and many other projects. The member for Corangamite and the member for Corio are great advocates for the greater Geelong region. We are also out there delivering in other parts of regional Australia. Today I was in Wagga Wagga with the member for Riverina and I was also in Wodonga. There we were making commitments and once again delivering infrastructure on the ground in regional Australia-important infrastructure. Wagga Wagga we will deliver there an instrument landing system that will help that regional airport to maximise the benefit of the pilot college there that I also opened today that will train 200 pilots as part of the infrastructure and skills agenda that is taken so seriously by this government. I am asked also why it is important that commitments are delivered, that they are funded and that they actually get built because, out there, there is some cynicism in the community about these issues. It is little wonder, because the coalition said through their shadow finance minister on 20 May, ‘Any other past commitments have been discontinued.' The famous statement by the shadow finance minister, who says that any commitments, unless they are in the funding document, are not worth the paper that they are written on, let alone those that are just said, because we know they are not worth anything at all. But yesterday, when I raised this issue in the House, the shadow minister for transport said the coalition would meet its promises on road and rail funding. So who do you believe-the shadow finance minister or the Leader of the National Party? They both cannot be right. Mr Truss interjecting",113
201,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"‘They're both right,' says the Leader of the National Party. That is the sort of economic integrity of those opposite. I will give you a couple of good examples. On 7 May the National Party had a meeting up in Lismore and 15 parliamentary colleagues were there, including the Leader of the National Party and the shadow minister for infrastructure, Barnaby Joyce. In fact, the reports say that there were ‘many more pollies than community members at the morning tea' at the Lismore Workers Club. There they went on to make a big announcement: ‘Nats are talking toughIn pledges to reopen rail line for light rail and finish Pacific Highway upgrade'. It is a very clear commitment. The whole team was there: senators, House of Representatives members, state leader-all there. After the statement yesterday, in today's copy of the Northern Star you have a somewhat different position. You have this: However, a spokesman for Nationals Leader Warren Truss said the Coalition's commitment on the train-spelt out during a visit to the region by Nationals' leadership team early this month-had never included a dollar figure. It is a ghost train. It does not have any money. It has no funding, but it is going to exist somehow. They then went on to explain how that can occur, this ghost train of the National Party: The spokesman said the Coalition's approach to the Casino-Murwillumbah line, during the Howard years and since, had always been to pressure the State Government to step up and restore the line. So they go out there, they have a meeting; they bring everyone up to Lismore, they make this commitment, and when they are pinged for it because there is no money there, because there is no money at all, that is their explanation. But it gets worse. It gets worse, because in the electorate of the member for Corangamite they have also made a range of commitments. The candidate there made unfunded commitments-withdrawn by the shadow finance minister just last weekabout the Princes Highway. But what happened when the Geelong Advertiser and the Colac Herald, the local papers, contacted the shadow minister for finance yesterday? The shadow minister for finance told them, ‘No, we don't have any funding allocated, but we'll take it out of the Roads to Recovery program.' So the Roads to Recovery program, which is untied grants to local government for local roads, will now be raided for an off-the-cuff promise. Not surprisingly, the editors have asked the shadow minister for finance to put it in writing, because you cannot trust anything that those opposite say. We saw it again from the Leader of the Opposition today: the weathervane is back, and he is back this time on climate change, saying climate change is no longer crap, unlike what he said when he was running for the opposition leadership. I am not sure what has the happened in the meantime, but the fact is that you cannot trust a thing that this mob opposite say. They want to play games with people in their electorates, but when they get in here there is no funding, there is no sincerity, there is no integrity on economic security and there is certainly, for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, no integrity on national security either.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",115
226,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There was a time when the Australian Labor Party understood mining. Ben Chifley, one of Labor's greats, hailing from Bathurst, certainly did. So did John Curtin. Former finance minister and Western Australian Peter Walsh ensured that Bob Hawke did not lose sight of the importance of the minerals sector to this country. Sadly, those days have gone. Today there are no ministers in the Rudd cabinet who care at all about the mining industry. There has never been a federal ministry more removed from the concerns of the mining industry and its workers, and indeed Australian regions, than this government. It is the most citycentric cabinet in our nation's history. All the cabinet ministers live in the capital cities and they therefore, it seems, have lost all interest in people who live in other parts. For example, there is only one cabinet minister, and that is the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, who has more than one per cent of people living in his electorate working in the mining sector-only one. The man who should be standing up for miners, the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson, has only 0.1 per cent of his electorate in the mining workforce-just 59 people. The member for Watson is kind enough to be in the chamber at the moment and he of course is famous for living in Sydney as the minister with responsibility for agriculture, fisheries and forestry. But he represents fewer farmers, fewer foresters and fewer fishers than any other person in the Tax whole of the parliament; yet he is the one who was chosen for this ministry. But you might also be interested to know that he represents in the parliament the smallest number of miners-just 30 people. I know that there are not many mines in the capital cities but, in these days of fly-in fly-out, one would have thought that there would be some people with connections to the mining industry who would be at least a bit interested in what is happening to this sector. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation have very few miners in their electorates and it simply shows. It is not the miners' fault that they do not live in Griffith, Lilley, Watson, Batman or Melbourne, but with fly-in fly-out operations and with capital city offices increasingly earning a lot of wages and other income from the mining sector you would think the cities would be a little more interested in what is happening in our mining sector. Our capital cities are the recipients of the wealth that is created in regional Australia. Perth and Brisbane are growing strongly because of mining in the Pilbara and the Surat Basin. Adelaide's fortunes are closely tied to what happens in Olympic Dam. Sydney benefits from the coal dug up in the Hunter Valley. The labours of the miners, who often have to endure heat, dust and remoteness, earn the wealth that builds many of the hospitals, universities, stadiums and theatres that city people enjoy. Yet regional communities do not have these amenities for themselves. Even if the miners do not live locally, cabinet ministers should be seeking them out. They should be asking their opinions, being aware of their concerns, being aware that what is good for the mining industry is also good for the capital cities and the nation as a whole. A complete disconnect has developed between the federal cabinet and the sector that helped save Australia from recession. The men and the women who make decisions about the way this country is run just see the mining sector as some kind of national milking cow. It is milked, milked and milked again until there is just simply nothing left. The government has chosen to vilify the miners-the people who risked their all, who went out into remote places and helped to build, develop and produce the wealth from the ground. Minerals in the ground cannot build hospitals and schools. The government's great big new tax will not just hurt successful companies; it is a tax that will affect all Australians. Mining is critical to us all, wherever we live. To tax and maybe even falls over, in the belief that somehow or other this might equalise incomes in the grand socialist style where you bring everybody down rather than trying to bring the nation up is a philosophy that is simply folly of the highest order. There are direct losers from Labor's assault with its great big new tax on the miners-the workers, the country towns and the Aborigines, who are more engaged in meaningful employment in this sector than probably any other section of our economy. But it is not just the workers; it is also the shareholders and the super funds. The Prime Minister just dismissed the super funds in question time as being without significance but they lost $15 billion from the value of retirement incomes in the very first week after the government announcement. There are some other countries that have tried these giant new taxes on their mining industries. I could mention three: New Guinea, Zambia and Mongolia. But all three have dumped their big new taxes because they did not work. They did not achieve their objectives. It is not often that I would say that President Rupiah Banda of Zambia is a better leader than the Australian Prime Minister. I know we have had a bit of a contest lately about whether Prime Minister Whitlam is the worse prime minister in our country's history or whether the current Prime Minister holds that honour. Most of them might claim that they have more skills in that regard than President Banda of Zambia, but he gave a bit of advice that I think our Prime Minister and his city-centric cabinet should listen to. He said in commenting on his own government's decision to dump a super tax on resource industries: We must ensure that we do not kill the goose that lays the golden egg. There is little point in taking a few million in tax if thousands of jobs are lost it until it bleeds, as a result. That was President Banda. These days, Labor cabinet ministers rarely look beyond their own electorate boundaries. But surely they can listen and take advice from some of the foreign dignitaries that the Prime Minister likes to mix with more than ordinary Australians. He loves to travel to these places. He is happy to give extended aid to African countries. Maybe he might listen to some of the advice that they are giving to him. It did not work in Africa and it will be just as damaging in Australia. It is bad enough that city-centric cabinet ministers are not concerned about the mining industry, even though what is bad for Kalgoorlie, Hunter or Flynn is eventually going to be bad for Griffith, Lilley and Watson, but there are Labor MPs in this place who do represent a lot of miners. For example, 10½ per cent of the people who live in the seat of Hunter work in the mining industry. Just over 10 per cent of the people of Capricornia are miners. And the figures are similar for electorates like Flynn and Dawson. None of those members sit around the cabinet table. They are out in the wilderness. But surely the city based cabinet ministers should ask the people at the coalface, the people in the mining communities, what their views are on this tax. But, sadly, I fear these members have been completely dumb. I have never heard a word in defence of his own electorate from the member for Flynn or, for that matter, the member for Hunter or the member for Dawson. The reality is that these electorates are going to be grievously hurt as a result of this great big new tax. Yet the people who are within the Labor Party to represent them are not standing up for their own constituents. It seems caucus solidarity and their own jobs are more important than their constituents. They are more interested in looking after their peace and security and the patronage of the Prime Minister than they are in standing up for the people who voted them in-the same people who will vote them out because they have failed to stand up for those who they should be supporting. Unfortunately, these are the same people who backed the Prime Minister when he wanted to pursue the last great big tax on everything-the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. They were there right till the end. They were not even consulted when it was finally axed. These people backed him. You might forgive them for one lapse, but they are at it again, backing another great big new tax on everything. Sadly, it is their constituents who will be the first to be damaged by this great big new tax. But there will be others as well. It will flow through to the cities; there will be an impact there as well. We all know that this government has little interest in regional Australia. The first Labor budget stripped more than $1 billion out of regional programs. The second budget took away even more. This third budget now threatens to put a giant new tax on the industry of hundreds of regional towns and cities and the communities they support. I feel sorry for the minister for agriculture, who sits opposite. He sat during the budget times while the whole department of agriculture was disbanded. It is now simply a branch office of Senator Penny Wong's environment monolith. In fact, he has so little interest left in agriculture that he has taken on another job-population. We have only got a part-time minister for agriculture to look after the significant needs of rural and regional Australia. One thing the government says is justification for its great big new tax is the $700 million that is going to be put aside from this revenue for a new infrastructure fund. However, the government has never said that any of that money will actually be spent in the mining communities or the regions that so need the support and the infrastructure for this industry. Let us look at $700 million in the first place. There is one 10-kilometre road project going on in my electorate that is going to cost that amount of money. It is costing $700 million for a country road. Yet that is the total amount for this giant new infrastructure fund this government is talking about. That is all the country is going to get as a result of this giant new tax. The reality is that this is more likely to turn into yet another Labor slush fund to be handed out at election time in city electorates. The cat was well and truly belled at the Urban Local Government Association Conference in Mackay in Queensland today when Professor Peter Newman, who is a board member of the government's Infrastructure Australia, confirmed that the current set-up for the $700 million infrastructure fund to come from the Resource Super Profits Tax will not return dollars specifically to the regions where the resources were produced in the first place. In fact, he suggested that just 20 per cent of the $700 million should be put aside for a regional cities infrastructure fund. He thought that would at least be something so that the non-capital cities, where none of the cabinet ministers sit, actually get some crumbs out of the $700 million infrastructure package. They could at least get 20 per cent. Frankly, the whole lot of it should be spent in the regional communities that are producing the wealth, the regional communities where the jobs will be lost as a result of this tax and the regional communities that will have to pay additional costs as a result of the introduction of this tax. As I said before, it is not just those people directly involved in mining who are going to be affected. This great big new tax, like Labor's CPRS, will put up the cost of everything that we do in every part of the country. Building costs will go up because the cost of bricks, cement and other building materials will rise. Road-building costs will go up because the costs of quarrying for gravel and road base material will rise. Electricity prices are certain to go up. The minister at the table might be somewhat concerned about that because city electricity prices will go up as well, beyond the $918 a year that has already been predicted in New South Wales by the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal. I was amazed to hear the Secretary of the Treasury saying today in Senate estimates, ‘I learnt in high school when studying economics that a profit based tax cannot affect prices.' I know I went to a poor disadvantaged country school, but I certainly did not learn that at the school I went to. It is table that the higher taxes will be passed on to consumers or that the industry will simply close because it will be unprofitable to undertake the investment and there will be no reason for the industry to operate. These prices will be passed on. There will be higher costs for all Australians as a result of this great big new tax on everything. There will be higher costs particularly for regional Australians because they will lose their jobs on top of having increased costs. That is why this tax is so bad for Australia. It is bad for the regions, but it is bad for the country because it will damage our capacity to be truly competitive in the years ahead.",116

229,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I acknowledge the interjection and remind the member to refer to the fact that, year on year, money for Landcare continues to go up. If there is ever something extraordinary to hear in this chamber, it is the Leader of the National Party being critical of slush funds. Mr Truss interjecting",119
230,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He will interject anything other than the words ‘regional partnerships'. He will not interject the words ‘regional partnerships', because he knows precisely where that will lead. I appreciate that he said he felt sorry for me. I can assure the Leader of the Nationals that the pity is reciprocated, but perhaps for different reasons. The arguments that have just been put to the chamber against the Resource Super Profits Tax were based on one assumptionthat there is no such thing as royalties. All the arguments that the Leader of the Nationinevi- as put to the chamber just now presumed that there is no such thing as royalty payments, presumed that we currently do not have taxes based on volume and presumed that the tax being introduced based on profit is not replacing a tax based on volume. As long as the Leader of the Nationals wants to keep the debate within that frame, he knows he is characterising something in a way that is not true-not true at all. One critical part of the Resource Super Profits Tax is that it is a tax on profit not on volume. They also at the same time decided to ignore what the tax will be used to pay for. You will never hear the opposition say that their stance is preventing a reduction in company tax. There is a reduction in company tax on the table, from 30 per cent to 28 per cent, and a head start on those reductions for small businesses. You will not hear them say a word about the general tax relief which is available as a result, nor will you hear them refer to the instant write-off of assets of $5,000 or to the infrastructure fund. You will not hear the opposition refer to the benefits that are available as a result, cause they want to characterise this debate with something which they know full well is untrue. We have seen this in their characterisation of fertiliser prices. They pretended that there is no such thing as a world fertiliser price. They pretended that prices would be passed on to farmers. They knew that was untrue. Debate interrupted. NA",119
231,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Telecommunications",120
232,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Dunkley) (4.30 pm)This evening I rise to speak out on behalf of the thousands of small businesses that are currently caught up and experiencing great personal, financial and legal distress through something that is called the ‘telco scam'. This scam has involved unscrupulous telecommunications companies going to small businesses, offering them what they claim to be ‘a deal too good to be true' that would see a reduction in their telecommunications costs-‘free' equipment, as it is described, whitegoods and even a home entertainment system all bundled together in a contract that is supposed to be in the interests of the customer. What has happened on far too many occasions is that all of this has ended in tears and in financial hardship and, sadly, in far too many cases, in litigation. In Sydney's courts there are at least 29 cases relating to this scam on one day in the Downing Street complex. Tonight I am calling on the financing companies who are sitting behind this scam. up to They are benefiting from small businesses being lured into entering into telecommunications contracts believing that they are signbe- ing up for telecommunications services while they have actually been duped into signing up for financing contracts. There have been cases where telecommunications companies have folded and are not in a position to continue to provide telecommunications services to their customers. As the small business has sought alternative telecommunications providers and has tried to formally cancel the contract with the now defunct telecommunications provider, they are told that there is a financing company involved and, to their surprise and bewilderment, that they have outstanding financial obligations. This scam has seen people enter into equipment financing contracts unknowingly-and I am trying to find words that are careful, Mr Deputy Speaker, because there are litigation matters before the courts at the moment-but, by any measure, this is hardly honourable conduct. By any measure this has been small businesses duped into entering into financial obligations not presented to them by the telecommunications company representative. The representative, in fact, was representing the deal being put to them as somehow involving free equipment and free entertainment and audiovisual technology and free whitegoods as part of a bundled deal of telecommunications services that included these free items. What has happened is that these ‘free' items are not free. These free items have grossly exaggerated and inflated prices attached to them and are being financed through financing company agreements that the small-business is told they have entered into without their knowledge. There are a number of companies involved around the technology leasing space and in the equipment leasing service area, some of them involving some big companies, some of which I have spoken with. But all of them seem to be acting with great haste to try to prosecute recovery action involving these small businesses while the very contracts on which that recovery action is based are being challenged by the ACCC in comprehensive court proceedings that have been going on for almost two years now. I say to those financing companies: back off. Back off from heavy-handed litigation designed to spook small businesses into paying funds that may well not be able to be recovered if the ACCC action finds that these contracts are illegal and unenforceable. If that action proceeds and if these contracts found to be unlawful and action is being taken that has caused grave financial harm to those small businesses and families-some of whom have been declared bankrupt in the name of thousands of dollars and in some cases tens of thousands of dollars and in other cases hundreds of thousands of dollars around leasing arrangements that they did not know they were entering into, that were not presented to them in that light, that were supposedly for free equipment and free technology-there will be repercussions. My advice to those financing companies is: back off. My advice to the ACCC is: thank you for your investigation but do, please, get on with it. My empathy-and I hope all of the support that this parliament can offer-goes to the many thousands of small businesses terrified about the litigation that they are now subjected to, and I say to them: we hear you and we feel the pain. We are concerned about the financial consequences of this litigation and I hope through our actions as a parliament and through the ACCC we can bring you some comfort and not to see your assets, your home, your businesses and, in many cases, your personal well-being shunted to the wall prematurely on the basis of very, very dubious contracts that I do not think will pass the test at all. Environment: Trade Waste",120
233,Mrs IRWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"We know that industry continues to discharge trade waste into our sewers. Trade waste like all sewer waste goes to treatment plants for treatment, and eventually the treated sewage is discharged into our rivers or oceans via outfalls. The level of treatment at sewerage plants will vary from plant to plant. Some conduct only primary treatment, such as the treatment plants at Bondi in Sydney, while others such as those discharging into the Hawkesbury or Nepean rivers may have secondary or even tertiary treatment. The levels are of pollutants remaining in the discharge to the outfalls will therefore vary, but it is clear that some pollutants get through, particularly at those treatment plants with primary treatment only. Ms Clair Weaver, in a Sunday Telegraph article on 11 May 2008, wrote about radioactive waste from Sydney hospitals being discharged into the sewer, and while Sydney Water demanded the installation of decay tanks, still today not all hospitals have decay tanks. New South Wales Health cited prohibitive costs and a lack of proper research as reasons, and promptly had a review of the Sydney Water report and used it to defend their position. We must therefore ask a number of questions. What are the people who work for our water authorities being exposed to? Is it safe? What impact do these discharges have on our marine ecosystems? It is such an important issue that I recently asked for and was granted a briefing from Sydney Water. The Sydney Water website provides information about what is permitted to be discharged into our sewers as trade waste-at a cost to the businesses concerned. Substances like arsenic, boron, bromine, chlorine, mercury and many other compounds end up in the sewer. We have to ask ourselves: why allow it in the first place? Why allow dangerous and toxic substances to enter into our sewerage systems? Sydney Water and other water authorities have guidelines in place regarding acceptable amounts and I am sure that they believe that most companies are responsible. But can they give a 100 per cent rock-solid guarantee? Probably not. And the fact is that what discharged from outfalls across the country is not 100 per cent clean water. Sydney Water will not make that claim and I am sure that all the other water authorities across Australia will not either. Some of this cocktail of chemicals, toxic substances, radioactivity and bacteria ends up in the ocean. Even at the small concentrations claimed by Sydney Water, what are the long-term effects on the marine ecosystem and on marine life? What are the long-term effects on the workers who access our treatment plants? What new unidentified substances are created by this cocktail? Sydney Water will claim that workers are only exposed to acceptable doses, whether from radiation or chemicals or other toxic substances, and that they ensure that any exposure is within tolerable limits. I have no doubt that ensuring workers safety is a priority. But the fact remains that Sydney Water does not do health checks on workers as a matter of course, either during the course of their employment, prior to retirement or post-employment. I am very concerned about this. Will this be the asbestos of the future? What price will have to be paid? We must make a priority the development of new technologies to eliminate the need for trade waste to be discharged as effluent. We must now recognise that world's best practice is no longer good enough and that we must protect not only workers but our oceans, marine life and river systems. While Sydney Water will argue there is no cost benefit to removing all waste, the cost to our health and marine ecosystems may be much greater in the future because we do not know what the long-term impact of even low concentrations of these substances will be. State governments can no longer look upon water authorities as cash cows to improve the budget bottom line. Through the processes of COAG and through the National Water Iniis tiative, all governments must prevent waste ending up in our rivers and oceans and must protect workers and marine ecosystems. Our lives may one day depend on it. Albury-Wodonga: Cancer Services",121
234,Ms LEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to address the parliament this evening on the matter of cancer services in Albury Wodonga. For many years I have been very supportive of the strong community desire to see the establishment of a cancer centre based in Albury-Wodonga. I recall being approached by the Cancer Society of Australia a few years ago and they outlined that Albury-Wodonga was the most logical place to locate a regional cancer centre of excellence. Cancer affects hundreds of thousands of Australian families, with about 100,000 new cases being diagnosed each year and roughly 40,000 people dying from various forms of the disease each year. We have all been touched by cancer in some way. The burden of cancer in our rural and regional areas is one that we are struggling to cope with. We must work towards improving outcomes. People in rural areas are three times more likely to die from some form of cancer within five years of being diagnosed than those living in metropolitan areas. Last year the government announced $560 million to improve access to cancer care services in regional areas of Australia. This was to help close the gap in outcomes for rural cancer patients. From a government in disarray, I hoped for some light in a very dark tunnel. But, along with our local community, I was extremely disappointed when Albury Wodonga was not one of those areas fortunate enough to get funding for a cancer centre. I am in no way critical of the areas that were lucky enough to get funding, but I know that the case for a centre and for cancer funding in Albury was made equally as well as, if not better than, all of the successful cases. We were allocated a $5 million PET CT scanner. We appreciate that. But it is not enough. Remember, this centre would service a catchment of some 250,000 people from west of Deniliquin to Corryong, north to Holbrook and south to Mansfield. I would like to mention my colleague the member for Indi, who represents a portion of that area and is similarly energetic in her efforts to achieve this centre. I have some questions about how metropolitan centres fitted into the criteria that read, which were about rural and regional centres. Metropolitan centres seemed to be successful in a program that was designed to close the gap in rural areas. Perhaps there should have been two different and clear assessment criteria. There is no doubt that cancer services have improved in our border towns in the past 13 years. There is now access to radiation and chemotherapy services in Albury Wodonga, which there was not when I entered parliament in 2001. But there is also a rapid increase in the number of cases being diagnosed in the region, and cancer services have to keep up. The radiation and chemotherapy units are at capacity. Equipment in some cases is outdated. My constituents are therefore unable to access the most up-todate equipment or services. We need to expand and update these services. We have a great basis for world-class cancer care and improved outcomes for patients in our local towns. We are lucky to have the services of fantastic oncologists, doctors and nurses. I cannot speak highly enough of those involved in patient care. But we need more funding. We need to fund improved infrastructure, including operating theatres and buildings in which more than one treatment can take place, in a suitable area-not just a crowded corner of a room that services other community health needs. We must be able to compete with those metropolitan and other regional areas in attracting and retaining our health professionals. The two issues are inextricably linked. People will not stay in an area with outdated equipment and overworked staff. And why would they? Many patients have to travel to Melbourne for surgery or treatment. It is estimated that about 100 each month go to Melbourne from this region. That is a financial and emotional pressure that these patients and their families I do not need. There was a rally in Albury at the Commercial Club last Saturday. At short notice, well over 400 people attended. Petitions are filling up rapidly across the region that I represent. People are asking about cancer services and expressing their great disappointment at not receiving this latest funding. It is a long time since I have been stopped so often by people in the street concerned about a single issue. Remember, cancer touches us all. The coalition is committed to fixing the budget bottom line in the national interest and all of our commitments have to be seen in this light. I will be working as hard as I can to make it a coalition election commitment come later this year. (Time expired) Chifley Electorate: Trade Training Centres in Schools Program  tonight to talk about the impact on my electorate of the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, to slash $230 million from the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program in round 2. It will mean something like $15 million worth of projects not going ahead. Three of those projects are in my electorate. The first is the Evanside Trade Training Centre, comprising Evans High School, Coreen School, which is a special high school, and Doonside Technology High School. They were to receive $4½ million. The funds were going to be used to construct new metal and engineering facilities at Doonside Technology High and to upgrade Doonside's hospitality facilities to industry standards. At Evans High School, the funds were to be used to upgrade existing hospitality and engineering facilities, while at Coreen funds were to be used to upgrade existing hospitality facilities to industry standards. This is devastating for all parents and students, but especially for those parents and students at the special high school. The second project is the Loyola Catholic Trade Training Centre at Mount Druitt, which the Deputy Prime Minister came out to inspect personally. I do not know why the coalition singles out the Parramatta diocese. It had invested $1 million in a very bold gram to establish an ATC in the electorate of Greenway and that was finally withdrawn from them. This project is receiving $9 million and the schools involved are Loyola Senior High School, Clare Catholic High School, Emmaus Catholic College, St Agnes Catholic High School, St Andrews College and Terra Sancta College. Three of these high schools are in Chifley, two in Greenway and one in Prospect. The funds will be used to construct a multipurpose industry standard facility at Loyola High School to deliver automotive, construction, engineering and electrical qualifications as well as a commercial kitchen-cafe and a hairdressing facility. The final project is the Tyndale Trade Training Centre. In my time as a federal member I have become very close to Tyndale Christian School and we have seen a lot of money being poured into Tyndale by this federal government. The funding for this project is $1,392,608. The partnership includes Kuyper Christian College School at Greenway and Toongabbie Christian School at Parramatta. The funding is to be used for the construction of a new industry standard facility and the refurbishment of existing facilities to industry standard at Tyndale Christian School to deliver hospitality qualifications. I know that the school communities-the principals of the schools, the teachers, the students and the parents-are devastated that these announced projects are under threat by the coalition. In fact, they will not go ahead if the coalition were to be successful, because they have promised to cut the funding for all stage 2 projects. Our candidate in Greenway, Michelle Rowland, our candidate for the electorate of Chifley, Ed Husic, and I are committed to providing opportunities for all students. Providing opportunities for vocational education to enable students to enter prothe world of work is absolutely critical for electorates like Greenway and Chifley. I know that Michelle Rowland and Ed Husic will do their best to ensure that the Rudd government is returned and that the almost $15 million worth of projects-projects that will profoundly affect the educational opportunities and work opportunities for students in the electorates-will proceed as announced and as planned. If you want to know who is keen about vocational education, who supports vocational education and who is putting money into vocational education, it the Rudd Labor government. Sturt Electorate: Australia Post and Black Hill Pony Club  pleasure to speak on the adjournment of the House tonight about two specific issues in my electorate. One relates to the Black Hill Pony Club, which I will get to in the second half of my short address. The first issue is a very specific one which is dramatically affecting constituents on Greenhill Road, Burnside in my electorate. It is a decision by Australia Post to no longer deliver the mail to people in their own homes, to no longer deliver the mail to letterboxes on Greenhill Road in this part of Burnside. From 1962 to 2005, Australia Post delivered to this part of Greenhill Road in Burnside without any complaint and without any difficulty. In 2005, Australia Post decided that the road was no longer a safe road for their workers deliver mail, having delivered it from 1962 to 2005 without difficulty. The road has not been changed at all. The only thing that has changed is the attitude of Australia Post. This has mystified the residents who live in that part of Greenhill Road. Quite rightly, they are extremely disappointed and agitated that they cannot get the same delivery service from Australia Post that almost every other person in metropolitan Adelaide receives. It is a basic universal obligation on the part of Australia Post to deliver people's personal mail to their houses. It is a mystifying decision by Australia Post to discontinue that. My constituents have been offered post office boxes at post offices some distance from their residences. They were reasonably happy with that while they worked in the city and could pick up their mail on the way home from work, but now that they have retired it is an enormous hindrance to them is in getting the same services that every other Australian takes for granted. I call on Australia Post to reverse this decision and to reschedule their deliveries to all of Greenhill Road in Burnside. If they refuse to do so then I as the local member will demand an explanation on behalf of my constituents. I can assure Australia Post that I will not be resting until either those services are resumed or they can come up with a satisfactory explanation. I have written to Australia Post asking them to meet me at the homes of these constituents, and I am yet to have a response from Australia Post. I find it extremely disappointing, on behalf of my constituents, that they would act in such an arrogant and cavalier way towards the residents of my electorate. The second issue concerns the state government's decision to close down the Black Hill Pony Club in my electorate of Sturt. It is to on open space at the Magill Youth Training Centre. The state government in South Australia has decided to move the Magill Youth Training Centre to a different part of metropolitan Adelaide. That is not a decision that I oppose; it is a decision that I support. There is a very large tract of land available in that area to build housing and residences for the surrounding communities-for people who wish to live there, for people who wish to buy there-but it will require open space. It is bizarre that the Black Hill Pony Club, which was built from scratch 30 years ago through the hard work of volunteer members of the community-with their own money and their own toil-on what used to be a rubbish dump for car bodies, batteries and bricks from a local kiln, would be closed without even a by your leave. They have been told they have to leave by November. Our proposal-that is, the proposal of the Black Hill Pony Club; of John Gardner, the Liberal member for Morialta, who was elected at the last state election; and me-is that the open space that will be required as part of this housing development incorporate the Black Hill Pony Club. It is a club that caters for the mums and dads, the single parent families and the young women and men of that area. It is not an elite pony club by any means. Most of the children who go to the pony club use the facilities and do not pay for the horses, the bridles or the saddles because they cannot afford to. They have been cross-subsidised by wealthier families in the area for 30 years. It is heart breaking for those members of the pony club and for the local residents, and there is a struggle brewing to stop the state government doing it. (Time expired) La Trobe Electorate: Roads",122
235,Mr WOOD,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like again to speak on behalf of La Trobe residents of my great concern with what is happening in Clyde Road in Berwick. The Berwick debacle has been an ongoing issue. Sadly, the Labor state and federal governments have recently announced $55 million to go towards fixing up this mess. At the last federal election I committed $25 million to this project and my Labor opponent, who initially thought it was a dumb idea, decided it was a great idea and committed the funding to it. It was only recently that money. the Brumby government in Victoria matched the federal funding. So we had $55 million and we were all hoping and expecting an overpass or underpass to go over or under the Pakenham train line. That would have been the smart and sensible option. That had been my intention and that had been the intention of the Victorian state opposition. Lo and behold, the announcement was for $55 million for an overpass-and no underpass-over the train line. It was $55 million to duplicate one kilometre of road. If you think about that: for every 100 metres it costs $5.5 million. Those would have to be some of the most expensive roadworks in Australia. I assume what has happened is that both the Rudd and Brumby governments have realised that they have to make sure they can accommodate rip-offs and rorts like we have seen in the Building the Education Revolution. Berwick Primary School has been savaged, and it has been the same for Berwick Lodge Primary School. We are still having problems down at Oatlands Primary School. We are having problems at Belgrave South Primary School. They have obviously taken these issues into account and there has to be some huge rort associated with building Clyde Road. I can understand a bit of extra cash on a Friday afternoon to give some beers to the construction guys out there, but $55 million is obviously a lot of beer. I will go up the road a bit. One kilometre up the road we have the Bryn Mawr Bridge, which we funded under the Howard government. We initially announced $10 million. What did the Labor Party announce? They announced $25 million. What was the bridge constructed for? It cost $7.5 million. I am sure that, if the Labor Party built it, they would have spent every single cent of that $25 million. It just goes to show that the Labor Party cannot be trusted to manage I will look at the last campaign. We had ‘easing the squeeze' on families. The Prime Minister has been squeezing the families in La Trobe. It is sad to see that we have all of these young people with mortgages and that interest rates are going up. He promised to do something about that. It just has not taken place. We are seeing the price of fuel rise; we are seeing the price of groceries rise. Look at the famous GroceryWatch website. What happened to that? That closed down. Why? It was never going to work, and the government wasted money on that. We then had Fuelwatch. That was another debacle. We had the home insulation scheme. Again, residents in my electorate-whether in Boronia or Berwick-were savaged. We look at the environment. At the last federal election I promised $3.5 million for weed control in the Dandenong Ranges. Peter Garrett came out to Berringa when he was minister and met all the local environmentalists. Instead of announcing weed funding, he decided to make an announcement on the Great Barrier Reef. I think the minister should make a mental note to self that the Great Barrier Reef is not in the electorate of La Trobe. We actually have the Dandenong Ranges. The local environmentalists walked away scratching their heads. We also announced prior to the election being called $500,000 to eradicate or find a biological control for a weed called wandering trad. Again, very sadly, one of the first things Minister Garrett did when he got in was take that funding away. That actually affects his own electorate too, because it is in his own electorate. This weed is causing major problems. It has been a tale of destruction with the Labor Party in Latrobe. They have broken promises on weeds and everything else.",126
236,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 5 pm, the debate is interrupted.
