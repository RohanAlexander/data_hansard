1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. 6. J. Bell) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. ADJOURNMENT. BEITISH CONSTITUTIONAL CBISIS: QUESTION OF THE E j N Â« ' s MAKBIAGB .",11
2,Mr LYONS,Unknown,"Wilmot-Prime Minister) [2 -30] - It is not the intention, today to reply to questions without notice or to proceed with any other business, I move That the House do now adjourn. In doing so, I wish to say, in connection with the matter mentioned in this chamber yesterday, that I have no further formation to supply to honourable members, but that I expect to make a definite statement to the House when it meets tomorrow.",11
3,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"Fremantle) [2.32] This is the second day on which the House has assembled and the Prime Minthat, ister (Mr Lyons) has immediately moved "" That the House do now adment journ."" The right honourable gentleman has made no informative statement, other than that the Parliament was refilled in' order to deal with a certain matter. Apparently that certain matter has not yet arisen. . Obviously, however, steps hive been taken somewhere, and may he '.taken by this .Government, which Te'ad to a decision that will be definite and irrevocable. Surely this Parliain ment,, since it was called together, has had time to deliberate upon whether not that decision is one with which agrees or to which it is opposed! I would submit, Mr Speaker, that the Parliament of Australia cannot be blind to the statements that have appeared in the newspapers; nor can its ears be deaf to the rumours that are even now in cirtinction culation. We are as good as told, undelicate officially, that there is to be effected, either today or tomorrow, a certain - event of which this Parliament will then be called upon to take cognizance, but without .any competence to advise as whether the course chosen is desirable undesirable. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",12
4,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"Furthermore, opinions which other dominions have apparently expressed upon this matter arc recorded in the newspapers, whereas there appears to he no information concerning whatever opinion the CommonMajesty, wealth of Australia may have in regard to it. Yesterday, I asked the Prime Minister to make available to the House and to the country the whole extent the communications or intimations that have passed between himself, as the Minister of Australia, and the Governwealth ment of the United Kingdom. There has been no response to that request. We not know what advice this Government has tendered to the Prime Minister of in- England, or lo His Majesty the Kingwho, I would point out, as far as this Parliament is concerned, is the King of Australia. OPPOSITION MEMBERS -'Hear , hear!",12
5,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"I therefore suggest, by reason of the course which the Prime Minister is taking, this Parliais being silenced in regard to a matter of major importance to the Throne, to the succession to the Throne, and to Australia's membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations. It is idle for us to say that this Parliament is to be silent while discussions and negotiations are proceeding, and presummay ably advice is being tendered to His Majesty in this connection, and tendered circumstances which make it impossible for His Majesty to intimate to this or Parliament his personal wishes in the it matter. I have to record that the Opposition is very much dissatisfied with the whole situation-. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",12
6,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"The members of the Opposition feel that there is a great disbetween reticence on a grave and matter, and the discharge of that major responsibility which rests upon this Government and this Parliament, and that the Prime Minister owed it to to the Parliament today, to perhaps a or much greater extent than he did yesterday, to make known what advice he has tendered to His Majesty, and what His Majesty has had to say in response to that advice. Furthermore, the right hon the orable gentleman owed it to this Parliament to make known the origin of the present difficulty-whethe r it was the result of representations made to His or the outcome of representations or suggestions which His Majesty made to the Government of the United Kingdom and, so far as we are concerned, of to the Government of Australia. I object to the Parliament of this selfPrime governing dominion - this Commonof Australia-which , in every major matter that, pertains to this Comdo monwealth, has the right directly to advise His Majesty, being reduced to the status of having merely to legalize whatever action may be taken in another parliament, and without reference to this Parliament. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",12
7,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"We are not here to subordinate our relations to His Majesty the King to the relations that exist between the Government of the United Kingdom and the King. We are here, in the first place, to discharge the entire nature of the relations of this Commonwealth of Australia to the Throne. Had the Prime Minister not moved for the adjournment of the House, I should have asked leave to move the following motion:Tliat the following resolution be transmitted through His Excellency the GovernorGoncral to His Majesty the King: "" We, the members of Hie Houne of .Representatives in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, desire to assure Your Majesty of our loyalty and allegiance, and to express our earnest hope that Your Majesty will not relinquish the Throne."" OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",13
8,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"That is the view of the Opposition. We sincerely hope that His Majesty will not relinquish the Throne. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",13
9,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"We desire this Parliament to direct the Government to tender that advice to His Majesty. It expresses the wish of the Australian Labour movement. As the circumstances in which I find myself preclude mc from asking for leave to move that motion, I now move, as an amendment to the motion of the Prime Ministei*That all the words aft;;r the word "" That"" Fairbairn, .7. V. be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereFisken, A. C. W. of the following words:"" the following resolution be transmitted Green, R. through His Excellency the Govcriinr-OencrnI to His Majesty the King:' We, the members of the House of Holt, H. E. Representatives in the Parliament of the Hughes, W. M. Commonwealth of Australia desire to Hunter, J. A. J. unsure Your Majesty of our loyalty and Hutchinson, W. J. allegiance and to express our earnest hoiic Jennings, J. T. that Your Majestv will not relinquish the Lane, A. Throne.'."" That is a specific statement of the wishes of the Opposition in connection with the present grave and delicate situation. We say that no other advice which the Government of thiB Commonwealth has tendered to His Majesty should be acceptable to this Parliament.",13
