1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA",11
2,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"On Monday, the issue of a statement made by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) in the course of a personal explanation was raised with me. The substance of the complaint was that the honourable member had made an untrue statement to the House in his explanation concerning comments attributed to him in connection with the death of Ms Penny Easton. The deliberate misleading of the House can be found to be a contempt, although since 1987 the test established by section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act needs to be satisfied. I have now had an opportunity to examine the Hansard record of proceedings for last Thursday, together with the transcript of comments by the honourable member for Chisholm when he was interviewed. The statement made by the honourable member may be untrue. However, there are clearly differences of opinion in respect of the remarks of the honourable member and particularly in respect of the conclusions to be drawn from his remarks. I can understand and appreciate the different conclusions that have been reached. This is a matter best left to the judgment of the House. Accordingly, I am prepared to allow precedence to a motion to be moved in relation to it. I present copies of papers relevant to the matter. NA Motion of Condemnation",11
3,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"I move: That: (1) the honourable member for Chisholm has intentionally misled the House in his personal explanation to the House on 24 August 1995, and (2) the House condemns the honourable member for Chisholm for his actions.",11
4,Mr HOWARD,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"On a point of order: Mr Speaker, your decision to give precedence is, as I understand it, a ruling on the matter raised by the Prime Minister. It is therefore, as I understand it, in order for the opposition to move dissent from your ruling, which I do.",11
5,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"The advice I have received is that the Speaker is required to give an opinion and a motion of dissent is not in order. I say to the point of order raised that a complaint was raised with me. I have said that the House can judge the matter. On the basis of precedence, I have said that I am allowing precedence to a motion in respect of this. The Leader of the House has moved a motion in respect of that, which is now the subject of debate.",11
6,Mr HOWARD,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"Mr Speaker, I am moving dissent from your decision.",11
7,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"No, you can't do that.",11
8,Mr HOWARD,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,I can't move dissent from your decision?,11
9,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,No.,11
10,Mr HOWARD,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"That is unprecedented. What you are saying is that you have made a decision and your decision is that you are prepared to allow precedence. You can't argue, Mr Speaker, that it is not a decision of the chair to give precedence to a particular item of business. If that is not a decision of the chair, then the English language has lost all meaning. I therefore move dissent from your decision, and that is seconded by the Leader of the National Party.",11
11,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I go directly to the question of parliamentary privilege, House of Representatives Practice, where it says: An opinion by the Speaker on a complaint raised under the provisions of standing order 95 is not a ruling and so a dissent motion, as provided for in standing order 100, is not in order.",11
12,Mr HOWARD,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,It is not an opinion.,11
13,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"Yes, it is.",11
14,Mr HOWARD,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,I will speak to the point of order made by the Leader of the House. Mr Speaker. What I am moving dissent from is your decision to grant precedence to a motion in relation to the matter raised by the Prime Minister. That is a decision. It is not an opinion; it is a decision. You cannot argue that a decision to give precedence to something is an opinion. It is a decision of the chair. I move dissent from it. And I require you to put that motion.,11
15,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"I am sorry. On page 7223 of the House of Representatives Practice, for the reasons that I have said-that there is no dissent allowed-I have given the call to the Leader of the House, who has moved a motion. That is the motion before the House at this stage.",12
16,Mr HOWARD,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,I move dissent from that.,12
17,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,You cannot.,12
18,Mr HOWARD,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,I cannot. So you are just making it up as you go along.,12
19,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"No, I am basing it",12
20,Unknown,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,Government members interjecting,12
21,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,Order! Those on my right!,12
22,Mr HOWARD,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,What the government is about to do is to unprecedentedly move a motion against the member for,12
23,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,Resume your seat. The Leader of the House has the call.,12
24,Mr HOWARD,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"Talk about a kangaroo court. This is an outrage, and you know it.",12
25,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,Resume your seat! The Leader of the House has the call. Mr Reith- Mr SPEAKER ,12
26,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"The honourable member for Flinders. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I move that so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended",12
27,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"No, you cannot. The call has gone to the Leader of the House, who has moved a motion. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, you have just given me the call.",12
28,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"No. I assume you are raising a point of order. If you are not, I have said that the Leader of the House has the call. Resume your seat. The Leader of the House has the call on the motion that he has moved. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order is this: you took the motionMr Ronaldson-This is a set up job.",12
29,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"Order! The member for Flinders has the call and the member for Ballarat is not helping his colleague. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, you took a motion from the Leader of the House as part of a tactic by the government to attack the coalition. You then dismissed a point of order and ruled invalid a motion of dissent which was put to you by the Leader of the Opposition. I then rose and you gave me the call. When you give a member the call, the member is entitled, under the standing orders, to move a motion, and I am moving that motion, Mr Speaker",12
30,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"No, resume your seat. Mr Reith-and, if you propose, Mr Speaker, to refuse me the right to move the motion-if that is now your ruling-then we will dissent from that.",12
31,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,"I gave you the call on the basis that I had anticipated you were raising a point of order, given that I had already said the Leader of the House had the call to move a motion. The Leader of the House has the call to do so, and he is proceeding on that basis. NA",12
32,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I move: That the Speaker's ruling be dissented from. I move dissent from the ruling you made in relation to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Flinders; I move dissent from that ruling. Mr Speaker, there is a calculated attempt by the government today, in a quite unprecedented way, to use the forms of this House to pursue a matter in a quite unprecedented fashion. I have to say in relation to your own ruling, Mr Speaker, that the attempt I made earlier",12
33,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",12
34,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"-You do not like it, do you.",13
35,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Not in the least; this is fine. Mr Speaker, the point of order is this: the motion of dissent is that you have ruled that, while I am on my feet speaking to this particular resolution and that that is the matter before the House, nobody at that point of time is entitled to move a suspension of standing orders. The Leader of the Opposition is not speaking to that dissent motion. That is all there is to it.",13
36,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The Leader of the House has the call in respect of the motion.,13
37,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"As you never answer any questions, nor does your Prime Minister, it passes very strange that you should require us to observe the meticulous forms of the House. That is the greatest piece of parliamentary humbug that I have heard from this mob. Not only has the government leader in the Senate introduced a dangerous new doctrine into Australian politics of guilt through marriage and filial association as a result of the government's tawdry handling of this issue, but now what you people are going to do is, for the first time that I can recall in the 21 years that I have been in parliament, use the weight of numbers that you have in this parliament to impose the political judgment of the Australian Labor Party on the veracity or otherwise of statements made by people on this side of the House. It will not represent any serious attempt",13
38,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"This is not an argument about the point of order. Mr Speaker, the point of order is that it has to be a discussion about whether or not your ruling was correct in relation to the particular proposition made by Peter Reith. It is a simple technical point: is it possible for somebody to introduce another item when a member is speaking to a motion with a proper call from you? Can anyone get up and at that point move a suspension of standing orders? The standing orders are clear on that. It is an argument about that and nothing else.",13
39,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,The Leader of the House has made a point. The Leader of the Opposition is dissenting from my ruling in respect of whether or not the member for Flinders can take the point of order.,13
40,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, the point of order raised by the honourable member for Flinders is, as you know and everybody in the parliament knows, related cognately to this matter that you have raised against the member for Chisholm. If you had not tried to dishonestly use the forms of the parliament",13
41,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Order! We have on our hands a very interesting issue. The Leader of the Opposition has the call on the dissent motion. He knows the rules of the place, and he will speak to that particular dissent motion.",13
42,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, I am speaking to the dissent motion. The ruling that you have given is generically associated with a decision taken by the government. The decision that has been taken by the government is to illicitly, wrongly and shamefully use",13
43,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Resume your seat.,13
44,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: there is no generic relationship between what is a dissent motion and a ruling on a point of order. What has to be argued in this is whether or not you, as a Speaker, are able to permit somebody to get up and move suspension of standing orders while somebody else has the call. That is the argument. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, to the point of order: the member for Flinders moved that so much of standing orders be suspended as to allow the debate on the processes to proceed. He had not been allowed to complete and substantiate that before he was cut off. It is perfectly in order, as you have indicated already in your ruling, and the Leader of the Opposition does have a right to move dissent from your ruling with regard to the motion by the member for Flinders. It is equally in order that debate can centre and focus on the intended motion by the member for Flinders.",13
45,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,The Leader of the National Party takes it a step further than is appropriate in this debate. I have given a ruling in respect of the member for Flinders. The Leader of the Opposition chose to move a motion of dissent about that particular matter. That is the matter before the chair for debate now. It does not go to the other generic issues-to use his words. They are matters that mayor may not be discussed later.,13
46,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, on that ruling of yours: the whole purpose of the honourable member for Flinders taking the point of order that he did, and the whole purpose of my moving dissent from your ruling in relation to that point of order, was a concern on this side of the House that the honourable member for Chisholm, in a quite unprecedented way, was being deniedMr Chynoweth-What's this got to do with it?",14
47,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,I am speaking to the point of order. It would be a good idea if you understood the forms of the House.,14
48,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The Leader of the Opposition is speaking to the point of order. So far he is in order.,14
49,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"What basically is happeninvite ing is that we are concerned, because unprecedented action being taken by the government, that procedural fairness is being denied to the member for Chisholm. I would have thought the most solemn obligation on anybody occupying the position that you occupy is to ensure that all members of the House, irrespective of their political allegiance, receive a modicum of procedural fairness. What has happened on this occasion is that there is a political argument between the government and the opposition about a para ticular event. The Prime Minister has made the most unfounded allegations about the character, the honesty and the reputation of people on this side of the House. The Leader of the Government in the Senate is now ber condemning people because they are related he by marriage",14
50,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Mr Downer-You just want to snuff out any dissent.",14
51,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Order! The member for procedural Mayo! Mr Downer-It is a real bitch, free speech. You bastard!",14
52,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Out the door, sport, if that is the best you can do in this chamber and if you want to go swearing across the chamber at us.",14
53,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The House will come to order.,14
54,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"What we are talking about here is the forms and standing orders of the House. There is a dissent motion against your ruling, Mr Speaker. It is a technical motion. There are plenty of opportunities for censures and debates on any of the matters that the Leader of the Opposition wants to raise. There is an opportunity to raise that on the motion that is before the House. This is a very simple proposition: have you ruled correctly in accordance with standing orders? That and nothing else is before the House.",14
55,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,The Leader of the House does go to the substance of the issue and I the Leader of the Opposition to direct of the his comments accordingly.,14
56,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, the effect of your ruling is to seriously limit the capacity of the opposition to respond effectively to the decision that you have taken in relation to granting precedence concerning a matter of privilege. That is the wellspring-the beginning-of this whole debate.",14
57,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,Debate it.,14
58,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"No, it is your ruling, Mr Speaker, that you would give precedence to motion being moved by the government in relation to the statements made by the honourable member for Chisholm. That was the beginning of this whole debate. Your decision in relation to that was what caused the memfor Flinders to take the point of order that did. It is therefore perfectly appropriate for me to direct some remarks, which I am doing, in support of that dissent motion to the reasons why the member for Flinders moved it in the first place. The member for Flinders moved it in the first place because we are concerned on this side of the House that fairness and ordinary parliamentary decency are being denied to the honourable member for Chisholm. While ever parliamentary procedure and decency are denied, we will continue to protest.",14
59,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker. All these points are points that can be made in the debate; they are not points to a dissent motion on a limited area of standing orders. When someone is standing in this chamber speaking, is it possible for somebody else to stand up and at that point, as opposed to the conclusion of the matter before the House, move a suspension?",14
60,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will come to the substance.,15
61,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, if I may speak to that point of order. I would have thought that, given the behaviour of the Keating government over the past few days, anything was possible in this parliament. You on that side of the House will use your numbers, no matter what the morality, no matter what the principle and no matter what the parliamentary institution involved, to trample over the rights of members on this side of the House. That is why we have moved dissent from the Speaker's ruling. I moved dissent from your ruling, Mr Speaker, because I believe your conduct in giving that ruling",15
62,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,Oh!,15
63,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,I am; it is a dissent. I am moving a motion.,15
64,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker.",15
65,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,I thought people could not stand up in the middle of motions. I thought people were not allowed to do that.,15
66,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The Leader of the House has a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.,15
67,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"They certainly can to make points of order. Once again, this is not canvassing the issue before the House. The issue before the House is that you, Mr Speaker, have ruled incorrectlyon a point that a member speaking on his feet cannot be interrupted in the course of remarks by somebody standing up and willy nilly moving a suspension. That is the issue. No other issue is before the House.",15
68,Mr HOWA,OBJECTION TO RULING,"n that point of order, Mr Speaker: what I was drawing attention to was that I am entitled, as I understand it, in a dissent motion to offer critical remarks of way in which the chair has behaved. I understand that it is out of order to offer those critical remarks other than in a dissent motion. I am expressing concern about your conduct of these proceedings this morning. That is why I have moved a dissent motion.",15
69,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"No, you are not.",15
70,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The Leader of the Opposition is entitled to do so.,15
71,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Exactly. So, in other words, you are overruling the point of order.",15
72,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I have overruled that point of order. You are entitled to raise those issues in respect of the matter raised by the honourable member for Flinders, but if that also involves me, by all means.",15
73,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Our concern, as I said, is that the honourable member for Flinders is being deliberately and cynically denied procedural fairness by the actions that have been taken. The government is now going from sleazy tactic to sleazy tactic. It is not good enough to impugn the professional reputation of people because of their association and their relationship through marriage with members of the opposition. What they are now doing is denying the right of members on this side of the House, without fear of persecution, to express a point of view legitimately on a political matter. What the government is proposing to do this morning is absolutely unprecedented.",15
74,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order again is, to get back to this, that this is a fine speech, if he wants to make it, for the matter that is before the House by way of my motion.",15
75,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,You won't let me do that.,15
76,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,That is absolute rubbish. It is not a matter for a dissent to a technical point about the standing orders. We have to have a his bit of standing orders observance in this place. Opposition member interjecting,15
77,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"No, in fact it is not. In fact, the Leader of the House again goes to the substance of the matter before the chair, which is a dissent motion in respect of a the ruling I gave in regard to the honourable member for Flinders. I have also, on a couple of occasions during the contribution by the Leader of the Opposition, suggested he confine his remarks to the technical aspects associated with that. I have also given him an opportunity, if he wishes, to direct some of those comments at me in respect of that particular matter and that alone. I have also said that, if the motion the honourable Leader of the House has moved proceeds, the other matters which he is going to from time to time which are the subject of the points of order from the Leader of the House can be addressed during that debate.",15
78,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I am aware of that, but the concern that we on this side of the House have is that the original decision made by the chair",16
79,Mr KERR,OBJECTION TO RULING,You just don't like a motion.,16
80,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"No, we just do not like the fact that you undemocratically use your numbers. That is what we do not like. We do not like the fact that you are introducing new and lower standards of political morality in Australia. We do not like that fact. We do not like the fact that you traduce the reputations of people because they are related to members of the opposition front bench.",16
81,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Order! Again, I say to the honourable Leader of the Opposition that the technical aspects of this particular motion are the ones that he should address his remarks to. The other issues I am sure he can come to shortly.",16
82,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"The technical aspect of this motion springs from your original decision to grant precedence to a motion by the government in relation to the substance of the matter which was raised as a point of privilege by the Prime Minister. Sir, you know and everybody in this House knows that this is the first time that a government has purported to use its numbers through a resolution of the House to say that one particular version of events in the heat of a political accepted over another. Those opposite are not just expressing a point of view. They are not just seeking to endorse the recollection of the government, its version of events. What they are saying is that the member for Chisholm deliberately misled the House, and they are using their numbers to do it. They know that once you cross that parliamentary Rubicon",16
83,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order",16
84,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,They know that once you cross that parliamentary Rubicon,16
85,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The honourable Leader of the House on a point of order again.,16
86,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,you are forever altering the rules under which the,16
87,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"The Leader of the Opposition, resume your seat. The Leader of the House has the call.",16
88,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"The point of order is that we have yet to hear from the Leader of the Opposition why it is incorrect that, when a person is on his feet before the House, another person is not entitled to stand up at that point and introduce another matter before the House by way of a suspension of standing orders. That anybody has been permitted to do that has never happened before in this House. The reason why it has not happened is that people's rights in this House need to be protected, which is what the Leader of the Opposition is going on with. He has not addressed himself to that matter once.",16
89,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, on that point of order: it is out of a concern for the rights and privileges of members of this House that the opposition is taking the strong stand it is. I repeat in relation to that point of order that, once you cross the parliamentary Rubicon that you are proposing to pass today, you are for all time rewriting the rules under which this parliament will operate. You more than most on your side of the House-I address this comment through the chair to the Leader of the House-know what grave injury you are doing to the parliamentary institution today by fight is to be what you are proposing.",16
90,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",16
91,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,You know that. You ought to be ashamed of what you are doing to the parliamentary institution.,16
92,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition, resume your seat. The Leader of the House on a point of order.",17
93,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"The point of order is that there are plenty of opportunities on the motion to make these points if the Leader of the Opposition wishes to. Again, he is not addressing the standing order.",17
94,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! I have the motion which the honourable Leader of the Opposition has moved before the House. I again remind him that it is a dissent from the ruling I gave that the member for Flinders could not stand up and move a suspension of standing orders to move another motion when there was already a motion before the chair. I again come back to that issue.,17
95,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I do understand that; but I would ask you and all members of the House to understand the context and the circumstances in which the point of order was made by the member for Flinders and the context and the circumstances in which I moved dissent. That context and that circumstance arise from the fact that, for the first time. I can recall in the 21 years I have been in parliament, this government is going to so rewrite the rules and so cross a parliamentary Rubicon that they are going to trample upon the legitimate rights of people on this side of the House to express a point of view. It is one thing to move, for the first time in I think the history of this parliament, three censures on the Leader of the Opposition in seven months. But, basically, what the government is proposing to do with this whole tactic under the colour of privilege has nothing to do with privilege. The Prime Minister raised a matter of privilege. It has nothing to do with privilege. It has everything to do with political point scoring. He does not agree with what the member for Chisholm said. The member for Chisholm does not agree with what the Prime Minister said. Instead of them being men enough to debate it out and leave it to the bar of public opinion, the government is using some kind of phoney parliamentary device to try to fit the member for Chisholm with an illicit charge of dishonesty. That is what they are trying to do. They are adding insult to injury. They are prepared to traduce people's professional reputation because those people are related to people on our front-bench.",17
96,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! Again I invite the honourable Leader of the Opposition to come back to the substance of the matter.,17
97,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Is the government going to attack the professional reputation of a justice of the High Court because he is related to a member of the Keating ministry? Are you going to do that? Is that the next step? Is that the next thing you are going to do? Is that your miserable standard? Is that how far the standards of this government have deteriorated? Are you so desperately cornered and vulnerable politically that you have to resort to these dodgy tactics; you have to insult Ms Vanstone because she is related by marriage to my colleague the shadow Attorney General? What kind of respect for the independent rights of women does that represent? I thought you were a party that opposed discrimination in the workplace. I thought you were a party that believed that people ought to be appointed on merit. I thought you were a party that believed in the rights of women. You hypocrites! You are sending Carmen Lawrence to Beijing the day after you traduce the independent right of Ms Vanstone to fulfil her professional career. Mr Chynoweth- Mr Speaker, for the last two minutes the Leader of the Opposition has not said a word about the subject matter that this debate is about. I think you should bring him back to the subject.",17
98,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Again I remind the honourable Leader of the Opposition to come back to the substance of the matter before the chair.,17
99,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"The substance is that the honourable member for Flinders quite legitimately and understandably has moved dissent from your ruling. He has moved dissent because of the quite disgraceful way in which the government proposes to use its weight of numbers to deny fundamental rights to people sitting on this side of the parliament. Your responsibility in that, Mr Speaker, is that, of all things, you are the custodian of the rights of individual members and, above everything else, the role of the Speaker is to protect those rights. That is why I move dissent from your ruling.",17
100,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Is the motion seconded?,18
101,Mr TIM FISCHER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I second the motion. Yesterday was ugly enough with the gaffe by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, with regard to counsel assisting the Marks royal commission-creating that very ugly precedent which introduces the connection of family relationships to the political debate in a way which hitherto the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has rejected. Today we have a circumstance where the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) comes in, in a premeditated matter, obviously with prior knowledge of the ruling that the Speaker gave on privilege, with a typed up motion prepared, to move a censure against the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). I tell the House this: every Liberal and every National Party member of this House will vote in support of the integrity of the member for Chisholm when we get a chance to in a few minutes time. But the motion before the chair at this time is the motion of dissent. I want to quote from the House of Representatives Practice in very clear-cut terms. It states: Having received the call from the Chair, a motion to suspend standing orders may be moved by any Member without notice, but to be passed it must be carried by an absolute majority of all Members (75 votes in a House of 148 Members). In other words, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) was perfectly in order to stand at that point in the proceedings this morning and move his motion of dissent. You only have to tum to page 296 of the House of Representatives Practice to see in very clear-cut terms that, a member having received the call from the chair, a motion to suspend standing orders can be moved by any member of the parliament at any time. It is in that context that he quite properly acted to move the suspension. The dissent from the ruling of the Speaker then flowed from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). I might add, that dissent comes understanding order 100, which provides: If any objection is taken to any ruling of the Speaker, such objection must be taken at once, and a motion of dissent, to be submitted in writing, moved, which, if seconded, shall be proposed to the House, and debate thereon shall proceed forthwith. According to page 226 of the House of Representatives Practice, the action that the member for Flinders sought to take and the subsequent action taken by the Leader of the Opposition was absolutely in order. Why are we in here? Why are we angry about this premeditated attack on the integrity of the member for Chisholm ? We are angry about the action of the Prime Minister on this matter and we are angry about what the Leader of the Government in the Senate had to say in that other place in a scurrilous attack on family relationships, reflecting on the integrity of the counsel assisting the Marks royal commission. Mr MCGauran-At the direction of Keating.",18
102,Mr TIM FISCHER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"At the direction, no less, of the Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to page 722 of the House of Representatives Practice. It is also very pertinent to the matters that have been before this House since the Lord's Prayer was uttered at 9.30 this morning, before commencement of hostilities. At the bottom of that page, in respect of privilege, it says: For instance, it may be considered inappropriate or inconsistent with the dignity of the House either to give further consideration to a matter or to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges for inquiry. This is pertinent because the original motion moved by the Leader of the House ducked the privilege issue. You decided that it was inappropriate to take it to the Privileges Committee. You decided to go for a short cut. You obviously had prior knowledge of what the Speaker was going to rule. In anticipation of the Speaker's ruling with regard to privilege, and the particular terminology of the Speaker's ruling, you came in here with a typed motion, ready to go, with regard to the member for Chisholm. It is impossible to consider that so quick on his feet is the Leader of the House not only was he able to listen to every word of the Speaker but also he had his little laptop underneath the table, in the drawer there, and was able to type up this motion. The moment the Speaker completed his ruling we had a typed motion moved by the Leader of the House. It is time that a stand was made for parliamentary decency in this country. It is time that a standard was established with regard to parliamentary decency, parliamentary fairness and the general processes of politics that spin off from the deliberations of the parliament. It is in that context that just after 2.00 p.m yesterday politics in Australia took a very ugly tum for the worse with a scurrilous and shameful attack by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Furthermore, this government, at timeswhen it suits the Prime Minister and otherslikes to try to defend family values. Yet what was the exact wording Minister Evans used yesterday in the Senate? He said that it was a questi'Jn of families preying together-he spelt it out for Hansard in very direct terms, p-r-e-y-i-n-g-with regard to the connection of Senator Amanda Vanstone and her sisterin-law, Ann Vanstone, counsel assisting the Marks royal commission. I might add, in respect of that, that it is unusual for the South Australian bar to supply personnel for legal deliberations in Western Australia. That has happened for a long while. It is not exceptional. It is a connection which has been used in the past. What we now know is that yesterday in the Senate we had a premeditated attack of a disgraceful kind by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, with regard to the Vanstone connection, which he should withdraw and apologise for when the Senate formally sits this day. We have now had an utterly disgraceful premeditated attack by the Leader of the House on the member for Chisholm.",18
103,Unknown,OBJECTION TO RULING,Honourable members interjecting,19
104,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The Leader of the National Party has the call and is not being assisted by members on either side.,19
105,Mr TIM FISCHER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Some members on both sides of the House, and even some people in the public gallery, might have a legitimate concern about the drift of the state of affairs of the proceedings of this parliament. My colleagues and I say, 'It has now gone too far. Enough is enough.' It is time we stood up for the standing orders of this parliament; it is time we stood up for the conventions of this parliament; and it is time we stood up for the principles of fair play. Legitimate debate in accord with the proceedings of the parliament is a fair cop. If you can't stand the heat, you get out of the kitchen. I concede that the Leader of the House is no slouch in getting wound up from time to time, but on this occasion he has got it wrong. He has got it massively wrong with regard to the short-cut procedure that he sought to inject immediately arising from the ruling of the Speaker. I challenge the Leader of the House to stand up and say that he did not know the thrust of the ruling of the Speaker when he gave it, that he did not know the Speaker was goir g to give that ruling. Of course he knew. He not only knew, but also he went to the tactics meeting on the government side, or its equivalent-the kitchen cabinet that runs the highway robbery not tactics of the government in both houses of this parliament. They said, 'What can we do here this morning? What can we do to get the heat off Minister Evans? What can we do to create a distraction and allow Carmen Lawrence to slip out of the country to Beijing to, above all else, talk about human rights and freedom of speech?' There is a certain bitter irony that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is already on a jumbo, winging it to that great citadel of free speech-Beijing-to attend a United Nations conference. Here we are getting clobbered on the question of legitimate debate and freedom of speech about a misuse of the proceedings and the standing orders and the conventions of this parliament. Mr MCGauran-And a demeaning of the parliament.",19
106,Mr TIM FISCHER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"And it is a massive demeaning of the parliament which cuts across the exactitude of House of RepresentaChisholm. tives Practice. It is that point which goes to the very nub of the motion of the member for Flinders. I think the member for Flinders, quite appropriately, sought to move the that suspension of standing orders, because we were very angry about the short-cut proceedthe ings of the Leader of the House. It is much in accord with the convention that came forward. suspension can be moved and, when moved, must be dealt with forthwith. I would add another thing: this parliament has taken for the worse with the antics and tactics of government in the Senate yesterday and in the House of Representatives today.",20
107,Mr KERR,OBJECTION TO RULING,For how long are we supposed to sit aside?,20
108,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,The Minister for Justice will cease interjecting.,20
109,Mr TIM FISCHER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I thank the Minister for Justice. It is good that he is in the chamdeliberations, ber at this moment interjecting, because he should hang his head in shame with regard this whole matter. He should acknowledge that the coalition at no stage reflected on appointment of Justice MCHugh to the High Court of Australia. At no stage have we brought any element of debate into these proceedings with regard to the fact Minister for Consumer Affairs, Jeanette MCHugh, a frontbencher in this House, is the wife of Justice MCHugh of the High Court. I have a great deal of respect for Justice MCHugh of the High Court. I have a great deal of respect for the High Court. I do not agree with everything the High Court might determine. We live in a democracy. I respect the separation of powers-the parliament, the executive and the High Court-but we on this side of the House have been ultra careful with today. regard to that particular appointment. We have established a benchmark of dignity and a proper approach with regard to the MCHugh-MCHugh linkage. Today and yesterparliament, day the government decided to tear up that doctrine to go down a very shabby path in an absolutely premeditated way. They now seek to distract the parliament and distract the nation by trumping up a charge against my good friend and colleague the member for I say: the member for Chisholm can walk tall and proud with regard to his integrity, his contribution, his effort. Yes, it is appropriate there will be debate on these matters, but the fact that the minister did not take this to Privileges Committee is an indication they very were on a second best approach when they This dissent motion is deserving of the unanimous support of the parliament. I have a tum good news for you, Mr Speaker. House of the Representatives Practice also says that the carriage of dissent does not necessarily mean a censure and automatic resignation for the Speaker, so you could stay on. In fact, if you had the deciding vote, you could vote for the dissent and still stay on. I welcome that there is a little room for you to breathe there, Mr Speaker. What we want to see is some fair dinkum some fairness and some justice with regard to the proceedings of this parliato ment. The government will always use their numbers on the floor of the House of Reprethe sentatives. We are conscious of that. We have witnessed that on so many occasions-three censure motions against the Leader of the Opposition, none of them justified but all that the rammed through on the numbers. I simply say to the House, to the Senate and to the nation that parliamentary democracy deserves better than the very ugly and very shabby tactics perpetrated by the Leader of the House-a person who should know a whole lot better, steeped as he is in parliamentary proceedings and as a result of his activities and of the portfolio positions he has held. I strongly support the dissent motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition here",20
110,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"The opposition's position is this: nobody is allowed to mislead nobody is allowed to mislead the House, unless you happen to be a member of the opposition, and then it can be routine. As far as they are concerned, you can get out there, say anything you like, be called to book for it in this place, then get up and mislead on a personal explanation. That is fine as far as the opposition is concerned. Only the government has a standard applied to it. That is precisely what has happened in this case. The argument put in favour of this dissent motion-an argument presented by the fellow on the other side of the House-if I can follow their arguments through all of this, is that this is a legitimate tactic on his part to stop something unprecedented. It is not unprecedented, of course. On the last occasion somebody went outside the chamber and made a statement about a set of propositions-it was actually in relation to one of your predecessors-that person came back into this House and effectively got up and gave a personal explanation which said, 'I never said it. I didn't say anything like that. As far as I am concerned, I made no reflections on the chair whatsoever.' He got up and made a totally misleading statement. Since the changes to the act in 1987, no longer can those matters be referred to the Privileges Committee. The Privileges Committee, which used to be able to handle that sort of deceit in this place, can no longer handle it. The only way in which those issues can be handled is by a motion in the House and an argument about it. In that particular instance, it was the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) who was, on that particular occasion, subject to virtually the same motion I moved, because he misled the House about remarks that he made outside this House, in precisely the same way the member for Chisholm has done here. And don't you hate to hear it! Mr Reith-On a point of order: we have an irrelevant precedent being put to us by the Leader of the House, as if it was somehow relevant to the motion which he is now addressing. He lectured you, Mr Speaker, all through the address of the Leader of the Opposition on the question of relevance. We expect you to require of him the same standards which were put upon the Leader of the Opposition.",20
111,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I make the same point to the Leader of the House as I repeatedly made to the Leader of the Opposition; that is, there is a matter of a technical nature before the chair.",21
112,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"We have just heard 15 minutes from the other side of the House, canvassing everything you could conceivably wish to handle-IS minutes from the Leader of the National Party, without interruption, canvassing the whole field on all of this. It is those points that were allowed to be made in this chamber in this debate which I seek to answer. Perhaps he should not have made such a silly speech. The question here is-the opposition has this view and I would have thought it was an exceptionally stupid attitude for the opposition to take-whether it is legitimate, if somebody happens to be on their scrapers in this place speaking, for somebody to stand up, call a point of order and then move a suspension of standing orders motion. Who do you think has a majority in this place? It is this side of the House. If we set up that standard of behaviour which you invite us to, who are the people most likely to miss out as a result of itpeople on the side of the House with the numbers, or people on the sire of the House without the numbers? So you want to introduce into standing orders the notion that it is okay, when anybody is on their feet in this place making any point, for somebody to stand up, get the eye of the chair, say 'Point of order,' and then move a suspension motion? Is this an acceptable parliamentary practice, acceptable standing orders? The opposition leader and then the Leader of the National Party made much of what went behind the proposition that caused the Manager of Opposition Business to get up and move that motion. What was the motivation behind it? It was very simple, since they challenge that motivation. The motivation behind it was simply to establish in this place proper treatment of the processes of personal explanation. A personal explanation is not an occasion to get up and mislead the House about what it is you have said. The honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) is making an art form of that-both yesterday and on the previous occasion. It is entirely legitimate, without a suspension of standing orders motion to be moved against it, for somebody to stand up in this House and declare when there has been that level of misleading, when he gets up and says, 'Oh, no. I didn't say anything about Carmen Lawrence, connecting her with the suicide of Penny Easton at all. No, no. I didn't say anything about that.' Then Mr Keating quotes directly from him. If she had exercised proper judgment, Penny Easton might still be alive today. That was an extraordinary statement, but to then get up and deny that he was making any connection between Carmen Lawrence and the death of Penny Easton! How can you possibly interpret those words? You went and got one little, selective element of the quote when there was a whole panoply of material after that in which he was linking her in by every possible means. The meaning of that sentence I just read out is, without question, a linkage between the two. The member for Chisholm gets up in this chamber and makes a statement that, as far as he is concerned, he never made any linkage between them. He took out a quote which was then qualified to the nth degree as justifying his position. The point of a personal explanation is not a debate. The point of a personal explanation is to express the truth of a matter to the House, to correct the misleading statements about you. It is not an opportunity to get up in this place and make yet another misleading statement. The member for Chisholm did it again yesterday when he got up and said that, somehow or other, when I had been suggesting to him that he had been in conference with the Liberal Party to set up this wretched political royal commission in Western Australia, I had been mistaken on that-that he was not consulting; he was 'liaising'. That was another abuse by the member for Chisholm of the standing orders. Mr MCGauran-On a point of order",21
113,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"They love it, don't they? They get up and abuse usMr MCGauran-On the point of order: the Leader of the House is progressing into areas that are far beyond the matter that has been raised in the dissent from your ruling. Some tolerance has been allowed by you in regard to other speakers-we accept that-but the Leader of the House is introducing material that no speaker has canva'>sed and is blatantly defying your ruling. We want to know if this is not another collusion between you and the Leader of the House. You will bring him to order.",22
114,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"The honourable member for Gippsland might just be careful on inferences that he would like to make there. There are other forms of the House he could use if he wants to put that forward. However, the Leader of the House, in fact, was given the opportunity to respond to some matters which were introduced into this by the Leader of the National Party. Again, I point out that there is a technical issue before the chair.",22
115,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Perhaps it was not collusion. We have a new word for collusion these days; it is called liaison. That is what we have these days: we do not have collusion, we have liaison. We get up and make personal explanations. If it is alleged that we colluded, we get up and say, 'No. We did not collude, we liaised.' That is the new standard as far as these people are concerned. Mr Downer-On a point of order: Mr Speaker, it deeply concerns me that the Leader of the House is totally ignoring your last ruling and your previous rulings, which were oddly enough in response to points of order made by the Leader of the House. I think it would be appropriate if he upheld not only his own points of order but your rulings on those points of order and stuck to what he likes to describe as the 'technical motion'.",22
116,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"As I indicated, the opportunity is provided to canvass the issue that was raised by the Leader of the Opposition. In the course of canvassing that issue, both speakers have dealt with some other issues. I again remind all speakers in this debate of the technical nature of the matter.",22
117,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Let me get back to the standing orders issue directly, as opposed to the set of circumstances which caused that issue to be raised. The Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party suggested that somehow or other their actions were a legitimate tactic on their part which would enable them to interrupt the debate before the House and express their views in defence of the indefensible actions of the honourable member for Chisholm. Unless they had the standing orders suspended in the way in which they dictated, somehow or other the opportunity for that would be missed. That was part of the legitimisation of their standing up in this place to move that motion. On what conceivable basis could that be so? Is there some suggestion that the government intended to gag the honourable member for Chisholm? Is there some section in the motion which is very similar to the sorts of motions that were moved in relation to the honourable member for New England? He misled this chamber about statements he had made outside this place. Were those motions similar to the motion relating to the actions of the honourable member for Chisholm when he came into this place and misled the House on the proposition? They are getting up here worried about whether or not Senator Vanstone's sister-in-IawMr MCGauran-Has been attacked and vilified.",22
118,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Whether she as a lawyer for the royal commission in some way was attacked and vilified? It does not matter if you get up here and accuse a minister of forcing a woman to suicide! No, that does not matter! That is of a minor nature when compared with this. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the minister just made a claim during his remarks that the member for Chisholm had misled the House. The motion that he is speaking to goes to a technical matter. Mr Speaker, I appreciate that your view is that speakers can range across a few boundaries, but he is certainly not entitled to make accusations and draw inferences and imputations about other members under the guise of a technical motion. On that basis, he should be made to withdraw.",23
119,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"On the basis that the minister is responding to some comments that were made in the course of this debate, I will allow the comment by the minister.",23
120,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,And those comments were made without interruption. Mr Reith-It's a shocking abuse.,23
121,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"It is a shocking abuse, according to the Manager of Opposition Business-a shocking abuse to have a debate in this chamber about a misleading statement! That is the shocking abuse. According to the member for Flinders, you can come into this House mislead and lie, but it does not matter-that is not a problem. But if anybody gets up and moves a motion on it, they are in trouble.",23
122,Mr SINCLAIR,OBJECTION TO RULING,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker, the honourable gentleman keeps referring to members of this House misleading and deceiving. You cannot use those words in this House unless it is under a substantive motion. This is not a substantive motion. It is a motion of dissent from the Speaker's ruling. The Leader of the House is going way beyond the text of his brief at the moment, and I suggest that he be asked to withdraw those remarks.",23
123,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,The right honourable member for New England makes a valid point. It really is going a bit beyond the particular motion before the chair. I ask the Leader of the House to confine his remarks to the motion.,23
124,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Certainly I will get back to the point, Mr Speaker, because I think it is an important point for us all to consider. This is a way that you can gag a member from speaking effectively in this chamber. The way that you gag a member is to deceive the Speaker by pretending that you are getting up before the Speaker and raising a point of order. It is a good tactic-when you get on your scrapers, you can eliminate the speech that is being made by effectively suspending standing orders and debating that. The only problem for you when you do that is that you open up the parliament to the majority numbers in all aspects of the standing orders. Basically, the standing orders are in place, at the end of the day, to protect the individual member. The capacity of the individual member to get on his or her scrapers in this place and say what they think without interruption to the end of it is a very important point indeed. What does the opposition do with that? Losing the plot on this, they stand up and attempt to interrupt the speech by moving for the suspension of standing orders. They attempt to interrupt the presentation of a case for the House to consider as to whether it has been massively misled by this individual. They decide, 'We will stifle that debate as best we can.' And well may they do that, because what that honourable member has revealed is a pattern of collusion, liaison or whatever it is that you might like to say, about the most outrageous political royal commission ever put in place. Millions of dollars of taxpayers' money has been spent on getting Carmen. I refer people to Laurie Oakes's article on that this morning. He said: Howard and his minions are out there every day accusing Labor of arrogantly misusing power, but the hypocrisy is glaringly obvious. I repeat- 'the hypoocrisy is glaringly obvious'. I move: That the question be now put. A division having been called and the bells being rung Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, the honourable member for Gilmore just used words, referring to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, which I find totally offensive and I ask him to withdraw them.",23
125,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I did not hear the comments but if the member for Gilmore has done that, he should withdraw. Mr Knott-I withdraw, Mr Speaker. Question put. The House divided.

127,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM,Is leave granted? Mr Reith-Leave is granted on the basis NA that we think this is such an abusive process that the issues ought to be properly put and debated. We are more than happy to take this minister on all day if necessary. Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would permit the Deputy Prime Minister to speak for 10 minutes.,25
128,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"I thank the House. Mr Downer-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker, just before the Leader of the House begins. I wanted to ask you whether it is consistent with the standing orders of this House-and, indeed, is proper-for the Leader of the House to have been given quite considerable advance notice of your ruling before you came in here. In fact, he was given such advance notice that this motion was presumably typed out-obviously not under the desk-in the minister's office. The minister has had time to prepare copious notes and quotes. Mr Speaker, it does indicate that you gave him advice quite some time before 9.30 this morning as to what your decision would be, whereas on this side of the House no such notification was given. I would like to ask not only whether that is consistent with standing orders, but also whether it falls within the role of propriety, which is part of your function as the Speaker and the guardian of this House.",26
129,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"The standing orders in this place, which do go to my responsibility, are being upheld.",26
130,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"Mr SPEAKER Mr Downer-Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker.",26
131,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Now on a point of order, rather than a series of questions. Mr Downer-Did you inform",26
132,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,I haven't spoken to the Speaker about it. Mr Downer-Who did-Keating's office?,26
133,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"The point about thisMr Downer- Mr Speaker, I do not think you have fully responded to my point of order. I am also seeking clarification on the grounds of propriety and the role of the Speaker. I want to know-and I know the House wants to know-whether you informed the government, be it the Leader of the House or one of his staff or by some means, and made it known to the Leader of the House",26
134,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! It is not a point of order. Mr Downer-It is a point of order.,26
135,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"No, it is not. There are other forms of the House that the honourable member can go to if he wants to pursue issues like that. Mr Downer-You seem to be unwilling to answer the point.",26
136,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"I have given an answer. My responsibility is to uphold the standing orders, and I will. You will resume your seat. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.",26
137,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a matter of privilege. I ask that the question that has been acknowledged by you be referred to the Privileges Committee. Any prior notice that has been given of the findings by you on the question of privilege raised by the Prime Minister should be considered by the Privileges Committee because I consider it a very serious threat to the propriety of your office and the conduct of affairs in this place.",26
138,Mr HOLDING,NOES,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I understand that any member of this House is entitled to seek your advice in respect of any aspect of the standing orders at any time. You are entitled to give that member the benefit of your advice. In so doing, that cannot constitute a breach of privilege. It is a matter for the honourable member how he then responds in terms of what action he takes in this House. This is a spurious point of order by an experienced member and he should know better.",26
139,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"It is not a point of order. The right honourable member for New England is requesting-no, he is actually moving",26
140,Mr SINCLAIR,NOES,I am asking that it be referred to the Privileges Committee to consider whether or not there has been a breach of privilege as a result of the prior disclosure of your findings on the reference requested by the Prime Minister the other day.,26
141,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"My understanding is that an issue such as this that is raised by any member in this place, quite legitimately, is referred to the Speaker to ascertain whether there is a prima facie case or an issue can be raised. I understand, therefore, that what you are suggesting to me is that I ask myself whether I should refer this matter to the Privileges Committee. I will give the same answer that I normally give when questions like that are brought before me: I will report back to the House.",26
142,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"I have already gone to these issues. There is a very specific requirement and absolute obligation upon members of parliament, when they stand before this House to correct the fact that somebody has produced some misleading statement and has misrepresented them personally, to come into this place and to speak the truth-the whole of it. If they merely want to engage in debate, there are appropriate forms of the House to engage in debate. If they want to get up and take issue with a point made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), or any other minister or any other member of the House, they are entitled to get up and make those points. That is the point of personal explanations: in ensuring that absolute clarity is established, they get up, they make their point and that is it. What members are not entitled to do in that explanation is mislead the House. The last person to do that in the way in which the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) did was the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), and the House dealt with him in exactly the same way that the honourable member for Chisholm is being dealt with here. When the right honourable member stood up on that occasion and said something totally contrary to what he had obviously said previously, which had caused the Speaker's ire, he was appropriately dealt with by the House for having misled it. That has happened again in this case. What the member said was this-and I have made most of these points, fortunately, in the previous debate: This morning at a doorstep interview my specific comments were: 'I don't think you could say that Carmen Lawrence killed Penny Easton.' It is completely the opposite of what the Prime Minister said. For the record, I do not say, and have not said, that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death. In fact, that is exactly what the honourable member did say. The Prime Minister quoted with absolute accuracy the remarks that the honourable member made. These are the comments that the Prime Minister citedperfectly accurate comments from exactly the same interview: Well, anyone that knows anything about suicide would know it requires a trigger, and it would appear that the tabling of the petition was the trigger that caused Penny Easton to suicide. Understandably, the commentator went on to say that Dr Wooldridge went further, blaming Dr Lawrence directly by saying: If she had exercised proper judgment, Penny Easton might still be alive today. You cannot get any clearer than that: 'If she had exercised proper judgment, Penny Easton would still be alive today', which was immediately preceded by a pseudo-medical judgment about the triggers which cause suicide. These are the quotes of the honourable member. If he wants to get up in a point of debate and say that he also said at some other point in his remarks that he did not think she killed her even though it is contradicted by that, that is an appropriate thing to do in a debate. But, if you are going to get up here and make the point and use the forms of the House to establish the absolute truth of the matter in regard to your personal behaviour, what you do is you get up and you present the whole truth. The honourable member was in a position to do that, and he did not do it. He misled the House with the position that he took. Unfortunately, it is becoming a pattern of behaviour as far as the honourable member is concerned because he did it again yesterday. He said: The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was suggesting just then that I had said that we were constantly having discussions. It is completely untrue. I said we were liaising-it is totally different. It was 2Y2 weeks before the royal commission. You cannot accept the truth because it does not fit in with what you want to believe. That is a personal explanation again. What does that bounce off but a series of interviews that he gave in which he said things like: 'We've been liaising with Richard Court', 'We've been looking for the best way to do it', 'We've agreed that up till now it would be better if it was a federal independent inquiry.' So you now have to go back to Richard Court and say, 'Our options are closing fast. :t's now up to you.' That was a very revealing interview with the honourable member in April. It actually establishes a pattern of quite deep collusion between the federal opposition and Richard Court on spending these millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. Again he misled the House when he got up and made a personal explanation. Not only was it an inadvertent accident, it is now becoming routine for the honourable member for Chisholm to stand up on personal explanations and make misleading statements about his own conduct. It is precisely for these r'!asons therefore that we have moved this motion-obviously in anticipation that at some point in time the Speaker was going to say something about it in this chamber and that would open up the fact that the chamber has an opportunity to respond to its misleading as it sees fit at the time. We happen to regard this as the most appropriate means of responding to it. For those reasons we move this motion on the honourable member for Chisholm. Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, standing order 95 reads: Any Member may rise at any time to speak upon a matter of privilege suddenly arising, and he or she shall be prepared to move, without notice, a motion declaring that a contempt or breach of privilege has been committed, or referring the matter to the Committee of Privileges ... It is quite clear under that standing order that the member who raises the question of privilege, who in this case was the Prime Minister, should in tum move any ensuing motion. In this particular case, whilst the Prime Minister raised the question of privilege with the Speaker, it is the Leader of the House who is moving the motion. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the moving of the motion by the Leader of the House is therefore out of order.",27
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I think the two matters are separate. I have just had a look at the Hansard extract of the way the matter was raised in the first place. The Prime Minister asked that the matter be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges. Mr Speaker responded by saying that he would in the usual way take the matter on board. That matter has been disposed of in that way. The motion now before the House is unrelated and is not in the form of words used in the motion. So the matters are separable. Mr Downer-Further to that point of order, if you look at the words of standing order 95, you will see that it reads: Any Member may rise at any time to speak upon a matter of privilege suddenly arisingthat was what the Prime Minister purported to doand he or she shall be prepared to move, without notice, a motion ... In this particular case, the Prime Minister spoke on a matter of privilege suddenly arising. It follows that it is he who should move any subsequent motion. That is quite clear. However, the subsequent motion is not being moved by the Prime Minister, who is presumably AWOL somewhere.",28
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Because it is not a matter of privilege that we are now discussing, there is no point of order.",28
145,Mr REITH,NOES,"I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""that the House condemns the Government for its abuse of due Parliamentary process"". The coalition unreservedly rejects the government motion. This is a tactic by the government to muddy the waters on the Carmen Lawrence affair. It is a gross abuse of parliamentary processes and should be rejected for that reason and for that reason alone. The forms of the House are well known on these matters. As the matter was raised as a matter of privilege by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a few days ago, it is sensible to refer to convention and practice in this place in dealing with such issues. As you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the normal arrangement is that the Speaker, upon receiving a matter of privilege, or a matter of privilege being put to the Speaker, would normally reserve his opinion on it, take further advice as to whether or not the matter might meet the criteria for a breach of privilege and then report back to the House. That is the procedure that has been followed because the House considers any allegation of a breach of privilege to be a very serious matter. It is serious because it goes to the proper functioning of the House. For those who are not used to the terminology, the word 'privilege' in this case refers to the rights and entitlements of members to carry on their work as members of parliament. It is very important, as a matter of our democratic process, that when a person is elected a member of parliament, they are able to represent the voters in what they do as a local member both inside and outside the parliament. If somebody tries to stop a person carrying out their functions as a member of parliament, the parliament in the past has been very jealous of the rights of members because of that basic democratic principle. When matters have been raised in the past, the Speaker has taken proper advice and then reported back to the chamber as to whether a prima facie case has been made out. In other words, the Speaker has come back to the House and said, 'I think there is something in this but it should be referred to a committee outside the heat of the chamber, outside the normal heat of party politics, so that members can sit down behind closed doors and assess whether this particular matter would represent a breach of privilege.' The parliament has very careful forms to ensure that we do not treat privilege in a trivial, party political way. I know politicians are often accused of playing to the galleries and enjoying having the cameras on us. But when it comes to this very important matter of privilege there are particular processes established for the very good reason that we consider it so important we have a special process to deal with it-the House of Representatives Committee of Privileges-and that is the proper way for these things to be treated. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has made much of an alleged precedent in respect of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I must say it is not much of a precedent because those opposite were in power when the so-called precedent was established. To me, it is not so much a precedent that goes to the substance of the matter but is only one of many precedents where they have abused their power in the past. That, quite frankly, is about all you can say about it. The only substantive thing you could say to dismiss this so-called precedent is that it was a matter that went to reflections on the chair. That is very different from allegations about who said what and whether they were gilding the lily in the normal to and fro between the government and the opposition in the House. The normal process is that the Speaker would come back to the House after having looked at the matter and would basically say, 'I think there is something in it. There is a prima facie case. Therefore the matter should go off to the committee.' The statement we had from the Speaker today as to whether the particular issue before him, raised by the Prime Minister, was one which qualified as establishing a prima facie case was an interesting one. The Speaker said: The statement made by the honourable member may be untrue, howeverand this is the particularly relevant piecethere are clearly differences of opinion in respect of the remarks of the honourable member, and particularly in respect of the conclusions to be drawn from his remarks. I can understand and appreciate the different conclusions that have been reached. That is what the Speaker said. He did not come in here and say, 'This is pretty obviously a case where someone has misled the House.' He said that this was a sort of garden variety case where there are differences of opinion as to what was said, who said it, when, and what the implications of those remarks are. In other words, the Speaker did not say that a prima facie case had been clearly established. In fact, he said to the contrary. For that very simple reason, that this allegation did not even pass the first test, it should obviously be refuted. That is why the motion, which really hangs on it, should be rejected and why our amendment should be put. That is the first point. On the Speaker's own words, the prima facie case has not been established. The second point is that, if the case had been established, the normal course of events is not to have the matter debated in here but to send it off to a committee. That is a very sensible course of action, because it takes the matter out of the political process to some extent so that it can be properly reviewed. The reason this matter has not been sent off to a committee is that it would not stand up if it were put under the microscope in the Committee of Privileges. The truth is that, for all the party political differences there are, the Committee of Privileges, when it gets behind closed doors and is charged with looking after the rights and entitlemems of members, generally has a record of properly reviewing and assessing the precedent and weighing up the merits of the case. The government is not sending this matter off to the committee because the merits of this case are absolutely zilch. There are no merits to this case, as the Speaker's statement to the House has made very clear. This is not a case based on the merits; this is a case based on a political play by the government in respect of the Carmen Lawrence affair. That is particularly obvious because it started a couple of days ago when the Prime Minister, at the start of question time, got up and attacked the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). I suppose I must have had a premonition about this because I got up yesterday and asked if the Speaker, in considering the Prime Minister's original claim in the House, would also consider whether or not it was a spurious claim for privileges-not that there have been spurious claims for precedence, but the Speaker himself has been attacking people on our side for raising so called spurious points of order. Yet here was, on the face of it, as clear as you like, a spurious claim of privilege. The matter is baseless. It does not follow the proper form. The reason it does not follow the proper form is that obviously it is a tactical ploy. The tactical ploy is one of the many defences we have had from the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). The truth is that she did not tell the truth to the Western Australian parliament two or three years back on the Penny Easton affair, and it is now patently obvious that that is the case. The government has a policy-a tactic, if you like-basically to tough it out, to maintain the minister in her position regardless of the fact that the evidence is totally against her. They virtually had a shadow cabinet meeting of the Labor Party in Western Australia when they decided that they would stand up and give evidence about what happened so as to contradict what the minister had to say. It must be the clearest case of a minister misleading the parliament that we have had in many years in Australian politics, and absolutely every last person knows it. The number of ministers lined up against her are about eight to nil. The fact is that she did not tell the truth when she was speaking to the Western Australian parliament. The government is running all these defences. They decided the day before that they would run this absolutely baseless attack on the member for Chisholm. He is going to speak after me. He will go through, word by word, exactly what he said, what was said in the parliament, what the Prime Minister said and what he said in the personal explanation. He will prove absolutely beyond doubt that this is a frivolous and baseless claim. The other tactic that they ran yesterdayalso a muddying the waters tactic-was to attack the senior barrister who is assisting the royal commission in Western Australia. This was a really over-the-top attack. I have ha- a bit to do with the government when it comes to the rights of Australian women and the sort of debate that we have about it. This government is full of talk about the rights of Australian women. They made a conference decision 12 months ago, for example, to provide a quota for women to enter into parliament. It has been very interesting to watch how they themselves have repudiated their own quota system in the last 12 months, as many women of merit have been rejected in the factional power plays of the men of the Labor Party. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order",28
146,Mr REITH,NOES,"Sore point, hey?",31
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Mr Rocher)The member for Flinders will resume his seat. Mr Leo MCLeay--As interesting as it is, it is a bit hard to draw a long bow that the Labor Party's quota for women in parliament has anything to do with the appointment of Mrs Vanstone as the counsel assisting the royal commission in Perth.",31
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I'll hear the honourable member for Flinders.,31
149,Mr REITH,NOES,"The point I make is that this is one of the tactics. Today's tactic is just another over-the-top attack by the government so as to protect the Minister for Human Services and Health. She is a great proponent of the rights of women. Yet yesterday, as a tactic to defend herself, she attacked the right of a successful leading woman barrister to appear and carry out her profession in this particular case as the senior counsel assisting the royal commission in Western Australia. I have had some personal experience because a constituent in my electorate raised matters of discrimination in the Australian defence forces, and these people have run a campaign against her to make sure she was never paid. I can tell you it makes me sick the way these people use an issue, like women's rights, in this case to protect this woman for the very obvious fact that she was not telling the truth. Here we have, as part of the defence, an attack on the Western Australian royal commission-the government calls it a kangaroo court. What incredible hypocrisy for these people to then come into this chamber today and move the motion against the member for Chisholm and abuse the processes of this House, the hallowed, most important processes of this House-the processes of parliamentary privilege. Throughout this whole process we have had nothing but obfuscation, an attempt to fudge, an attempt to deny, an attempt to stand aside from the very obvious consequence for a minister who does not tell the truth-that is, they ought to stand aside and/or resign. Let me refer back to 1981 as it shows you the hypocrisy of these people. This was a speech by the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the time of the Fraser government. In the debate, he said-it is an interesting aside: Theythat is, Mr Sinclair and Mr Nixonsent Minister Connor, the former honourable member for Cunningham, to his death. By any standards, the measure of the decline in his health under the brutality of those attacks is clear Interesting reflection, I thought. He went on to say: The present Prime Minister when in the Opposition insisted upon resignations when he thought that standards had been breached. Yet now his Ministers sit it out, trying to deny the undeniable. That is basically what this tactic is about. It is absolutely, without foundation, one of the most baseless, vile, low parliamentary tactics I have seen from the Labor Party in the 10 years I have been here. The government ought to be absolutely censured for this. It is completely over the top, a complete abuse of parliamentary tactics. We completely deny it-in fact, we are angry. I am disappointed with the Speaker for even bringing down such a statement. I hope they are condemned from one end of the country to the other for this absolutely disgraceful, appalling performance for which they ought to be absolutely ashamed of themselves.",31
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Is the amendment seconded? Mr MCGauran-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,31
151,Mr LEO MCLEAY,NOES,"We heard a lot of unctuous posturing from the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) a few minutes ago. Before that, we heard drivel and methods of darkening the waters from the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). They are all out there saying, 'Shock, horror! Isn't this terrible that the House wants to have some say on what the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) has said both in here and outside.' Let me say from the outset: it is very clear from the remarks the member for Chisholm made outside this House and inside this House that he has misled the House. It is clear and unequivocal. The member for Flinders knows that. The member for Chisholm knows that. Everybody knows that. That is part of the opposition's tactic in this issue-a tactic they have been pursuing for many years, a tactic perfected by the people in the National Party, led by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who was censured by this House for just this same thing some years ago. The member for Flinders says, 'Well, of course it does not matter. All the member for New England was censured for was casting a slur on the chair and that is something that does not matter. That happens all the time.' He said that in his speech. These people say that standards are important but that that is all right because that happens all the time. He would say that, because, in his view, the opposition attacked the chair all the time and that is all right, it is quite in order for the member for Chisholm to say one thing outside this House and then try to slip-slide out of it in a personal explanation which repudiates that and which misleads the House. The member for Flinders thinks we should just sit by and say, 'That does not matter. These are the standards the opposition wants to have and somehow or other we should let it reflect on all of us. ' We are not going to do that. This unctuous drivel we hear from the opposition about standards and decency is from the people who brought you the stinking Penny Easton royal commission-the crookedest, most corrupt royal commission we have seen in this country. It was set up for one reason and one reason only: to abuse the process. We have the opposition running around the countryside trying to put a line that says that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) had a hand in the death of Penny Easton and they put out the member for Chisholm. They say, 'He is a nice young fellow. He is pleasant. He doesn't look like these National Party thugs who come along and say anything. He is your local family doctor. If we put him out here spreading this canard, people will believe it.' Mr Truss- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the speaker referred to the National Party as thugs. I take offence to that and ask him to withdraw it. Mr Grace-You are thugs. Mr Truss-I take offence to that, too. Mr Grace-Good on you.",31
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Mr Rocher)The honourable member will withdraw that remark. Mr Grace-I withdraw.,32
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Unfortunately, it is a collective accusation and the chair usually does not rule against those matters. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-I must say that it is a very proper ruling.",32
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Don't test the chair too much. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-It is like members of the opposition once again to abuse the standing orders to try to slip-slide out of the accurate remarks that are made against them. What we have seen here is this stinking royal commission that has been set up with only one thing in mind. The member for Chisholm is going out there putting this canard out on the water about the Minister for Human Services and Health. The member for Chisholm parades himself as your local family doctor who knows a little about psychiatry. Of course, if he knows anything about psychiatry, as naturally he as your local family doctor would, he would know that the petition could trigger Penny Easton's suicide. He expects that that should be just accepted-that that stands alone; that it means nothing and is just something out there in the ether-while his other colleagues are going around saying that the royal commission is inquiring into the Minister for Human Services and Health. If you put the two arguments together, it is quite clear that the message the opposition wanted to get out was that the minister had a hand in the death of Penny Easton. He comes in here and unctuously says in his personal explanation, 'Of course I never meant that.' The fact is that, just like the right honourable member for New England, who thought he could slip-slide out of these things years ago and was discovered, the member for Chisholm has been discovered. The public record shows what he said. By trying to change it in here in a personal explanation and by trying to get his leader to change it for him as well, he has misled the House. This whole situation raises the question: if the member for Chisholm did not say that Penny Easton was done in by the Minister for Human Services and Health, then why did leader feel constrained to have him in for chat? Did his leader want to tell him that thought he might have been saying these things, or did his leader want to say, 'You've done a good job out there today. You've got the subliminal message out that Lawrence killed Easton. Keep it going. You go on television as the nice young man, and we'll run the hardline downstairs.' That is what this is all about, and that is why this House should condemn the member for Chisholm for what he has done. We have heard a lot from the Leader of the Opposition about standards. We have also heard a lot from the Leader of the Opposition about how the opposition had nothing to do with the Easton royal commission. He said, 'It wasn't something that we were involved in. The Court government decided that this was an important matter.' The member for Chisslimy holm has another interesting role as the agent of the Leader of the Opposition. The for Chisholm condemned himself out of his own mouth in a personal explanation in the We House on 29 August. The member for Chisabsolute, holm should give up making personal ations. He just gets further and further into the mire every time he tries to slip-slide his way out of it. The member for Chisholm said that what the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) said about the Liberal Party and the Leader of Opposition being involved in the setting the Easton royal commission is completely untrue. He said: I said we were liaising-it is totally different. It was 2'12 weeks before the royal commission. So what have we got here? Some 2V2 weeks before the royal commission, the nice young GP was in Perth with the Liberal Party liaising about how to set up the Easton royal commission. What does 'liaising' mean? Any dictionary will give you the definition of 'liaising'. It is getting together in concert with people to get an outcome. Members of the Liberal Party were over in Perth saying precisely what they thought the Court government should do. While the member for Chisholm was his liaising, Mr Court said, 'I may well have a discussed the matter of the royal commission he with John Howard, but he wasn't involved in the decision making.' So members of the Liberal Party went over there; they had a little chat and said, 'We'd better set up this royal commission; we'd better put the line out that the Carmen Lawrence killed Penny Easton; we'd better go and set up some crook royal commission. But don't say we're in favour of itjust say that we're just over here liaising with you.' This is a man who never went anywhere and never said anything. They liaised with their mouth shut, according to the member for Chisholm. But they were in it up to their neck and, as the agent of his leader, the member for Chisholm was in it up to his neck-and he has been found out. That is what the opposition do not like: the longer this goes on, the more fingerprints of the Leader of the Opposition and his agents we see on this stinking, royal commission over there. We hear the Leader of the Opposition talking about member truth. On the AM program, he said: want to assert the simple principle that truth is truth is supreme, truth is never disposable explanin national political life. Mr Duncan-But he was tongue in cheek. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-As the parliamentary secretary said, he was probably tongue in cheek. The trouble with these people is that they would not know the truth if it bit them. the We are going to see the member for Chisholm up of get up in this place and say a few other misleading things about how this really did not happen. I would like the member for Chisholm to tell us what liaison he did have with Mr Court and to tell us what liaison his leader had with Mr Court. Let us know what relationship the Liberal Party had with Mr Court and the setting up of this royal commission. Let us know what the winks, nods and nudges were. Let us know how they orchestrated the plot to get Carmen Lawrence. This was something that the Liberal Party thought was really important at the time. They thought about it for so long; it took them a couple years before they set it up. It just happened to be set up so that it would coincide with a federal election. These are people who want to tell you that truth is an absolute thing. When Mr Court was asked whether he had any discussions with the Leader of the Opposition or his agents on this matter, he said, 'In the answer to the question in parliament, I said that I discussed the question with a number of people, but John Howard played no role in the establishment of the commission.' Who were the people? The member for Chisholm, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party were all over there in Perth saying, 'Come on, let's get into this; let's act in concert; let's liaise with other; let's make sure we set up this royal commission to do in the Minister for Human Services and Health.' This, of course, is typical of the way we have seen the Liberals operate in the past when they have been in opposition. When they get a bit of a smell of blood in their nose and they think they might have a chance to win an election, out comes the old bag of dirty tricks-except nowadays, they have some nice new apprentices. The Leader of the Opposition was right up to his ears in this. The right honourable member for New England has been right up to his ears in these things before and now they are training the new generation. The nice young member for Chisholm will get out there and he will be right up to his neck in it, too. He will smile at you on television and he will say here in a few minutes, 'Who, me? I wouldn't do something like this.' But what was he doing liaising with them? How was he acting in concert with them to get this outcome of setting up the royal commission? Of course, it was the same thing when they liaised with Garfield Barwick. They liaised with old Gar, and they got old Gar to give them private decisions, private advice about what he should tell the Governor General. They went and liaised with John Kerr. They would say they were only out there in Yarralumla in 1975 liaising with John Kerr. They had nothing to do with making up John Kerr's mind for him. They were not making him any promises. They were just out there liaising, in the same way that they are liaising with Richard Court to set up this royal commission, for exactly the same Liberal Party, old boy network outcome. The Leader of the Opposition has got the hide, the absolute gall, to stand up in here and in public and say he wants absolute truth. Let us hear a little of the truth about these liaisons. Of course, it would be interesting to hear a little about the truth of Mr Court's liaisons and why this royal commission was set up in the first place. Why did Mr Court have such a continuing interest in the Easton marriage problems? Mr Court has drawn up these royal commission terms of reference very adroitly, each so that on issues such as that, which are issues of national interest, he says, 'Well, you can't address them.' When he set up this crook royal commission in the first place, they trolled the country to find a commissioner. No-one with any sense would take it on. They finally got a commissioner and then they hired a member of the family to be counsel assisting. We have heard the member for Flinders say, 'Isn't this terrible? They're casting aspersions on Ms Vanstone. It is just unfortunate that she is related to Senator Vanstone.' I suppose it would be unfortunate for anyone to be related to Senator Vanstone. But what we ought to think about is: where is the propriety from these people who talk about propriety? Why didn't Senator Vanstone suggest to her sisterin-law that it might not be a good idea to take this job on? She congratulated her on getting the job. We have all seen on the public record that she congratulated her on getting the job. She then went to dinner at her mother's place, and I suppose they never talked about it. But she thought it was pretty good that her sisterin-law got the job. Let us look at what Senator Vanstone said in the Senate on 9 March this year about justice and the perception of justice: A finding of appearance of bias at law will overturn a decision on the basis that justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done. The threshold for overturning a decision is therefore the appearance of bias. The question of whether actual bias was displayed need not be addressed. Confidence in the judicial system will be lost if there is a public perception of bias in the courts. You can bet your life, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there will be a loss of confidence in royal commissions that have the same perception of bias. If these people had half a brain, if the Liberal Party had half a brain, if Senator Vanstone and her sister-in-law had half a brain, they would have counselled her not to take the job. But the truth is they could not find anyone to go and service this rotten, stinking, inquisitional royal commission. The dregs of the law took this job, not people of any substance. The member is guilty and he should be condemned by the House. (Time expired)",32
155,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"This is not a motion based on the facts; this is a motion based on the numbers in this House. This is not a motion based on any sort of precedence, as the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) would have, for the case of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in 1986 was quite different. People should understand that this is the first time in a Western democracy, since Profumo, that a parliament has been misused for something like this: where a member has been censured on a personal explanation. An allegation has been made against me that I have misled the House in a personal explanation. That is the substance of this motion. And, although it was not the substance of the personal explanation I gave yesterday, it was also raised then. I will address both those issues, and I will address them in detail. First of all, on Thursday 24 August 1995 my personal explanation read: Today in the debate on the censure motion the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a number of allegations. There is one in particular on which I claim to have been misrepresented. He said that John Howard had suggested that I point out that Carmen Lawrence had killed Penny Easton. This morning at a doorstop interview my specific comments were: 'I don't think you could say that Carmen Lawrence killed Penny Easton.' It is completely the opposite of what the Prime Minister said. For the record, I do not say, and have not said, that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death. The doorstop interview to which that personal explanation refers was given that morning as I came into parliament. I was stopped and the first question I was asked was: Is Carmen Lawrence responsible for Penny Easton's suicide? I replied: Well, anyone that knows about suicide would know that it requires a trigger and it would appear that the tabling of the petition was the trigger that caused Penny Easton to suicide. Now, a lot of people are responsible for the tabling of that petition. A lot of people have to take that responsibility, but there's also, there was one person at the top that appears to have to take some responsibility. So, I don't think you can say Carmen Lawrence killed Penny Easton, but I think you can say that, if she'd exercised proper judgment, Penny Easton might be still alive today. Then I was asked: So, she is responsible for that woman's death? Mr Latham-What's the difference?",35
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Mr Rocher)If the honourable Werriwa interrupts once more, he will be dealt with.",35
157,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"I replied: Well, she should take some of the responsibility. So should John Halden, so should others. I think it'sany psychiatrist or psychologist will tell you that it is a trigger, usually, that sets off someone's suicide, and I think it' fairly clear that the tabling of the petition was the trigger for Penny Easton, which is very sad. I stand by that comment totally. That comment is moderate, reasoned, accurate and backed up by the facts. For the record, I would like to read to the House the finding of the inquiry by the coroner into the death of Penny Easton on 5 April 1993. It states: As a result of a petition presented to the State Parliament further publicity was generated concerning the deceased and her family. It is clear that the deceased had been concerned and distressed by past events and that her distress was exacerbated by the more recent events. Let me take the two elements of that personal explanation separately. In a speech here in this place on Monday, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) got up, dripping with venom and vitriol, his eyes popping out, the veins bulging out of his head-you can dress him up in a Zegna suit, but he still looks a spiv-and the spiv was standing up there saying: In other words, Lawrence killed her. That is what you have said. Nothing could be further from the truth. That is a deliberate untruth, because my measured comments that morning could not have been more different. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I think that to call a Prime Minister a 'spiv' is unparliamentary, and the honourable member might with draw it.",35
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The honourable member will resume his seat. He will take the point of order when the alleged offence arises.,36
159,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"So the Prime Minister is over there sayingMr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I took the point of order within less than a minute of the member saying it.",36
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,That is not the time to take a point of order. The honourable member for Watson will resume his seat immediately.,36
161,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"The first part of my personal explanation goes to when the Prime Minister said that I had said she killed her. I could not have been more different in what I said. In fact, I specifically said, 'I don't think you can say Carmen Lawrence killed Penny Easton.' So the Prime Minister chose to try to say black is white, and I made a personal explanation which was totally backed up by the facts. The second element of this is when I went on to say: For the record, I do not say, and have not said, Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death. We have had half an hour of debate in this place on this specific motion, and on not one occasion has anyone on the opposite side been able to come up with anything I have said in five months on this issue to the effect that that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death. With all the work of the National Media Liaison Service trawling through everything I have said, you have not been able to come up with a single occasion on which I have said such a thing. My statement to this House was absolutely accurate. I have never said here or anywhere else that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death. I have said and implied that Penny Easton's death might have been able to be prevented. They are two totally different things. Further to the substance of what I was saying, it is a fact - hat suicide is a very complicated issue and it involves a multitude of factors. The government people were running around the galleries saying, 'They've said this was the cause; they've said this was the only thing responsible.' Nothing could be further from the truth. Any suicide is a very sad thing and it is often precipitated by something that is the last straw. According to the coroner and the woman's mother, the simple fact is that this was the last straw. So it is accurate and reasonable to say that it was a factor. But that does not mean I have ever said Carmen Lawrence caused it. I do not say it, the opposition does not say it; but that is not the fact or the basis of what is going on here-the truthfulness of Dr Lawrence is. I will come to that in a moment. In half an hour of debate and with one more speaker, I challenge you-with all the resources of taxpayer-funded people to eavesdrop and listen to anything we say anywhere in the country-to come up with one occasion where I have said that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death. You cannot do it. What I said in this House was absolutely accurate. The second thing on which I have been charged is the personal explanation of yesterday. I was not really going to even dignify it with a reply but, given that the Leader of the House and the member for Watson (Mr MCLeay) have both raised it, I will put on the record here in this House exactly what happened in the setting up of the royal commission. Yesterday, the Leader of the House said: Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the member for Chisholm was saying that they were constantly involved in discussions. It might not surprise people to know that the Premier of Western Australia and I are not at the top of each other's Christmas card list. The last time. I remember speaking to him was in December 1993, when I bumped into him at a function-nearly two years ago. Yes, our offices were liaising. With $3 million of taxpayers' money, everything I say anywhere in the country is being monitored and anything he says anywhere in the country is being monitored. It would be sheer stupidity for us not to be in contact-through our offices, not directly-so that we do not give you the opportunity to send your media unit around the gallery trying to misrepresent what we do. The comments that they have used for me saying that we were liaising referred to 18 April. The royal commission was set up on 9 May-three weeks later. I found out about the royal commission about half an hour after the press gallery did. I found out about the terms of reference when I read it in the paper. We had no discussions about the royal commission. If you want to check, three weeks before the discussion was: 'Do we do it in Western Australia by a parliamentary inquiry, or do we do it in the Senate by a Senate inquiry?' If you read the full context of what I said on 18 April, it is quite clear that I am referring to whether we do it in the Western Australian parliament or whether we do it in the federal parliament. I had absolutely no role whatsoever in anything to do with the setting up of this royal commission. I was merely trying to act professionally and not give the Labor Party, with all their taxpayer-funded resources, the opportunity to misrepresent what we do, as they have been doing now. They are the bases of the two allegations against me. That is not the real issue here though. The real issue here is that we have the Minister for Human Services and Health and we have to ask, 'Can she can be believed?' We have a version of events that has been changing for the last three years. She cannot quite seem to get her lines right. She started off in 1992 saying: Dr Lawrence didn't know about it beforehand. The only people who knew about it beforehand were the clerk of the House myself and Mr Eastonthat is, John Halden. Then she said: I learnt the detail of the petition and its general thrust upon the tabling. It is very different from what she has been saying lately. She has been saying, 'Oh, I might have known about it. Yes, I did know about it in general terms, but I didn't have a detailed knowledge.' A detailed knowledge is very different from knowing the detail. The issue that should also be looked at here is the whispering campaign being run out of Dr Lawrence's office by Brenda Conroy around the galleries trying to besmirch the name of Keith Wilson. When Keith Wilsona dignified, decent Christian gentleman-gets up and says, 'Well, I remember differently', what happens? They send Brenda up into the gallery. She goes around and says, 'Keith Wilson's not right; he had schizophrenia in the family. There is mental illness and mental instability in the family.' People in the parliamentary gallery know that is true. Ask Paul MCGeoch, who wrote about it. What did Dr Lawrence say when asked on 6WF about Brenda Conroy going around the gallery defaming Keith Wilson? She said, 'No, I've checked this morning following the allegations and that certainly isn't true.' Ask the press gallery, ask Paul MCGeoch and ask why Brenda Conroy is still working in her office. This issue is about the financing of Carmen Lawrence's defence, unprecedented. The government is trying to have a bob both ways. They are trying to say, 'It's not important; it's of no consequence. We're not going to listen to the results. But we will spend as much taxpayers' money as we need to try to stop her having to go there and give evidence.' This is about Notre Dame when, as minister for education, Carmen Lawrence said to the Western Australian parliament, 'All dealings with Notre Dame are off', and then sent her deputy, Ian Taylor, to discuss a land deal about it. This issue is about Western Women. Carmen Lawrence said in the Western Australian parliament, 'I've got no knowledge of Western Women at all', until a letter came up saying, 'Dear Sandra' on a letterhead, complementing her on Western Women. This is about the $5,000 in Dr Lawrence's imprest account. How many people in this place would have $5,000 in their account and not know it?",36
162,Mr SOMLYAY,NOES,Not one of us.,38
163,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"Maybe one of my colleagues and maybe the Prime Minister too. But if I had $5,000 in my account, I would know it, and if any person out there had $5,000 in their account, they would know it. Carmen Lawrence had $5,000 of taxpayers' money in her account, which was put in in 1989. She only found it in 1992 and that was when Brian Burke was going to gaol for the same thing. This issue is about the outrageous slur on Anne Vanstone, for no other reason than that her brother is married to one of my colleagues. That lowers the whole debate in this place. I have nothing to answer. This is unprecedented. It is the first time in a western racy in over 30 years that anything like this has been done. It is not a motion based on facts; it is a motion based on the raw numbers in this House. I got no advance notice of this. Clearly, the government was given advance notice of this. Where is the fairness in that? Any fair-minded person will see that there is no basis to the facts of this whatsoever. The leader of my party has been censured three times on trumped up charges. If I have to join him, I am proud to do so. This has no substance, it should never have been raised, it is totally unfair and people will see right through it.",38
164,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"Werriwa) (11.39 a.m.)One of the beautiful ironies of this place is that in a debate about truth-when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has said that truth is absolute and supreme-the one person who has been caught out red-handed not telling the truth and misleading this parliament is a member of John Howard's own front bench, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). It is one of the most beautiful ironies of this place and parliamentary politics. The member for Chisholm knows, and he has known it from day one, that for the opposition this has been business as usualrorting business as usual, backdoor business as usual, conniving business as usual-to put together a conspiracy and the arrangements whereby, through the backdoor in Western Australia, the opposition could get at the Minister for Health and Human Services (Dr Lawrence). The member for Chisholm has the hide to come into the House today and confirm his sin, confirm the way in which he has misled this parliament. His argument is essentially-and this is why the blood drained out of the face of every member opposite-to say that he has never said that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death. He said in this place on 24 August, 'I have never, ever claimed that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death.' But the honourable member for Chisholm said, at a doorstep in front of Parliament House just hours before that statement of 24 August, 'If she had exercised proper judgdemoc- ment, Penny Easton might still be alive today.' The basis of the defence of the member for Chisholm is to put to the House that you can say it is 11.30 but you cannot say it is half past II, that you can say there are a dozen members here but you cannot say there are 12 present in the chamber. That is the basis of the member for Chisholm's defence in this place, and it is a sham. It is an absolute sham that the member for Chisholm could so comprehensively mislead this parliament and not come into this debate and apologise-to do the decent thing and say, 'I have been caught out red-handed.' When this matter was first raised at the shadow cabinet, he put up his hand and said, 'Look, leave it to me. I am a GP. I have got street credibility on this matter. Everyone knows I have been a family doctor. You just leave it to me.' He then went up to the press gallery and said, 'Look, I know what happened on this. I am a GP. I've had medical training. You can believe my account of what happened between Carmen Lawrence and Penny Easton. I'm going to tell you all about it. ' There the honourable member was, at the doorstep in front of parliament, saying, 'If she'-Carmen Lawrence-'had exercised proper judgment, Penny Easton might still be alive today.' His defence before the parliament today is to say that it is coming up to 12 noon but you cannot say it is coming up to midday. It is an absolute sham by the member for Chisholm. This is not the only instance. The member for Chisholm has form on this, and we have been reading the form guide. We heard about it yesterday at the end of question time, when he claimed in yet another personal explanation that he had not been involved in discussions with Richard Court about setting up a royal commission-only liaising. There had not been discussions-only liaison. The member for Chisholm wants the House to believe that these were liaisons with their mouths closed, that this was liaison through ESP, that this was liaison where not a word was spoken, that this was liaison all through mental telepathy, that this was liaison around an ouija board, that this was liaison where one person said something to anyone else. The member wants us to believe that it was liaison through a seance where Michael Wooldridge, John Howard and Richard Court, with the incense burning in the background, the lights dim and the ouija board in the middle, all held hands and liaised and that somehow through this process of unspoken liaison, through mental telepathy, the message got through that the federal opposition wanted Richard Court to set up a royal commission into Carmen Lawrencc. This is the quality of the argument that is being presented to the House by the member for Chisholm. It is appalling. It is disgraceful. It is an absolute fraud on the intelligence of every person in this place. Not only that, the honourable member said in his earlier remarks, and I hope everyone heard this, 'There were no discussions. I have not seen Richard Court since we were at a Christmas party a few years ago, but there was liaison between our offices.' The member for Chisholm is now trying to have us believe that he would sit in his office and say to his private secretary, 'You ring Richard Court's private secretary and tell them that we want a royal commission into Carmen Lawrence to be set up,' and Richard C0-lrt's private st""'crctary would then have tolJ Richard Court. The member for Chisholm would have us believe that the Liberal Party runs its affairs by chain letter, by a Chinese whisper. How gullible does he think we are? It is absolutely extraordinary for a member of John Howard's opposition to come into this place and say, 'We don't have discussions; we have liaisons. We run the affairs of the Liberal Party and relations with a Liberal premier like a Chinese whisper, like a chain letter, where I tell my private secretary to tell Richard Court's private secretary.' The member for Chisholm was talking about political history. I do not think there would be a time in the history of this parliament where a frontbencher has ever come in, in defence of himself, and had such a lend of the intelligence of every single member. Those opposite trying to defend this know it is indefensible. You know the way in which not the Liberal Party works. The royal commission was set up because John Howard and Michael Wooldridge told Richard Court that they supported it, that they wanted it done and that it was the best way to get at Carmen Lawrence and satisfy their grubby, low based political motive. It is totally unbelievable for the member for Chisholm to come in and say, 'That happened a different way. If you play enough with words, if you argue that black is really white and white is really black, somehow I am innocent.' It is so ironic in this debate, in which we have heard sermons from the Leader of the Opposition saying that truth is supreme and truth is absolute, that the greatest debasing of truth and the greatest misleading of this parliament has come from one of his own frontbenchers: the member for Chisholm. It confirms again the way in which the establishment does business and the way in which they have always gone through the backdoor. They have always connived. They have always had their meetings at the Melbourne Club to plot against those in government, those who stand in their way. It is no different from the Tory establishment way of doing politics: always going through the backdoor, always lying, always misleading, never telling the truth. It has always been the case. The member for Chisholm is just moving and working in that long standing tradition. It confirms beyond doubt the whole basis of the royal commission. The royal commission in Western Australia is a stew, and it has been that way since the first day of this debate. It is a rort. It is a loaded dice. It is a rigged wheel at the casino. Every time you throw the ball in, it comes up with Carmen Lawrence's number. That is the way they have organised this royal commission from the very first day. It is the loaded dice, the rigged wheel of Tory politics. We know beyond doubt that John Howard was there setting it up through Richard Court. Mr Ronaldson-Where is your proof of that?",38
165,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"The member for Ballarat asks for proof on this matter. Obviously he has not read Richard Court's interview from yesterday, 29 August, where he was asked about this matter. He said that I had discussed the matter with a number of people. I said that I probably did raise the issue with John Howard. Mr Ronaldson-'Raised the issue.' That is the proof, is it?",40
166,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"The member for Ballarat would have us believe that John Howard, in response to this telephone call from Richard Court, said, 'You work it out for yourself. You're the Liberal Premier of Western Australia; you work it out for yourself. I have no opinion on this matter.' So the matter was raised with John Howard. The member for Ballarat, using the same line of argument and logic developed by the member for Chisholm, has been so inspired that he is now having us believe that John Howard said, 'I've no opinion on this. You are talking about setting up a royal commission into a federal cabinet minister, and I have no opinion on this. You go and sort it out for yourself.' The truth is that they were in it up to their ears from the very first day. Richard Court then goes on to say, 'As I said, I can't even recall discussing the matter with John Howard, but I'm not saying that I didn't.' It is the same old doublespeak, the same old argument where white is black and black is white. He says, 'I can't ever recall discussing it, but I can't say that I didn't.' You are really having a lend of us, trying to have people in the government believe that quality of argument. Beyond that, the member for Ballarat has obviously not read the transcript of John Howard's interview on ABC Radio on 25 August. He said, 'Richard Court set up this royal commission of his own volition. He informed me the matter was under consideration about the same time he announced that he was considering doing it.' You would have us believe that the Leader of the Opposition said, 'You sort it out for yourself. I've no opinion on this.' The truth is that the member for Chisholm is guilty of misleading this parliament on 24 August in a personal explanation and yesterday in a personal explanation. Yesterday he was saying, 'There were no discussions between the federal opposition and the Western Australian government, only liaison.' Mr Leo MCLeay-Two and a half weeks before the commission was set up.",40
167,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"That is right. It is an absolute disgrace. As the member for Watson points out, there were discussions way back on 19 April. In an interview on the Nine Network, the member for Chisholm, in response to the news that the Senate might not establish an inquiry into this matter, said, 'If that is the case, we'll look at our options in Western Australia.' But we are supposed to believe there were no discussions in pursuing those options. When it was put to him, 'Richard Court keeps threatening to call a state parliamentary inquiry, but he hasn't', the member for Chisholm said, 'We've been liaising with Richard Court. We've been looking for the best way to do it.' Looking but not talking! That is a unique way to conduct politics and run a political party, to be looking for the way to do it but not talking, not discussing, not exchanging views as federal and state Liberal Party representatives. That is totally unbelievable. The member for Chisholm has come into this place and misled the parliament not only on 24 and 29 August; he has done it again today. He is a compulsive liar. He cannot help himself.",40
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Mr Andrew)Order!,41
169,Mr LATHAM,NOES,It really is time for the Leader of the Opposition to step in and sack the member for Chisholm from the front-bench.,41
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I believe that the member for Werriwa ought to withdraw that imputation on the reputation of the member for Chisholm.,41
171,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"It is a medical term that the member for Chisholm would be aware of. I will withdraw it, but the truth of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition, far from arguing for scalps on this side of the House, should be sacking the member for Chisholm. If the Leader of the Opposition believes that truth is absolute, that truth is supreme, he should not have a bar of a frontbencher who is willing to argue in this House that black is white and white is black. He should not have a bar of a frontbencher who is willing to argue in this House that you can liaise without having discussions. He should not have a bar of a Liberal Party frontbencher who is willing to say-nudge, nudge, wink, winkthat Carmen Lawrence was directly responsible but did not cause Penny Easton's death. That is just playing with words-words that are untrue. We all know the standards of the Leader of the Opposition in this matter. He demonstrates them day in, day out by persevering with the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the selfconfessed liar of Australian politics. He was at it in 1989. He was on the Four Corners program saying, 'Sure, we lied. We misled everyone. We didn't tell the truth. We stabbed John Howard in the back. We knocked him over.' What was the response of the Leader of the Opposition when that was pointed out at a press conference a few days ago? He said, 'Oh, that? Well, that did occur a very long time ago and it hasn't occurred while he's been a member of my front-bench.' The journalist asking the question exposed the folly and fraud of this by responding, 'Oh, a statute of limitations.' From the perspective of the Leader of the Opposition-if truth is absolute, truth is supreme-it does not matter if the member for O'Connor lied six years ago, he is still on the opposition front-bench in 1995. So too is the member for Chisholm who has a convoluted way of trying to hide the truth with his fraudulent presentation to this House. If the Leader of the Opposition is true to his word and believes in truth-that truth is supreme, that truth is absolute-then out they should go. The member for O'Connor and the member for Chisholm should not sit for one moment longer on the front bench of this parliament. In particular, the member for Chisholm, in misleading this House on 24 August, yesterday and again today, should be censured by the House and fully condemned.",41
172,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES," Mr Deputy Speaker, the Labor Party's actions today have forced the federal parliament to a historic low. They have corrupted the processes of this place and fatally compromised the Speaker. I remind members of the events that took place at the commencement of the parliamentary day at 9.30. At that time the Speaker ruled on the allegation made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of a breach of privilege on the part of the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) last Thursday. The Speaker, as we sat here and listened to his ruling, made it patently clear that no prima facie case of abuse of privilege existed against the member for Chisholm. Then, to our astonishment, the Speaker, at the conclusion of his remarks, allowed precedence for a motion to be moved by the government. In apparent contradiction of all that had gone before in his judgment, the Speaker left it open to the government to move either a motion of reference of the matter to the Privileges Committee or another form of motion, which we have before us, being a censure. There is no question in the mind of the opposition or any objective observer that there was a prearranged plan of action between the Speaker and the government. The evidence for that is quite overwhelming-not least of all that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) had before him during prayers at the commencement of the day's proceedings a typed motion of censure. The Leader of the House knew the exact terms of the Speaker's judgment.  point of order. The member has said that Mr Speaker has been corrupted. I do not believe that such language is parliamentary.",41
173,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: I said that the processes of this place have been corrupted and that the Speaker has been fatally compromised.  and I think the Hansard record will show that. Out of respect for the institution of the office of Mr Speaker, the member should withdraw that remark.",42
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Mr Andrew)I apologise to the member for Chifley because I was in conversation with the attendant and, therefore, did not hear the remarks made by the member for Gippsland. I accept that the member for Gippsland would not want to have deliberately reflected on the chair. If he believes he did, I would ask him to withdraw those remarks.",42
175,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"No, I did not use the word 'corrupt' in relation to the Speaker.",42
176,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Since I did not hear the allegation, I would assume that he would want to indicate that he would in no way wish to reflect on the chair.",42
177,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"Most certainly, I would not wish to reflect on the chair. What angers members of the opposition is that the Leader of the House was pre-empting the judgment of the Speaker on this matter of an alleged breach of privilege. The whole thing has the Prime Minister's footprints all over it. The government in a deliberate strategy has sought to divert attention from the problems of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to the member for Chisholm, but they have been hopelessly unsuccessful. The government would not refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges, of which I am a member, because they know very well that trumped up charges like this would not succeed in that forum. The Committee of Privileges works extremely well and without fear or favour. The chairman of that committee, the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), is a very impartial and fair chairman. The government knew the Privileges Committee would not find any breach of privilege against the member for Chisholm.",42
178,Mr HOLDING,NOES,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to the standing order which requires that a member not reflect upon a decision of the House. The matters being canvassed by the honourable member have already been the subject of not merely a somewhat vehement debate but also a vote which resolved the matter. I put it to you that the honourable gentleman is coming remarkably close to reflecting upon a decision of the House.",42
179,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"I am unsure as to the reference of the member for Melbourne Ports in his point of order. But the member for Gippsland in his comments to date, I think, has been relevant to the issue before the chair.",42
180,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"Thank you. The allegation of the breach of privilege was so weak that the government did not dare refer it to the Committee of Privileges. Instead, it opted for the distraction device of a motion of censure. We have now reached the stage where the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has referred the matter of a potential breach of privilege in the dissemination of your judgment prior to its delivery in this place to you for judgment as to whether or not a prima facie case of privilege exists. We are very concerned and want to ensure that a member-in this case the honourable member for Chisholm-is not subject to unfair collusion or discriminatory treatment by any officers of this place. The simple fact is that the government wants to distract attention from the woes of the minister for health and from the government as a whole. Mr Leo MCLeay-I am sure the member for Gippsland would want to correct this just so that it is clear that what he said about the officers of this place meant the officers of the parliament, not the clerks.",42
181,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"I thank the member for Watson. Of course, I was referring to the officers of the parliament, not the clerks in any way. The minister for health is in desperate trouble and has created enormous problems for the government for which it sees no way out other than to attack the opposition and to attack the Marks royal commission. The vilification of the commission started last week so as to lay the groundwork for the government to reject any of its findings. We have seen the member for Watson tell us today that the commission is a vile, rotten, stinking inquisition and that the dregs of the law took the jobs. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) followed that up with similar language. The government is throwing aside any concept of precedent, convention, fairness or decency and attacking the commission with the most violent of language. In doing so, they have particularly seized on counsel assisting the inquiry, Ann Vanstone QC, and impugned her reputation and, in doing so, have breached a very important principle of the parliament and the community at large, that a person is not to be attacked on the basis of family association. The government, for all its rhetoric about the rights of women or the rights of a person to a fair hearing, has attacked Ann Vanstone QC, whose reputation as a lawyer stands very high in Adelaide. The government can produce no evidence to justify an attack on Vanstone QC other than by way of family association. Does that mean the government would allow us to attack Justice MCHugh of the High Court if we were so disposed, and we are not? I have read some of his judgments at length and I have a great deal of respect for him. Justice MCHugh of the High Court rules time and time again on government actions and constitutional matters whilst his wife is a minister of the government. There is nothing wrong with that. We have never suggested it and we don't now. The fact is the government believes there is one rule in regard to us not alleging bias on the basis of family association and another for itself. I ask a member of the government to stand up and tell us it is okay to attack anyone on the basis of family association. That is how desperate the government has become. You cannot see it, can you? You cannot see yourselves being dragged down by the actions of the minister for health. The Prime Minister has locked you in. You are so cowardly in the cabinet and caucus rooms that you dare not challenge his determination to ride this out. You know very well how the community at large regards the propensity of the minister for health not to tell the truth in this matter. We ask time and time again in this House for the minister for health to repeat her comments made outside the House, particularly at the National Press Club in April. She refuses to do so. We continually ask the Prime Minister whether or not it is a requirement for his ministers to tell the truth. He refuses even to concede that point. We ask the Prime Minister time apd time again whether he will feel bound by the findings of the Marks royal commission. He refuses to answer. All of that is simply because if there is an adverse finding against the minister for health he will reject it. Of that there is not a shadow of doubt. The Prime Minister keeps insisting that the minister for health be given her day at the commission and judgment should be suspended until she gives her evidence, whilst at the same time proclaiming that he will not be bound by the findings of the Marks royal commission. The vilification of the commission and those associated with it is just part of the government's attempt to defend the minister for health. The member for Chisholm is now the latest target with this very personal action. The member for Chisholm has very ably defended himself today and revealed the censure motion for the nonsense that it truly is. The member for Watson, in ridiculing Ann Vanstone QC, said that it was impossible to imagine that she and the shadow Attorney General, Senator Vanstone, had not talked about the commission at their mother's place over dinner. The logical extension of that is: does Anne Keating, as chief of United Airlines, discuss aviation policy with her brother the Prime Minister at their mother's place over dinner? Do you see where you have led this whole debate? You are allowing aspersions to be cast on individuals who are beyond question and whose sense of propriety nobody would question, because you want to attack the commission before it hands down its findings on the minister for health. The minister for health has ducked and weaved in this place for two weeks now, or for those three days she has appeared on the roster system. The Prime Minister has appeared only once over the two-week parliamentary session for questions and, therefore, the first time in several months. Gary Gray got it right. The minister for health must resign for the good of the government. Part of this dissembling technique of the minister for health which other speakers have mentioned, whether it be not knowing about the $5,000 travelling allowance in her bank account for two years or not knowing about the corrupt and dishonest Western Women until a letterMr Leo MCLeay-Point of order, Mr Speaker: this has absolutely nothing to do with the matter before the House. It has to do with the member for Chisholm and his behaviour.",43
182,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"There is no point of order. The issues the honourable member for Gippsland is going to, I think, have been raised by other members in this place and at that stage they were not pulled up.",44
183,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"In continuation of this technique or style, the minister for health allows her staff to tell the ABC earlier this week, when the Australian newspaper broke the story of Gary Gray's demand for her resignation, that it was a false and inaccurate report. So she allowed her staff to get out there and tell the lies, but she will not come into this parliament and clarify the truth of the situation.",44
184,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,The honourable member for Gippsland will withdraw that last comment.,44
185,Mr MCGAURAN,NOES,"I withdraw. The credibility of the minister for health is in tatters and, as a result, so is the government. The government will do anything to save its political hide, even if it means totally distorting the workings of this parliament and calling into question the position of the Speaker because of the belief on our side that there was prior notice given to the government of the Speaker's ruling on the Prime Minister's allegation of breach of privilege on the part of the member for Chisholm. This is not going to go away for the government. It does not matter how much they twist and tum the standing orders in this place. The opposition will pursue this matter because of the principle of truth. If a minister cannot tell the truth, then he or she should not be a minister. It is that simple. No matter how many red herrings you create, the opposition will not be distracted from that principled task, which is to establish whether or not the minister for health should remain as a minister because she cannot tell the truth. Motion (by Mr Leo MCLeay) agreed to: That the question be now put. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Reith's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided.

186,Mr CHYNOWETH,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,"Yesterday, I was speaking about a proposal by David Packham and Nigel Tapper. This was something that would be quite revolutionary with regard to the greenhouse effect. I would like to read part of their paper: The perception has been generated that the apparent global warming over the last 200 years has largely been brought about by increased carbon dioxide (C02) concentrations in the atmosphere creating a greenhouse effect. PAIRS It appears that there is little doubt that some global warming has occurred and the values discussed have been around I-2°C. Various mathematical models have been created and run on very large computers in an attempt to determine the relationship between CO 2 (and other gasses) and global temperature change. The connection between CO 2, greenhouse effect, global warming and various likely effects (e.g. sea level rise) has become so definitive that public policy is responding. And this is their view: The CO2-warming scenario has been propounded very strongly by various schools of atmospheric scientist, some climate modellers and most of the environmental movement. A more cautious view has been put forward by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (see Zillman 1993) Even a casual examination of the computer models yield considerable uncertainties and a large number of approximations and assumptions so that some considerable doubt must exist in the model outputs. It appears that only two of the models currently running (University of Colorado, and the UK Meteorological Office) are capable of adequately including the effect of smoke and dust particles in the atmosphere. It has been observed that certain large volcanic eruptions have cooled the earth's temperature (generally by about 0.5°C) and that the sulphate particles generated by power production and industrialisation may also have caused some cooling. (Zillman 1993:11). No model has taken into account the effect of biomass or forest burning even though biomass burning may inject several times more particulate into the atmosphere than volcanic activity. However, it is possible that they have a shorter residence time. It is becoming clear that the most likely natural (pre-European) fire frequency for Australia is around about once every ten years for perhaps 10% of 30% of our total land. There are recent studies that would strongly suggest the same 10% for European Mediterranean regions ... a recent startling study in California suggested that a 10% of California was burnt each year before European settlement. What they are saying is that there is not enough smoke in the atmosphere, and that is why the world is heating up. It is a very interesting hypothesis, I can assure you. To continue: In a recent paper from the Arizona Tree Ring Laboratory ... it was revealed that the number of fires in Californian Sequoia has ranged between 5 to 25 per century for the last 200 years, i.e. a 424 year rotation. The greatest frequency was around the ye- 1300 AD. The most dramatic change occurred 200 years ago when the average temperature started to climb and the frequency of burning became the lowest ever. So there is a correlation in these tree rings that shows that, as the burning decreased, the temperature increased. It is also expected that there would have been extensive and regular burning in Boreal forests of Siberia, Alaska and Canada that would have been suppressed as settlement moved into those areas. Tropical burning in SE Asia is routed in farming practices for thousands of years. There are reports that early European navigators had a difficult time navigating in SE Asia due to smoke haze. While burning in the forests and agricultural lands of SE Asia continues today, it is likely that there is much more contemporary effort to suppress the fires than occurred in the past. That the decrease in biomass burning is causing environmental harm has been recognised by the US Forest Service who have instigated a policy of forest burning to return forest health to the US environment. There is little doubt that global warming has occurred as global burning has decreased in the last two hundred years. It would also appear that smoke and haze from rural sources has decreased dramatically over the last 200 years. While these developments may be unconnected, it is more likely that the decrease in smoke and haze would lead to more solar radiation reaching the earth's surface, so contributing to global warming. This is a completely new hypothesis. We had the nuclear winter scenario some years ago. It was put forward by a CSIRO atmospheric research scientist, Dr Pittock, that if there were a nuclear war it would cool the earth quite dramatically and there would be a winter which would continue for many years. These scientists have suggested that the fact similar there is not enough smoke in the atmosphere at the present time is causing global warming. It is something that has been hotly disputed and will be disputed a lot more, I am quite sure, in the future. But it is something worth looking at-even though I certainly would be against forest burning, unless it were controlled burning in certain cases. I like the atmosphere as it is. It is nice and clear here in the Southern Hemisphere; we do not want it looking like the atmosphere in the Northern Hemisphere where there is continual smoke and haze. But it is quite an lnteresting point of view that they are putting across, and it is well worth looking at. We could be looking at a huge scientific error-instead of clean air, we need dirty air. I am not a scientist, as I have said before, but I am a practical person and I can see that this argument could have some merit. I believe that the problems with the greenhouse effect, which I brought back to the House in 1987, still have not been solved. Also, a lot of the warnings that I gave at that time have not been assessed or even looked at. But from anecdotal evidence, we know for ourselves that there definitely has been a change in weather patterns over the short period of time of the last nine or 10 years. Something, it appears, is happening. We are getting more droughts and floods, and it appears as though the level of our seawater is increasing. With all of these things, nothing is definite. Once again, as I have said, this hypothesis that these two scientists have put forward is not certain but it is worth having a look at. It would be quite interesting if they found, through computer modelling, that the atmosphere needed more smoke particles. What would we do? Would we start to burn off more land, increase the coal-fired power stations to create a bit more smog, put a bit more oil into petrol so that we can get more smoke out of our cars? They are the sorts of things we should be looking at. I believe it is worthwhile investing some money in an investigation of the matters they have raised. They have put forward a paper, and I believe it will be in the public arena very soon.",46
187,Mr CHARLES,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,"I am delighted to rise today to speak to the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill, the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Bill and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Manufacture) Bill. Ozone is an important issue and deserves the proper consideration of this House. It is my understanding, from talking to representatives of industry, that the industry in Australia supports the legislation, as does the coalition. It is important to recognise that some chemicals we use in society today, and have used in the past, for very useful purposes are now believed to destroy the ozone. Some of those chemicals are chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, halons, methyl chloroform, methyl bromide and carbon tetrachloride. All of these are chemicals which are important for us in modern life. Ozone in the atmosphere, or in any place, can also be destroyed naturally, by occurrences such as volcanoes and solar flares. I understand that there is great controversy in the scientific community as to the degree of ozone depletion caused by a solar flare, or by a volcano-a very disruptive activity, naturally occurring, that pumps thousands of tonnes of chemicals and minerals into the atmosphere in a very forceful manner. A problem all along in dealing with this issue has been that these chemicals-which scientific modelling shows are causing a hole in the ozone protective layer-we might want to get rid of are used for very useful things. They are used in products that we use in our everyday lives. Such common uses are in refrigerators, fire extinguishers, soil sterilisation, cleaning solvents, foam blowing agents, and aerosol carriers for inhalants for people who have asthma and other breathing conditions. I note that the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) in his contribution yesterday afternoon said very forcefully that he wished us to stop now all production and import of all so-called ozone depleting chemicals. In other words, he wants us to quit manufacture and import of chemicals that we need to operate refrigerators. So, if your refrigerator breaks down or if you want to buy a new car, your refrigerator will not work, your new car will not be air conditioned and your house will not have air conditioning-regardless of where you live. The member for Dunkley believes that the government and the industry got it wrong through self-regulation and that we should simply tell all the chemical companies, 'No more refrigerants, no more fire extinguishers, no more soil sterilisation, no more solvents for cleaning, and no more foam blowing agents in Australia.' That would make us unique in the world. I think the effect would be devastating. Thank goodness the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mr Snowdon) did not listen to the member for Dunkley when he took his advice on this bill. We would be debating a very different issue today. Australia is currently phasing out the manufacture and import of ozone depleting CFCs, methyl chloride and carbon tetrachloride by the end of 1995. This action has cost far less than originally predicted. I recall that there was a bit of doomsay in industry when this issue was first raised in the eighties, but I am pleased to say that, in a voluntary and cooperative manner, the industry has managed to get its own house in order and to find effective substitutes. These substitutes are not 100 per cent perfect. I do note that the hydrochlorofluorocarbons which replaced the chlorofluorocarbons still cause us some ozone depletion problem, but they are far less destructive than the CFCs that they have replaced. It is intended in this bill to phase out those hydrocarbons as well, which means we will need new substances around the turn of the century and certainly all the way out to the year 2020 and the year 2030. We will ultimately totally phase out the production and use of these ozone-depleting substances. It is pleasing that industry has been able to do the work it has so far in a cooperative and selfregulating manner. The Ozone Protection Act, which was passed by this parliament in 1989, draws its strength from the corporations power of the constitution. It is applied nationally, with the agreement of the states, to the national strategy for ozone protection. That is a very good thing. We on this side of the House approve of the use of that instrument in this case to make sure that we have a consistent practice across Australia. I can assure honourable members that the hole over Antarctica is not location dependent on what we do in New South Wales versus what we do in Victoria. We need to take consistent action across the country to deal with this serious problem. I am told that in 1985 a gradual decline in springtime ozone layers over Halley Bay, Antarctica, was reported and further extensive observations in 1987 found convincing links between rising stratosphere chloride levels, a reactive chemical---chlorine monoxide-and the ozone decrease. The Antarctic ozone hole has become a regular feature of each southern hemisphere spring. The stratosphere returns to normal at the end of spring when rising temperatures force a large parcel of ozonedepleted air to disperse, being replaced by ozone rich air from lower latitudes. It is important to note that not all chlorine and bromide containing chemicals have the same effect on the ozone layer. They do have differing effects. Their differing capacities to destroy stratospheric ozone are indicated by numbers which scientists have developed called ozone depletion potential numbers. They allow rather more easy assessment of the benefits gained from reducing or substituting individual chemicals under the Montreal protocol. A local issue in my electorate that concerns me a bit is the phasing out of methyl bromide. Methyl bromide sterilises the soil. In my electorate, particularly in Gembrook, we still have a residual problem with PCN contamination of the soil. Methyl bromide is used in order to help clear that contamination so that we can grow cattle and potatoes. We need to do more research and development work in order to replace these chemicals which we now believe are destructive. The natural greenhouse effect is also an issue of which we should take cognisance. In addition to the ozone problem, of which we are all aware and which we are all trying to take account of by dressing more appropriately in Australia, we also live with the knowledge that it is highly likely that we are pumping chemicals or compounds-gasesinto the atmosphere which add to global warming and potentially to rising sea levels. The natural greenhouse effect provides average surface temperatures across the earth of approximately 15 degrees Celsius. That is warmer than if there were no greenhouse gases at all. Human activity affects the nature and the composition of the earth's atmosphere. Our problem is that we do not know in absolute terms the effects that are caused. All we can do is try to model the atmosphere and the stratosphere and model our production of so-called greenhouse gases to determine, mathematically, the effects that are likely to take place. It is impossible to constantly measure concentrations in the upper atmosphere of various gases at various locations around the world. We do not know the effect on the earth's atmosphere of all these trace gases, but the ones that are most important in terms of discussing greenhouse effect appear to be carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and halocarbons. I note that all of these are increasing. That has caused concern for people who are worried that rising earth temperatures may lead to devastating effects in some areas-for example, deserts may become more desertified. The areas which currently are marginal for agricultural production and/or human living may become marginalised. It is possible that rising temperatures, together with rising rainfall, may produce a better climate in some parts of the world and may increase agricultural production and make it more efficient. We do not know all of the effects of the so called greenhouse effect and man's effect on those trace gases in the upper atmosphere. We do know that the climate models produced so far suggest a rise in temperature, from the 15 degrees Celsius average, of 1.5 degrees Celsius to 4.5 degrees Celsius in the earth's surface temperature over the next century. A possibility associated with that is a rise in sea level of up to 500 millimetres. While we do not know the absolute effects of global warming, we do know that some aspects could be positive but will shift economic activity from one location to another and that other effects could be negatiVl.; and they could be absolutely devastating and wipe out whole animal, bird and plant populations. Australia's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, unfortunately, is very high by world standards but represents only 1.5 per cent of the world's total production. In 1990, of all Australian carbon dioxide emissions produced, approximately 16 per cent were produced by transportation, 51 per cent by fossil fuel combustion and 31 per cent by forestry, which includes land clearing There is an absolute need to do further research on the greenhouse effect. While it is accepted in scientific circles that it is likely that our production of these gases is causing global warming, it is not universally accepted. Nor have the world's scientists agreed on the degree of potential rise or any potential problem or risk. In the absence of proof, it certainly is important that we take action now to prevent any further increase in those trace gases in the upper atmosphere in case the scientists predicting doom and gloom are right so that we have taken action in advance to make sure that we do not create a problem for ourselves that we otherwise might have been able to negate. Obviously, things out there are changing all the time from natural effects. Not just man affects what happens in the atmosphere and stratosphere. Regardless of the controversy, we must do something about it. I maintain that it is necessary for us in Australia to take a more active role in the development of renewable resource energy potential, which we have in great abundance. I compliment the government for its activities in renewables; but I would maintain that we need more emphasis, more money and more scientific effort directed towards using energy sources which renew themselves over and over again-which are, in effect, nondestructible-in lieu of burning coal, oil and gas. It is our huge production of electricity from both brown and black coal that causes us most of our problems in terms of greenhouse gas emissions per head of population in Australia. A large portion of that is dedicated to the production of aluminium in smelters which have very high electricity requirements. That electricity is uniformly generated by burning brown and black coal. Some of the alternative energy sources we might consider and further develop include micro-hydro. I note that in Australia we have used hydro-electric development well for the benefit of the country in terms of cost and stable electricity supply. It is unlikely that we will do more major hydro-electric development. It is highly likely that we will continue with the small stations that we are now putting in in a number of rivers and where dams were built some time ago in small locations to generate power from a megawatt to as little as a few kilowatts. The various forms of solar energy-which is really the harnessing of the sun-range from direct sunshine to wave and wind energy, photovoltaic energy, solar thermal electric generation and biomass. In many areas of Australia there is real potential for greater use of solar powered fuel supplies. Another issue that needs attention is wave energy. Where winds blow across long clear stretches of water, such as the oceans, a constant wave system will build up and what we know as ocean swell becomes evident. There are a number of methods for harnessing wave power from the ocean swell and some of those are under development. Some of them involve floating a device. I note that a small demonstration plant considered to represent state-of-the-art technology in onshore wave energy conversion has recently been installed at Islay in the Inner Hebrides in the UK. The plant consists of a 100 kilowatt shoreline oscillating water column device which now feeds into the local power grid. Windmills, which harness wind power, have a long history of use for pumping water and turning grinding wheels for flour and other grain products. They are still used today in many countries, including Australia, for that same basic purposes of providing mechanical energy. Wind is solar power that has already been converted into mechanical power, so further conversion to electricity is simple and cost efficient. Around 2,500 megawatts of wind-electric capacity is connected to electricity grids worldwide. Most of that power is in California, where there are about 16,000 wind turbines with an installed capacity of about 1,600 megawatts supplying about three per cent of California's grid electricity. In March 1994 Australia's largest and first commercial wind farm was opened at Esperance, on Western Australia's south coast. It was estimated that the farm, which cost $5.8 million, would recoup its cost in eight to 10 years, with savings in traditional fuel costs $650,000 each year. The result for Esperance is the production of lower cost electricity. Wind power from the farm costs around 8c per kilowatt hour compared with about 10c per kilowatt hour for diesel power, based on fuel costs. Photovoltaic electric power is one of the most important new methods of generating electricity currently under consideration in Australia. I have spoken several times in this place about the potential we have in the Kimberley for converting the tides into electric power, converting that electric power into hydrogen, which we might use as an energy carrier, then converting that back into electricity at the required location without atmospheric pollution whatsoever. The result of burning hydrogen is the production of energy and water. All of these methods of replacing our coal fired generation must be urgently considered. (Time expired)",48
188,Mr KNOTT,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak on the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1995 because it goes to a vital issue that faces us all. It is one of those issues that goes to the core of what we are. Unfortunately, a lot of the people who speak on such issues in this place and in many other places deny the fact that we are a biological entity. That is why I wish to speak. I do not believe that this bill goes far enough, quite frankly-I do not believe it goes anywhere near far enough. I would like to refer to some information about the ozone layer that the Parliamentary Library supplied. Ozone is created by the reaction of ultraviolet rays on oxygen molecules in the stratosphere. The ozone layer is a thin layer concentrated in the stratosphere at 15 to 50 kilometres above the earth's surface with the greatest concentration at 20 to 25 kilometres. The stratosphere absorbs 90 per cent of the sun's UV rays. Absorption of these rays heats the stratosphere to temperatures much higher than those in the troposphere, which is important to the earth's climatic pattern. The amount of ozone in the stratosphere varies with latitude, night and day, seasons, and the balance between the rate it is being destroyed of and created. The highest levels of ozone are located between 60 and 80 degrees latitude. Ozone depletion on a large scale was first observed in 1985 over Antarctica, peaking in 1993-94. Ozone depletion is expected to peak again around 2000 followed by improvements around 2050. Increased UV radiation leads to-I hope the children in the gallery hear this-increased skin cancer, genetic damage, suppression of the immune system, damage to fish and crab larvae, and the impediment of photosynthesis, and may affect forest productivity. Now, let's talk about biology. If I am involved in a fire and my skin is burnt badly, I am not going to die from the fire, I will die any from the secondary infections that set in. Skin, that very simple thing we all take for granted-this bag in which our essence is held-is the most important protection that we have against the forces around us on this planet. I may be alone in this place in saying this, but I believe that this earth is a living entity. I believe that when the Aboriginals call the earth their mother they do not do it to denote a gender relationship; they are implying that life comes from this living thing. Most of us look at it as something to abuse, to thlJW trash on, as we walk through. But if you understand the beliefs of the Aboriginal people, and of most indigenous people in this world with religions that have not gone through a great deal of humanisation and civilisation, you will find that their relationship with this earth is a personal one. I agree with them. Therefore, if this earth is a living thing, biologically, it can die. Biologically, can kill the things that it sustains. We can do it through our actions. It is similar to when a virus gets inside you. It attacks your immune system and, even though you are the host which keeps it alive, it can kill you. I think that in some versions of Christianity we are looked at as being the pinnacle of this God's creation, but I sense that perhaps what we are is a virus. In many ways I feel that are uncontrolled. The number of human beings on this planet is unsustainable and, the long term, so is our continued activity. I heard the last speaker, the member for Trobe (Mr Charles), talk about the hardship that will be created to human beings if we cannot use these chemicals for foam blowing and refrigeration and use solvents for gents. There is a very old saying: necessity the mother of invention. The reason why the commercial world and other people will not own families? create the alternatives that we need for our lifestyle is economics: because the others are cheaper. It is much easier to have landmines than some other form of surveillance, because they are cheap. It does not matter that they might blow innocent people's legs off for the years after the conflict has gone. There are many people in this world, and perhaps even in this place, who have no morals. They do not and will not understand that we are not here for money. Money was our creation, and it is a creation that has gone over the top. Those opposite continually stand up here with bleeding hearts and talk about being industrious, about short-sighted attitudes and about how we should bend over because they need to make a profit. What good is a job if you are dead? What good is a job if you have no future? I suggest that we need to start taking a few moral stands in this world-hopefully next week. I notice at the dispatch box our Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh), who has led the fight over the last 25 or 30 years against the nuclear industry in this country. I will be privileged enough to be one of the few people who will be over at Mururoa, not Tahiti-at bloody Mururoa. The French are wrong on this. They have taken a narrow attitude similar to that of the manufacturers and the we capitalists of this world who say, 'We can't possibly do without our methyl bromide.' There has been talk of the year 2050. But the fact that the use of these chemicals may mean that in the year 3000-1 pull that year out of a hat; it does not matter which year it is-there may be a total biological collapse of planet, or the fact that their actions today are jeopardising the future and the continued we existence of our species and other species on this planet, does not mean a damn to them. in They stand up in here and say, 'Oh, well, we've got to be reasonable about it. We've La got to be nice.' I am sick of being nice. I am sick of copping this. I am sick of having to wear decisions which have no father. Enough! When are we in this place and in this country detergoing to stand up and start making some is decisions which are based on logic, principle, and our concern for other people and for our I am concerned about my two boys. My two boys, aged two and three, are going to live a long time longer on this planet than I will. The legacy I hope to give them is a curve that is improving, but I cannot see that curve is improving. In fact, if anything, it is going very much the other way. We cannot get involved in coastal management skills to stop these developers, because these people own the land and they are entitled to earn millions of dollars. It does not matter if all the fish stocks are wiped out. It does not matter if they tum around and do that. Then there are our farmers, and I am very much concerned about them. Look what happened when we had a certain chemical some time ago that caused some major hassles with the beef industry. Short-sighted attitudes are bringing these chemicals in. Look at DDT and 2,4-T for instance. The fact that these things are causing genetic problems within human beings and other species did not really matter. It is said that we have got to look at the bottom line; we have got to look at the dollars and cents. Fortunately, there are people in this world who do believe and do understand that this earth, this thing that we live on, is a living entity. It has a skin around it; it is called the atmosphere. We breach that by our stupidity, by continuing to do things which are absolutely stupid. For example, if I was in industry and I was a worker pushing a power saw in front of anyone who was going by, sooner or later they would sack me and throw me out. They would say , 'You are not going to risk your life; you are not going to stand here in our factory and do that. ' Yet the actions of industry towards the planet are just as foolhardy. When is industry going to take responsibility? It will not. All we have to do is look at some of the corporate entities in our world and look at how much responsibility they have taken. Look at what happened with thalidomide. That is a much better example. In 1963, the Surgeon-General of the United States-and for our last speaker it may be relevantdeclared that smoking is bad for your health because it is linked to cancer. Here we are 32 years later, and the tobacco companies still wheel out 'scientists' who say, 'The court is still out, the jury is still out; it has not been decided as yet.' I do not think that there is one logical person in this place who believes that smoking has not got a causal link with cancer. But if you buy enough scientists and you are in the tobacco industry you have got no problems. By the same token, we all know that CFCs, HCFCs and other chemicals are depleting our ozone. We all know that if the ozone layer is depleted, UV light will come through. This is a form of radiation. We all know that the number of skin cancers is going to be higher and people are going to die from them. Can anyone in this place tell me that the producers of these things are going to compensate the families of people who get skin cancer? No one will tell me that these companies are going to come forward out of the goodness of their hearts and say, 'We have made a few billion out of producing this chemical. We will just kick the can for a few bob.' The costs will fall on the Australian community and the health systems of the rest of the world. Will they give us any assistance? No. I may seem slightly agitated and angry. I am agitated. I am angry and I believe I have every right to be agitated and every right to be angry . We need a ground swell, as we have now over what the French are doing in Tahiti. We need people to understand the messages that are being put out to them by people such as me, who have been hounded. I will make an aside here, because I know that Mr Deputy Speaker Scott has been very much involved in the nuclear debate for a number of years, as has the minister at the table, the Minister for Consumer Affairs. In 1973, I got a resolution passed by Young Labor in New South Wales-seconded by none other than Bob Carr-which attacked the French and asked the Australian government of the time to send across a frigate to stop these atmospheric tests. My action was reported in my area, and I was vilified in the local press as being absolutely irresponsible. I know that both you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, and the minister at the table have copped flak for years and years for the principled stands that both of you have taken and I have taken. But now, the issue of popularity comes up, and no one likes the French. Even in an American show, Married with Children, the dude puts his hand up and says, 'Who hates the French?' Everyone puts their hand up. It is a world sport. In the polls popular opinion against French testing is strong. Lo and behold, who jumps on board? Little Johnny Howard, who says, 'Let us get a little bit of a move in that direction.' It is a funny thing. I should know, but I ask to be corrected if necessary. In the 25 years I have been involved in the anti-nuclear movement, I have never seen the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) or the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) be involved in any one of those actions. I have never seen a letter with their names on it supporting any one of these actions. Yet, when they find out that all Australians see what the French are doing as being absolutely irresponsible, 'hey say, 'Me too! We're on board-have us too.' I welcome them on board. It may be a late conversion. If, five minutes before you die, you decide that there is a god, a late conversion is fine. We will accept them. All I want them to know is that, when they book this ticket, they go for the complete journey. They do not decide that they are going to get off halfway, on the other side of an election. In that vein, may we have a bit of support from them for stopping the generation of electricity by nuclear methods in this country? Kennett was looking at selling the electricity generation of Victoria to the French. How do the French produce their electricity in France? They use nuclear energy. This ozone protection bill goes right to the heart of what we, in this parliament, really should be about. We should be about applying a moral conscience and logical processes to the biological nature of existence. Unfortunately, those people opposite have decided that our creation-money-has taken a much higher place in the role of things. The dollar is a great god. If someone is going to lose a dollar because of an action which is moral and right, we cannot have that happening, brother. We just cannot have that happening. We need to take stronger action from here.",51
189,Mr TUCKEY,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,"Are you talking about Carmen's $5,000?",54
190,Mr KNOTT,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,You keep your mouth shut.,54
191,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,Order!,54
192,Mr KNOTT,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,"You have got no right to talk on anything, mate. You have the morals of a carpetbagger.",54
193,Mr TUCKEY,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,I think the member for Gilmore should withdraw that.,54
194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member for Gilmore might withdraw that comment.,54
195,Mr KNOTT,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,You are probably right; a carpetbagger has got more morals. He has not got the morals of a carpetbagger. I withdraw it.,54
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,I think that is appropriate.,54
197,Mr KNOTT,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,He is wasting my time.,54
198,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,The honourable member might continue in line with the bill.,54
199,Mr KNOTT,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,"The bill is about morals. I understand that some in this place do not understand what that means. They could not even spell the word. Who knows about people who are confessed liars? We are in a position where we need to take a stand. We need to stand up for this planet, we need to stand up for the environment, and we need to not sell out our souls as many have done. Many have done it, over a long period of time. This is one of a number of pivotal bills which are going to virtually put us in the position of being the doctors of this earth. We have been given the synopsis of what is going to happen. We have been told that we have got the infection. We have been shown that continued activity, the way that we are going, is going to lead to our demise. We have just got to have the guts to tum around to those who champion the rights of vested interests, who think that the great god is the dollar, and say, 'I, for one, am prepared to do without, because I have a moral stance.' My family is doing it now, with French products. Previously, we did it with South African products. People in this House, on the other side, really put it into us because we supported blocking trade with South Africa. Well, it worked. There were people on that side who vilified us for saying that sancti,ms should be applied. If one goes back far enough through the history, one finds that they even supported apartheid. We welcome their change of attitude, but it is a one-way street. You cannot say that you are a pragmatist and one day a thing is right and the next day it is wrong. I am idealist, and I will take that criticism. We need to act now. We need to act on behalf of ourselves and on behalf of our host. We are just fleas on the back of a living organism, and that organism is the earth. I have got a funny feeling that, unless we understand that, the future of us all is in jeopardy. I hope that we take stronger action in the future. I hope that on the big issues of the biological viability of this planet we act in the interests of us all and act in the common good for the common wealth.",54
200,Mr HORNE,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill and cognate bills and also to support my colleague the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott). As we approach the end of a fortnight's sitting in this House that has been totally dominated by the misuse of power by the opposition in its support of What will probably go down as the greatest misuse of power by any state government in Australia, we realise that issues such as this ozone protection bill that we are debating today do not get nearly enough time and do not get nearly as much dominance of our affairs as they should. I have listened to some of the debate. I appreciate that the member at the dispatch box on the other side, the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), will not participate in it, and I have got no doubt that he will not participate in it because he will not understand it.",55

202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,Order! The member for O'Connor might cease interjecting.,55
203,Mr HORNE,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,We could tell the honourable member a lot of things but he will not understand them,55
204,Mr TUCKEY,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,"Point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.",55
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,The member for Paterson will please resume his seat. The member for O'Connor on a point of order.,55
206,Mr TUCKEY,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,"The point of order is that this member has taken up all his time so far having a go at me and then you question my response. He has got a simple solution to his problem, and that is to address what he says is an extremely important issue. I point out that there is nobody being denied the right to speak on this and I am listed for the next matter.",55
207,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,"Okay, I have heard your point of order. The member for O'Connor will resume his seat. The point is that the member should be addressing the bill before the House and I would ask him to come back to the bill.",55
208,Mr HORNE,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,"And I will return to the legislation. It seems that it is all right for people to come in here and interject and offer all sorts of advice. The point is that many people do not understand the importance of the ozone layer to global earth. I was very interested to hear the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) chastising my colleague the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth). The member for Dunkley has suggested that all of these refrigerants and other substances should be withdrawn from use because of the potential harm to our atmosphere. The member for La Trobe said, 'How would the world get by without refrigerants? How would it get by without air conditioning in cars?' Personally, I think there are far more serious matters that need to be considered. At the beginning of the northern summer three years ago there was a major television advertising campaign advising people in Europe that their children should not venture outside in summer without UV 15+ blockout, without long trousers and without long sleeves on their shirts because of the potential for sunburn, because of the potential for skin cancer. What is the cumulative effect of continually degrading the ozone layer? I think it is important that all people understand that we do not know how quickly the ozone layer is capable of regenerating. What we do know is that it has been there for millions of years. What we do know is that, with the advent of these substances that we are using as refrigerants, as fire retardants, et cetera, the ozone layer, which is present in the stratosphere between 15 and 50 kilometres above the earth's surface, has become depleted extensively in recent years. The beauty of the ozone layer is that it is capable of absorbing ultraviolet radiation. Ultraviolet radiation is high energy radiation that is capable of ionising molecules. That is the very reason for the existence of the ozone layer or the ionosphere in the first place: that this radiation has enough energy to ionise molecules. It does that with molecules of oxygen which instead of existing in the normal O 2 form exist as 0 3 molecules and that, of course, is ozone. However, if we remove that layer, it means that the ultraviolet radiation penetrates a greater distance into the earth's atmosphere and will eventually come in contact with living matter. That may be plant or animal or it may even be marine organisms. If it ionises the molecules of living tissue then we have the capacity to set up malformations such as cancer, variations in reproductive processes and so on. The worldwide decrease of ozone in the atmosphere is now well documented with annual losses of between three and six per cent over the Northern Hemisphere in the last decade, and ozone losses in the past 10 years over Australia range from five per cent over Hobart to less than 0.5 per cent over Darwin. The most dramatic evidence of stratospheric ozone depletion is provided by the seasonal appearance of the Antarctic ozone hole where the total ozone concentration over the continent is reduced by up to 70 per cent. Anyone who lives on the eastern seaboard of Australia is aware that currently we are experiencing abnormal weather, and have been for a couple of weeks. Statisticians, the people who collect weather data, have been stating over recent weeks that records are continually being broken. Those records include the driest July and the hottest winter's day. What is the cause of it? The answer is that no-one knows. But there is a chance that this has been caused by the depletion of our ozone layer. There is a chance that it has been caused by conditions that have probably emanated from the misuse of substances by humans. A member can come in here and say, 'What a terrible thing if we have to look for new refrigerants or fire retardants.' But the point is, if we get past the point of no return with our ozone layer, if it is reduced to such an extent that it does not regenerate, then all airconditioners in the world are not going to help us. Not even all the airconditioners that have not yet been manufactured are going to help us, because living tissue simply will not survive. This is what the Montreal protocol was all about. It realised that something had to be done and it tried to put an achievable timetable on the phasing out of these materials. I sincerely hope it is achievable. This legislation is there to ensure that we in Australia are going to play our part and that we are going to reduce the use of these ozone depleting substances. We are not only going to reduce them; we are going to reduce the importation of them and the direct use of them. That is important, that we show our responsibility as a global citizen. We must look for new technology. We must look for new substances. Some have been discovered. We must ensure that the ozone layer regenerates and provides the safeguard that it has done for those millions of years. The size of the hole in the ozone layer is currently about 23 million square kilometres and was first measured in 1985. It has moved further north since that time. We have experienced some of the side effects of ultraviolet radiation coming through but I can assure all people that with the passage of time the threat of skin cancers increases every year because, as the ozone layer is reduced, the exposure to ultraviolet radiation is increased. It is not only restricted to Australia and Antarctica; it has also been found in tropical regions, and the increase in ultraviolet radiation has been measured in Australia's far north at Darwin. We are fortunate that as a nation we have time to take the positive steps that this legislation is addressing. It is interesting that during 1986 Australia used 14,000 tonnes14,633 to be exact-of chlorofluorocarbons, but by 1992 we had reduced that usage to only about one-third of that amount, just over 5,000 tonnes. So that is a measure of how we are addressing this problem. That is the relatively good news, but we must do more. It is important for industry to understand the vital role it has to play if we are to manthe age the use of these materials successfully. Industry has to be responsible and show a willingness to look for new technology and new materials because there is going to be no comfort for them in expecting the old technology with its completely unsavoury substances to be allowed to continue; they simply will not. While there was an industry backlash feared in the 1980s following the Montreal agreement, industry now has generally accepted that it has no alternative to proceeding with new technologies. Many industries have adopted the new CFC replacement technology, including butane gases and hydrocarbons, for example, which are being used as refrigerants. In fact, they are being used at faster rates than is specified by the Montreal agreement. That says a lot for the environmental attitudes of Australian industry, and that is something that as a nation we should take pride in. However, as I indicated earlier, the timetable was completely arbitrary, and no-one knows the cumulative effect of the past use of these substances. When the Ozone Protection Act was originally passed in 1989 many were surprised at the speed at which ozone reducing or replacing technologies were being accepted and utilised by industry but, by the end of 1995, Australia will have completely stopped the manufacture and importation of new chlorofluorocarbons, and that includes halon, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. The Montreal protocol has also proved to be effective, with current research showing that the implementation of the reduction plans has seen the slowing down of atmospheric growth rates in the troposphere of several major ozone depleting substances. In 1995 the Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, ANZECC, endorsed policies for hydrochlorofluorocarbon controls. It was recognised that these materials may need to be used for an interim period. To implement the policies, the ANZECC proposed that the issue should be tackled on two fronts: control on hydrochlorofluorocarbon supply and production would be the responsibility of the Commonwealth government, and the states would control emissions and uses of existing HCFCs. These decisions were not arbitrary but followed two years of discussion among state and territory governments, business groups and the environmental movement. The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill basically provides five main amendments. First, it provides that all current licences for CFCs, halon, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride cease on 31 December i995. Second, it establishes a new system of essential use and used substances licences for ongoing uses allowed under the Montreal protocol. Third, it introduces a new system of control substances licence for hydrochlorofluorocarbons and methyl bromide. Fourth, it bans HBFC exportation and manufacture and, fifth, it will establish a trust fund into which all licence fees will be paid. The fund will support the administration of the act and management of the programs for HCFCs and methyl bromide. In conclusion, this is a very important issue. It should not be overlooked. It is one that the future of our planet depends on greatly, and there are many others like it. It is a responsible action. It is one that Australian industry has adopted, and I think it has surprised itself with the rate at which it is adopting it. It is one on which industry should be congratulated. It is also one on which, I believe, the government should be congratulated because it is a very positive response to a major problem. Insidious as it is and little understood as it is, this is something that we must conquer. Thank you very much.",55
209,Mr NEWELL,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,"I join quite a few of my colleagues in this debate, both this morning and yesterday evening, in supporting the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1995 and cognate bills which are before the House. I must say at the outset that I concur with the comments of the member for Paterson (Mr Home). The debate on ozone-a substance which very few people had even heard of 14 or 15 years ago--is very much evident in society today. There has been a big change in people's thinking. Ozone was a substance which very few people were even aware of, and now most people are aware of the damage caused by the removal of that substance from the environment. In his comments, the member for Paterson referred to the way school children today are conscious of both the greenhouse effect and the hole in the ozone layer and the danger which the removal of the ozone layer poses. That can be reinforced in any schoolyard today, where most of the children in the playground wear hats. That is a great thing. Certainly, medical science is battling, not only to spend enough money on, but also to come to grips with methods of controlling the epidemic of skin cancers, particularly amongst Caucasian Australians. Ozone, in itself, is a substance which most people recognise as a poison. Strangely enough, it is one of those things in nature which actually works to our benefit. It works, as we all know, by reducing by some 90 per cent the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches the earth. The destruction of that layer poses quite a few problems for our long-term survival on this planet. A number of speakers have already alluded to that particular aspect of the problem. There has been debate about both the legitimacy of the greenhouse argument and also, in years gone by, the real likelihood of the destruction of the ozone layer by the industrial gases which are being produced. There is certainly ongoing debate about the legitimacy of the greenhouse equation, but there is no longer debate about the importance of the ozone layer. Ozone, chemically referred to as 0 3 , is a poison, but it is one of those good guys in the atmosphere and, as such, its importance cannot be underestimated. Industry and society have recognised that and have been prepared to move constructively and collectively towards ending, or I should say reducing-because, regretfully, ending it is not possible-the amount of CFCs and halons. The use of those chemicals which contain chlorine, which have been used in industrial refrigerants, aerosols and fire extinguishers in the past, has been rapidly reduced. Obviously, we are happy that in Australia the manufacture of those chemicals has gone down to zero. Australia is doing its bit as one of the major continents to reduce the overall amount of CFCs and halons in the atmosphere-the gases which are affecting the ozone balance. I have heard figures quoted which estimate that the amount of ozone destruction which has occurred has been in the order of 60 per cent in places. It is a horrendous figure and one that should frighten anybody since it indicates that a very fragile but important part of the environment could be destroyed by our actions. I will not attribute blame to anybody, but we have all used refrigerants, aerosols and fire extinguishers in the past. The important point is that collectively a decision was made to move very quickly towards the reduction of those gllses. In some cases, I think people might have been pushed on a no-regrets basis but, after some 10 to 15 years of debate and action, I think everyone is more than happy that we took the decision that we did and very pleased with the results that we have had, particularly here in Australia, in addressing the requirements of the Montreal protocol of 1987. It is clear that the efforts by Australia and other signatories to the Montreal protocol to protect the ozone layer are showing results. CSIRO projections based on these observations show that we are well on the way towards meeting the objectives of that protocol. It is great news for the environment and gives us all encouragement to further reduce ozone depletion. We must also give some acknowledgment to some of the processes which have occurred in Australia in meeting those targets. I mentioned-I think, very generously-that it was a community effort. Once the importance of the ozone was in the public arena and people realised that the destruction of that ozone layer was going to mean an increase in ultraviolet radiation with consequent health effects, people were galvanised into action. It was the consumer concern, I think, which promoted the rapid growth of the movement in industry and the community. My experience and of others at the time indicates that when knowledge within the community was expanded on this issue consumers very quickly stopped buying aerosols which were not ozone friendly. One only had to walk through a supermarket in those days to know which of the aerosols people were picking up and, when they did pick them up, they were having a dam good look to make sure that the one that they were picking up was consumer friendly. So it was the value of the consumer dollar, the spending dollar, which precipitated a lot of action from industry. At the same time we have to acknowledge that industry in other areas which were not so quickly affected also played its part. Hence new technologies such as new refrigerants and chemicals for fire extinguishers were very quickly sought and have now been put in place. So we have done a substantial amount to protect the threadbare shield of the ozone layer. Industry and community have certainly recognised the need to ensure that they play their part. The legislation we are debating today also allows for the continued use and importation of some of these nasties, such as the CFCs and the halons. It is a limited importation, one has to admit, but in some cases it is regrettable that we have extended the time limit rate out to 2030. I think we could have been a little bit tighter on this aspect. After all, we have only got one ozone layer. While we might congratulate ourselves on what we have done thus far, it would be silly to pat selves on the back and give ourselves a slowed down timetable. I think it was the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) who vigilant. pointed out in his contribution yesterday that the time frame could and should be tightened. I agree with that proposition. The bill allows for the importation of of the substances, obviously for medical reasons. No-one would argue with that. After Certainly other industries got cracking when they were meeting the wrath of the consumer spending the dollar and they certainly up with solutions quite quickly. I am sure those on the medical industry side, if the pressure were put on them, would also be able to come up with some of those solutions. Perhaps I am suggesting that, because of the emotive side of that argument, they are dragging their feet. Let us hope that they can get their feet going a little bit faster in the future to ensure that something is done about that. After all, as I said, it is an emotive of it. While I am, fortunately, not one to rely on that particular type of medicine, I appreciate that there are quite a few asthmatics as members of the parliament, and certainly it would be a very unusual family in Australia that does not have an asthmatic in its midst. I do support these bills. I appreciate some of the emotion which went into the debate, which I actually had to miss because of other commitments here this morning. Australia can be proud of what we have achieved thus far through consensus. The carrot has been a little bit sweeter or heavier than the stick, if you like, but nevertheless we are meeting the commitments we acceded to in 1987. I guess we cannot really expect to push industry past that but, with a little bit of prodding from consumers and from us here in the parliament, I think that we can actually see some of those targets not just reached but pushed further and further ahead so that that very precious layer, that very fragile layer that we all knew so very little about just over a decade ago, is now protected and can actually renew itself. When we look at the figures from the CSIRO, the people supplying them do make ourwarm noises about the ozone layer itself no longer depleting, but they base that just on one or two years. I think we still have to be We have to keep up the pressure not just within Australia but without Australia on other countries to ensure that they too recognise the importance of this particular global issue and do follow it up in their own countsome ries. Certainly the CSIRO does put out some warm words. Let us hope that they are right. all, the very existence on the earth not just of people but of both fauna and flora will actually depend on our actions here today and came for some time into the future.",57
210,Mr JENKINS,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to be able to rise in this debate in support of this package of three ozone protection bills. It is not the first time that I have had the opportunity to speak on the topic of ozone depletion and, like other speakers in the debate, I think that the pleasant situation that we find ourselves in at the moment, that we side are having some success in tackling this that has problem, is very worthy of note. As the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) has just said, one of the main features of the tackling of this problem has been the wide community action that has occurred. It is a clear example of an environmental problem where, through education, discussion and debate of the problem, the community is able to come to judgments about the appropriate action that should be taken. They are able to join with government and they are able to join with industries involved in coming up with solutions that go towards the rectification of a problem which is caused by the actions of human beings and the way in which we have affected our environment. The other thing that this particular problem illustrates is that, within science, there is continuing debate about causes and effects. If I refer back to the original debate on the original bill in 1988, at that time there were still people in this House who had continuing concerns about the hypothesis that had been put forward about the absolute effect of the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. As time has gone on, science has become more sophisticated and has confirmed a lot of what was predicted at that time and has made differing judgments on some of the effects of the lowering of the levels of ozone in the stratosphere, but still has underlined that it is a problem of global importance, requiring action. The other thing about this, as an environgases mental problem, is that through our local action we can have an effect at a global level. In fact, it is only by combining local actions that we are going to be able to tackle this problem. As has been emphasised throughout debates on matters to do with ozone depletion and to do with the greenhouse effect, these types of problems know no political administrative boundaries, and it is only through the concerted efforts of the sovereign nations at an international level-and, in the case of the Australian federation, through the combined efforts of governments at the state, local and federal levels-that we are going to be able to appropriately tackle these problems. Some of the things that we need to keep in mind are that, of course, through scientific investigation we can go to modifying what is the generally believed situation and the generally believed importance of the actions that we are taking. I wish to mention some research that was, I think, first talked about in an article in Nature and was reported upon in the Age of 27 July, under the headline 'CFC substitute threatens wetlands'. I raise the matter of this article just to illustrate that our knowledge about this problem needs to be ongoing in the way that we modify what we think is important to tackle. The work that was first mentioned in the scientific journal Nature indicated that some of those gases that had been used as replacements for chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs, such as hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons, HCFCs, had been used as replacements for CFCs not only because they displayed similar properties but also because they had, as beneficial properties, shorter halflives and therefore less potential ozone-depleting capacity. But the work that was quoted in the article indicated that one of the compounds that these substances degraded into was trifluoroacetate, TFA, which can be washed into the atmosphere through rain and has been shown to have an effect of toxic accumulation in wetlands. I raise that not to create a scare campaign but to illustrate the point that, when we talk about replacing some of the ozone depleting with other substances, we have to be vigilant to ensure that those other substances do not have further environmental ramifications. We need that ongoing research into the environmental effects of such substances. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) talk about the importance of modelling exercises in trying to be able to predict the effects of ozone depletion. It is only through sophisticated modelling that we can hazard a guess about what is going to be the effect not only now but into the middle of the next century. Clearly, one of the important things that we have to realise in tackling the problem of ozone depletion is that the actions that we are taking today are only going to have some effect five to 10 years down the track. Simply put, one of the problems is that the ozone depleting gases take considerable time to percolate the 20 to 50 kilometres up into the stratosphere where they have effect after they are broken down themselves, predominantly by the action of UV light. It is the chlorine and bromide radicals, amongst other things, that act as catalysts in the breakdown of ozone into constituent oxygen molecules. It is one of those clear examples of an environmental problem that can take some time to occur, or happen rapidly, but the solution for it can only happen over time. The legislation before us puts in place some of our obligations under the relevant international treaties. In fact, the pleasing thing about this is that the targets that we established back in the late 1980s we have been able to achieve even more easily than was predicted at that time. As the honourable member for Richmond was saying, one of the reasons why that happened was through the pressure applied by consumers upon manufacturers. It was one of those things where proper product labelling had great effect in making people more aware of what was actually involved. It also had the effect of ensuring that industry continue to have pressure placed upon it to come up with solutions. It is a good example of the way in which the community can have a positive effect in tackling the problems that confront us. This legislation widens the scope of the present legislation to include hydrochlorofluorocarbons as well as methyl bromide. As I said earlier, the so-called HCFCs have been used as substitutes for CFCs. We now will see caps placed on the levels of those gases that are in use which will, hopefully, place sufficient pressure on those who are researching and investigating substitute gases. The other substance, methyl bromide, is a substance which is used as a pest fumigant in soils. The banning of that substance in countries such as the United States and Holland has seen replacement fumigants put in use that appear to be doing the same job but without any economic consequences, as I read the literature. Again, I do not know how much work has been done on ensuring that the replacement chemicals do not have any different environmental consequences. For a host of reasons, the way in which we have been able to tackle this problem of ozone depletion in the stratosphere is important. Throughout the debates that we have had on this question over the years, we have also gone to the way in which it is required under our federal system. A lot of the regulations that are involved in the manufacture of the substances require action at the state level. It is an example of where there was a need for a cooperative approach between the spheres of governments. It is an example, as has been emphasised, of where community action is important. It is also an example of where science is important. I was a little disappointed that I was not able to actually hear the second part of the honourable member for Dunkley's speech today, wherein he put the interesting hypothesis-which had been put to him by a couple of scientists-that perhaps we need more smoke in the atmosphere. He briefly, outside the chamber, tried to bring me up to speed on this hypothesis; I will have to enter into a longer discussion with him to more clearly understand what has been put to him. I highlight it as an illustration of the continuing need for this type of debate and discussion within the scientific community. It did appear, during the scant briefing he was able to give me, that this was something that was well and truly coming from either far Left field or far Right field; I am not too sure which. I am not too sure whether it is coming from Left field or Right field; we just have to be careful about which direction it is coming from. Again, I emphasise that it is important to have these types of debates about what is really important. I was speaking to somebody, before this debate, who had recently spent 12 months in Germany, in the Northern Hemisphere. I said that I was going to speak on ozone. He went on to say that it is a very important problem in Germany and they are really worried about the increase in ozone. I momentarily thought, 'Wait a moment, what is going on here? How are we at cross-purposes?' But, of course, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, the increasing levels of ozone in the atmosphere are cause for concern. It is a phenomenon which is associated with the greenhouse effect, it is something that many people identify as being a problem, especially for those people with respiratory problems, and it is something with which the sciences continue to try to come to grips. In the Age of 7 August this year, an article appeared under the headline 'Heat on the US as Ozone Levels Rise'. The article says: Ozone levels in the United States are exceeding government standards so drastically can Lung Association is warning people with weak hearts and respiratory systems to seek shelter indoors. So-given the way in which we, as a species on this planet, have been able to affect the environment-we continue to have to come to grips with modifying our behaviour to ensure that the various activities that we carry out on the planet are sustainable. On some occasions, we have to look at these types of hypotheses-such as the need for more smoke in the atmosphere-not with direct scepticism, and at least take them on their merits and let them stand up to rigorous debate and rigorous research. This has been a worthwhile debate. The final point that I wish to make is that I am refreshed to see that, over the six to seven years that this particular problem has been debated in the House, there has been an increasingly bipartisan approach to the problem. I can remember that, back in 1988, the disappointing aspect was that there was political point scoring on an important issue like this. In the main, in the overwhelming majority of those matters that have a global dimension to do with the environment, we find that in the body politic in Australia there is agreement and an acknowledgment of the need for a concerted effort to tackle the problems. There may be, as a number of my colleagues have mentioned throughout the debate, some uneasiness that we are not proceeding at a rapid enough pace, and from time to time. I share the disquiet that the members for Dunkley and Richmond mentioned in their contributions. But, if we take as the benchmarks the requirements that were put in place by such international agreements as the Montreal protocol and the like, Australia can hold its head high that we are tackling these problems at a rate quicker than is required at those international levels. In conclusion, it is perhaps disappointing that we have to spend as much time as we do in this place on the discussion of problems that are man-made. The only way that we are going to tackle them is by modifying our behaviour so that it has a lesser effect on the that the Ameri- environment.",59
211,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,"I rise to participate in this cognate debate on a very important issue for Australians and for every nation around the world. The greenhouse effect has certainly become a major issue at national and international conferences around the world, and any moves being made by governments, as with the legislation before us, are to be welcomed. My comments today relate to my own electorate of MCMillan in Victoria, where we have in the municipality of Latrobe the coal based power stations which generate virtually all of Victoria's coal based power. All those power stations are located within the electorate of MCMillan. So there has been a very concentrated development over many years for the generating of electricity using brown coal, which has come, of course, to the attention of the environmental movement as an important issue in the discussion of greenhouse matters. I wanted to bring to the attention of this House some things that have occurred in the last month and which I am sure that members of this parliament would be interested in and that those involved in the environment movement would welcome. We have seen the development in Victoria of a company, HRL Ltd Research and Technology. In fact, I attended on 10 August at the Hyatt Hotel the launch of this company, which has developed from what was a state instrumentality known as the Herman Research Laboratory, part of the old State Electricity Commission. With tax breaks of 150 per cent made available by this government just two years ago, processes were put in place to try and put together a research development. At five minutes to midnight on 30 June, just before the opportunity closed, the Victorian government and the federal government, along with some major backers, were able to put together what is known today as HRL Ltd Research and Technology. A major project in the development of that company is a $100 million research program into new brown coal power generati·)n trchnology called IDGCC, or integrated drying gasification combined cycle process: quite a mouthful! In this process, coal is gasified and the product i-gas cooled to approximately 600 degrees centigrade before passing through a porous ceramic barrier to remove any particulates and then being fired in a gas turbine. Any alkali, sodium or potassium, in the coal is removed before the turbine stage because volatile sodium species will condense and form particulates before the gas enters the filter. Following successful tests performed in the 25 kilogram per hour atmospheric coal gasification development unit at the University of Aachen, Germany, in early February 1991, a pressurised coal gasification development unit, CGDU, based on the high temperature winkler fluidised-bed concept was designed and constructed at the Herman Research Laboratory in Victoria. The CGDU is designed to gasify coal with air under pressure and is capable of handling up to 300 kilogram per hour of dried brown coal of up to 20 per cent moisture, wet basis. This unique technology promises to deliver a 25 per cent reduction in CO 2 emissions with the added bonus of an up to 30 per cent reduction in the cost of electricity. IDGCC will also be applicable to coals found throughout the Asian region. This has enormous implications for Australia and the world. For instance, China has very large deposits of brown coal similar to what we have in Victoria. This $100 million research project is going to play a major role in relation to greenhouse gas emissions in the future. Under the program, which has been financed by a syndicate of private investors, HRL will construct and operate a six to 10 megawatt scale coal gasification development facility at the Morwell site in my electorate and will undertake a three-year research program there. If that pilot plant is proven successful, a demonstration power station would be the next step prior to commercialisation. I think we have seen probably the last of the large power stations that have been developed to this point using brown coal. This technology will be the way to go. This is c' p.lr:'cu 1:. .li' ·l-..ll "".' \ h,.: . consider that the brown coal deposits in many of the underdeveloped countries of the world are also going to come on-stream for electricity generation. Australia will have a very important role to play in developing this technology for future power stations. Only yesterday HRL put out a media release, which read: HRL Limited today announced that it's subsidiary Herman Research Pty Ltd, had been given the go ahead from the Environment Protection Authority for a Coal Gasification Development Facility to be built in the Latrobe Valley. According to HRL's Managing Director, Mr Graeme Pleasance, the $100M project which will involve the construction of the Gasification Facility and an associated 3V2 year research program will be used to test a new technology for power generation from brown coal called IDGCC. I have just spoken about that. It goes on: ""The approval is a clear indicator of the potential value of the technology to the future of brown coal power generation in the Latrobe Valley, and we look forward to working with the EPA in monitoring the environmental performance of the Gasifica ""We're confident that the technology will reduce C02 emissions from new brown coal power stations by 25%, while producing electricity which is about 30% cheaper. If commercialised, IDGCC will make brown coal generated electricity cheaper  The gasification test program is planned to begin early in 1996 with the completion of the research program by the end of 1997. It is very pleasing to see the work that has been put into this over the last couple of years: first, at the Commonwealth level in offering incentive to industry to come forward and invest; secondly, by the state government in Victoria in putting together, at five minutes to midnight, the process-the last couple of days of getting it off the ground were quite hectic-and, thirdly, to have reached this stage now of clearance by the Environment Protection Authority to go ahead with this pilot plant. We are looking forward in the very near future to the turning of the sod and the actual building of that plant. There are other items, of course, in the greenhouse debate which are extremely important in the shorter term in relation to what is going on in my electorate with the power stations. I think there would not be too many people who are not aware that they are being broken up into independent competitive units by the Kennett government in Victoria. There are commitments by industry, in conjunction with the federal and the state governments and the international community, to reach certain standards voluntarily within the processes that we have at present. We are not letting any grass grow under our feet in relation to that. There is a group of people now-I am chairing a small group in my electorate-also looking at this greenhouse problem and putting together processes which we believe will assist industry, the new industries in particular, whether they are fully privati sed, partly privatised or whatever they turn out to be in the future, to have all the information available on the emissions from those power stations at the moment and to do what is necessary in order to make sure that their emissions are not excessive in relation to what is expected of industry and what is expected of Australia. One of the processes we presently looking 01 is the possibility of having the sink pro-'e""s--if you can find a biomass facility which wiil absorb CO 2 emissions in such a way that maintains our power stations in the technology that is being used at present at a particular level. That sort of work needs to be done and done immediately. Some of the other ""'-h n'()rk that is being done by HRL is '''6 luwards more efficient use of the power stations, maximum use for the amount of coal that is being used and secondary uses also. Steam from those power stations is also a real possibility in the future to assist in , "" - ocesses of reducing greenhouse efiects and the overall effect on the ozone layer. It is a great pleasure for me today to be able to stand here and inform this House of a major project such as this, an overall project of $100 million in research, on a magnificent industry that is quite capable of being competitive in the future. It is not an industry that is now looking and saying, 'Things will be right, Jack.' We believe this process will come to fruition. The scientists are very confident of the process and that future brown coal stations which will be built in Australia, and also in Asian countries, will be very efficient in their emissions and their responsibilities to the overall population of the world in how they operate and the effect they have on the environment. It gives me great pleasure to support the legislation. I wish to congratulate all of those who have been involved with HRL and wish them well in the future. We certainly look forward to the turning of the sod and the building of this pilot plant in the very near future.",62
212,Mr SNOWDON,NOES OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (2.07 p.m.)--in reply-In summing up, I would like to thank all members who have been involved in the debate for their interest and for their constructive comments in support of the ozone protection bills. I am glad to see that the debate was wide ranging and that people saw themselves able to address a number of environmental issues-not all directly related to the ozone; nevertheless, they are very important. It is very clear that everyone in this House appreciates the importance and urgency of the measures proposed in these bills. I think it shows in many respects quite a large degree of maturity and understanding of what the community'S expectations are that we have had such strong bipartisan support for this legislation. It needs to be noted that global ozone the measurement from satellites implies significant ultraviolet-B increases at high and mid latitudes of both hemispheres. The increase in UV-B associated with stratospheric ozone depletion is likely to have a substantial impact on human health. Potential risks include increase in the incidence of, and morbidity from, eye diseases, skin cancer and infectious diseases. Estimates, while still somewhat uncertain, predict an approximate 0.5 per cent increase in cataracts for each one per cent sustained decrease in ozone. Exposure to UV-B radiation can adversely affect the human immune function. In areas of the world where infectious diseases already pose a significant challenge to human health, the impact may be very serious. It is estimated that a sustained decrease in stratospheric ozone will also result in an increase of nonmelanoma skin cancer. But there is good news: the atmospheric growth rates of several major ozone depleting substances have slowed, clearly demonstrating the impact of the Montreal protocol and associated actions. Internationally, Australia is doing its part in helping other nations to phase out their use of harmful substances. Recovery to pre-ozone depletion levels is expected to take place gradually over the next 50 years. Ozone protection is one environmental issue that we can truly say is supported by all governments and political parties in Australia, and our success to date reflects this spirit of bipartisanship. In conclusion, I note that it is an awareness which is shared by industry and the community generally. I want to thank all members of this House and the other place for their support of this legislation. I also thank the relevant people from the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories for the magnificent work they have been doing on this particular subject.

213,Mr JOHNS,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (2.15 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The main amendments in this bill will change the existing unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The handling of cases will become simpler, more effective and less legalistic. These proposals reflect the outcome of discussions with employer representatives, the ACTU and state governments. The amendments have been widely welcomed by leading business groups, including the ACCI and the MTIA, and have the support of the union movement as part of the latest accord between the government and the ACTU. the changes will make a good system even better. The bill will also make minor amendments to other legislation. A number of fundamental minimum entitlements for Australian employees were introduced into the Industrial Relations Act by the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. A key initiative was to ensure that employees are guaranteed a fair level of employment protection. This gives effect to the internationally recognised standards contained in the !La's termination of employment convention. This step was necessary to address the removal or restriction of protection under the industrial relations agendas of conservative state governments. The Industrial Relations Act now ensures that employees have a remedy if they are unfairly dismissed. The legislation was not intended to supplant other fair remedies under state laws which met the international standard. Instead, it meant that an employee whose protection was inadequate, or who had no remedy at all, could use the federal system. The legislation has been operating for over 16 months. It has been used by employees to differing degrees in all states and territories. It is the only relevant remedy for dismissed employees in Victoria, which removed any fair protection under the much criticised 1992 Kennett industrial legislation. It is worth noting that 45 per cent of all applications filed under the federal system have been from Victoria. There has also been increasing recourse to the federal system by dismissed employees in New South Wales, which does not cover all employees under its industrial legislation, and in Western Australia. This has been a new field for federal legislation, which previously only provided remedies where dismissals were discriminatory, leaving the general area of unfair dismissals to state laws. Clearly, by enacting the legislation, the Commonwealth has filled in gaps in employment protection: gaps which had previously existed or which were created by regressive state legislation. The government has carefully monitored the operation of the legislation, including by consultation with the National Labour Consultative Council and state industrial relations ministers. As a result of the consultative process, we now propose four changes to the existing provisions. First, all applications will commence in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Applications now begin in the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, which refers most of them to the commission for conciliation. This first procedural step can be streamlined, with greater emphasis on trying to resolve cases by conciliation first. The court will only become involved if conciliation fails and the parties do not wish to have the matter resolved by voluntary arbitration. The government expects that the great majority of cases will continue to be resolved by negotiation and conciliation. Ninety-four per cent of all cases have been settled through conciliation or mediation, or have been discontinued after negotiation. Two-thirds of these were settled after the commission conciliated. Only six per cent of cases have been determined by the court. Secondly, the act will allow consent arbitration of unfair dismissal claims when the parties choose this option. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will conduct the arbitration. The commission's decision will be binding and enforceable by the court. Parties will therefore be able to avoid the need for a hearing in the court by choosing a less legalistic way of resolving the claim. The third amendment will clarify when state law provides an acceptable alternative to the federal remedy. The government has always intended that dismissed employees use state remedies rather than the federal provisions when the state remedies provide satisfactory protection against unfair dismissals. The existing test of what is an acceptable alternative remedy has two elements: the remedy must be provided under machinery which gives effect to the ILO convention; and the remedy must also be one which the court decides is adequate. This aspect of the legislation has operated more strictly than anticipated, so that only state laws which virtually replicate the federal legislation could be treated as adequate alternative remedies. Most states have indicated that they are willing to provide protection against unfair dismissal which will meet the requirements of the ILO convention but which may involve a different approach from that taken under the federal laws. This has been accepted by the members of the National Labor Consultative Council as an acceptable approach. Accordingly, under these amendments, if the court is satisfied that an alternative remedy meets the relevant requirements of the ILO convention, no remedy will be available under the unlawful termination provisions of the Industrial Relations Act. It is of course implicit in this new provision that the state law must genuinely conform to the ILO convention if it is to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of that convention. Under the amendment, a state will be able to give effect to the convention in its own way. Provision will also be made to give greater certainty to a state as to what will be taken to be an adequate alternative remedy. This is in response to requests by some states for such a provision. Accordingly, a state law will be taken to be an adequate alternative remedy where it requires the relevant state tribunal to give effect to the convention and gives it the necessary powers to do so. This does not prevent a state from choosing another suitable approach to meeting the requirements of the convention. Whichever approach is taken in the state law, it must provide for the making of late applications by dismissed employees who mistakenly applied for a remedy in the federal system rather than under the relevant state law. The fourth change is of particular importance. The act will be amended to make it clear that a breach of an employer's obligations will not automatically lead to a remedy. It has been suggested that remedies are given for breaches based only on procedural grounds without regard to the overall circumstances. Such a situation should not exist. For example, there should not be any guarantee of a remedy where the only defect in the employer's conduct has been some failure to provide procedural fairness and the employee's conduct warrants dismissal. To make it clear that this situation is not intended, the court will be required to consider all the circumstances in deciding whether a remedy of reinstatement or compensation should be granted and, if so, what the remedy should be. In other words, the court will weigh up all of the circumstances, and may, even though an employer has not met a statutory requirement, decide that a remedy should not be given to the employee. This approach is consistent with the long standing practice of industrial tribunals. The bill includes two amendments of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. The first will clarify that no employee injured prior to the commencement of that act is entitled to have his or her compensation entitlements indexed after the age of 65. The second amendment will clarify that injuries sustained in the course of travel to or from work are not compensable if they occur wholly within the boundary of the property on which the employee's residence is located. The bill will also provide a mechanism for ensuring that determinations of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal are free of sex discrimination. This mechan;""m has already been provided in relation to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Remuneration Tribunal. Stevedoring legislation will be amended by this bill to reflect current usage; 'waterside workers' are now better described as 'stevedoring employees'. also There are also minor technical amendments about industrial relations jurisdiction in coal industry matters. All these amendments are explained in more detail in the explanatory memorandum that has been tabled. When the bill was introduced in the last sittings, it was not expected to have a significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure. Since then, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has consulted employer groups and the ACTU about the best way to ensure that the new arrangements operate efficiently, effectively and quickly for all parties. The commission is proposing innovative methods to ensure the speedy listing and determination of applications under the amended provisions. To support this, the commission is constructing some new hearing rooms and support facilities for the parties and their representatives, in Sydney and Melbourne, at an estimated one-off cost of $1 million. There will also be some additional staff required to advise and assist applicants and other parties. The cost of the additional staff over a full year is estimated to be $0.5 million. A reduction in the resources required by the court is expected. However, it is not possible to estimate with any certainty what that reduction will be before the new arrangements are better established and the court has dealt with the balance of its caseload under the existing legislative arrangements. I commend the bill to the House.",65
214,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The coalition will not oppose the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill, but I foreshadow that at the conclusion of my remarks I will be moving a second reading amendment to the following effect: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill and whilst recognising that this Bill provides some improvement to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, the House is of the opinion that, even as amended, the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act remain a disincentive to job creation, that they impose heavy burden on business, particularly on small business, and that they were enacted without proper prior consultation"". The provisions in the current act, and now the amendments, have a long history which has been exemplified by a lack of consultation, by a complete disregard of industry opinion on these issues, by the Commonwealth government's overriding the states, by the refusal to countenance that there could be something wrong with the unfair dismissal provisions and, in a word, by the arrogance of this government which has both made these amendments necessary and so unconscionably delayed their introduction into the House. We are debating these amendments today not because the state systems which the federal provisions overrode were so iniquitous, or that there was some appalling social injustice that needed to be eradicated, but simply because in the run-up to the 1993 election the Labor government, desperate to gamer support, responded and conceded to the ACTU and its demands and went on to ratify an international treaty-in this case, International Labour Organisation Convention 158 on the Termination of Employment. It did so over the objections of employer groups and most of the states and territories. One major employer organisation was only informed of the ratification after the decision. Of all the things this government has done, I think history will record that some of its blackest days have been when it has overridden the provisions of the Australian constitution and acted unilaterally to give itself powers that had never been agreed to by the Australian people. One of the great things about the Australian constitution is that those who wrote it had the good sense to say that, if there are to be any formal amendments to the Australian constitution, they can only come into effect after a resolution by the Australian people through a referendum. In other words, you cannot change the Australian constitution unless the people so agree. It is why, in the proper definition of the word, we are already a great republicbecause power rests with the people. I know this is an aside, but I welcome the remarks of a very the Governor General designate who made that very point: the great thing about the Australian political system is that power rests with the people. In recent years we have found that by entering into a treaty with some foreign power that process alone gives the federal parliament a power which is not already given to it under the Australian constitution. In other words, the federal government can give the federal parliament a power which is not given to it by the Australian people. Mr Cleeland-Say that again. Where did the constitution come from?",68
215,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member for MCEwen will have the opportunity to participate later.,68
216,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It is amazing that he does not understand this point because you people have been abusing it for years. You can effectively change Australia's constitutional arrangements by signing a treaty with a foreign power, and that is exactly what you have done on this ""fair occasion with the unfair dismissals. Therefore, this ratification established a new head of power under the external affairs provisions of the constitution, which allowed the Labor a government, using its numbers in the lower house and knowing that a federal election was employees. just around the comer, to ram through its It unfair dismissal provisions, which overrode the existing state systems. Not only did it this; it also deliberately chose to interpret convention upon which it relies in a way as to place the onus of proof on the employer. It is noteworthy that the convention itself does not require this. It provides: (a) the burden of proving the existence of a reason shall rest on the employer; and/or (b) the competent bodies shall be empowered reach a conclusion having regard to the dence provided by the parties and according the procedures provided for by law and tice. The Labor government did not take the latter employers. option; it took the first option and placed the onus of proof on employers. This relates to a situation where people are dismissed by their employer. This existing set of provisions, to be amended, basically gives people a right of appeal-a process of appeal-to the bodies established under federal law. What transpired is that, far from being the experts on constructing a sensible and reasontionships able system for people who do have genuine cases against their employers, the unfair dismissal provisions that the Labor Party introduced have been absolutely disastrous. fact, it had to change them within months first bringing them in. In the last 12 months or so the weight of evidence and the extent of of the damage done by these unfair dismissals has become so overwhelming that even it had to acknowledge that something had to be down there? done. They proved to be totally biased against employers. Honourable members do not have to accept my view of that. Justice Gray, in one of the very many court cases we have had on these provisions, said: The formerSouth AustralianAct and the present State Act, like their counterpart in New South Wales, operate in the realm of the go all round"" ... This is not a realm that this Court inhabits. The provisions of division 3 of part VIA of the federal Act are not directed to achieving some balance between the interests of employers and employees in particular cases. They constitute charter of rights for employees. They are directed towards the protection of the existing jobs of is fair enough to protect, rightfully, the jobs of existing employees, but it is plainly wrong do to completely disregard the interests of emthe ployers. For heaven's sake, as a matter of such common sense, the employers provide the jobs. We ought to have a system where the interests of both parties are taken into account. The system which was introduced by valid the Labor Party was basically written by the ACTO, as usual; it was dictated to the to government by the ACTO. It totally disreevigarded the interests of employers. It was, as to the judge said, just a charter of rights for pracexisting employees and as a result proved to be absolutely and totally biased against The provisions also impose very significant costs on employers and encourage frivolous now or malicious claims. They contravene one of the so-called objectives of tht; government's Industrial Relations Act, which is to promote more harmonious relationships at work. One of the consequences of these unfair dismissal provisions is that they actually soured relaat work. They eroded the jurisdiction of the states and, perhaps most importantly, deterred employers from giving people jobs. Even Martin Ferguson, the voice of the In Labor Party in the ACTO-about to be a of member of the House; the bloke who bulldozed his way through preselection in the seat Mr Johns-Aren't you running a candidate",68
217,Mr REITH,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Hopefully there will be a strong campaign against Martin Ferguson. I have to say I think that is a fair interjection. I do not think he is a shoe-in. There will be such resentment within the Labor Party particularly-it is a safe Labor seat-at the way in which you have walked all over the rights of your own local branch people that his candidature must be in doubt. But let me get back to the point. Even Martin Ferguson eventually conceded that the outcome of some unfair dismissal cases had been indefensible. 'Indefensible' was his word. That makes a complete joke of you, Minister, repeating that pathetic line of your Jwn minister, who said, The changes will make a good system even better.' What a pathetic thing to say. These provisions were a disaster from the start. Nearly a year after their introduction, nearly 10,000 claims for unfair dismissal have been lodged under the new provisions. They were so biased that an avalanche of claims were lodged. Small business people have basically been driven to the verge of bankruptcy. Businesses are refusing to take on employees because of the fear that they might then become the victims of bogus claims. People who have been sacked for sexual harassment have got back their jobs and have been compensated to boot. A good system, Minister? Let me give you just one case involving this 'good system'. A lecturer was charged with sexual harassment of his students. There was no dispute about the facts. This bloke was sexually harassing his own students on the basis that, if they provided him with sexual favours, they would get better marks. This lecturer was dismissed and lodged an application under the unfair dismissal provisions. Under your 'good system', Minister, this bloke was reinstated and paid compensation even though the fact was that he, as a lecturer, was harassing his own students. You call that a good system, Minister! I would hate to see a bad system under you. That was a classic case. This bloke was harassing his own students. He was sacked, Minister, and he should have stayed sacked. A matter of absolute shame for you people is that such circumstances can even happen. We have had the government dragged with its ears laid back and eyes rolling to an acceptance that anything was wrong. Successive decisions such as that under the new provisions reveal even more bizarre outcomes. Industry bodies and the coalition pointed these out. Do you know what the government's defence was for months? They said our criticisms were merely an example of us revealing our alleged anti-worker bias. That is what you said. This puerile formula is one of your standard smears. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said. 'John Howard h: 'e, workers.' That is what you said in response to our criticisms. It is a very interesting point to make because, as those criticisms of us were shown to be unfounded, it might give people an idea that the rest of the government's criticisms about our industrial relations policy are also unfounded. The government kept that up after not only a Federal Court judge made his criticisms but even Bob Carr, the Leader of the Labor Party in New South Wales and Premier of New South Wales, made the point on 13 April 1995: There are kids going without jobs because of the way the unfair dismissal provision works in the Federal law. There are kids with good training, good education, who are not being given employment because employers won't take them on if they know that, down the track, whatever the circumstances, it is very difficult to effect a dismissal. The European experience makes it very clear: if you make it complex for employers to vary their employment levels down the track, they won't take on employment to start with. The Federal provisions are a handbrake on employment growth ... I want to revise the Federal law. If we can, there are going to be more employers taking on young people who would otherwise be unemployed. That is not Liberal Party political propaganda. Gee, This is the Premier of New South Wales, a Labor Premier, saying that this is not a good law that you are going to make better. He was making the very simple point that we have made for months: these provisions are an absolute disaster. As the government was preparing the ground for an early election, finally on 21 June the Prime Minister forced his Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) to make a humiliating reversal and to announce the amendments which are before us today. The reason why it was so humiliating was that not just months but weeks beforehand the minister, over there in Geneva at the ILO where the whole thing essentially originated with your approval of this foreign treaty, had been boasting to an international audience about how successful his proposals were. He then capped off the announcement of the amendments with the statement we have had so fatuously repeated today by the assistant minister at the table that the amendments would make a good system better yet. It was fatuous because the previous system had been a disaster. It was fatuous because the federal Industrial Relations Court was then and still is making judgments under the old provisions and the damage is still being done. It is fatuous because the amendments which we have before the House simply do not go far enough. There have been so many examples that it is hard to know where to start. Let me give some of the more recent examples. This is your good system, Assistant Minister. A worker in a funeral parlour was dismissed for cremating the wrong body and was then awarded $8,000 compensation. That is great consolation for the family of the person who was mistakenly cremated. Even if a company has a clearly stated policy of dismissal for fighting at work, dismissal for fighting can still be deemed in certain circumstances harsh, unjust and unreasonable. There was a company that had a crackdown on people who were nicking stuff from work. One bloke was actually caught red-handed nicking stuff from work whilst the company had a campaign against pilfering. That guy was compensated and reinstated. In another case, the court found an employee's dismissal had been unfair, even though his employer had given him three written warnings about unsatisfactory performance. Three written warnings, and the bloke gets reinstated! We have had other cases which show that the court limited the right of state governments to hire or fire employees. The court found that an application for a review of a judicial registrar's decision in an unfair dismissal case outside the 21 days permitted should be accepted because the court would be blind if it did not realise that the average person does not know of the technical requirements of order 74 rule 3-that is to say, the system is too technical. In another case a manager was dismissed because of a $300,000 business deficit. He was reinstated because the deficit was not considered by the court to be conclusive evidence of a downturn in business$300,000 in the red and that is not enough to prove a downturn in the business! He got reinstated. The court found that a resignation given in the heat of the moment and subsequently regretted should not have been accepted by the employer as a bona fide resignation. So here we have an employee who is getting stuck into her manager. Obviously I do not want to repeat the words, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I will give you a flavour of it without going beyond the bounds of decency. The employee told her manager that she could stick her expletive job up her expletive. That person was found to have been unfairly dismissed and awarded $5,100 compensation, even though in using those words she had tendered her resignation. The court says, 'It was all done in the heat of the moment. That is fair enough.' That person '.las reinstated. Two employees who were made redundant were reinstated because the court determined to be that their employer had failed to consult adequately with them, even though the employer had discussed the cases with the relevant union. This is not a good system at work; this is a system which has been a disaster. Beyond the anecdotal evidence, of which there is miles and miles, the National Business Bulletin small business survey published in July surveyed 400 companies with an average of 15 employees. It found, in respect of the unfair dismissal provisions, that 49 per cent of respondents were reluctant to employ new staff; 34 per cent would not employ new staff; 37 per cent were reluctant to terminate staff; and 43 per cent would not terminate staff. Even worse than that, employers have changed their whole attitude to employing staff as a result of these provisions and the damage, as a result, will go on. In the Australian Financial Review in May, it was reported: Employer fears over the Federal Government's unlawful dismissal rules have been reinforced by a new survey which shows companies are already altering their recruitment strategies. The Recruitment Solutions' survey of more than 600 employers of accounting staff found that 12 per cent of companies put on fewer permanent staff last year due to the legislation. Many companies are worried about unfair dismissal actions being taken against them by sacked employees, and are increasingly using temporary and contract staff. Whichever way you look at this thing, be it from anecdotal evidence-a lecturer who is caught harassing his students is reinstated and is paid compensation--or, more broadly, from the surveys, the fact is that a lot of people have been unable to obtain work as a result of the absolutely disastrous provisions of this particular aspect of the Industrial Relations Act. Therefore, I have grave doubts about whether these latest amendments will bring the golden new world that the minister would have us believe in. Of course, the government claims that the new changes will fix the situation. But, given the government's lack of candour in the past about the operations of the unfair dismissal laws, who would be confident? Let's face it, the ACTV basically drafted the last lot. It would be amazing if it were not heavily involved in the drafting of the latest. The amendments provide for procedural changes which will see unfair dismissal applications commence in the commission rather than in the court, and voluntary binding arbitration by the commission. The amendments require the court to consider all of the circumstances of an unfair dismissal case. These changes are so obvious, one wonders why it took a year for the government to institute them. I note the minister's remarks in his second reading speech where he said that procedural fairness will not be a more dominant influence in the consideration of the commission and/or the court in the decisions they bring down. I hope that is right but I must say that, from my understanding of the implications of the amendments, I am not confident that will be the case. Up until now decisions have been handed down in circumstances where it is more important to give people notice in writing of their alleged failures than it is to consider the issues on their merits. All we are saying is that you should have a system which is practical, that understands the reality of relationships at work and how things operate at work, and is not superseded by a technical reading of the provisions. The amendments also purport to allow any state system to operate which provides an adequate alternative remedy which genuinely conforms with ILO 158 and preserves employee protection. But, as I have pointed out, the convention offers a choice of modes of compliance-for example, on the onus of proof issue. Therefore, the question of what will constitute a genuine adequate alternative remedy will quickly become crucial. These amendments are steps in the right direction but I do not think they go far enough. They certainly do not address the issues of onus of proof or legal costs. Legal costs are very important because until now the average cost for an employer to defend himself or herself against one of these claims has been about $8,000. That is just an invitation to blackmail. An unscrupulous employee could say to themselves, 'I'll lodge the application, then I'll say to the employer that they can fight me but if they fight me it will cost them eight grand so I'll take five grand as a compromise in advance.' That does not happen in every case but it is an open invitation. We will have to wait to see the impact of these amendments on the system. I think there are some basic principles by which the government should operate. Certainly we will be operating by them. Firstly, the government must abide by its various international obligations. My point is that there are a number of options in doing so. Secondly, employees should have access to a process of appeal when they have been unjustly treated at work. We certainly abide by that principle, and will do so in government. Thirdly, the system should be fair to both sides. It should be a fair go all round. It should not be stacked in favour of the employees, as it has been until now-nor should it be stacked in favour of employers in the future. It should be fair to both sides. That could only be reasonable. That is basically what we had before the government made these amendments and that is what we should have in the future. Fourthly, any future system should minimise legal costs and legal niceties. It should not be a battle between lawyers when somebody gets sacked. It should be a situation where there is a fair, independent appraisal of the issues. Fifthly, we would like a system that discourages frivolous claims, and I am not convinced that is happening with the system we now have, even with these amendments. Sixthly, any system should operate within community standards. My view is that, if someone breaks the law-for example, is caught thieving at work-and it is a serious offence and they are convicted of that criminal offence in a Magistrate's Court, they should get sacked as a result. Quite frankly, I reckon an employer is entitled to sack them. It should not be the system that a person who has been convicted of a criminal offence in a black and white clear-cut case should then be able to go off and lodge an appeal for unfair dismissal. It is totally unreasonable and outside of community expectations. Similarly, there could be a case of sexual harassment-and I have referred to a particular case once or twice before. It was a clear case-the facts are not in dispute. If the person has abused their position-in that case as a lecturer-they should not be reinstated and paid compensation. The same should be said for the Qantas employee who used the Qantas passenger computer system to get the names of female passengers so he could ring them up and harass them at home. The employer brings the bloke in and says, 'Look, this is outrageous' and gave him a warning. I thought they were very generous to him. Within a few months he was at it again-this time not into the passenger computer records but into the overtime records of the company. So they sacked him. Under your system, Minister, which you consider to be a good system, this bloke was reinstated and paid compensation. I just cannot believe how you could defend that. There is hardly a person listening today who would not agree with us that that is in breach of community standards. You just cannot tolerate sexual harassment of such a blatant, nasty, unpleasant sort. So the sixth criterion is that any system you have has to abide by reasonable, mainstream Australian community standards. Lastly, you have to have a system that is user friendly and can deal with issues quickly and reasonably, not only where people have a fair go as employees but also where employers know that they have had fair treatment. The minister says much about the employer organisations all clapping him on the back for a great set of changes. Let me just add something of a slightly different tone to what he has said. I will read to the House what the main employer group, ACCI, have said on it. They have resolved, and it is dated 21 July 1995, as follows: ACCI notes the changes proposed by the Federal Government to the unfair dismissal legislation, and the degree to which these are consistent with some of ACCI's proposals. While these changes will constitute an improvement in the currently unacceptable legislative scheme, the fact remains that they are limited in totally nature and more requires to be done. In particular, there are major deficiencies affecting the Federal jurisdiction in relation to: onus of proof, the lack of a filing fee and a filtering mechanism, the inclusion in the Act of the ILO Recommendation, costs, the provisions concerning absence on sickness, the lack of power for the Commission to determine applications other than on a voluntary basis. In addition, uncertainty remains as to the future approach which will be taken by the Industrial Relations Court on the issue of procedural fairness. In summary, the changes which are now proposed are changes in the right direction, but do not go far enough. ACCI therefore calls on the Government to make further changes to address the issues identified above. ACCI also calls on the Federal Government to I'()W make the changes required to the Federal bargaining and agreement laws, which are too inflexible, and place too great a stress on the role of trade unions and the award system. We will obviously await the final outcome and the impact of these changes. The next election is now not until March, so these will go through in the next little while. We will start to see the operation of the amendments in the next few months. The commitment I give on behalf of the coalition is that when we are in we will, as a matter of urgency, review the operations of these amendments and the act, particularly in respect of unfair dismissals. We will consult properly with interested parties, not just the employer groups. Obviously they are entitled to have a say, but we will certainly consult with the trade union movement and individual employees as well. We will consult widely. We will not just ride roughshod over people-as you have done with these amendments and, more generally, with your industrial relations-and we will introduce appropriate amendments in accordance with those basic principles. The government has introduced a system by essentially abusing the external affairs power. The system it has introduced has been a complete disaster. It has cost a lot of people their jobs. A lot of young people have lost their jobs and the opportunity for jobs. As was said by Premier Bob Carr, Labor Premier of New South Wales, these amendments go some of the way towards the problem. The reason the government has introduced them is that it was thought there would be an election around the comer. They were preparing for it, so they pushed it. Under those circumstances, obviously we now await the impact of them. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the provisions of and whilst recognising that this Bill provides some improvement to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, House is of the opinion that, even as amended, the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act remain a disincentive to job creation, that they impose a very heavy burden on business, particularly on small business, and that they were enacted without proper prior consultation.""",69

220,Mr CLEELAND,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"MCEwen) (2.56 p.m.)On 19 August this year, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), in an address to the South Australian Liberals, said: I warn all of you to put on your political raincoats because you're going to be showered with lies and distortions. Again, on 25 August on ABC radio, the Leader of the Opposition said: We want to assert the very simple principle that truth is absolute, truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life. Why then is the Liberal Party sending out to Australian families lies and distortions about the industrial relations policy? Why is it, indeed? Today we have had a good example of where they stand. The premise of the speech of the shadow minister for industrial relations, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), was that this government has misused the external affairs powera charge of abuse of power, a charge of abuse of process. Yet, and I invite members to read what he said in Hansard, he did not clarifya charge he is happy to make, a charge he alleges against this government yet which he does not clarify and totally ignores. The simple fact is that legislation passed by this House under the industrial relations power in the constitution, as expanded by the external affairs power, is legal. If it were not, it would have been challenged through the High Court and would have been struck out. When we listen to the opposition talk about their position on industrial relations we know one thing. We know their colleagues in the states, such as two-bottle Gude in the Victorithe Bill an parliament and Mr Kierath in Western Australia, and we know what legislation they the are passing. We know what they are doing to Australian workers. We know where they stood in 1993 because we all still carry Fightback with us. We know e-actly what they said they would do to AustralIan workers in 1993. Yet now they think they are going to give a soft, gentle line to Australian workers. We also know that the Leader of the Opposition the Hon. John Howard, has very clearly said that the bottom lin- of. their policy will be the Western Australian - ndus­ trial relations legislation. They are trymg to run away from the second tranche but at least from the first tranche of legislation we know that is what they stand for. If anyone wants to see some pretty horrible legislation where there is no equality, where working people are treated as slaves, then they should have a look at the Western Australian legislation, have a look again at what the Liberals do to ordinary workers when they have the power in the parliament. The shadow minister kept saying that there is no equality, that somehow employees have greater rights under our system than employers. He went through a whole range of misdemeanours he said were caused by employees. Yet in 30 minutes he did not mention one misdemeanour by an employer. The impression that we are getting is that in the real world all employers are beautiful human beings who love their employees, - ho want to pay them proper and appropnate wages, who want them to have reasonable conditions, who care for their safety, who care for their families.",74

224,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Order! Earlier today the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) raised as a matter of privilege my own actions in connection with a matter of privilege concerning the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). As Speaker, I am required to consider all matt-rs of privilege raised, but I find myself m. an extremely difficult situation in expressmg opinion about my own conduct. While I do not propose to be a judge of my own cause, I am happy to provide some information to the House. In considering the matter in question, I did talk to both the honourable member for Chisholm and the Chief Government Whip (Mr Leo MCLeay). The honourable member for Chisholm contacted my office and saw me on Monday evening and made certain material available to me, which I tabled this morning. I indicated to both members my view that it was not clear that the information available established that an issue of contempt existed. I did not divulge the substance of my statement to either member. In my statement to the House, I did not state that a prima facie case had been made out. I indicated that the matter was best left to the judgment of the House and I - as willing to allow precedence to a motIOn. Honourable members will find that there are at least four occasions on which precedence has been allowed to motions, even though the Speaker has not stated that a prima facie case has been made out. I refer honourable members to House of Representatives debates of 23 May 1985 at page 3081, 18 November 1986 at page 3277, 17 September 1990 at page 1943, and 9 June 1994 at page 1856. Although I have an opinion about the issue raised by the right honourable member, I - o not wish to be a judge of my own cause m such a matter. In these circumstances, I would not prevent him from moving a motion, if that is his wish.",75
225,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, I first seek your indulgence. As I understand it, the question that has been raised covers, in your statement, the suggestion that you have had some consultations with the Chief Government Whip (Mr Leo MCLeay) as well as the member concerned, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). In those circumstances, it would seem to me that the discussions with the Chief Government Whip fall outside what I would see as matters that should be properly contained in a consideration by you of a prima facie reference. It is on that basis that I move: That the matter be referred to the Committee Privileges.",76
226,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Is the motion seconded? Mr Nugent-I second the motion.,76
227,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVILEGE,"It is an extraordinarily important part of the proper conduct of affairs in this place that, if it is a matter that has gone to a committee or if it is a matter that has gone to you, Mr Speaker, the matter be held in absolute confidence before it is in any way disclosed to a person outside. I remember, for example, that a little while ago we had a matter in which I think the honourable  a committee and some suggestion was made that, because he had had a press conference refer to matters before a committee, that could well have been in breach of the privilege of this place. In the event, it was not decided it was so. My concern is that, if a matter is referred to you for consideration as a matter of privilege, it should be held absolutely confidentially at the stage that it is only a prima facie investigation. I understand that in this particular instance the honourable member for Chisholm, because of the inference regarding his remarks, was perhaps going to be asked by you whether or not the remarks attributed to him had been made by him. You have to draw a distinction between the prima facie inquiry which you make and the inquiry made by the Privileges Committee. To my mind it would have been far better if, in the circumstances, no person other than the member for Chisholm had been approachedand then only on a very limited basis. It does put you, as holder of the office of Speaker, in a difficult position if you cannot conduct some inquiries prior to making that prima facie report to the House. On the balance of the events this morning, the concern that we all had was that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) seemed to be able to both prepare material and have a resolution typed before the House sat this morning. If that were so and if your report to this place was made only after the sitting of the House, then it seems that in some way the Leader of the House had been privy to the prima facie report you made. It is on that of basis that I express my concern. The inquiry of the Privileges Committee really needs to address, firstly, the extent to which in the conduct of your prima facie investigation any person at all should be consulted, other than the clerks who provide you with advice, and, secondly, the extent to which any prima facie report or, for that matter, any other matter which needs to be reported to the House should or can be discussed outside this place. Those are the two issues which I believe are important. I believe that, in order to ensure clarity and to establish future practice, it would be wise that the reference be made. It is on that basis, rather than as a reflection in this instance on the events as you have described them, that I suggest that it would be preferable that the matter be sent to the Committee of Privileges which can investigate, report back and perhaps advise on proper procedures for the conduct of such prima facie investigation on any future occasion.",76
228,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIVILEGE,We do not agree with the motion. It is quite an unnecessary proposition for the Privileges CommitteeMr Costello--What! They cannot even investigate it?,76
229,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIVILEGE,"No, of course not. You are big on the overacting.",76
230,Mr SPRAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Order! Those on my left! The right honourable member for New England was heard in silence, as will be the Leader of the House. Mr BEAZLEYI suppose if anyone was entitled to some consultation on that process-given that the mover of the original motion was not the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) or the Chief Government Whip (Mr Leo MCLeay) but the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-it was the Prime Minister. The notion of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who was Leader of the House in a previous government for a substantial period, that he ever walked into the place after there was a Speaker's ruling on a matter of privilege or anything else without being forearmed with a series of appropriately typed up propositions would, of course, be a complete nonsense. I had a series of motions which I was capable of moving, depending on the outcome. The first motion I could have moved was: That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges: Whether the honourable member for Chisholm committed a contempt by making a misleading statement to the House in the course of a personal explanation on 24 August 1995. Another motion I could have moved was: That this House censures the honourable member for Chisholm for misleading the House in making his personal explanation on Thursday, 24 August 1995 in relation to remarks made by him in an interview concerning the Minister for Human Services and Health. Another motion I could have moved was: That the House condemns the honourable member for Chisholm for making a misleading statement to the House. So I think I had all the bases covered, and I subsequently moved the motion that I did this morning. The simple fact of the matter is that the actions of the Speaker were entirely appropriate in giving advice both to the honourable member for Chisholm and to the Chief Government Whip as to the general directions of his thinking so that when he subsequently came and presented the position in parliament they would then be able to respond to it. In case it was different from that particular proposition or was going to be a matter which enabled a variety of motions to be moved, we had a whole series of motions prepared. I will lay London to a brick that you did too on the numerous occasions when you had an opportunity to sit on this side of the chamber and handle similar issues.",76
231,Mr DOWNER,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, you might recall that I first raised this issue by way of a point of order this morning. The reason why I became particularly interested in the issue and why I support the motion moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) is that I was standing at this dispatch box this morning and I noticed that, on the other side of the table in front of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), there was a pile of papers which were clearly documents to be used for an ensuing speech-indeed, they were used for that speech. The point I make is this: they were documents to be used to support a motion which was already typed out-:-presumably in the office of the Leader of the House, but at least in a government office. They were the supporting documentation for that motion. Given that you, Mr Speaker, had not told the House of your response to the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) earlier this week, it was a little odd that the Leader of the House had already prepared a motion and had with him a great wad of quotes and speech notes. It is therefore perfectly clear-and this has been clearly revealed by your remarks this afternoon, Mr SPEAKER - that the government was not only aware of what you were going to tell the House, and presumably in terms pretty close to the precise terms, but aware through somebody in the form of the Chief Government Whip (Mr Leo MCLeay). Why would the Speaker think it appropriate to raise this matter and give the details of it to the Chief Government Whip? You could have given the details to the Prime Minister, but you did not give them to the Prime Minister. You did not think of giving them to the Prime Minister or the Leader of the House-you gave them to the Chief Government Whip. He is the backroom tacticianer of the Labor Party. Mr Costello-A factional hack.",77
232,Mr DOWNER,PRIVILEGE,"Indeed, he is a factional hack-and pretty close to the worse kind. Mr Speaker, you gave the details to somebody whose role is obviously to help work out grubby tactics for parliamentary processes. The other thing the Privileges Committee might be interested in examining is not only why you chose the Chief Government Whip as the person you would communicate this information to but when you did it. When did you speak to the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) and what did you tell him? When did you speak to the Chief Government Whip and what did you tell him? That raises a further question: are they the only two people you spoke to? Whom else did you speak to? Did you, for example, speak to any staff members? To what extent was this matter communicated around the government? Mr Speaker, the simple point here is obvious and incontestable: the government was given foreknowledge of what you were going to say so it could prepare its tactics for morning. You are the guardian of this institution. You have a very great responsibility to uphold the standards of this institution through the impartiality of your office. That is why this is such a serious matter and why the Privileges Committee should examine your behaviour and your actions and ensure that you behaved in a manner which was impartial and therefore upheld the dignity of the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives has been reduced to little more than a rabble by the Labor Party over recent years.",78
233,Unknown,PRIVILEGE,Government members interjecting,78
234,Mr DOWNER,PRIVILEGE,"I knew you would all start interjecting, which only proves the point. The member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) shouts and talks endlessly but is not warned or told to be quite. He yaps away like a terrier at the Tennant Creek dog show. The dignity of the House needs to be upheld through the impartial work of the Speaker. This whole matter, which should be referred to the Privileges Committee, comes to the heart of that very issue. In conclusion, it is an extraordinary thing that the Leader of the House-and government members will all vote for whatever he suggests, no doubt--does not want this matter to be sent to the Privileges Committee. Why not? What are you trying to hide? What don't you want the Privileges Committee to find out?",78
235,Unknown,PRIVILEGE,Government members interjecting,78
236,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Order! Those on my right!,78
237,Mr DOWNER,PRIVILEGE,It took you a while. Why don't you want the Privileges Committee to hear from the Speaker and to hear from others as to what their actions were? What do you want to hide? The fact is the Leader of the House does not want this matter to go to the Privileges Committee because he has got something to hide. So I support the motion.,78
238,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I call the honourable member for O'Connor. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr SPEAKER ,78
239,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I am sorry. I will give the honourable member the call in a moment. I this call the honourable member for Watson. In the spirit of fairness, one each way.",78
240,Mr LEO MCLEAY,PRIVILEGE,"Watson) (3.15 p.m.}-Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.",78
241,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVILEGE,"Spill the beans, Leo. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-I am happy to spill the beans for the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) because, unfortunately, this is going to be one of those things where the truth spoils a good story. We have heard a lot of unctuous carryings-on from the former failed leader of the Liberal Party in the mock indignation that he is bringing to us here today. But the reality is, Mr Speaker, as you know, that last evening I inquired of you, on behalf of the government, when you would be bringing down your report on this matter, as is quite right and proper in my position as Chief Government Whip, seeing that this was not the privilege matter of the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge); it was the privilege matter of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He raised it. It was his issue. I inquired of you when you would be bringing down your ruling and you said that you would be bringing it down this morning. You did not canvass with me, nor did I canvass with you, the issue. I then advised the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that this matter would be coming on this morning. The Leader of the House then got some material together, prepared a number of proposed motions that could have eventuated from any ruling that you had made, and indeed",78
242,Unknown,PRIVILEGE,Honourable members interjecting,79
243,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Order! The House will come to order. The member for Watson has the call. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-The Leader of the House has just outlined to the House the proposed motions that he had prepared and did not use, including the one that we did use this morning. So the reality is that we knew the issue was coming on because we asked. We had the right to ask because it was one of our member's privilege matters, and when you quite properly told us the issue was coming on this morning, we were prepared for it. The opposition, in the last couple of weeks, and in all the things they do, are never prepared, they never know what they are doing, and you get the stupid responses like we have just had from the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) in trying to cover up their point.",79
244,Mr COSTELLO,PRIVILEGE,"I want to put this matter on the basis of the extremely important issues that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) raised. I overlook the spurious points made by the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), in his paltry performance. I wish to bring out two statements from your report that make it very important that this do go to the Committee of Privileges. The first is this: you have said in your report, 'I do not propose to be a judge in my own cause.' If the government has its way, there will be no judge in this cause. You have deliberately left the door open for there to be a judgment in relation to this matter and you have said you are not the appropriate person to do it. That being the case, the appropriate body of persons in order to have a look at this is the Privileges Committee. There is no answer to that; it must be. You are in a situation where the Speaker has opened the gate for this motion so that a bipartisan committee, a committee on which you have a majority, could have a look at it. The advantages of having a committee-on which you actually have a majority, but a committee nonetheless-look at it is that that committee has the opportunity to do something that this House does not. That committee has the opportunity to ask those who were involved what the circumstances were. There is no appropriate procedure in this House for other questions that are not covered by this statement to be examined; there is in the Privileges Committee. Anybody who has ever served on the Privileges Committee would know that it operates in a quasi-judicial manner; that it gives everybody who has an interest the opportunity to come in and say what they have to say; and it gives the opportunity to members from both sides of the House to ask questions.",79
245,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,Produce some evidence to send to it.,79
246,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,Order! The member for Banks.,79
247,Mr COSTELLO,PRIVILEGE,"You! This is the great civil libertarian who does not want any investigation at all. Is this the kind of civil libertarianism that you really subscribe to? It is also an opportunity for members of both the government and the opposition to have a look at the facts. Mr Speaker, I want to raise another point from your statement which is very interesting and makes it absolutely essential that this issue go to the Privileges Committee. This statement does not answer one of the questions-in fact, the prime question. I do not know whether that is because the statement has been carefully drawn or whether the question just has not been considered. But what you have said in this statement is: In considering the matter in question, I did talk to both the honourable member for Chisholm and the Chief Government Whip (Mr Leo MCLeay). What you do not say is to whom you reported the outcome of those deliberations. That is exactly the point that the right honourable member for New England was going to. I repeat: you said: In considering the matter in question, I did to both the honourable member for Chisholm the Chief Government Whip ... It leaves open the question of what and whom, after you had made that decision, you reported. That is exactly the thing that Committee of Privileges could get to the bott-m of. If the answer is nil, by reason of havmg that hearing, with both sides being represented, that could be established. Mr Speaker, the third reason why it is absolutely essential that this go to the Commotion mittee of Privileges and that members on both sides of the House get to consider this is very obvious question as to what interest !=hief G-vernment Whip could possibly have In knowmg of your deliberations-not the outcome of your deliberations. He has already said that he was informed of the outcome' you said a totally different thing. This iwhere you completely overstepped the mark; you did not realise what you were saying. The Speaker had actually said, 'In considering the matter in question, I talked to both the honHouse ourable member... ' He did not say, 'I should reported the outcome to the Chief Governes ment Whip. ' You gave that information just now by your absolute foolishness. The question is this: what interest, and why, would the Chief Government Whip have in commenting on the deliberations? Being a person who was neither concerned in the complaint nor the subject of the complaint, of what assistance could he be to the Speaker? 96: That raises the much bigger question again: is it now the case that any member of this House who raises a privileges matter must factor into their decision that the Speaker will consult 'that' before he makes a decisionthat he will consult the Chief Government Whip before he makes a decision? If that is the outcome of this particular decision, obviously people will be much more guarded in what they put to the Speaker, and they will be much more guarded in what they tell. If it is to become a rule that the Chief Government Whip can be consulted on all deliberations, people will have to be much more careful in what they say to the Speaker. :r-at comes back to the other point about talk pnvtlege. Mr Speaker, my contention to you and IS that each member who raises a matter of privilege should have the confidence that they to are dealing with you and you alone. They should have the confidence that what they say the will not be reported to others on the other side of the House. If they are the subject matter of a complaint and they seek your guidance, in my opinion, they should have the confidence that they will not then be subject to having that guidance relayed to others. But in any event, the whole object of the is to determine that question. Is that not a question that should be looked at in the the context of a privileges committee? Is not the the a-swer to .that question something that both SIdes of thIS House have an interest in knowing? Is that not a question which would be the subject of proper and formal deliberations by a privileges committee? Of course it is. Each side of this parliament has an interest in that question. It is something that you should be able to rise above and say that this has an interest in. It is something that properly be determined in the PrivilegCommittee. That is why the right honourable member for New England should get the support of both sides of this House for his motion. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the question be now put.",79
248,Mr TUCKEY,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I draw your attention to standing order A. matter of privilege at any time arising shall, until dIsposed of, or unless the debate on a motion thereon is adjourned, suspend the consideration and decision of every other question: I do not think such a debate can be curtailed by such a motion.",80
249,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Even though the honourable member rightly points out that this particular matter is relevant to privilege, it does not stop a closure motion being moved. That has been done. A division having been called and the bells being rung",80
250,Mr REID,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: you called the member for O'Connor prior to calling the member for W atson. You deferred then to the member for Watson and acknowledged that the member for O'Connor was the next speaker to come on. He should take right of precedence, because you had called him to speak.",81
251,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I had done so; you are absolutely right. But the Deputy Leader of the Opposition took his place. According to the protocol of this House, if one of the leaders on either side wishes to speak they are given precedence, and that was the case. Question put: That the question be now put.

NA Foreign Debt",81
252,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. The minister will be aware that foreign debt jumped today to $180 billion-the highest on record and an eight-fold increase on the debt of $23 billion that Australia owed overseas before Mr Keating got his hands on the Australian economy. Is it a fact that Australia's foreign NOES debt puts a premium on interest rates paid by each and every Australian, including home buyers, as a result of your government's wanton mismanagement of this problem?",82
253,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let us correct your question. It is not the highest foreign debt on record, thanks very much. It is at least three percentage points of GDP lower than its highest point. Another thing that you might have also pointed out in your remarks is that the debt servicing ratio related to it as a percentage of GDP is down from something like 20 per cent in the late 1980s to about 11.2 per cent, and it in fact fell over the last quarter. You need to get those couple of points firmly fixed in your mind. I notice that today you decided to go out with a variant of this when you were quizzed on the doorstop, despite what the Treasurer had to say about these matters today. You attempted to portray the position as follows: 'The worse net foreign debt position Australia has ever had.' Wrong, of course. You went on to say, 'That is $10,000 for each man, woman and child. It represents in human terms, if you break it down for each person, $10,000 worth of debt for Australians.' Then the journalist said, 'But they have not incurred the debt. They do not have to pay it back.' You said, 'If you break it down, if you want to try to humanise the figuresMr Snowdon-You are a deceitful man.",82
254,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for the Northern Territory will withdraw that remark and I warn the member for the Northern Territory. His constant interjections will not be tolerated. Mr Snowdon-I withdraw.,83
255,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is his variant of humanising the figures: to go around and frighten the life out of every man, woman and child in the country by telling them that they have $10,000 worth of debt. It is like me going to the member for the Northern Territory, who has just paid off his mortgage, pointing out that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has just taken on a $100,000 mortgage and saying, 'We're going to average it. Whether or not you're responsible, you've got $50,000 each.' That is your variant of humanising it. It makes about as much sense as going around and doing that. This, of course, is a debt which carried by the private sector by and large. From the government's point of view, about $7 billion worth of the $180 billion is carried by the Commonwealth government. Mr Costello-Can't you read the tables?",83
256,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I can read the tables. It is $7 billion. So you are completely wrong in those propositions that you put forward. The only relevant measure as far as the Commonwealth government is concerned is what is carried effectively by the Commonwealth in its own operations-not by Commonwealth business enterprises or state enterprises, all of which carry it against assets. So you are completely wrong. You cannot read your figures properly. What is actually carried in the course of the year and responsible to the taxpayer is $7 billion. So it is a nonsense proposition to go around talking about $10,000 for every man, woman and child in your stupid scaremongering. Mr Ruddock-Not by the banks.",83
257,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Berowra!,83
258,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But it is even more reprehensible to wander around the place talking about $10,000 for every man, woman and child when you oppose the only effective measures that have been put in place to deal with this problem: firstly, by moving the Commonwealth budget into surplus, which we are in the process of doing, resisted manfully by you; and, secondly, by putting in place the only effective savings arrangement for private savings that has been put in place in this country by the Commonwealth government ever, and you oppose it. You have no answers on that one. Mr Costello-'Put in place'.",83
259,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are in the process of getting it into place. Mr Costello-Ha, hal",83
260,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A big horse laugh. It has three per cent further to come, as you know, from what has been negotiated with the business community. On top of that is the contribution we will be making to match savings that individuals make themselves. The reason it is threatened and not in place-and is this is precisely the point I want to make-is that there is the possibility you might get elected and knock it over. Every single sensible economist in this country and every single financial adviser that you can care to name-every one of them-has signed up to this as the most practical way of dealing with the necessity to get up to speed our private savings in this country and to bring up to speed our domestic savings so that we are not so dependent on foreigners' savings. Everyone has signed up to that except you. You are the opposition spokesperson on treasury matters. You have been for three their years. You have not come up with an economic policy in three years. You have not come up with an answer on savings in three years. Mr Costello-I haven't been for three years.",83
261,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You're finance as wellso you have been the finance and Treasury spokesman for the last three years. Mr Downer-You're even lying about that.,83
262,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Mayo will withdraw that last comment, in the same way as the honourable member for the Northern Territory was required to withdraw. Mr Downer-I withdraw.",84
263,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have been responsible for devising an economic policy for your party for the last three years. You have not done it. You have not produced a savings alternative to the superannuation propositions that have been put in place. You have not been decent enough to sign your own party up to it, even though it now has virtually the unanimous support of the business community and the financial community-virtually unanimous support. You are incapable of signing your party up to it and you come in here and expect us to take seriously questions like the one you have just raised with us, given the source from which it emanates. Your position is reprehensible. Your tactic in getting out there and trying to frighten average citizens by that nonsense notion that there is $10,000 debt being carried by everyone of them is absolutely reprehensible as well. Education Funding",84
264,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and it relates to recent statements made by the Premier of Victoria with respect to Commonwealth-state relationships. Can the minister advise the House of the implications of these statements for Commonwealth funding of Australian schools?",84
265,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I am aware of statements recently made by the Premier of Victoria in which he nominated education as the domain of the states. I might just remind the House as to what he has done with that domain since he has been in office. He has cut school funding by $400 million. He has closed 300 schools. And he has gotten rid of 8,000 teachers from the system. Some presiding over a domain! That is despite the fact that, in the period has been in office, Commonwealth direct funding for schools in Victoria has gone up 1.5 per cent in real terms, yet he has cut expenditure by 10 per cent. We have funded him, through the index, to pay wage increases for teachers and he has not passed them on. Yet this is the domain that he claims Victoria should preside over. I was interested to see in another speech he made yesterday that he was claiming that Victoria was leading Australia. You cannot lead with a second-rate education system. You cannot pretend that what you are producing is dynamism in the economy if you are running the education system down. It is very interesting that the Liberal Party in Victoria are very concerned about this state of affairs. Ms Penson, who is the Liberal candidate for Jagajaga, in a letter that she sent to would be constituents of hers, said that Victoria's literacy and truancy problems 'are more than a little disturbing' - something of an understatement, I would add-but she goes on to say that a federal Liberal government will offer a national strategy to raise the standards of literacy and numeracy. But that is not what the Liberal Party nationally would do. It is not what John Howard is saying, because in his headland speech he said he will give more freedom to the states-more freedom with the funds, more freedom to cut the services. Apart from that, if literacy is such a problem, why is it that the Victorian government is refusing to participate in the national survey of literacy standards? How can the Liberal candidate in Victoria claim a need for a national strategy if the state government will not even participate in a survey to identify the extent of the problem? Mr Cleeland-All liars.",84
266,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for MCEwen will also withdraw his comments. Mr Cleeland-I do indeed, Mr Speaker.",84
267,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This government is seriously concerned about what is happening to education in Victoria. It is against that background that I have indicated recently a preparedness to withhold growth funds next year from he Victoria unless they commit to two important things: firstly, that they agree to outcome measures, so that we can really work out whether or not improvements in the education system are occurring with less funds; and, secondly, that they commit to the national survey of literacy. They cannot masquerade around the country saying literacy is a problem, it needs a national response, but not be prepared to participate in the exercise. These issues are of national importance. They are so essential that we are not prepared to leave it to Victoria alone. The Victorian approach is not the one that this government will be following. It is the approach that John Howard would not only follow; he would also allow it to occur at an even greater pace. We on this side of the House will not. I urge the Victorian government to do something about improving the quality of the education system, getting it up to a first-rate exercise, rather than focusing on developing a second-rate grand prix racetrack.",84
268,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I call the Leader of the National Party, if the member for Sturt and the member for Melbourne want to play a bit of one on one, I will assist them by allowing them to leave the chamber. Otherwise, you sit there and you listen under the provisions of standing order 55. Marks Royal Commission",85
269,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance. Will the Deputy Prime Minister condemn the line of argument adopted by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who attacked counsel assisting the Marks royal commission on the basis that she was related by marriage to the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Amanda Vanstone? Do you accept the fact that people have a right to be appointed on merit without in any way being tarnished by the fact that they happen to be related to a politician? Will you or will you not reject Senator Evans's outrageous slur?",85
270,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Firstly, let me say that obviously I absolutely accept the right of any spouse of a member of parliament to hold any position of authority within the Commonwealth, the state sector or anywhere you care to name. It is most important that that should be the case. The question arises in any particular set of circumstances as to whether or not the particular position happens to be appropriate in the context of the issue that you are dealing with. Senator Evans did not challenge the right of Ms Vanstone to be a judge, to be a QC or to be whatever the legal profession entitles her to be-and that is entirely appropriate. The question is whether or not it is appropriate that a person in that position serve in a particular context. There is a legion of judges, lawyers or whatever who are excluding themselves from court processes every year because some element of it might in some way or another relate to the possibility of the appearance-not the actuality of it; the appearance--of compromise. Counsel assisting a royal commission is not a permanent position. It is not a job that you hold for life. It is a job that is there for temporary purposes, and many people can fill that position. There are numerous barristers available around the Commonwealth, including Western Australia, who could serve in that position. The question which arises is whether or not in that highly charged situation, in a highly politicised royal commission, as this one is, no matter what level of integrity the person concerned may have-it may, to all intents and purposes, be very high indeed-it is appropriate that a person who has a relationship with somebody actively engaged in the political process ought to serve. That is what Senator Evans called into question. I would have thought that was just one of a number of factors that any person placed in that sort of situation would want to consider. She has a sister-in-law, here in this place and outside in the community, virulently advocating various positions in relation to the conduct, the existence and the creation of the royal commission-and she chooses to serve in it. That does not go to any criticism of the way in which she may have conducted herself in the course of the royal commission. It is a question of appearances. I thought a most dignified statement on those matters was made this morning on the A.M. program by David Smith, whose refusal-his absolute determination to stand by parliamentary privilege and cabinet confidentiality as central features of decent democratic institutions in this country-has now been reported to the state Attorney-General for action against him. He was queried about these matters. He is obviously a person most directly concerned with the progress of the royal commission .and most directly reliant upon fair treatment in the case of his own person. He was asked what he, as a person directly affected by it, had to say about it. He did not call into question the integrity, dignity or whatever of Ms Vanstone. Mr MCGauran-But he did: 'the family that preys together'. Mr BEAZLEYI am talking about David Smith. What he said in the circumstances in which he finds himself-a person directly, personally affected by the political processes associated with the royal commission, and now by its legal processes-is that he does not have confidence in the appearance of the situation, in which a person who is related to clear political opponents is there as the counsel who, in technical terms, is trying to put him in gaol. I would have thought that anybody who is concerned about appropriate political processes anywhere would have taken note of that. It is in that context that I think questions can be legitimately raised-not in connection with the integrity of Ms Vanstone at all, but in connection with the politics and the appearance of fairness in this process. It was entirely appropriate for Mr Smith, a victim, to raise that this morning and for the Leader of the Government in the Senate to raise it yesterday. Highway Link in Sydney",85
271,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Can the minister inform the House about progress with the planned national highway link through western and south-western Sydney?,86
272,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to inform the House that planning for the western Sydney orbital road-the road that will link Sydney's two airports as well as linking the highways to the south and north of Sydneyis now well advanced. In this year's budget, the government announced some $260 million by way of a package to upgrade the road approaches to Sydney West airport and to announce the commencement of an EIS on the southern section of the orbital road from Prestons to Cecil Park. That is the section that will link the two airports. As such, I am able to inform the House that its completion is timed to coincide with the airport's opening in 1999. Today I want to announce that this freeway will be extended all the way to link with the M4 at Eastern Creek at an additional cost of some $220 million. Planning for this second stage will be funded in next year's budget with major works commencing in 1998. The completed orbital will bring great benefits to the whole of Australia, to western Sydney most of all. Indeed, a draft study on the project just provided to the government estimates the national dividend in terms of reduced transport costs at $870 million and the economic windfall to the nation at some $1.2 billion. I know it was with such benefits in mind that, in announcing the project last year, I suggested it might have to be funded by the private sector. Given its high priority and given its large cost, it was only right that all of the options of funding were explored and that the public was forewarned that a toll might be the price of bringing forward this vital new investment. Today I can inform the House that, after analysing the draft study, we have decided there will be no toll on either section of the western orbital.",86
273,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,L-a-w law.,86
274,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Member for Parkes, contain your excitement!",86
275,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This decision has been made possible by our government's shift to a three-year national highway program that provides greater flexibility and provides greater funding certainty for such large, high priority projects. It is reinforced by the draft study, which indicated that tolling these sections could result in traffic diversion as high as 50 per cent onto suburban roads. The draft study has, at the same time, redoubled our determination to treat the orbital as a major priority. As such, today I can confirm to the House that the second section will proceed and will be built without a toll, a decision that I know will be warmly welcomed by those on this side of the House. Today's announcement is very good news for Sydney, it is fantastic news for western Sydney and, indeed, it is great news for all motorists who will benefit from this very important project. Marks Royal Commission",86
276,Mrs SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. I draw your attention to the fact that the opposition has never attacked High Court Justice MCHugh, who deals also with political issues in a sometimes highly charged atmosphere, on the basis of his family relationship with the Minister for Consumer Affairs. How can you justify Senator Evans's attack on the professionalism of counsel assisting the Marks commission on the basis of her family connection-I remind you that he said that it was 'the family that preys together' - to the shadow Attorney-General? How will Senator Evans's comments encourage more women to enter parliament or seek to rise to higher positions",87
277,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,87
278,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my right. The member for Moncrieff has the call with a question.,87
279,Mrs SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,How will Senator Evans's comments encourage more women to enter parliament or seek to rise to higher positions in public life or the professions?,87
280,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have been most surprised if Senator Evans's objectionsindeed, mine, as I expressed in answer to the previous questioner-applied exclusively in the case of it being a 'Ms' Vanstone we are dealing with rather than a ' Mr The point has nothing to do with the gender of Ms Vanstone. It has everything to do with the familial relationship. That is all. I acknowledge the point you make about the opposition not objecting to the relationship between the two, but of course it would be incumbent upon the High Court judge, if in any set of circumstances he thought there was an element of that relationship which impinged on his capacity to consider a particular case, to exclude himself from it. Likewise, it would apply to judges-many of them are married to solicitors and barristerswho, from time to time, have personal relationships or a friendship or association with a person whose case could conceivably be impinged upon by a ca-e that is before lilat judge, or the particular lawyer, barrister or solicitor. They exclude themselves. It is not an unusual thing. The comments I made about the position of Ms Vanstone do not go to her appropriateness to be a QC, to be a barrister or to serve as a judge. They go to the question of a highly politically charged royal commission in which various members of parliament, seeking to uphold the rights of parliament and uphold the rights of cabinet confidentiality, are now royal being referred to the Attorney-General in Western Australia for prosecution. It is a most intense political atmosphere. The individual directly concerned-who may go to gaol for it, of course, if taken through to a charge of contempt-says that he feels uncomfortable with a situation in which there is a person related to another individual who is a spear carrier for the Liberal Party in the Senate, in the case of Senator Vanstone. Mr Smith did not raise at all whether or not her conduct was in any way reprehensible. It had nothing to do with that. It was all to do with appearances. As far as that is concerned, I think he raised his comments in an entirely appropriate way and he has a point. Social Security",87
281,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Can the minister advise the House what action is being taken by the Department of Social Security to make sure that only people who genuinely qualify for social security payments are able to be paid?,87
282,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and for the opportunity to acquaint the House with the latest statistics on the department's compliance activity for the 1994-95 year. It is well known amongst those who know about these things that since the mid-1980s the government has undertaken a very wide range of activities to tighten our social security system and to restore the integrity of a system which, according to an international expert from Harvard University, Professor Weatherley, was at that time-in the mid-1980s-pretty lax in ensuring that payments went only to those who were entitled to receive them. His conclusion as of 1993 was that the integrity of the system had been, as a result of government actions, essentially repaired. In fact, what we do by way of compliance is now recognised as being of world leading standard in many respects. For example, I have just returned from the United States. In the course of that visit, I spoke to AT&T and visited their headquarters. They provide us with the parallel high capacity computing facilities we use in data matching. They told me that our operation here in the Department of Social Security is their world reference site-not only in terms of its technical aspects but also in terms of the legislative framework and the methods we have used to deal with the privacy aspects and so forth. It is a very good operation and is recognised as such by those who have expertise in the field. Data matching is now a significant source of savings to the government. It saves us around $5.4 million per fortnight. This is around $140 million per year. If the opposition were serious about achieving a tightening of fiscal policy, you would think they would support that. Have they been supportive? No. We get this constant carping. We do not get clear commitments from them to maintain the operation of this program, which needs to be legislatively renewed at the end of this year. What do we get from them? Uncertainty, inaccurate criticism and ill-informed criticism. This is how they approach the need to ensure the integrity of government programs. Data matching is a significant part of what we do, but it is only a component of our compliance activities. Overall, we have 93 mobile review teams that visit various areas and do intensive reviews of what is going on. We have computerised processes at the point of application to ensure that people do not have multiple identities and other such things. We regularly review people on various payments to ensure that their circumstances are as they claimed. People who are getting unemployment payments, of course, are required to meet pretty stringent requirements. They have to show that they are available for work, that they are actively seeking work and that they are actively taking steps to improve their availability for work. The net effect of these activities is very substantial. In the 1994-95 year, the department did 2.1 million reviews, and much of that was generated by data matching. As a result of that, there were 127,000 cancellations and 60,000 reductions. Also, I might say that some 29,000 people had their payments increased. So it is not purely a one-way street here. What we are on about is not cutting people's benefits but ensuring that people receive their correct benefits. On the one hand, we do not want them to rort the system but, on the other hand, we do not want them to get less than they are entitled to. It is a great success and is recognised as such. It is an area where we are increasingly getting into the business of consulting with others throughout the world because of the recognised nature of our expertise in this area. Marks Royal Commission",87
283,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister, and I ask him to give us a straightforward yes or no answer. Do you support the cowardly and unwarranted personal attack on a woman, the senior counsel assisting the royal commission, because she is related by marriage to Senator Vanstone and, in particular, do you support the words used by Senator Evans that 'the family that preys together stays together'? Yes or no?",88
284,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can ask the questions as you choose and I will answer them as I choose-thank you very much. As far as I am concerned, I believe that the situation in terms of its appearance and not in terms of Ms Vanstone represents a grave problemMr MCGauran-Evans did.",88
285,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Gippsland did not ask the question.,88
286,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,as far as this royal commission is concerned. Mr MCGauran-Yes or no.,89
287,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not going to give you yes or no answers, my friend. You have the privilege to ask lengthy and tendentious questions and 1 will choose to respond with the same privilege, thank you very much. Let me go to these statements because these views of David Smith sum up my views on this matter exactly. Since you have asked for my views, I shall express them. Smith was being interviewed by MCNamara and the transcript goes this way: ... Later he told John MCNamara that counsel assisting the Commission, Adelaide QC Ann Vanstone, should consider withdrawing from the inquiry. Mrs Vanstone is the sister-in-law of the Shadow Attorney-General, Senator Amanda Vanstone. SMITH: I don't think in this situation-where the person responsible for deciding the order of witnesses, what witnesses are called, and what questions are asked-has such a close connection to someone in the Federal political arenaMCNAMARA: So you're concerned about the appearance of propriety? SMITH: There are a number of issues like that, that have concerned me about some elements of the Commission ... MCNAMARA: Ann Vanstone is an Adelaide QC. She's well respected I understand in Adelaide legal circles. What is wrong with her appearing in this Commission as one of her colleagues did, Brian Martin QC from Adelaide, doing the WA Inc. Royal Commission as it was called? SMITH: I know nothing about Mrs Vanstone's qualifications or background, but I think when you're handling such a sensitive political issue, there really has to be a rule that justice has to be seen to be done. I just put it to you, that if the sister-in-law of one of the parties was involved in deciding what order witnesses were called and what questions were asked of those witnesses-that people might is that appropriate? In my view it's not. Even if you felt that she could accept the appointment initially, I actually believe that when the public statements started to emanate from her sister-in-Iawthat is, Senator Vanstoneshe should have either told her sister-in-law to pull her head in, or she should have reconsidered her position. That was David Smith's position, and 1 agree absolutely with David Smith's position. There are a number of problems emerging with the conduct ofMr Tim Fischer-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the question from the member for Flinders was quite specific. It related to the attack by Gareth Evans and his use of a term 'the family that preys'-and he then spelt it out for Hansard as p-r-e-y-s in a very grubby way. The minister has deliberately breached standing order 145 with his lengthy answer on unrelated matters to the specificity of the question and I ask that he be directed to come back to the question.",89
288,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister was asked a question in respect of matters that have been canvassed in this place. As 1I have always said here, the chair is limited in its ability to direct ministers to be specific in a way that I am sure we would all like. Mr Abbott-Point of order, Mr Speaker. The House of Representatives Practice says that, if the standing orders are silent or do not place a limitation on the Speaker, the Speaker should assume the authority to make any ruling or decision that the Speaker thinks is appropriate. So you have perfect authority to tell the minister to be relevant.",89
289,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have said that the minister is canvassing issues that have been raised in this place in the course of this debate. There is some validity in the comment of the honourable member for Warringah, as indeed there was in that of the Leader of the National Party. 1 hope that all ministers endeavour to be relevant to some extent in their responses.",89
290,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think I am being entirely relevant on this matter. 1 was asked a series of questions as to what my opinion is on Senator Vanstone's situationMr MCGauran-No, on Gareth Evans.",89
291,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On Gareth Evans's opinion of it-and I am answering them in the way that 1 see fit, and they go right to the nub of the issues involved here. There is a series of problems now in the way in which this royal commission has been presented, which makes it even more important that the position of propriety appears to be done as opposed to simply being done. That goes to the way in which witnesses have been called, as David Smith said. For example, we have yet to hear from the people who drafted the petition. It is now two months into the royal commission. One would have thought that a few facts would have been established to start off with-so much so that Mr Halden, one of the principal persons, has finally had to go and present his evidence to the Bulletin. To get a hearing for his evidence, he has to put it in the Bulletin. Of course, a read of that evidence casts an awful lot of things in a very different light. He has not been able to get himself on to be heard. We have heard all this nonsense about, 'They will be called.' Don't you know that at a royal commission you don't get one shot at witnesses. You can come in persistently through the period of a royal commission. You can be recalled. They can have you on day one, on day 20 and on day 55 if they want. So it would have been entirely possible-and appropriate, I would say-for them to have had first up the people who put in place the petition. It has not actually been factually established before the commission that there was a petition, because no-one who has been associated with it has actually gone in and said there was-and we are now into about the second month of the commission. So there is a problem for people who look at the processes of this royal commission, and the problem goes, of course, to the original political origins of it, rightly described by Laurie Oakes this morning as outrageous. Yesterday Gerard Henderson pointed out with absolute clarity that this is the sort of commission that Malcolm Fraser rejected outright when he was invited to go down this particular course. He had a bit of a sense of propriety around the place, before the Liberal Party descended. So the question that comes in this highly politically charged atmosphere is: what do you do to have a decent regime of political propriety associated with it in so far as you can go? I think that David Smith's questioning of that, and I think Senator Evans's questioning of that, is entirely appropriate. Asbestos Related Diseases",89
292,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations. Can the Minister advise the House what the government is doing about the pain and suffering of those workers afflicted with asbestos related diseases?,90
293,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. The government is taking very seriously the plight of those workers who do suffer from asbestos related diseases. There are something like 1,000 to 1,500 lung cancer deaths notified per year that are due mainly or partly to asbestos exposure. Indeed, the trend in mesothelioma notifications over the last decade is that these have increased. In 1994, there were 345 notifications nationally. The cost of this, in terms of absenteeism and suffering, is almost $1 million a year, which does not take into account the personal nature of the cost of that suffering-the human cost involved. I am pleased to say that the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, of which the Commonwealth and the states are a part, has agreed to establish a national asbestos disease research foundation which we hope to have under way by May 1996. The foundation will focus on the development of more effective treatment and management of those who have been exposed to asbestos in the workplace. The outcomes of the foundation will be effective measures to reduce future risks of these asbestos related diseases among those individuals who have had significant exposure. I also indicate to the House that I am currently reviewing the occupational exposure standards of those now working with asbestos with a view to tightening those standards. In addition, we hope that the foundation will improve effective treatment for sufferers and, where a cure unfortunately cannot be achieved, implement measures to prolong and improve the quality of life of those sufferers. Industry, government, unions and the National Health and Medical Research Council are all involved in this. It will have a clear emphasis on worker health and safety. On behalf of those workers suffering from these diseases, I wish the foundation well in its work and much success. Marks Royal Commission",90
294,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Deputy Prime Minister, do you agree with your Labor colleague in Western Australia, Jim MCGinty, who said this week: People who pretend that they will ignore the findings of the commission or place no weight on them whatsoever, quite frankly are being quite foolish. Further, do you agree with his view when he said: So anyone who's suggesting that those findings can be simply ignored, I think are completely wrong. Mr BEAZLEYI think the conduct of the royal commission, its fairness, the basis on which it was set up, ultimately all go to what you ought to think about any particular ruling or finding they might make at the end of the day. 1 think that is absolutely appropriate. You are a National Party member; did you think it was okay when a royal commission came out and criticised the handling by Mr Nixon of the meat substitution case? Did you think it was appropriate that he continued in office after that was brought down with an adverse finding against him? 1 do not think so. Mr Neville- Mr Speaker, 1 raise a point of order. My question was not whether or not Peter Nixon mayor may not have done Lawrence something. My question was: did the Deputy Prime Minster agree with his colleague in its Western Australia who made those two statements?",91
295,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime pinning Minister is responding to the question that was put to him.,91
296,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He has asked exactly the same question again and 1I have put one which 1 thought was of some relevance back to him, given where he is coming from. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I am reluctant raise this point of order, but by constantly posing rhetorical questions like this the Deputy Prime Minister is making a mockery of question time. 1 say to you that you do have the power, under House of Representaworks tives Practice, under the eXlstmg standing orders, and I ask you please, for the respect of this place, to call him to order.",91
297,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister was asked a question and he is responding to the question that was put to him.,91
298,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Absolutely. You have asked me a question about the extent to which you should have regard to findings of a commission-absolutely. I am starting with an example of the extent to which your party, when it was last in office-in fact, in its last term of office-had regard to the findings of a royal commissioner; and that was to give it the flick. That was the view that was held by yourselves at the time as to how that particular royal commissioner's findings ought to be dealt with. Obviously, if you are going to make judgments about any particular set of findings by any particular body-by a royal commission or anything else-you have regard to the context in which they have been set, the conduct and the terms of reference. We have raised persistently in this place the gravest fears about this royal commission: the narrowness and pointed nature of its terms of reference; the way in which witnesses have been called before it; the minister's inability, despite her repeated efforts, to get before it to present her evidence; the treatment of Carmen in that regard by the unwillingness of those who have been directly involved with presentation to get her up at an early stage; and the fact that there has been no other shonkier set of political circumstances underany royal commission created anywhere in the Commonwealth of Australia in living memory. And you ask us to suspend judgment on the basis of all of that! Great Eastern Highway",91
299,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to addressed to the Minister for Transport. 1 refer the minister to a number of recent tragic fatal accidents on the Great Eastern Highway near Perth. Can the minister advise the House whether it is intended to bring forward safety on that section of the Great Eastern Highway under the three-year national highway program?,91
300,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am certainly aware of the critical importance of addressing safety issues-the issues that have been raised again here this afternoon by the honourable member for Perth, who has persistently campaigned for action in respect of these problems and who organised my visit to inspect some of these sites following that tragic accident last year at Greenmount Hill-actually, it was on New Year's Eve 1993-when we had the chance to inspect the Great Eastern Highway and then, of course, to initiate a study into the options for improving conditions on that notorious piece of road. In response to that study, the Commonwealth as a matter of urgency committed some $2.5 million to safety works on the Great Eastern Highway. There can be no doubt today that, of all of the new roadworks in Western Australia, further safety works on that section of road need to be the No. 1 priority. It is a pity that the Western Australian roads minister, Mr Charlton, does not share that view--or he certainly did not when he presented to me his wish list of projects for which he wanted Commonwealth funding to be considered. That was a wish list that had no prioritisation whatsoever, and which included just about every conceivable project in the state. At the federal level, we are going to be far more serious about road funding than that. The Commonwealth is intent on taking a sensible approach to assessing on a national basis the road projects in each state. As part of that process, I can announce today a $187 million road funding package, to be spread over the next three years, for Western Australia's national highways. That program will include further vital safety works on the Great Eastern Highway. The federal government will spend $5.7 million on a dual carriageway between Roe Highway and Scott Street at Greenmount. I can indicate to the House that the bulldozers will be on the job this year and the work will be finished in 1997. This year we will also start work on the treacherous lake section of the highway, that is, the section between Old Northam Road and Linley Valley, with a $4.2 million allocation for widening and reconstruction works in that location. On top of that, the federal government has allocated another $10 million to new works on the Western Australian national highway, works which will involve duplications, bridge construction and planning studies, all of which will result in greatly improved road conditions. That is almost $21 million worth of new road projects in Western Australia under this program. You can add to that $166 million over the next three years from the Commonwealth for maintenance and for major rehabilitation works on Western Australia's national highway network. This year Western Australia will receive $67 million. That is the second highest allocation ever given to the state under the national highway program. In fact, it was exceeded in only one year, and that was the result of a huge top-up from the One Nation program funding. That aside, this is the highest allocation ever. On top of that, we are handing over another $97.8 million in untied road funds this year alone to provide aid to Western Australia's state roads and local roads. I hope Mr Charlton and the Western Australian government now find the time to properly consider how to spend that allocation and to get on and build the works with great efficiency. Australian National Line",92
301,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Transport. Can the minister explain just what it is that the $300,000plus-for two days worth of work per weekchairman of the board of ANL and his quarter of a million dollar colleagues have done to earn their money, when ANL has continued to lose money at a consistent rate and its value has been seriously eroded, to the point where it now seems likely that they will have made the minister's own judgment-that you cannot even give it away--come true? Isn't it true that the $3,000 a day consultancies for his mate Neville Wran and the $2,500 a day consultancies for the other two boardroom mates, which now amount to $816,000 or an absurd 16 per cent of the line's reported current worth, have benefited no-one but the mates themselves?",92
302,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Every once in a while you get a real good gift, and this question is a gift from the shadow minister to me. This question gives me an opportunity to rebut some of the misinformation that he and his colleagues have been spreading about the remuneration of N.K. WranMr MCGauran-Is it higher?",93
303,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Drder! I warn the member for Gippsland.,93
304,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and his colleague Mr Turnbull in their capacity as directors of the company ANL. I start by saying that the remuneration arrangements in respect of both gentlemen were not set by me and were not set by this government but were set by the independent Remuneration Tribunal. Rather than the shadow minister suggesting that they have been in receipt of almost a million dollars, as he has consistently and persistently stated, he ought to admit the fact that they have received in this one year of work not nearly a million dollarsMr Tim Fischer-For part-time work.",93
305,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will tell you a bit about that work in a minute, because I have been asked this gift of a question. They have received $574,000. That's right. Exactly.",93
306,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,93
307,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will just wait for a moment. Those on my left! The member for Hume is trying to listen to this response; he has an MPI pending.,93
308,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is in respect of a company that has been losing an average of $23 million every year for the past five years. N.K. Wran and his colleague Mr Turnbull have had the very difficult task of tackling those recurrent losses. Those recurrent losses now amount to $115 million over five years in operational terms. You say to me that there is something wrong with us finding the best consultants to turn this around. I would rather spend half a million dollars to fix a $23 million problem than allow it to go on. Mr Speaker, I will tell you the first of a number of measures undertaken by the board-that is, the Wran board-since it was appointed one year ago. The first thing it did was to successfully negotiate the sale of ANL's shareholding in Australian Stevedores for the sum of $28 million. Mr MCGauran-That was the easy bit.",93
309,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was not an easy bit. Indeed, it was the same amount that Howard Smith received for its shares. Only last week the Auditor-General indicated that it was an entirely reasonable outcome. That was action taken by them which prevented the government from being forced to put in $275 million in total exposure as a result of having to acquire the other three-quarters of Australian Stevedores. That was the first bit of good work undertaken by Mr Wran and Mr Turnbull. The next bit of good work they undertook was to wind up joint ventures with Howard Smith and Union Shipping, which they have also done this year. I will tell you what else they have done. The next bit of good work was to buyout Howard Smith's shares of the Mesco container park and Conaust's shares of the Liner transcontainer rail freight business. That is the next bit of good work they have done. The next thing they did was to wind up ANL's technology division. It is not as if they have been sitting on their hands; they have done all this. They have also closed a number of ANL's overseas offices and they have rationalised ANL's head office operations. Mr MCGauran-Anyone could do that.",93
310,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, you did not do it when you were in power. You left ANL in a disgraceful condition where this government had to inject $160 million in capital to keep the line afloat. You persistently and consistently avoided making the hard decisions that this government is addressing as a result of the processes that we have put in place-the processes of appointing a new board to undertake these steps, the processes of tackling the endemic loss-making at ANL and the sorts of processes that you squibbed right through the 1970s and right into the early 1980s, and you know it. You are the guilty men as far as ANL is concerned. All of those measures that I have outlined to the House in this little gift of a question have helped to rationalise ANL's position and rationalise what is a very complex structure that existed at that company and to reduce the losses to taxpayers incurred by the company. The most important thing that Neville Wran and his colleague have done has ben to successfully negotiate a potential sale of this company to P&O, which gives the government the option-which we are considering at the moment-of either sale and exit or restructure. That is a very serious question before the government at this point. Should we decide to go down the first path, we have the benefit of a very sound proposal which has been negotiated by Neville Wran and Mr Turnbull. All of that for a little over half a million dollars and 12 monthsMr MCGauran-What about the allowances?",93
311,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is the lot; that is it. Mr MCGauran-Travel allowances?,94
312,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Should they have paid their air fares? Should they be denied the same overnight allowance that you get when you are in Canberra? The fact is that this is the sum total of their remuneration. If through that process they help us tum around a lossmaker with $115 million of operational losses-and they do all that for half a million dollars-I say it is very good value indeed. Thank you for the gift. National Training Reform Agenda,94
313,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I understand that the Committee for Economic Development of Australia has conducted a review of the national training reform agenda. Can the minister advise the House what the review found and, in particular, what it identified as significant changes in Australia's vocational education and training system?",94
314,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The national training reforms are being addressed on behalf of all state, territory and Commonwealth governments by the Australian National Training Authority, which has a board of directors from industry. Therefore, the government welcomes business bodies such as CEDA using their resources to see how the national training reforms are working and offering constructive views on improving them. CEDA is overwhelmingly supportive of the directions of the reforms. In a report arising from its review, CEDA has praised the government for developing national competency standards across a wide range of industries, creating accredited training in areas which previously had none, successfully implementing more than 100 AVTS pilots, developing a national core curriculum for schools, improving links between schools, TAPE and industry, gaining acceptance of the national training wage and developing innovative regional arrangements between schools, industries and training institutes aimed at meeting local needs. That report of CEDA's is based on seminars which began in March of last year. Of course, much more has been achieved in the 18 months since then. Many of the improvements which the CEDA report suggests have already been implemented. For example, state and Commonwealth ministers have already agreed to actions which will increase industry's involvement in training by simplifying structures, streamlining arrangements and reducing red tape. This means that industry will have more say in the training system and best practice bodies within an industry will be able to endorse competency standards directly. Accreditation arrangements for courses are also being streamlined to speed up approvals. For instance, the creation of the Standards and Curriculum Council has simplified national training structures. Industry will be better served through improved coordination of standards, curriculum and assessment through the council. All governments in Australia have agreed that industry'S training needs will be met more effectively through a more diverse and open training market, and a choice of training providers is being introduced progressively around the country. Training reform is already producing significant dividends for employers and, more importantly, for our young people. There is still more to do. This government, in partnership with industry, is determined to make further improvements to the vocational education and training system to better provide a work force which has the skills required in a contemporary and competitive economy. Waterfront Reform",94
315,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. How can the minister justify his statement that 'the front reform program has been a huge success' when the benchmark report of the Bureau of Industry Economics-this is the report you have been hiding-on the waterfront states that waterfront charges for containers in Australia are considerably higher than most of the surveyed overseas ports in New Zealand, Asia and Europe. It also says that crane rates for the best performing Australian container terminal are equivalent to some of the poorest performances in Europe. It also says that it generally takes 50 per cent to 100 per cent longer to unload and load a container ship in Australia than it does in comparable overseas ports. It also says that most overseas ports have moved ahead, while Australia has stepped backwards. When will you tell the truth about the failure of Australia's waterfront reform program and the $440 million that has been wasted on it?",95
316,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, after my last answer you would have thought that the honourable member could have got up and admitted and apologised to the House for telling an untruth about Neville Wran, claiming that he received",95
317,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will withdraw that imputation on the reputation of the honourable member.,95
318,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly withdraw. I would have thought he would have apologised to the House for the manner in which he has been slurring the character of N.K. Wran, by suggesting he receives an amount almost double what he has received. He would not admit the truth himself and he would not take this opportunity to apologise. Not on your nelly! There is shortly in this House to be an MPI debate on this very subject. We will have a chance then to run through this matter at some length, so I will not delay the House at this stage other than to say I will tell those opposite why I believe the reforms of this government are a considerable achievement and why they are a very good basis for continuing the task and the work that we have set ourselves-the work and the task that opposition members always ducked when they were in power. Let me remind the House of waterthe benefits to all shippers of the WlRA process-benefits which the BTCE indicated in 1993 totalledMr Sharp-What about the report in 1994?",95
319,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Excuse me. Benefits to shippers totalled $276 million, of which $200 million accrued to Australian interests. That was for that year alone. That is an annual figure which goes on year after year. I remind the House that we have reduced the work force by 57 per cent. That is the achievement of this government. You did nothing about it. Direct employment of the labour force was achieved for the first time with enterprise bargains in place-the sorts of processes that you always squibbed, always ducked. There is a 75 per cent reduction in shipping time lost through industrial disputes. That is the achievement of this government. These are the facts of waterfront reform. There has been an 88 per cent reduction in time lost through accidents-an 88 per cent time lost in accidents reduction. There has been an increase in container rate productivity by 50 per cent and in net ship working rates by 64 per cent. These are the facts of the Australian waterfront. Mr Sharp-Why don't you release the later report of the BTCE?",95
320,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All the reports are in the public arena. There was a 24 per cent reduction in stevedoring prices between 1990 and 1993, a 45 per cent reduction in ship turnaround time and a container rate availability improvement, down from between 10 and 21 days to between five and seven days-a process that was funded by this government to the tune of $165 million. These are the reforms of this government, and these are the reforms that are paying off. The fact is that the five-port average shows a very considerable improvement since 1989 through to March of this year. As revealed in the report, there has been a 48.5 per cent increase in the five-port average. Let me repeat the figures for the crane rate: Brisbane, December 1989, 13.3, March 1995, 18.4, up 38.3 per cent; Sydney, December 1989, 13.3, March 1995, 18.9, up 42.1 per cent; Melbourne, December 1989, 12.4, March 1995, 20.8, up 70.5 per cent; Adelaide, December 1989, 15.8, March 1995,21.5, up 36 per cent; and Fremantle, December 1989, 14, March 1995, 20.2, up 44.2 per cent. The five-port average for December 1989 was 13.4 and in March 1995, 19.9-up 48.5 per cent. We have never said that there is still not a long way to go, but you ought to give credit where it is due and you ought to stop misleading the Australian people in pretending that none of this tremendous reform-the reform championed by this government, the reform that you always squibbed and ducked-has not been very successful.",95
321,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Privilege",96
322,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, now that the government, by use of its numbers, has refused you the right to defend your integrity before the appropriate tribunal-that is, the Privileges Committee-will you personally demand that right or the establishment of some other independent inquiry to allow you to properly present your case in the interests of clearing your name and re-establishing the integrity which is fundamental to the conduct of your office?",96

That matter has been canvassed in debate. The House has taken a decision on that, and that is where the matter stands as far as I am concerned. Unparliamentary Language",96
324,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I asked you on Monday whether or not you would uphold the required parliamentary standards when the Prime Minister in fact and in effect repeatedly called someone a liar in this House. You replied that there were forms by which members so impugned could deal with the matter. I used one of those forms on the adjournment debate last Thursday, and the Prime Minister has continued to use such words about me since. Today the member for Gippsland used the word 'lie'-at seven minutes past 12. Instantly you made him withdraw. I noticed you made the Minister for Transport do the same with the use of the word 'untruth'. On the surface of it, the dichotomy between those two sets of circumstances looks different.",96

330,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The point of order goes to the question. Generally speaking, questions to the Speaker are questions that go to the arrangements of the House, if you,like. If you want to query a Speaker's ruling on any particular matter, the point of time at which it is appropriate for a querying of it is at the point of time the offence occurs. If you decide that you will accumulate a set of objections, the only way in which you can legitimately deal with that is with some sort of motion in relation to the chair. Mr Andrews-Can't the Speaker speak for himself?",96

332,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"My question is quite clear. It is whether you will in the future enforce the use of proper parliamentary language, which is what you told me on Monday should happen in this place, evenhandedly and immediately whenever such unparliamentary remarks are made. Can we get an undertaking",97

357,Mr SINCLAIR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"On page 16 of the Daily Commercial News of Friday, 25 August 1995, an article was written by John Spiers, for whom I have a great regard and who is the editor of trade and logistics for the paper. There is reference in that article to the Australian National Line and to the autobiography of a great Australian, Sir John Williams, entitled So ends this day. In that comment Sir John referred to my own direction to him. I want to quote Spiers's point. He said: Sir John named Ian Sinclair as the later coalition transport minister who informed him that instead of putting commercial considerations first, ANL was to become an instrument of government policy. In fact, I told Sir John that it was important he put, as I said at the time, the commercial considerations of ANL first and not his own. At that stage he ran Fleetways and together with his son had a monopoly of land transport to ANL. I told him then, as I publicly said after his autobiography was published, that it was inappropriate for hiw as chairman, although he was a very good chief executive of ANL, to have a conflict of interest between having a monopoly of land transport services to ANL's base in various ports around Australia and, at the same time, being chairman of a major national operation. He continues to suggest that the decline of ANL has been relatively constant ever since. While this was 26 years ago, at the time. I was last minister the ANL actually operated profitably. That is in marked contrast to the $23 million a year it has been losing since the present minister has been in charge. NA",97

Debate (on motion by Mr Tim Fischer) adjourned. NA Waterfront Reform",98
359,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's complete failure to reform the Australian waterfront. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",98
360,Mr SHARP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Just a few moments ago in the House during question time the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) defended the waterfront reform process undertaken by his government, using statistics that came from the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics report into the waterfront performance of Australia that was concluded at the end of 1993. It was a very interesting comparison for the minister to use. Do you know that the latest report by the BTCE, which was presented in December last year, has yet to be made public? That document has been going backwards and forwards between the BTCE and the minister's office, with the minister's request that it be rewritten. It has been rewritten several times. It has been sitting on your desk now for the last four months. Why don't you release that document so that we can see what the BTCE had to say about waterfront reform in Australia as of that time? I will give you a reason why the minister has been trying to keep that one under wraps. It goes in the report done by the Bureau of Industry Economics which has yet to be released publicly. It was supposed to be released last week, yet this government decided not to release it but to hide it. We have a copy of it here. I will give you an insight into why the minister chose to use out-of-date figures. It is in the BIB report into Australia's waterfront performance. Page 18 of the executive summary says: Recent declines in container stevedoring ty has resulted in Australia falling well behind similarly sized overseas ports. If you go to page 24 of the BIB report, which has not been made public but should have been made public by now, you will see that it says: However, rather than witnessing progress in waterfront productivity, the past year has seen some serious setbacks in crane rates. It goes on to say: The overall five port average fell between September 1993 and December 1994. Page 18 of the BIB report refers to the national transport planning task force document that was concluded at the end of last year. It states: Users and operators also noted recent significant declines in workplace performance and questioned whether present levels of competition were sufficient to maintain the pressure for continuing improvement. All of those statements in the BIB report, which is yet to be tabled, prove the reason why this government is choosing to use outof-date figures to support its claim, which it repeats continually, that waterfront reform in Australia under this government has been a huge success. If you listened to the anecdotes of the people who use the waterfront you will know, as do I and the people who wrote the international benchmarking waterfront 1995 report in the Bureau of Industry Economics, that waterfront reform in Australia has not been the success that this government has been crowing it is. For example, the report says: In regard to container productivity, most overseas ports have moved ahead while Australia has stepped backwards. Hardly what you would call an endorsement of waterfront reform under this government. It also says: Waterfront charges for containers in Australia are considerably higher than most of the surveyed ports in New Zealand, Asia and Europe. It also goes on to say: Crane rates at the best performing container terminals is equivalent to some of the poorest productivi- performances in Europe. On the same page it also goes on to say: . .. it generally takes 50 to 100% longer to unload and load a container ship in Australia as it does in a comparable overseas port. On the next page it goes on to say: Indeed, the lowest charges in Australia are equivalent to the more expensive ports on the West Coast of North America. This is what the latest review of Australia's waterfront performance has to say about the government's waterfront reform program. This analysis has not been done by me or by the Minister for Transport; it has been done by the government's own body-a disinterested party, you might say-that has expert analysis available to it to provide us with an expert judgment as to the performance of the Australian waterfront. Any reasonable person who read this BIB document, any person who read and heard the concerns that are coming from people using the Australian waterfront, will not agree with the statement that this minister has been repeating over and over again. The best way to summarise what he has been saying is to read a press release he put out on 18 August this year, only a couple of weeks ago, in which he said: The waterfront reform program has been a huge success. Anybody reading the BIB report, anybody speaking to people who are users of our Australian waterfront, will say that it has not been a great success. Our Australian waterfront does not perform as well as it ought to. Our Australian waterfront in recent times has been going backwards. Our Australian waterfront does not make Australia competitive. Our Australian waterfront has seen an enormous amount of money-$440 million of Australians' money-being poured down the throat of the Maritime Union of Australia, those wharfies who took their redundancy package during the waterfront reform process. We are not talking about tens of thousand.' of wharfies; we are talking about 4,000-odd wharfies who took a redundancy package topped up as a result of this government's agreement-$440 million worth of redundancies to top off these people's retirement packages; yet we continue to get, coming from this government, a crowing of what they have achieved. I put to the House today, and I am sure many people will agree with me, that the way this government has been portraying its success in waterfront reform in this country has been a misrepresentation of the truth and that it has not been the case. The truth of it is that we have wasted an ellormous amount of money. Indeed, you might say that the waterfront reform program under this government has been a giant con, because the people who have benefited have been the wharfies who picked up the $440 million, those retiring wharfies, not the people of Australia who paid that money out. In case you are thinking of it, do not all sorry for those wharfies who did not pick up their retirement package-this generous redundancy that the government endorsed and which you and I, as taxpayers, have paid for-because those people who remain on the waterfront have plenty of good reasons for staying there. Their Labor mates in government here in Canberra made sure that not only were those retiring people going to get a lot of money but also there would be enough room at the trough for those who remained on the waterfront to get their noses in too. From the time waterfront reform started to the time it concluded and up to today, the wage of a waterside worker has virtually doubled. When waterfront reform started, according to Conaust, a grade 4 wharfie, an average wharfie, was earning $34,000 a year. As at the beginning of this year, the same grade of wharfie was earning $75,000 a year.",98
361,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,How much?,100
362,Mr SHARP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"From $34,000 before this government allegedly reformed the waterfront to $75,000 today. So do not feel sorry for the people who remain. Do not say, 'Isn't it a pity they missed out on the big $100,000 redundancy package.' The people who stayed got a good deal too. Do not think that those wharfies who made the supreme sacrifice and offered to retire and take the redundancy package have been left out of the whole business. Many of them are back on the waterfront today, working as casuals. What a very nice repatriation program this government has for its Labor mates who have to make a small sacrifice for the national cause. You can see that an enormous amount of money has been paid out, whether it be to retiring wharfies or to those who continue to be employed on the waterfront. But if you look at the BIE paper, which this government will not release, you can see that we have not got any value out of that money at all. With all of the money and all of the youbeaut, one-off rorted deals that this government has given the waterside workers and their now amalgamated union, the Maritime Union of Australia, you would think that the feel at MUA would think that the government was pretty good and would be doing the right thing by it. But even at this very moment we are in the process of putting through a bill that will pay $19 million worth of seafarers' PAYE tax bills for them-a $19 million grant to pay for the seafarers' PAYE tax billl You do not see Qantas employees getting their taxes paid by the government through a grant, yet the MUA and their members get that. It has been an absolutely ripper deal that this government has given those people in the MUA. But even now they are talking about going on strike. That deal of $19 million was to pay for the arrangements agreed to to settle the last strike just on 12 months ago. Now we are shaping up for another strike because the MUA does not like the colour of P&O's money. But you can rest assured, as you heard today from the minister, that the minister's old mate Neville Wran does like the colour of the government's money. And a couple of his other mates do too. Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull were put on the board of ANL. In order to put them there the entire board of ANL had to be sacked without explanation-no notice, bang, just gone-with Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and so on installed. Mates of the minister. You might think that would be justifiable if these so-called mates had any experience of running a shipping company. But did they have any experience of running a shipping company? No, they did not. I dare say the only training that these people had was careering around Pittwater on the minister's own yacht. You can just picture it now. There is Lawrie and Malcolm and Neville, up on the deck of the minister's yacht",100
363,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member will use the correct titles.,101
364,Mr SHARP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am sorry. There is the Minister for Transport and his mates, Neville and Malcolm, up on the deck of the minister's yacht, with a glass of French bubbly in one hand, doing the patriotic thing, letting the Grange breathe before drinking it. You can just picture them there, with Lawrie saying, 'Look, boys, you don't need to know anything about running a shipping company. Just watch what I do as I career around the harbour here, ""'banging into Kay Cottee' s yacht and causing alarm amongst all the recreational yachtsmen on the weekend. Just watch what I do.' Well, they did, and as a result poor old ANL lost $20 million-odd since they took charge of it. Poor old ANL's value has dropped from what it was reported to be when they took charge of it, around $30 million, to what it is reported to be today, between $4 million and $5 million. With the expertise that you could say these people-Malcolm and Neville-had, which is stitching up a deal, you might have thought that the one thing they could have done was to ensure they had plenty of bidders in there for the damn thing. When we started the bidding process for ANL there were three bidders. Enter our friends and what do we end up with? One bidder; the other two dropped out. So you can hardly say that their expertise millionwas of any great value or that the money that was paid to them was of any great value to the taxpayer. It is quite clear that the BIE's analysis of the government's performance in the maritime industry proves the point that this government has been misleading us about the performance of the waterfront. We had a lot of debate this morning in the House about how important it is for people to tell the truth and not misrepresent things in the parliament. But the BIB proves the point that we have been misled in matters spoken of in this House on occasions in the past. The waterfront report proves how incompetent this government is when it gets down to doing something in any detail related to a business. It proves that this government has not told us the truth. It proves how grossly irresponsible this government is with the public's money. It proves how generous this government can be to their mates, whether they are the wharfies, the seamen, Neville Wran or anybody else. It just proves how generous this government can be. I think we can conclude this MPI today by remaking the points that this government's waterfront reform program has been proven by the BIE's report to have failed and that the $440 million expended on it has been wasted. The BIE report, which the government refuses to this day to release, proves to us that this government no longer deserves to be at the helm.",101
365,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (5.07 p.m.)-What a pathetic little effort we have had this afternoon from the member for Hume (Mr Sharp). He has been serving up to the parliament the same old tired, worn out rhetoric, the same story we have heard again and again. Here he is in the House today with his set piece, trotting out this motley collection of distortions, halftruths and untruths. He has the hide to talk about telling the truth when this very day, here in the House, he has been responsible for two absolute untruths. The first was the allegation that Neville Wran has received close to $1 Mr Sharp-When did I say that?",101
366,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You have been saying it for months. He received $300,000. Secondly, he has just asserted that members of the MUA are the beneficiaries of $19 millior by way of tax relief when he knows full well that the members of the MUA do not receive one penny of that. It goes to the ship owners; not one penny of it goes to members of the MUA. But any half-truth, any untruth, is good enough for the member. Today we have seen his trained monkey speech, as I call it. It is the one he probably mumbles in his sleep each night. You can just picture the scene in the Sharp residence: his wife poking him in the ribs saying, 'Shut up, John, I've heard it all before. I've heard it 100 times. It even bores the sheep.' It is a case of tedious repetition. You must go to bed with it and get up in the morning with it. It would bore anyone, quite frankly, because it is always long on allegations, long on conspiracies, long on half-truths and untruths, long on anecdotes but very short on concrete policy for waterfront reform. That is the great difference between our government and the opposition when it comes to micro-economic reform. We are the doers. We are the ones who go and do the job. We are the ones who make it happen. It is our government which has been responsible for all of the significant steps in reform on the waterfront and all of the significant steps in improving productivity. You have to ask yourself: what did the coalition ever do to reform the waterfront during their long years in office? Absolutely nothing. Not a darn thing. The member for Hume has the gall to come into the House and talk about the government's record. This is from a party that achieved nothing in government and left the waterfront in an absolutely disgraceful state. Yet again the member for Hume seems to have conveniently forgotten what was achieved during the three years of the WIRA program. Let me, once again, in these few minutes available to me, remind him of those achievements. There was a 57 per cent reduction in the size of the work force: 4,479 workers accepted retirement and redundancy packages4,479. For the first time ever, it was a labour force directly employed by stevedores rather than the old pooled arrangement. Our government replaced the 21 awards with one award-the stevedoring industry award. Multiskilling and a skills based career path were introduced in the waterside area for the first time. Shift times were made more flexible. Seven unions in the area have reduced down to three unions. This is a proud program of reform. Overtime worked by waterside workers is down by 25 per cent. The use of casualisation considerably increased. Enterprise bargaining was introduced for the first time-enterprise bargaining that resulted in agreements meeting many of the needs of the individual enterprises and the individual sites. There was an 88 per cent reduction, as I said in the House this afternoon, in time lost by accidents on the waterfront. There was also an increase in container crane rate productivity of 50 per cent and in net shipping working rates of 64 per cent. This is no mean feat, yet the honourable member walks into the House and says, 'Oh, there has been no reform at all,' and his MPI today asserts that there has been a complete failure in this area. There has been a 24 per cent reduction in container terminal charges. There has been a 45 per cent reduction in ship turnaround time, and we have seen container cargo availability improved. It is now at five to seven days, whereas it used to be at 10 to 21 days. I have indicated there is still some distance to go. The BTCE has indicated that in that first year it made the assessment that the bene'its which have flowed to the owners of non-bulk cargo, as a result of the program, totalled no less than $267 million. That is right-$267 million in 1993 alone. In relation to reforms affecting bulk cargo, grain and fertiliser, the constituents that the honourable member would pretend to represent saved a further $9 million during that one year alone. These are savings that accrue year in, year out. They are not a flash in the pan; they are not a one-off effort. They go on year after year, and they now amount to more than half a billion dollars of savirigs accumulated year after year. We have seen waterfront productivity improve greatly. We have seen it up very considerably from the start of that WIRA process. In December of 1993, the crane rate at Brisbane was, as I have said, 13.3 per cent. The figure at the end of March this yearwhich, I have to say, is a later figure than the figures that the honourable member has been quoting-was 18.4 per cent. The honourable member talks about our figures being out of date. The fact is that ours are the very latest figures, yet he suggests they have not been published. Mr Sharp-Why don't you release the BTCE report?",102
367,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The BTCE report comes out in the publication Waterline, which is due to come out in about two weeks time, and it will have all this laid out. It is not a matter for me to determine the timing of that-that is done by the BTCE. It will outline all of these crane rates. Let me tell you what it will say, and these are the March figures this year. The figure for Brisbane was 13.3 per cent at the end of March this year; it is up to 18.4-a 38.3 per cent increase in productivity, even though there was a 61 per cent increase in the containers handled there. There was a huge increase in volume, but at the same time there was a 38.3 per cent increase in productivity. That is the story that is replicated right around the other five ports in the work that has been undertaken by the BTCE. At Sydney, it was 13.3 per cent at the start of the program. It is now, in this year's March figures, 18.9 per cent-up by 42 per cent. Melbourne was 12.4 per cent at the start. In March this year it is 20.8-up by 70 per cent. In Adelaide, it was 15.8 per cent at the start. It is now, in March this year, 21.5 per centup by 36 per cent. In Fremantle, it was 14 per cent at the start. In March this year it was at 20.2 per cent-a 44 per cent increase. The BTCE will also, in its regular publication, be outlining the figures, not just for the March quarter but for the June quarter. What you will see from those figures will be very consistent with that March figure. So it is no good the honourable member coming in here and trying to mislead the House by not referring to the latest figures and by asserting that there has been no waterfront reform in Australia. The fact is that for the five ports, since the start of WIRA, the average crane rate has gone from 13.4 per cent up to 19.9 per cent. That is the five-port averageMr Sharp-This is March 1995?",103
368,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,March 1995-a 48.5 per cent increase. Mr Sharp-This is August.,103
369,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, but what are the figures it is referring to? They are not the March figures or the June figures for crane rates around the ports of Australia. You have to tell the truth. You cannot keep denying it. The fact is that the figures say it all. There has been a 48.5 per cent increase. Of course, during the same period, the total number of containers that were handled doubled. You cannot play with the truth in this business. These are the actual figures for rates around the ports. I would like to see it better still-I make no bones about that, no excuses for that-but at least the opposition could be fair dinkum enough to tell the truth, to admit that there has been some very successful reform to date. We have seen double the productivity with half of the work force, and we have seen ship turnaround times falling. The Department of Transport has been advising that in Sydney we have seen the figure drop from 44 hours in ship turnaround time in 1989 down to 25.9 hours for the March quarter of this year, 1995-a 59 per cent reduction. I would like to see it go lower still, but it is still a 59 per cent reduction. Having said all of this, the point I have been making again and again is that the industry has only completed half the tasks to date. There is still a long way to go. Peter Storey, the Managing Director of Patricks, put it this way last week: I think the minister's claim that waterfront reform has been a 'huge success' is right, but if people look at that as being the end of it then they're wrong, and I'm sure Mr Brereton doesn't think that's the end of it either. Let me say that I certainly do not think that is the end of it, not for one moment. That is why I said this three weeks ago at a meeting of the Australian Shipowners Association when I released their report: . . . the Government has established the framework for waterfront reform and the responsibility for pursuing world class performance now lies with the industry itself. They have to do the job. It is fair to say that there is some evidence that both the stevedores and the unions are pursuing that goal. They have to, because the rest of the world is not standing still, so they cannot stand still either. Last week we saw Conaust announce a very innovative EBA at its Botany Bay facility. Commencing in September this year, it aims to reduce berth occupancy there from 71 per cent to 40 per cent; to increase hourly handling rates by 75 per cent; and to introduce a 24-hour a day seven days a week operation. Work is already under way in adapting that plan for its operations in Brisbane, Melbourne and Fremantle. It would not hurt you to acknowledge some of this. That is the great effort being put in by Conaust. We are now seeing very significant new investment in equipment and technology from Conaust and Patricks-Conaust with $140 million, because they have satisfied themselves that the benefits of waterfront reform are real and sustainable. That is why they are putting in $140 million worth of private sector money. Sydney gets two new cranes, six rubber tied gantry cranes and a more extensive hard stand. Melbourne gets two new cranes, ten straddles and a replacement hard stand. Last week Conaust announced compliance with Australia's quality assurance standards at Glebe Island and at White Bay. Quality assurance will soon follow with the other Conaust facilities. This is very good news for this industry. This is serious good news. It is not serious obfuscation of the facts of waterfront reform, as we have seen from the shadow minister. You had better get real about this. You have to be fair dinkum about waterfront reform. It is not just Conaust. Patricks have committed themselves to an ambitious $250 million investment program. They are purchasing 29 straddles to the east Swanston dock and to Fremantle. Eight are in use now at east Swanston dock. Mr Sharp--Are they brand new?",103
370,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, they are new straddles. The way out of this dock has been completely overhauled to assist in traffic flows. It should have been done years ago. It is a very important reform. All of the pavement there is being replaced this year. A new container crane is on order for berth No.3. That is a $250 million program. It is a very fine investment hy the private sector and it is entirely consistent with what I wanted to see happen when I saw Patricks become the sole proprietor of that operation rather than the government, as the weakkneed efforts of the opposition would have had us be if we had not sold our share in Australian Stevedores some 12 months ago. I have no doubt that in the period ahead we are going to see a great deal of hard work from the stevedoring companies. I am sure they are going to be vigorously pursuing the very best rates of return on their investment. After all, they must. These are not paltry sums of money-$140 million here, $250 million there and new EBAs to back it up. Who benefits from all of this? I will tell you who benefits--everyone in Australia benefits from it. The workers receive the dividend of that increased productivity; Conaust and Patricks improve their profitability; and Australian importers and exportersand I am particularly interested in Australian exporters-get the benefits of this microeconomic reform. I think it is well past the time when our detractors-particularly the shadow minister who has slaved for five or six years now to sit in the seat I sit in today, to be Minister for Transport-admit some of this and desist from this tired old rhetoric, to get with it, to get with the rest of the industry, to get with the shipowners, to get with the stevedoring companies and to make sure that together we go on pursuing world class performance and not indulging in this pithy exercise of point scoring with rubbishy rhetoric and a total disregard for the facts of waterfront reform. (Time expired) .",104
371,Mr CHARLES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"La Trobe) (5.22 p.m.)Honest to goodness! If that was a high profile response by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to the attack of the shadow minister for transport, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), on the government's performance of waterfront reform, then it was pathetic. The minister is leaving the chamber, unfortunately. I will take some time to try to wake us up after the minister's little expose with sheep. Today we learned that Australia has a national debt of some $181 billion. While our country drowns in a sea of debt, the minister and this government wring their hands in pious denial of their culpable responsibility for huge inefficiencies in our sea transport industries. There are three issues that I will address this afternoon: first, the waterfront; second, Australian National Line; and, third, trans-Tasman and coastal shipping. Our current account deficit is really made up of two components. There are two problems that largely contribute to our difficulty financially to pay our own way in the world. One of those is national savings but, perhaps more importantly, another is our negative balance of trade. One of the things that impacts most seriously on that negative balance of trade is cost to industry. There is a whole range of costs that industry has imposed on it from outside over which it has little or no control. We talk about the need to address those as micro-economic reform, but that is a very long phrase of economic jargon. I prefer to talk about it as cost inefficiency. One of the biggest cost inefficiencies that we face in Australia is the cost of internationblinkered. al transport. Everybody knows that we are an island continent in the bottom of the Pacific a million miles from anywhere, and it is very expensive for us to import and export. If we want to pay our way, we need to export from Australia an equal value, and hopefully more value, of what we import. If the cost of transport impacts on our cost of trying to compete in Europe, America or Japan, then we have a problem. The minister knows he needs to fix up the mess. It has been a mess for a long time. The minister has fiddled at the edges a bit. He has done a bit here and a bit there. Sure, his container numbers are a little better here and there, and he has crane numbers. He has numbers for just about everything but, unfortunately, he does not have numbers from the BIE report. It is a fact that at every tum the minister takes he comes slam-bang up against the trade unions. The ACTU and the MEU pull the minister's strings. The minister cannot make a decision by himself to improve efficiency on the waterfront, coastal shipping and transTasman shipping. He cannot do anything about ANL because he is controlled by his political mate, the ACTU. Jennie George said to Bryan Noakes on Meet the Press in October 1993 after the 1993 election: Now, I think the employers have failed to realise that the people you supported lost the electionthat's us; we lost the electionLabor won and they have a right to implement their commitments. The union movement supported the ALP at the polls in my electorate, in the electorate of the honourable member for Hume and in the electorate of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou). The ALP was out on the ground and they demand their due. We are paying for it in the high cost of shipping and transport. Jennie George carried this on last Sunday morning on Meet the Press. When asked, 'Can you work with the coalition? Can you work with Peter Reith in government?' she said, 'No, we can't.' How ideologically I reckon it is the first time. I have heard an ACTU president or secretary actually come out and say, 'No, we cannot work with a conservative government.' What a lot of rot. Unions have always worked with conservative governments and have probably worked better with them than with this lot, the ALP, because there was no accord and the unions could not pull the strings. They would not pull the strings of a coalition minister for transport. That is a fact. The member for Hume would not have his strings pulled by Jennie George. Perhaps we would get some real waterfront reform. And that is not rhetoric, mate; that is fair dinkum. We are not supposed to have the BIE report because the minister does not want anybody to have it. It does reach some very interesting conclusions. The shadow minister talked about what was happening on the waterfront in terms of crane movements and containerisation. I will talk briefly about break-bulk. For those of you who do not know, break-bulk is any loose cargo such as steel, coil, timber, newsprint, motor vehicles and so on. The BIE report says: In late 1994 Australia's non-tenninal waterfront charges for break-bulk cargo were high by international standards. Indeed, the lowest charges in Australia are equivalent to the more expensive ports on the west coast of North America. BHP Transportwhich did part of the work for this reportrecognises that Australian port authorities have subsequently made some reductions to their charges. However, Australian waterfront charges are substantially above those applying to ports in the southern United States, Mexico and Panama. Mexico-got it? The report continued: Port authority and auxiliary charges are the main causes of differences in waterfront charges between the Australian and the southern American ports. BHP Transport has also compared the productivity of loading operations for a number of its steel products. Stevedoring costs in Australia are consistently higher than for a wide selection of ports in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. These higher loading costs reflect a combination of low productivity and relatively high wages. 'Low productivity and relatively high wages.' The report goes on: Reforms to work practices and modernisation of facilities must be high priorities. The report then goes on and reaches a major conclusion: Australia's performance in break bulk urgently needs improving. It does not say that it is terrific. It does not say that the minister has done a great job. It says that it has to be fixed. It goes on: It will be difficult for Australia to develop a reputation as a reliable supplier of elaborately transformed manufactures if the timeliness and reliability deficiencies of containing and break operations are not urgently addressed. If that is not an indictment of this minister in this government, I do not know what is. The second issue I will address very briefly is ANL. While the shadow minister talked about the payments that are made to Neville Wran and his friends in order to try to decide what to do with ANL, in fact the unions are pulling the government's string on ANL as well. In this morning's Financial Review, it is reported that: The P&O group has rejected a Federal Government proposal that the Commonwealth retain 15 per cent equity in ANL Ltd and is considering an alternative package in a bid to allay union concerns about the shipping line's future. Adding to the urgency for the Government to resolve the impasse over ANL, Canberra has been warned by the company's chairman, Mr Neville Wran, that the shipping line will be unable to trade beyond next February unless it receives a capital injection from the Government. It is going broke again. No matter that they sold off the profitable bit; they used almost all the $18 million they got from the profitable bit. The important lot out of the Financial Review article says: But the union movement's campaign to scuttle the sale of ANL has been stepped up with the powerful Construction, Forestry Mining and Energy Union yesterday warning the Government that it would join the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) if it decided to embark on a national waterfront strike. That is what we have got. We have got the unions telling the government what they can do with ANL, just as they have told the government for years that they would not reform the trans-Tasman shipping cartel. They would not allow those vessels to be recrewed efficiently and financially responsibly, any more than they will get rid of cabotage around the Australian coast, which costs all of us so dearly for shipping Australian goods from Tasmania to the mainland and vice versa. (Time expired)",105
372,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In this matter of public importance debate we have seen the substitution of smear for policy and envy for integrity. We have had the opposibulk tion come into this House and cast doubt upon the integrity of the government in this debate, cast doubt upon the integrity of the waterfront reform process and suggest somehow that the government is not looking after the best interests of the Australian community. This comes from a party which admires the Republicans in America, admires their contract with America, a contract with the wealthy part. This is the party which is not Menzies' child. This is the party which is dominated by shady outside forces-from the Melbourne Club, the World Club in Perth and the Adelaide Club. Businessmen tell that party when Alexander Downer and John Hewson can have their day and when Crichton-Browne will go. How can we have such cant and hypocrisy from them?",106
373,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member will refer to other parliamentarians and members of this House by their correct title. Mr Tim Fischer-Particularly you, after your disgraceful Australia Remembers effort.",107
374,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Your disgraceful effort. So your position reflects your general approach to industrial relations.,107
375,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member will address his remarks through the chair.,107
376,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Perhaps you might direct those opposite to do the same. Their approach here is the same as it is across all policy areas, particularly in industrial relations. of this debate has been code for increased powers for employers, a greater capacity to exploit the work force and any attempt to reduce wages and working conditions. The fact of the matter is that there have been dramatic increases in productivity on the waterfront and dramatic increases in productivity in the whole of the Australian economy. Those opposite know that the Australian economy is 40 per cent more competitive than it was a decade ago. They know that real unit labour costs across the Australian economy have been reduced significantly. They know that waterfront productivity as measured by crane rates has improved by 48 per cent. I will not run through all the figures that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) ran through because I would like to talk about the general approach of the opposition to these matters. They are opposed to all of those things that this government has done to make this economy significantly more productive-not just on the ports but in all areas of industry. The one thing that has made this economy so much more productive is a sensible wages policy. That sensible wages policy has come through the Accord. It is because of the Accord that this government has now put in place a national savings plan, which they call for day in and day out. The national savings plan, the Accord and the requirements for increased productivity are all linked. They opposed every one of those. So perhaps the obligation in this debate is upon them to tell us what they would do, instead of an accord, to get the productivity increases. What would they do instead of superannuation to get the savings in place to fund the investment to get the productivity increases to get the high growth to get the jobs so that we can trade more and be more competitive? Where is their alternative? It is not there because they continue in this debate to substitute smear for policy. That is what those opposite have done. The problem we have with the opposition is that it will not tell us the alternative. That is a shame. The arrogance of the opposition to refuse to stand for anything, to put a marker down and tell us what they stand for! All I guess this was best summed up recently by Chris Wallace in the Financial Review, in an article entitled 'Howard and the great WA wimp-out'. It states: If John Howard cannot fix the West Australian Liberal Party, why should anyone believe he can fix the labour market? Why should anyone believe he can fix the labour market? (Quorum formed) As I was saying, if John Howard cannot fix the Western Australian Liberal Party, why would anyone believe he could fix the labour market or the waterfront? What we didn't see in this debate today were any proposals to fix the problem. Chris Wallace went on to say: If he shrinks from setting things straight in his own backyard, how will he go winding up the pace of micro reform? Or cutting spending? Or doing any of the other difficult things he tells the Australian people a Howard government would do better than the Keating Government does now? The last 10 days have seen one of the great wimp-outs of modem federal politics, a bout of gutlessness for which the Federal Coalition is to pay a considerable price. Of course, following on from that, Fred Chaney had a few words to say. If Fred Chaney does represent the middle ground of Australian politics, the Liberal Party in Western Australia must be a long way from the middle ground. We know that when we look at their industrial relations policy. That state offers a basic wage of $301 a week and a whole series of draconian measures which attack workers. Mr Charles- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. It seems to me that the honourable member has strayed pretty far from the discussion of the matter of public importance, which relates to the government's complete failure to reform the Australian waterfront. We are now talking about matters in Western Australia which I would have thought were highly inappropriate to the issue.  point of order: the honourable member has raised an irrelevant point of order, clearly designed to interrupt this speaker. I ask you to rule accordingly and discipline the honourable member for La Trobe.",107
377,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I was a bit inclined to rule in favour of the point of order after reading the wording of the matter of public importance. But I would ask the honourable member for Lilley to tie his remarks into the matter before the House.,108
378,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member who raised the point of order raised the question of labour market reform in Western Australia. He raised the whole question of the attitude towards wages and labour market reform. Western Australia guarantees a miserable minimum wage of $301.10 week. Those opposite come into this House and argue that the problem with the waterfront and the Australian economy is that wages are too high. They have a solution in place in Western Australia: they are lowering wages. They support Jeff Kennett's cuts to the minimum wage in Victoria to the tune of $3,000 a year. Those opposite constantly come into this House and claim that we are not pursuing reform and that they have an alternative. The only alternative they have is the low wage, likely low productivity alternative which will knock out the industrial relations safety net. That is the only policy they have. That is the only thing they talk about in this House when we get down to the serious matter of making this economy much more competitive. What is the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in respect of these questions? What does he think about Western Australia? An article in the West Australian of 29 July stated: A federal coalition government would mirror the industrial relations policies implemented by the Court Government in Western Australia ... John Howard said yesterday. He said the coalition wanted to offer a more flexible system ... What is 'flexible' a euphemism for? 'Flexible' is a euphemism for massive cuts to basic conditions; 'flexible' is a euphemism for knocking off overtime; 'flexible' is a euphemism for knocking off shift allowances. We now have the second wave of reform in Western Australia, and what does its architect say? Another article in the West Australian reads: With a dazed Mr Kierath looking on, Mr Howard launched into a tirade against Paul Keating. He said the PM had ""blinked first"" by admitting that Mr Howard did indeed have policies(Time expired)",108
379,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The discussion is now concluded. NA Corporations and Securities Committee Report,108
380,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Rocher)Mr Speaker has received a message from the Senate transmitting the following resolution agreed to by the Senate: That the time for the presentation of the report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on its inquiry into the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1995 be extended to 30 August 1995. NA NA BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed.,108
381,Mr CLEELAND,OTHER LEGIS LA TION AMENDMENT,"MCEwen) (5.43 p.m.)Before I was interrupted for question time, I referred the House to comments by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). On 19 August he told South Australian Liberals: I warn all of you to put on your political raincoats because you're going to be showered with lies and distortions. I made that comment after listening to the contribution of the shadow minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), in the debate on the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, I also note that the member for Flinders made a very wide ranging contribution to the debate with the courtesy of the chair, and it is my intention to follow the path that he took. In my initial contribution, I referred to the Liberal Party policy as we know it and as adopted by Liberal state governments. I referred to two-bottle Gude in Victoria. Surely, it is the most famous industrial relations reform this country has ever seen because it was established over two bottles of scotch on the weekend. What is more astonishing is the fact that the state minister revealed to the public that his industrial relations policy was developed over two bottles of scotch on the weekend. The Victorian industrial relations legislation was a disaster. I refer the House to 14 contracts which were prepared under Jeff Kennett's industrial relations legislation in Victoria. Those contracts were pretty extraordinary. They were work contracts. Of those 14 contracts, in most cases the hourly rate of ordinary pay was not included. So it was not possible to determine the hourly rate of pay because the legislation did not provide for an hourly rate of pay. Of those 14 contracts, nine abolished penalty rates for weekend shifts or work on public holidays. Three of those contracts reduced penalty rates or overtime rates. Three of the contracts abolished paid public holidays. Four of the contracts reduced or took away sick leave. Three of the contracts abolished employer superannuation contributions. Five of the contracts provided for an increase in working hours-in one case up to 50 hours per week--or they did not specify any minimum hours to be worked under the contract. Two of the contracts provided that the worker could be sacked due to injury or ill health causing that worker to be unable to work. Two of the contracts provided for automatic stand-down if no work was available. Four of the contracts reduced and abolished meal allowances. (Quorum formed) For the information of members in the House, before the quorum was called I was referring to the Victorian industrial relations legislation produced by two-bottle Gude. I was referring to the contracts which resulted from that legislation. I pointed out that in two of the contracts that we have seen in Victoria the employee can be sacked summarily for distributing printed or written material without the permission of management. In one of those contracts, the employee could be sacked summarily for showing disrespect to a director of the company. In another contract, and perhaps the worse we saw, if the employee was late for work and did not give more than two hours notice of the absence, he was liable under the contract for all of his colleagues' wages for the time they were not able to perform the work in his absence. This is an example of the conservatives' industrial relations policy when they are in government and passing legislation. We all know that the opposition, through its leader, the Hon. John Howard, have adopted the 1993 Western Australian industriallegislation. Two of those bills-the Workplace Agreements Bill and the Minimum Conditions of Employment Bill-are a reflection of where the opposition stand in industrial relations. The legislation is just a product of an outmoded, ideological view of the world held by the Western Australian Liberal Party and supported by the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and a number of antiworker solicitors. The dismissal laws in the Western Australian legislation are pretty frightening. The legislation suggests that workers can remain on state awards if they wish-which is not quite true. If an employer wishes to move his or her employees out of the award system and onto individual contracts, the employees are virtually powerless to resist. Respected industrial lawyer Rene Le Miere and former Commonwealth industrial relations minister Ian Viner QC have given their studied view on the legislation in Western Australia. They said: The legislation does not protect prospective employees who wish to be employed pursuant to an award rather than a workplace agreement in circumstances where the prospective employer requires that they enter into a workplace as a precondition to employment. The legislation does not protect employees who have entered into workplace agreements in circumstances where their employer threatens to dismiss them from their employment by notice, in accordance with their contract of employment, for the purpose of compelling them to accept less favourable terms and conditions of employment in a new workplace agreement. In other words, you can get the sack if you disagree. They continued: The legislation does not protect employees in circumstances where their employer threatens to dismiss them from their employment by notice, in accordance with their contract of employment, for the purpose of compelling them to accept the terms and conditions of employment in a workplace agreement proposed by the employer, except in the situation where an employer has not previously entered into a workplace agreement. Whether the employee is actually protected will depend upon the particular circumstances. In other words, if you are a worker in Western Australia and they want to move you off an award and on to a workplace agreement and you say no-which is your choice-you can get the boot without any recourse to an industrial relations tribunal. There is no protection for the worker at all. They further stated: The legislation does not protect employees if their employer dismisses all its work force by notice, advertises their jobs and then employs only those persons, including the former employees, who are willing to enter into a workplace agreement on the terms and conditions specified by the employer. This is the policy of the federal opposition. This is the policy adopted by John Howard. Despite the fact that he says they will not accept the second tranche of legislation in Western Australia, this legislation is already law in Western Australia. This is the policy of our conservative opponents in this place, and every employee in Australia should take a good look at it. Even if the threats of an employer breached the act, the employee faces Hobson's choice. If he or she resists the intimidation and takes legal action against the employer-which would be at great financial cost to the employee-the employer can still carry out the employer's threat. The employee still loses his agreement or her job. Some protection! We heard the shadow minister for industrial relations point out here that they are concerned that employees should be protected. Yet this is the very legislation he would adopt as a minister in this place. So there is no protection. Quite frankly, the House is being grievously misled by the claims of the shadow minister. The other parts of the legislation which require the Commissioner for Workplace Agreements not to register agreements unless satisfied that the employee was not persuaded to enter the agreement by threat or intimidation give no real protection to the employee. While the agreement cannot be registered, nothing stops the employer carrying out the employer's threat to dismiss the employee by notice and recruit another willing to take the job on the employer's terms. This the opposition's freedom of choice. This is freedom of choice for the employee negotiating with an employer. It is a notion of freedom of choice that, frankly, is ludicrous. There is no choice for an employee in those circumstances. I refer to a statement by a previous conservative Attorney-General of Western Australia on the introduction of Western Australia's first conciliation and arbitration legislation. (Quorum formed) The former Western Australian Attorney-General, a conservative, said: That phrase 'freedom of contract' must not be taken in its literal acceptation: we must look at the condition of the people, the circumstances surrounding those who are making that contract; and except both parties to the contract to be placed on a level, there is no equality of contract. It cannot be called a contract when one person has a rod in his hand, and the other has to submit to be punished. It is a great pity that the words of that conservative in Australia are not being adopted by the opposition in the fonnulation of its policy. (Time expired)",109
382,Mr CHARLES,OTHER LEGIS LA TION AMENDMENT,"La Trobe) (6.00 p.m.)The unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act ploughed untilled soil in 1994 when the Industrial Relations Refonn Act came into force on 30 March of that year. Prior to that time, we relied largely on state based provisions to take care of any problems which were inherent in the termination of employment. Prior to that time, the federal jurisdiction relied on the conciliation and arbitration powers of the constitutionspecifically, section 51 (35). It was on 30 March 1994, when the refonn act came into force, that this Labor government overturned almost a century of constitutional operation in Australia-of industrial relations which adhered to the intent, to the largest extent, of the framers of our constitution. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) last year turned all of that on its head when he detennined that he would rely on the external affairs power of the constitution in order to bring in ILO convention No. 158 and ILO recommendation No. 166 in order to be able to control the tennination of employment. From my viewpoint, it was a great negative in Australian law when finally the government took the route of overturning the intent of the founders of our constitution, who wanted matters of industrial relations handled by states' parties, the original colonies. They wanted it handled as close to the workplace as possible, and that is inherent in the words of the constitution. But this minister, because of his need to satisfy the ACTU over what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had promised the nation in April 1993, was forced to kowtow to the unions and was forced to bring in a measure which had not been contemplated by either him or the Prime Minister. We managed quite well in Australia for a very long time with state tribunals and state laws relating to tennination of employment. I must say that the Cain-Kirner government in Victoria did rather get it wrong when they set up a tribunal to hear unfair dismissals, and so overbalanced the tribunal system that employers were given no consideration in the equation whatsoever. I am reminded of a case in my electorate where an employer-a small carpet laying company-found himself needing to hire a new secretary for his premises. Because the girl who worked for him had a better job offer and she decided to leave, she placed an advertisement in the paper and replaced herself, in essence. The appointed morning came and the new lass showed up for work. She came in while the owner was discussing with a client the colour of carpet. I should say that he used subcontractors to lay the carpet, so there was just the proprietor and his secretary/girl Friday. When she came in he said, 'Would you mind making a cup of coffee? I am just discussing the colour of the carpet with a client and I will then show you your duties.' She said, 'I don't make coffee.' He said, 'Would you mind getting the vacuum and cleaning up a bit while I finish here with the client?' She said, 'I don't hoover.' By two o'clock that afternoon they had agreed that they were not meant for each other. But she said to the employer, 'Look, just in case I don't find another job, how about giving me the sack?' Reluctantly, he said, 'I really shouldn't, but okay, fair enough, I will.' Within seven days he had an unfair dismissal notice on his hands. That is an example of the kind of thing that happens when you overbalance the equation, when you give one side of the argument too much power. With that example as an exception, we managed pretty well with state based laws in respect of unfair dismissal. The Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill represents a third set of amendments and modifications to the federal law since it came into effect on 30 March 1994. Members will recall that we attended this House not long after the legislation came into effect in order to straighten it out, because the minister had included in the bill that management and employees were included, there was no limit on salary and there was no limit, in effect, on damages that an employee could extract through the Industrial Relations Court-not the commission, but the court. That proved almost immediately to be unworkable and there was a hue and cry around the country. The minister backflipped at about a million miles an hour and brought in a bill in order to modify this. The regulations under this legislation have been modified on two occasions, and here we are once again, less than two years after it came into force, modifying the legislation again. We on this side of the House tried to tell the government at the time that the minister had got it wrong. You cannot put all the power in the hands of an employee with respect to termination and expect employers to keep hiring people. It is not a legitimate expectation. That is a scenario that the Industrial Relations Reform Act set up, because what we put in place with ILO convention No. 158 and recommendation No. 166 was a set of procedures which must be followed in order for an employer to terminate the employment of an unsatisfactory employee. What has transpired in practice has been that the court has not dealt with issues of equity, fairness or reality; it has dealt with procedure. Procedure is important, as we know . We experienced today an issue in which we on this side of the House believed that procedural fairness had perhaps not been followed. But procedural fairness is not all of the equation. Employers were required under this act-until this amendment is passed; if it is passed-to prove that the employee was unsatisfactory. The employee did not have to prove that the employee had been unfairly dismissed. So the employer is required to .tJ'0'v- that a whole set of procedures have been followed, including warnings, written warnings and confirmation of what will happen if changes are not made in an employee's attitude, to the point where people ',1!(- klVe lied, cheated and stolen from their employers have been reinstated by the commission, with damages as well. The situation had become intolerable, so the minister has brought to us once again a set of reforms to try to make his very bad original legislation a bit better. In July this year the Prime Minister wrote a letter to Mr Christopher Edwards, the Chairman of the National Small Business Forum, reflecting on issues affecting small business. Amongst other things, discussing the Small Business Forum, he said: One of those issues recently has been the legislation relating to unfair dismissal. I was pleased that the government was able to announce the proposed changes to the unfair dismissals provision of the Industrial Relations Act in the lead-up to the forum held in June. I have been told the proposals were well received by the members of the forum. I am glad that we have been able to respond to the concerns of the sector. He went on to say: We are confident that the newand 'new' is the important wordunfair dismissal arrangements will mean that the system is reasonable and balanced for both employees and employers. What an indictment, fair dinkum! Why bring in a bill in the first place the provisions of which everybody under the sun-the employers, the employer bodies, the representatives of industry, and the members of the coalition on both this side of the House and our side of the Senate-tried to tell you were not workable, not fair in principle because they were not balanced. They gave undue emphasis to procedure. Also, they gave to employees almost a guarantee of permanent employment, once they had got a job. What this means in the real world, quite frankly, is that people stop hiring. It does not have a big effect on big manufacturers or big employers, whether in the processing, mining or chemical industries, because they have in place procedures and systems to be able to deal with personnel; they have personnel departments. And, yes, the more detailed and prescriptive the procedures are, the more people they have to hire, the higher the overheads-but it is a small fraction of their operating cost. Let us take a small business proprietor with two or three employees. If that proprietor finds he cannot dismiss an employeeperhaps it is one who constantly shows up late for work, one who does not show up for work at all without reasonable excuse, or one who takes money out of the till-who clearly is not satisfactory for his business purposes, then he will not hire. That proprietor simply will stop employing people because he cannot afford to run his business in such a manner. Those are the kinds of problems that we set up with the legislation. If the Prime Minister says that the new unfair dismissal arrangements will mean that the system is reasoned and balance for both employees and employers, for heaven's sake why did he not get it right 16 or 17 months ago? It is a nonsense to come in here and say, 'Well, we're going to make it fair now; we started out making it unfair.' That is terrific-great for microeconomic reform, great for Australian industry and great for revitalising the manufacturing sector in Australia. I have never met anyone anywhere who, having been dismissed, thought it was fair. That is a reasonable proposition, isn't it. I cannot imagine that, if I were dismissed, I would think it was very fair. We can safely assume that 100 per cent of the time, if an employer dismisses an employee, the employee believes that he has been unfairly dismissed. If we take the total number of people in Australia who have been dismissed, if we create a system which is balanced in favour of the employee who has been dismissed, and if we make it all procedural based, then we make it likely that every dismissed employee will take his grievance to a court. And we make it likely that most businesses, not having the money to afford solicitors, barristers and time in front of a court, tribunal or commission, will in the end acquiesce and pay up what the employee wants. I recently had a case like that in my electorstated: ate. A small business person with a small shop hired one employee to work every Monday on a part-time basis. He knew, before he hired the employee, that the employee also worked from home doing the same job from time to time. So he discussed with the employee the need for the employee not to take the owner's customers away from the owner's business and do her job with them at home. The employee clearly understood this. After the employee had been in on the part-time basis to work for only two Mondays, the employer found out that she had already stolen one customer. So he dismissed the employee. Unfair dismissal. He had needed to carry this on for another five or six weeks, warning the employee over and over again, both verbally and in writing, before he could dismiss her-this temporary employee who had completely violated his trust and was trying to undermine his business by taking his clients away. Legislation is all about procedures; it is not about equity nor is it about reasonableness. There should be a reasonableness test in all of this. But I will give it to the minister-who, once again when we are debating matters industrial, is not in the House; that is par for the course-that this time the bill is more balanced; it is better. He has taken it out of the Industrial Relations Court, which was an inappropriate place for it to be, and put it into the commission. That gives us a better shot. In fact, I believe that at 9 June this year, over 10,000 matters under the unlawful termination provisions of the act had been filed with the court; 7,300 of those had been finalised, but only seven per cent were dealt with by the court, the rest having been settled in some manner or other. So it is clear that we do not need a federal court in order to deal with unfair dismissals. We told the minister that when he brought the legislation in originally. At least he has finally gotten that part right, too. The onus of proof was so far reversed in the original legislation that it made employees almost absolutely untouchable. An article appeared in the Australian of 25 October 1994 that put this in some perspective. It Employers will not be able to legally sack employees for excessive absenteeism if they cannot prove the worker is not ill under a ruling which throws new doubt on the termination rights of employers. Lawyers said the ruling effectively required employers to prove the almost impossible, and cast doubt on any terminations involving circumstantial evidence. It did not work very well. When the Prime Minister went to address the small business forum, he would have known that they were unhappy with the survey which was set out in an article headed 'Small business unhappy with dismissal procedures: survey' published in the Australian Financial Review of 23 September 1994. That article stated that the responses of employers, when asked what the major impediments were to them hiring new staff, were: 'lack of work or sales' 33 per cent; 'costs of labour or wages' 20 per cent; 'need more profit' 16 per cent; and 'hard to dismiss, wrongful dismissal', et cetera, 13 per cent. So that was the fourth most important reason why employers were not hiring people. On 5 July 1995, in a speech at the Menzies Research Centre, Professor Judith Sloan, on the bill we are debating here today, said: The press coverage of industrial relations matters over the past several months might suggest to the casual observer that the main problem with the 'reforms' has been the hopelessly complex and unbalanced unfair dismissal provisions, provisions that were described by a Judge of the Industrial Relations Court as a ""charter of workers' rights"". Have you got that? Charter of workers' rights. That is really what these procedures have been-and they have been an absolute disgrace. She continued: There is no doubt that these provisions were, and will remain even after the changes announced on June 21 1995, deficient-they are overly legalistic and costly; they place too much emphasis on procedural fairness without consideration being given to the substantive reasons for the dismissal; there is an imbalance in the handling of matters between federal and State jurisdictions. She has said it all. That is right. It is no wonder that employers cite the act as a reason for not expanding their employment, when the conditions relating to employing people have been made that hard. No reasonable, sensible employer wants to hire someone and then get rid of them. It is very expensive to hire and train new people, and to get them used to your operation and the way you do things. Employees are an asset to any business, any company. No-one in their right mind would dismiss employees, without a very substantive reason. Some employers will pick the wrong person or there may be some who perhaps vindictively will take a personality difference out on an employee-and in those cases we need, in a procedurally fair manner, to make sure that those employers are dealt with, and dealt with properly. This legislation, I have no doubt, will see to that. I myself do not believe that the legislation goes far enough. (Time expired)",111
383,Mr LATHAM,OTHER LEGIS LA TION AMENDMENT,"It is not so much the speech made by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) that concerns me; it is the fact that he has made the same speech a thousand times. It gets absolutely no better in the telling, and it reflects a certain philosophy to industrial relations which does not believe-(Quorum formed) As I was explaining, in the world of the Liberal and National parties workers have no rights. Of course, by calling a quorum on me they are denying my right, as a hard working member of this place, to explain the way in which industrial relations reform in Australia should proceed.",114

385,Mr LATHAM,OTHER LEGIS LA TION AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, my rhetoric has excited them. That is predictable because they also were excited by the member for La Trobe, by the fact that he was not telling the truth about the provisions in this legislation. He was not telling the truth about the way in which the unfair dismissal laws have been operating in Australia. The member for La Trobe's central proposition was that employees are untouchable under the unfair dismissal provisions. The example he gave midway through his speech was quite astounding. The member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) should understand this. The member for La Trobe gave a hypothetical example of a worker taking money out of a till and said that under these provisions the worker could not be sacked. That is just absurd. It is totally untrue. To suggest that a worker taking money out of the till cannot be",114
386,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OTHER LEGIS LA TION AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The honourable member for Fowler will please observe standing order 57.,115
387,Mr LATHAM,OTHER LEGIS LA TION AMENDMENT,"The truth of the matter is that any worker caught taking money out of a till would not only be dismissed but would find themselves before the courts on criminal charges. The membei for La Trobe was advancing a standard of debate that is sadly indicative of that of other members opposite, like the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who seem to be incapable of giving a correct account of the facts. It needs to be understood that, under the proposed amendments before the House, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia will required to consider all the circumstances of a case concerning a dismissed employee in deciding whether the employee should get a remedy. The court will not be obliged to give a remedy, even if there has been a contravention of the act. For example, the court could decide not to grant a remedy, depending on all the circumstances, if it decided that a dismissal was only unlawful because of a procedural defect. An employer must still have a valid reason for the dismissal, and the dismissal must not be harsh, unjust or unreasonable in all the circumstances. A valid reason relates to an employee's capacity or conduct or to the operational requirements of a business. For the dismissal of an employee to be lawful, an employer must have a valid reason relating to the employee's capacity or conduct, or the operational requirements of the business, and the employer must give the employee the chance to respond to allegations about conduct or work performance and must give the required notice, or compensation instead of notice. In short, and in essence, the employee must be treated fairly. To this stage, I have had a single complaint relating to the unfair dismissal provisions from employers in my electorate. It is a large electorate-130,000 people, hundreds of businesses, large industrial areas and thriving commercial and retail centres. There are a lot of businesses, big and small, in my electorate and I have had one complaint about the provisions of the unfair dismissal laws. When the businesswoman-she is from the hairdressing trade-came to my electorate office with her complaint, I explained to her the provisions. The nature of her complaint was that she had been believing some of the untrue propaganda from members of the Liberal and National parties. Once I explained to her the truth of the matter and gave her some of the literature provided by the government, she went away content that these provisions are fair and reasonable. To my mind, the average employer in Australia who is fair and reasonable would not have any problem whatsoever with the provisions of the unfair dismissal laws. be Employers will be even more pleased because of the outstanding amendments to those laws that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has now brought before the House. Employers were not necessarily unhappy in the past. I am giving a valid and truthful account of the circumstances in my electorate. Employers are much more likely to be happy in the future because of the amendments now before the House. What is reflected in this is an attitude to industrial relations, an attitude to the workplace. This government believes, and this government's legislation reflects, that the workplace does not involve a master-slave relationship. In a civilised society, workers are not slaves. In a civilised society, workers are not servants. In a civilised and decent society, workers have rights that need to be respected and protected. It is fair, civilised and decent to issue warnings to workers at enterprise level. It is fair, civilised and decent to try to assist the employee to overcome a particular problem. That is fair and reasonable. We would do it in our own work as members of parliament. Consultation, cooperation and decency in the workplace increase productivity. They promote teamwork, cohesion and a shared sense of direction. One would have thought that in the 1990s all these things are part of the fabric of a modern and effective industrial relations framework. In an open economy we need continuous investment and continuous upgrading by business. That will not be achieved by employers trying to divide and rule, by employers thinking they have a licence to sack at will and by employers thinking they have a licence to be indecent and fire employees at will. None of those things will be achieved. In an environment where we require continuous investment and upgrading by business, these unfair dismissal provisions are entirely appropriate. Members of parliament have experience with these provisions. I was interested to hear that no opposition member of parliament, as an employer of a small number of people, has related to the House in this debate that these provisions are unsuitable for their own circumstances. If they are not unfair to us, as employers of a small number of people in our electorate office, we could reasonably expect that these are decent provisions for small business and, indeed, the entire business sector in Australia. The argument that these provisions have stopped employment growth is totally untrue. One need only look at the number of new jobs created in Australia since March 1993 to understand that. More than 600,000 new jobs have been created in the Australian economy. We cannot accept the simplistic argument about small business in employment. The opposition is trying to advance the notion that, because there are 850,000 classified small businesses in Australia, if each employed one more person unemployment in Australia would be solved. The opposition is trying to say that the federal unfair dismissal provisions are stopping that employment of one extra person. That is totally simplistic totally unrealistic when one looks at the and structure of the Australian economy. Mr Rob Bastion, the chief executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations, gave an address to the National Press Club on 23 August. Let me outline some of his comments: Australia has approximately 870,000 firms. ABS defines some 850,000 or 98 per cent of these as ""small"" in employment terms using thresholds of 100 in manufacturing and 20 in retail and rural. You will be aware that small firms employ between 52 and 58 per cent of the private sector work force and, depending on who you read, generate 30 and 40 per cent of our nation's added value or wealth. The average firm in Australia employs between five and seven people. According to the ABS, in the financial year 199293, 419,000 of these businesses employed nobody. Though I suspect they really do support some. It would help a lot if our public policy makers could reflect on that a little. Well, I have reflected on it a lot, and I think it is quite an important statistic. Even though the ABS classifies 850,000 small businesses in Australia, 420,000 of those-almost halfemploy nobody. They are sole traders. My feeling is that they show up in the statistics because the ABS is lagging behind changes in the nature of work. We have seen the growth in Australia in household and business outsourcing and contracting out. In the so called information age we are seeing more specialisation and flexibility and businesses are becoming small and adaptable units. Those who might have been classified as workers under previous industrial structures are now being classified as small businesses. But in reality these tradesmen, consultants and information workers working on their own are still doing most of their work for the same company, but they are doing it by contract, not by our traditional notion of the employeremployee relationship. In many respects these sole trader and sole worker enterprises are a product of labour market deregulation and a product of changes in the nature of work. and They are not likely to be beneficiaries of fabric further labour market deregulation. In Australia when we talk about 850,000 small businesses, it needs to be understood that half of those businesses employ nobody. If the ABS had more relevant and more contemporary definitions and classifications for enterprises and workers, it may be deemed that people such as the tradesmen, the consultants and the information workers-in fact, what we would have years ago known as workers-are employees. The truth is that many of them do not want or need employees. Many of them do not want or need to employ another person. The simplistic argument we hear from small business leaders and from Liberal and National Party members of parliament that if every small business in Australia employed one more person there would be no unemployment in the country is just unacceptable. It is not in tune with reality because a good proportion of those small businesses do not want to employ anyone else because of the nature of the work that they are engaged in. It is very important-you would understand this, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - in public life and in debates such as this to guard against embellished and simplistic points of view. When it comes to small business very important to guard against excessive romance. The truth is that small business people work hard, but it also needs to be understood that their businesses are small because they involve risk. They are starting out or they are subject to market restructuring. Mr Bastion made these points in his speech when he spoke about strip retailing and the problems of small business in the retail sector. Those problems are a product of market adjustment to a convenience based society. In a free and open economy it should be regarded as the government's fault that market forces take hold and produce restrucdirection turing. We should understand the nature of small business. It is risk laden. Ninety per bargaining. cent of small businesses fail primarily because their risk was unsustainable in the market. This romantic view that small business can no wrong and only government makes whereby mistakes falls short of the mark and should dismissed as unrealistic and untrue. There should be a realistic assessment of the needs of small business. We should be guarding against embellished and simplistic points view and excessive romance. We should be trying to have an enterprise culture and an industrial relations environment in Australia that encourages business cess-small, medium and large. That is one of the defining issues in Australian politics. Those in the media and around the traps who sometimes say that there is very little difference these days between the government and the opposition obviously have not read any of the policy work on industrial relations. They have not read the Accord Mark VIII or Jobsback, which is re-endorsed by the Liberal and National Party members. There are two very important features of industrial relations that need to be understood. The first of those relates to the enterprise culture. My argument is that enterprise culture can only be fostered through enterprise bargaining-collective bargaining in the workplace where everyone is involved and where everyone has a shared sense of direction, a shared sense of responsibility and a sense of teamwork and cohesion. That has so comprehensively been the direction of this it is also government's policy. The Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns), who is in the chamber, would be aware of the great credit given to the government in this tremendous report produced by the department-Enterprise bargaining in Australia. It outlines all the success of this government's policy. While I do not have time to provide the relevant quotes, I would direct members to page 2 and the excellent summary provided therein. It needs to be understood that in an open econnot omy enterprises compete, not individuals. Enterprises need common goals, a sense of and shared purpose. That is the great strength of a collective approach to workplace What does the opposition advocate? It advocates the dog-eat-dog model of individual do employment contracts. It advocates a system each individual in the enterprise will be have their own employment contract. This is a system that can only achieve the destruction of an enterprise culture. It can only lead to jealousy, distrust and suspicion in the workof place. What other reason can there be for advancing this model other than to set up a recipe for exploitation? The truth is that, if every worker has their sucown contract, everyone in the workplace would be so suspicious and jealous, wondering what someone else has written into their contract. It detracts totally from and it destroys the sense of enterprise culture and shared direction that is so important to economic success in the 1990s. It drives down productivity and leads to more disputes and more unemployment. It is the old John Howard formula-the stagflation: take away money from the social wage and you will produce a wages blow-out. Take away the sense of enterprise culture that has emerged in Australia, try and set people against each other-a dog-eat-dog model-and you end up with a stagflation that you left Australia with in the early 1980s. It really is a dumb way to proceed. In this place I am not known as a militant leftie or a screaming radical and I have not been to the Phil Cleary school of economic isolationism or the Phil Cleary school of outdated dogma, but I can tell the opposition that individual",115

390,Mr MCARTHUR,OTHER LEGIS LA TION AMENDMENT,"I am delighted to support the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) in their comments in relation to the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill. I draw to the attention of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) cases they quoted, in particular as they related to the effect of this legislation individuals in the workplace as recorded in court decisions. The member for Werriwa suggested that the cases that have been quoted in the House are figments of their imagination. I will report some of those that give a lie to that proposition. It is quite clear to people in the workplace and employers around Australia that the effects of this legislation in the industrial relations arena have been horrific and disastrous in terms of job creation and bringing about a fair dismissal. As for the honourable member's comments on the Accord Mark VIII, I wonder whether he has read it and whether he is just getting ready to read Accord Mark IX, which the government might just get in before the next election. I note the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) is in the House. At least he has some understanding of the bill before the parliament and some of the implications for all workers of Australia. For the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), it will be third time lucky. This bill is the third attempt to amend the unfair dismissal laws since their inception some 15 months ago. Members on the government side have not been prepared to concede that. However, this is yet another step in repairing some of the damage done by the most disastrous laws yet devised in Australian industrial relations. The laws have cost jobs, made lawyers rich and produced some of the most bizarre judgments ever witnessed in our legal system. The unfair dismissal laws have been so preoccupied with the issue of how workers have been dismissed that they have failed to ask the real question: whether the employer had a valid reason for dismissing. Whether or not employers are justified in dismissing workers has taken a back seat to the technical detail and the legalistic provisions of the legislation in the way the government has gone about this process. It is not surprising that the laws have brought forward an army of aggrieved litigants eager to press their claim for compensation and reinstatement. Since the laws came into effect in March 1994, over 10,000 claims on have been lodged with the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, and fewer than 75 per cent have been finalised. Ten thousand claimsthat is somewhat different from what the member for Werriwa was suggesting. By June 1994, three months after the initial legislation, pressure forced Minister Brereton to make changes. That was the first set of changes. The government amended the legislation to limit sacked workers' access to unfair dismissal provisions and to limit the extraordinary amounts that some litigants were receiving in compensation. The minister at the table would be aware that this legislation opened a whole raft of compensation claims that were completely unreasonable and obviously not in accord with what even the government had in mind. Nevertheless, three months later, in September, new unfair dismissal claims were still flowing in at a rate of 120 a week. That is what some workers around Australia felt about this legislation: they were on a good thing and they were going to stick to it. The government resorted to calling in retired industrial relations commissioners and part-time judicial registrars to help deal with the growing backlog of claims. By November the government passed additional regulation to exclude trainees, casual staff and probationary employees from accessing the unfair dismissal provisions. It is even more remarkable, and I am sure the minister at the table would understand this, that the Working Nation traineeship scheme had a special provision within the regulations to exclude the unfair dismissal provisions. What a remarkable situation: a piece of government legislation, a piece of government program, contained a provision saying that a provision in the very piece of legislation that the government is lauding here today did not apply to that program. Even with that exclusion, more claims were forthcoming. So far, 7,300 unfair dismissal claims have been finalised, compared with 452 other matters. So we have 7,000 claims balanced against 400 other more reasonable and genuine industrial relations matters. Employers around the country have been faced with large compensation payouts, not to mention the legal costs combined with them. Because of uncertainty surrounding the provisions, employers have settled doubtful claims for $1,000 or $2,000 to avoid the legal cost of taking them to court despite the fact that they would most likely win. They made a judgment. They said, 'Let's pay up. Let's not go to court and try to put up with the legal costs and all the inconvenience.' Small businesses, as other speakers on this side of the House have said, were scared to employ new staff because they were worried about the provisions of this legislation. Industrial lawyers made a small fortune thriving on the complexity of the statutory provisions within the act-the very thing the government are now addressing. For all the while, workers who have behaved in the most reprehensible manner have been reinstated with back pay because the employer did not satisfy strict procedural requirements in terminating their employment. Speakers on this side have indicated that very unfair set of arrangements that this legislation brought into play. Members of the government are saying that this legislation did not cost jobs-yet Minister Laurie Brereton told the International Labour Organisation in Geneva in May",118

392,Mr MCARTHUR,OTHER LEGIS LA TION AMENDMENT,"I thought I said 'Minister Brereton'. The minister said: In Australia, some commentators have argued that the employment protection provided in our national industrial relations legislation would discourage employers taking on new staff and result in higher unemployment. We believe we have achieved the right balance between employment creation and ensuring workers have a fair safety net to protect wages and conditions. Back in Australia, on 30 May Minister Brereton told The World Todrzy: The fact is, in respect of this-and I've been around and tested it with many employers-no one, no one has any evidence to suggest that this is a brake on employment. In point of fact, the opposite is the case. Unfortunately for Minister Brereton, a survey of 600 firms in three capital cities by a Sydney recruiting firm found totally different results. Twelve per cent of the businesses surveyed had employed fewer staff as a direct result of the federal unfair dismissal laws. New South Wales employer representative Garry Brack said: I've spoken now, over the last 13 months or so, to a lot of small business groups and every time this question is raised, they are the ones who say: We are not employing, either because of their personal exposure or because of somebody else they know. So they fully understood the problem facing them with the unfair dismissal laws. Even if the figures tallied, they made the decision not to employ that extra person because of this legislation. In New South Wales, even Labor Premier Bob Carr admitted that the unfair dismissal laws were costing jobs in that state. Furthermore, 17 per cent of businesses surveyed said they had deliberately used temporary and contract staff instead of hiring new employees so as to avoid the legislation. So we have the evidence on the board that businesses were concerned about this legislation and were voting with their feet by not employing more people. These comments were backed up by an anonymous employer who told the Business Report on 28 July, after contesting an unfair dismissal claim: It taught me not to employ people in staff. So the average Joe Bloggs worker-- their job security is no longer. He went on to say: I will only employ casual staff from this point on. It costs me more on the initial stages but a lot less later on. So he understood what this legislation would or could do to him. Thus, not only were the laws costing; they were also ironically having the effect of lessening job security by ensuring that more people were employed on a temporary or contract basis. Around half the growth in employment since the last federal election has been in part-time, casual or temporary employment. Members on both sides of the parliament would be aware of this. The statistics support that view. There has not been growth in full-time jobs, as so often ministers of the government are inclined to suggest. By now, virtually every small business operator has heard stories of workers whose dismissal was clearly justified, deserved and necessary being reinstated with compensation because one particular step was not taken by the boss in the legalistic process of bringing about a dismissal. But in May of this year Minister Brereton still was not convinced. He said on The World Today: I don't accept, for one moment, that there are ridiculous cases under this new law ... That is just like what the member for Werriwa said. By 21 June Minister Brereton had bowed to the inevitable and foreshadowed yet more changes to the act, saying in a press release: ... the change will make the handling of unfair dismissals simpler, more effective and less legalistic. What more convincing evidence would you need than the minister actually conceding at long last that this legislation was not working in its intent, it was legalistic and it was costing jobs. The amendments before the House are broadly in two areas. The first is to take some of the load away from the Industrial Relations Court by giving a greater role to the Industrial Relations Commission and the state jurisdictions. The second is to try to put an end to the more ludicrous unfair dismissal judgments by requiring the court to look at all the circumstances of a case rather than the strict procedural requirements. All of us on this side are aware of cases where the practical result should have been for a dismissal to take place, yet the legalistic process prevented this. In short, the second change is designed to ensure the court looks at why a worker has been dismissed rather than how the worker has been dismissed in the legalistic process. Let us have a look at some of these more ridiculous judgments where even some of the most difficult employees have won unfair dismissal cases. Even since Minister Brereton foreshadowed these amendments, the stream of adventurous decisions has continued. On 1 August, Anna Obrart, a prominent employment lawyer, wrote in the Australian Financial Review about the case of a man who applied to become a driver of an LPG tanker. This is quite an interesting case. The man forgot to mention on his application form that he had previously rolled a truck, which would most likely have barred him from working in the industry. Once employed, he broke the speed limit, fiddled his hours and eventually caused an accident with another motorist. Having caused the accident, he breached company policy by refusing to provide the driver of the other car with his name and details. The company promptly set up a disciplinary meeting, but the employee failed to tum up. A second meeting was organised, but again the worker did not attend, providing no excuse for his absence. When he finally did show up, he was rude and abusive to the employer. The company then decided to terminate his employment-quite a reasonable set of circumstances. The worker lodged an application in the industrial court, which amazingly managed to find in his favour. Apparently the dismissal was in breach of procedural fairness. The driver was reinstated-imagine this-with a tidy $20,000 in compensation. Assistant Minister, what could be fair about that?",119

395,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OTHER LEGIS LA TION AMENDMENT,Not then you didn't.,121
396,Mr MCARTHUR,OTHER LEGIS LA TION AMENDMENT,"I draw it to the attention of the assistant minister at the table. understands fairness and procedural arrangements. I am sure he would understand the unfair nature of this particular case. Here a clear case where the termination of employment of this employee was justified but ruled unlawful because of the way in which the act is constructed. So the actual merits of this case were thrown out the window and that person was reinstated. The government has sought to rectify this by amending section 170DE of the act to ensure that the Industrial Relations Court has regard to all the circumstances of the case when assessing unfair dismissal claims. I commend the government on that change. This may help to remove some of the more extraordinary decisions where procedure has taken precedence over substance. However, two significant problems remain. The first is the issue of the burden of proof. Employers will still bear the burden of proving that the dismissal of an employee was valid. This reversal of the burden of proof been a major problem for small businesses and has given rise to a few notable judgments. In the case of Mac's Foods, an employee was accused of stealing money from the till. The member for Werriwa said that that would ensure the person would be dismissed. But listen to this, Mr Deputy Speaker: other employees had claimed that the sacked worker had admitted to taking the money. The court said that there had not been adequate proof of theft. They required virtually a criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt and they dismissed the management's investigation as 'amateur sleuthing'. The employee was awarded $7,000 compensation as well as getting his job back. There are very few small businesses with the resources to investigate the wrongdoings by staff and then bear the burden of proof of establishing the guilt of staff members to the standard required by the public prosecutor; yet that has been one of the consequences of this reversal of the burden of proof. In the case of Conagra Wool, the company was forced to pay $11,660 to a worker who had been absent for 35 days over a two-year He period, including 20 days without a medical certificate. He was given two written warnings, counselled and placed on a monthly was review, during which his unexplained absences continued. The court found that the employer was in breach because the company could not prove that the man was not ill on the day he was eventually sacked. What a remarkable set of circumstances. This was a clear case of a stunning reversal of the burden of proof which most Australians would ordinarily expect to be the case. The second problem which remains for business is that the legislation still stipulates that temporary absence from work because of illness or injury cannot be valid grounds for dismissal. So the Conagra Wool case, where the worker had 35 sick days in two years, cannot be regarded as a valid ground for termination of employment. A remarkable set of circumstances. Just how ludicrous this can become was highlighted in the case of SCI Operations. In has that case a man had been sacked for being absent for 21f2 years and was given his job back with $15,500. The worker had been on leave during a period of incapacity and was eventually sacked after refusing a number of offers to return to work. It is truly remarkable that somebody can be absent from the workplace for 2Y2 years and the company is ""till obliged to take the worker back on. How do government members support that sort of situation? Thus, small business remains wary of the fact that chronic absenteeism cannot constitute grounds for validly terminating a worker's employment. The government's amendments in this bill do not address this key point. I tum to the strain on the Industrial Relations Court. The government has also tried to take the strain off the Industrial Relations Court by providing that all unfair dismissal cases will first go to the Industrial Relations Commission. That would seem fair enough on the surface. Previously, all cases went to the court, which could then refer them back to the commission for conciliation. Now the commission will deal with the matter first. The commission can endeavour to conciliate the matter and, failing that, can arbitrate the matter if both parties agree to be bound by the commission's findings. There is no compulsory arbitration, only 'consent arbitration'. Because of limitations on the Commonwealth's conciliation and arbitration power in section 51 of the constitution, the Industrial Relations Commission has traditionally been restricted to settling industrial disputes which have an interstate character. This was usually done by compulsory arbitration. The federal government is also wary of having the Industrial Relations Commission exercising anything which could be construed as judicial powers. This was the problem with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which the High Court held in the Brandy case was wrongly hearing and determining matters in a manner similar to a court. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was making binding judgments about discrimination matters and awarding compensation. The High Court said that only a properly constituted court under division 3 of the constitution could exercise these powers. This constitutional separation of powers poses problems for the speedy resolution of unfair dismissal claims. While the commission can conciliate the matter and can arbitrate if both parties agree, they cannot bring about a compulsory arbitrated outcome-again a problem that I am sure the assistant minister at the table will understand. If they did, they would be operating very much like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was prior to the High Court decision in the Brandy case. If either party wants to go to court, they can. Having done that, the Industrial Relations Court must hear the matter de novo. Thus, the capacity for the commission to relieve the workload for the court is strictly limited. On the very day that Minister Brereton foreshadowed the amendments to the act, Mr Ross Levin of the law firm Clayton Utz was reported on AAP as saying that the number of claims would not be reduced. He claimed that as long as employees could force the matter to go before the Industrial Relations Court, they would do so-seeking large compensation payments. Thus, while the amendments make some progress in re-emphasising the merits of unfair dismissal cases rather than the procedural details, problems remain. The onus of proof still remains firmly with the employer; absenteeism cannot be a valid ground for dismissal; and constitutional limitations on Commonwealth power mean that the flow of claims to the Industrial Relations Court may not be stemmed in the near future. There remain problems in industrial relations. The chopping and changing that has gone on with this legislation in its IS-month history is symbolic of the remarkable state of industrial relations in Australia. In relation to the current Industrial Relations Act, Professor Andrew Stewart, an expert in industrial law at Flinders University, on the Business Report said: I don't think you would find any industrial lawyer or industrial relations practitioner in this country who would be prepared to say that this current piece of legislation-forgetting its content, just in terms of the way it is put together and the amount of detail it contains, is a good piece of legislationit isn't. He went on to say: Since 1988, when the Industrial Relations Act was first introduced, the size of the statute has, I would say, almost doubled ... they are becoming harder and har-er to understand, attempting to overregulate In many cases and they in the end impose a great deal of cost on everyone who uses the system--on anyone who wants to litigate, on anyone who wants to seek advice. Really it's the lawyers who've been the winner out of the industrial relations system for the last few years. Far from making a good system better, as Minister Brereton would have us believe these changes make a disastrous system barely workable. What is perhaps most surprising was the ease with which the trade union movement embraced the changes to the unfair dismissal laws. (Time expired)",121
397,Mr SWAN,OTHER LEGIS LA TION AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 amends six acts to amend the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act of 1988. As the Metal Trades Industry Association has observed, these changes are regarded positively by employers. We have also had some positive comment from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which said: We welcome this bill, which implements the Federal Government's recent commitment to amend procedural fairness laws, to specifically recognise voluntary arbitration by the Industrial Relations Commission in the Act, to provide that applications are made to the Commission not the Court, and to preserve the operations of the more realistic state systems. Realistically, it is fair to say that the governm-nt has had some problems in trying to stnke a balance with this legislation but that we have got there on this occasion. I think it is worth remembering that this legislation was required in the first place because the action of conservative state gov-rnments, particularly Victoria, was simply to np away the whole award system. That is why this legislation was necessary. Basic protections, in states like Victoria, were withdrawn from workers. Those workers deserve to have some protection, so the Commonwealth moved in this area and in a number of other areas to provide those minimum protections. Ultimately, responsibility for this legislation coming in in the first place rests with the conservative state governments, particularly that in Victoria. The opposition would have us believe that this and other parts of the Industrial Relations Act have such a negative influence on business that we do not have any employment growth, we do not have high investment, and we do not have any productivity growth. That is nonsense. We have very high employment growth-680,000-odd jobs since March 1993-and we have very strong productivity growth. These are very significant achievements which have been built on the backs of workers making very considerable sacrifices, as reflected in the cuts to real wages in recent times. Workers made those sacrifices in the interests of making us more competitive, in the interests of job creation, in the interests of the long-tenn future of the country. I get a little bit saddened when I hear contributions from those opposite that fail to recognise that fact. Undoubtedly, there have been some pretty horrendous examples of what has occurred on some sides of the ledger with the unfair dismissal laws. But, equally, there would have been many cases where these basic protections have been entirely justified, justifying the existence of legislation such as this. You never hear that from those opposite. You just get this one-sided view of the world. The Accord, and all of the legislative provisions that go with it, has delivered very great benefits to the economy, and to employers and employees. I recently read a speech made by the head of the MTIA in New South  the unfair dismissal legislation, he said that the MTIA in his state had been able to achieve positive gains for employers. He went on to make other important comments about the general business environment. He said: Australian industry has been performing strongly over the past few years. Manufacturing is presently growing by almost 50 per cent-faster than the overall economy. Production levels are up by more than a fifth in real terms since 1991, accounting for a quarter of total output growth in the Australian economy over the last four years Mr Truss- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.

(2) How many placements have actually been made under the training wage in each month of 1994-95 to date. (3) How many of the training wage placements have been made under the Job Compact. (4) How many placements were made with (a) private and (b) public sector employers (i) in total and (ii) in each month in 1994-95 to date. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No monthly targets were set for the employment of unemployed persons as trainees in Working Nation. (2) As at 10 May 1995, there were 10,120 recorded trainee commencements under training Month (1994-95) July August September October November December January February March April It is expected that the number of traineeships Companies begin operating and the new Training Wage dictions. NA wage arrangements, including placements under the Australian Traineeship and Career Start Traineeship Systems. (3) The number of traineeship placements under the Job Compact should be viewed in the context of overall Job Compact outcomes. In the financial year to the end of April, 144,165 Job Compact clients achieved an outcome which ceased their CES registration and Newstart Allowance. DSS data indicates that around 60 per cent of these found employment, many as a result of assistance provided by the CES: 47,960 Job Compact jobseekers have been placed in permanent jobs by the CES, including 40,255 placed with the assistance of a wage subsidy or employment program. 560 of these placements have involved traineeships; the remaining 96,205 had moved into full time employment, further education, withdrawn from the labour market or transferred to another benefit such as Sickness Allowance or Disability Support Pension. (4) As at 10 May 1995,9052 trainee commencements were recorded with private sector employers and 1068 trainee commencements recorded with public sector employers. Commencements by month and sector were: Private Public 601 175 804 176 522 54 551 33 396 4 140 12 847 14 1853 126 1705 331 1633 143 will increase in 1995 as NETTFORCE Industry Training provisions come into effect in the various jurisLabour Market Programs: Subsidised Employment (Question No. 2046) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 8 February 1995: (1) How many persons were in subsidised employment in each labour market program and industry adjustment program in each month since March 1993. (2) Is a breakdown by State and Territory of the figures referred to in part (1) available; if so, what are they; if not, why not. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Data on persons in subsidised employment at the level of detail sought would take substantial Departmental resources to produce. The following data therefore includes the number of clients who commenced a subsidised employment placement under a labour market program each month since March 1993. TAP data include only those commencements which are subsidised employment. Training courses are also funded under TAP.

In February 1994 general access to JobStart wage subsidy assistance was withdrawn for jobseekers unemployed between 6 and 12 months. This category of participants had represented a substantial proportion of JobStart business. In addition, the better than expected employment growth during 1994-95 has had an impact on demand for some labour market programs, with many jobseekers obtaining unsubsidised employment. It should also be noted that Working Nation introduced a wider range of employment and training labour market programs in order to meet the needs of individual employers and jobseekers. This has had an impact on commencements in individual programs. The following data does not include labour market training program commencements. The experience of the last twelve months in implementing Working Nation's Job Compact has been that employers have expressed a strong preference for new employees being 'job ready'. Working Nation has responded to this by placing a stronger than anticipated emphasis on training programs rather than subsidised employment programs.

(3) Has the ASC investigated claims (a) by an independent analyst that the prospectus provides sensitivity analysis and pre-tax intemal-rate-ofreturn analysis commencing at a level of average daily traffic volume that project consultants acknowledge are unlikely to be attained and, (b) that the conclusions of the prospectus rely on a report prepared by consultants who were paid $1.2 million by the contractors for project design work thus compromising the consultants' independence; if so, what are the results of the investigations; if not, will he cause the claims to be investigated. (4) What action (a) can be taken and (b) will he cause to be taken to protect investors if the failure of the prospectus to meet the relevant requirements causes them to suffer losses.",152
445,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that on 17 November 1994 the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) registered the prospectus issued by the Hills Motorway Limited and the Hills Motorway Trust, dated 7 November 1994, in accordance with the section 1020A of the Corporations Law. Section 1020A of the Corporations Law requires the ASC to register a prospectus within 14 days unless it appears that the prospectus does not comply with the tions Law, or the ASC forms the opinion that the prospectus contains a false or misleading statement or that there is a material omission. The Attomeydamage General has no role in the registration of prospecinvolved tuses and accordingly, I have no detailed knowincluding ledge of the Hills Motorway prospectus. (2) (a) The ASC advises that the NSW's Auditorreports General's performance audit of 31 January 1995 has been drawn to its attention and it is of the that the audit raised no new issues that warranted ASC action. (b) I am advised that the ASC has been provided with the document prepared by RJ Tanner entitled Motorway : Hills Motorway Trust, The Hills circumstances Motorway Limited, A financial analysis of operdirect ations after construction dated 4 April 1995 and reviewed that report in the context of other reavailable ports_made available to the ASC. The ASC advises that the analysis of RJ Tanner diverged in a prospectus number of respects from the projections in prospectus. I am further advised that the ASC is unable to comment on the likelihood of any particular set of projections being achieved and seeks to satisfy itself, on the basis of its inquiries, that any forecasts or projections would appear to have a reasonable basis. On the basis of information provided and after consideration of the circumstances in which those reports were obtained, the ASC formed the view that there appeared to a reasonable basis for the forecasts tus in relation to traffic volumes and potential rates of return. (3)(a) I am advised that the ASC conducted inquiries into the projections in the prospectus during the offer period. The ASC has subsequently considered the report of RJ Tanner those earlier inquiries and a number of experts' reports. The ASC advises that it does not attempt to resolve differences between projections made in a prospectus and those made by some other party provided the projections in the prospectus appear to have been made on a reasonable basis. (b) I am advised that the payment to the traffic expert, Gutteridge, Haskins and Davey Pty Ltd, who provided project design work for the Hills Motorway project, was disclosed in the prospectus. After consideration of the circumstances in which the original report was provided, the circumstances of the payment and other reports known to the directors, I am advised that the ASC decided not to Corporapursue any further action at that time. (4)(a) Under the Corporations Law investors have statutory rights of action to recover, for any loss or that they may suffer, against persons in the preparation of the prospectus, directors who signed the prospectus and experts who consented to the inclusion of their in the prospectus, where statements in the prospectus prove to be false or misleading, or there view is a material omission from the prospectus. (b) I am advised that the ASC will continue to monitor the performance of the project in light of the information contained in the prospectus and will take any action considered appropriate, should the arise. Therefore, I do not propose to the ASC to investigate the matter. As stated has in my answer to question 4(a), remedies are to investors under the Corporations Law for loss or damage suffered where statements in a prove to be false or misleading or there the is a material omission from the prospectus.
