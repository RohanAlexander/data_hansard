1,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I - wish to know from the Minister for the N a v y if he intends to remove the training snip Tingira from her present mooring at Rose Bay? If not, 'will the honourable gentleman make provision for the sick ,to receive medical attention off the ship, and provide for new arrivals to bo medically examined before they board the ship, to prevent epidemics of sickness in the cradle of our Australian Navy?",4
2,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The removal from Rose Bay of the training ship Tingira has been under the consideration of the Naval Board, and we have received from 2.30 Commander Robins a report suggesting that, in view of the possibility of epidemics breaking out on board, it might be advisable to remove the vessel from Port Jackson to some other Australian of port. That suggestion is .under consideration. I have called for a report as to the Andercost incurred in providing moorings at Rose Bay, laying on water and telephone communication, and other expenditure which I believe was considerable, and also for an estimate of the cost of making the vessel seaworthy for a journey to some other port, which I believe would be very large. I might inform the House that I must be assured that the removal of the vessel from Rose Bay is absolutely necessary before I shall consent to it . Later,",4
3,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,Is it intended to remove the vessel to Port Phillip?,5
4,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I have already answered the question. No decision has yetbeen come to. MINISTERIAL STATEMENT. THE WAR-BUSINES S OF PAREIAMENT.,5

6,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"In the first place, let business-paper me declare clearly the policy of the Gocipation vernment with regard to the war.

8,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I thank the right honourable member for reminding me of it . AB ill will be introduced to give effect to the. Agreement, and, as doubt has raised as to the liability of the Commonwealth under the Agreement, we propose to state in plain language that it shall not exceed £1,000,000.

9,Mr RIOHAED EOSTEE,Unknown,Has the Prime Minister a statement to make to the House and to the country as to the progress which he has made in securing wheat charters for the coming harvest?,5
10,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,A Conference to decide the rate of freight will take place tomorrow.,5
11,Mr BUBOHEIX,Unknown,"I ask whether the is not out of order, as it anticipates one of which notice has been given? Mr RICHAH D POSTER - My question and 'deals with a different matter.",5
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is, of course, i m possible for me to keep in mind every question of which notice appears on the for the day; but the antiof such questions is out of order. - I can hardly see that there is such antibe cipation in this case, and I think that the Minister is entitled to reply to the ques- I shall furnish a a comreply to the question of the honourable member for Wakefield, b ut I may inform a the honourable gentleman that the information he has asked for cannot be given ask at the present moment, because the Conference to which I have referred is alone The Conferon ence will meet on Friday, and may probaby continue its deliberations over We shall announce the rates of freight, and proceed A to its allotment as early as possible. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. APPOINTMENT OF OFFICERS.",5
13,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I desire to make a statement on .behalf of the Minister of Defence, in reply to statements made yesterday by the honourable members for Newcastle and Melbourne. Leave granted.",5
14,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,In reply to the statebeen ments made in the House yesterday,5
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"On a point of order. The honourable member has frequently asked for leave to make statements of this kind. I do not object at all; in fact, I welcome them, and I think that a statement on this subject ought to be made. At the same time, I suhmit that statements of this character should be laid upon the table of the House, and not made in the way the honourable member proposes. If the honourable member will lay his statement on the table, and then move that it be printed, some other honourable member may have an opportunity of discussing it. As it is, honourable members cannot do that.",6
16,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Will the honourable member state his point of order?,6
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"My point of order is that it is not in order for a statement affecting administration and policy to be made, under cover of the leave of the House, without an opportunity being given for any honourable member to reply. It appears to me that, in this respect, we are developing a system that is wrong.",6
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The point of order raised by the honourable member has been considered by me and, I think, by former Speakers on frequent occasions. The practice of honourable members asking for leave to make statements has somehow grown up, and requests for such leave seem to become more frequent as time goes on. The House, in its generous mood, offers no objection, with the result that a statement is frequently made to which several honourable members may desire an opportunity of reply. Then difficulty arises. The whole system is irregular, but I am in the unfortunate position that when an honourable member asks for leave to make a statement it is my duty to ask if the House will sanction the granting of that leave. The point raised by the right honourable gentleman raises the question as to whether there is likely to be anything in the statement the Minister now proposes to make that may call for reply. If it were desired to make a reply, the only way that could be done under present circumstances would be for some other honourable member to ask for leave, and the whole thing might go on indefinitely, and, of course, irregularly. Some better method of dealing with matters of this kind might he adopted than that which has hitherto been accepted.",6
19,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,Unknown,The honourable member may conclude with a motion.,6
20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the practice develops of an honourable member moving that a paper be printed, the Standing Orders will be practically set at naught, for there may follow endless debates on matters which may be important or unimportant, whilst the actual business of the House will he.lost sight of. In that case the Standing Orders would have to be suspended entirely, or a new set of Standing. Orders drawn up to meet the situation. What I suggest is that leave shpuld be granted in those cases whore it is desired, to make a statement of sufficient importance to warrant this course being pursued, hut not otherwise.",6
21,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"As I understand the statement that the Minister desires to make follows upon remarks made by me yesterday, I think correct procedurewould be established if I were to repeat' the question now. I therefore ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence why it is that officers have been appointed to supersede those officers who have heen recommended for appointment by the Commandant and Board in New South Wales?",6
22,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"In reply to the statements made yesterday by the honourable member for Newcastle and the honourable member for Melbourne in reference to the appointment of officers in the Australia. I m p e r i a l Forces, w h o were not fit t » lead the m e n , the Minister for D e f e n c e makes the following s t at e m e n t : The statement is a general one, and, considering it as a general statement, it is most certainly inaccurate. No officer is sent away in cliarge of men unless he is qualified for his position and passes the necessary tests, which are of a practical as well as a theoretical character. He also has to be recommended by the Selection Committee of the District, the. Commandant of the District, and the AdjutantGeneral of the M i l it a r y Board. That the officers so chosen have justified their selection, is shown by the many eulogistic references that have been received from those in command at the front, and also b j ' the fact that many of the junior officers have been the recipients of honours conferred for distinguished service. Amongst the thousands or officers who have had to be appointed, it is of course possiblethat there may be some who have not been fairly selected, and if the honourable members, who make the general statement have knowledge of such cases, and will bring them under the notice of the Minister, he will have ai thorough investigation made - with a view to rectifying them. The Minister, therefore, appeals to the two members requesting to supply Aim with specific information so that he can have the necessary inquiries made.",6
23,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Will the Minister for the Navy, as representing the Minister of Defence, make available to honourable members the qualifications of the officers appointed to officer the A r m y Service Corps U n it now at the Warren, Marrickville, New South Wales, who were appointed directly from Melbourne, against 4he recommendations of the special Officers Appointment Committee established in New South Wales?",7
24,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I will lay the papers - on the Library table this afternoon. EXPOET OE MEAT .,7
25,Mr EODGERS,Unknown,"Will the Minister of Trade and Customs in f o rm the House which Australian ports have received permission to export beef, mutton, or lamb, and to which Australian ports that permission has been refused. Will the M in ister also state why any discrimination has been made?",7
26,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Permissio n has been granted to those States which have agreed to the condition that meat should be made available to the people of Australia at the same price as it is placed f.o.b. Directly meat exporters in Yictoria f all int o line, they will receive exactly the same permission that has heen granted, in other States. TELEPHONERATE S.",7
27,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether, in consequence of the threatened increase in the telephone charges, a large number of old subscribers have given notice that they propose to discontinue their service? If so, is it the intention of the honourable gentleman to withdraw from the proposed increases, and thus, while giving greater services to the public, securing a larger revenue ?",7
28,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I have no knowledge as to whether or not a number of old subscribers have 'given notice of their intent i o n to withdraw from the service. As to the second part of the honourable member's question, when I have had time to consider the matter, I shall furnish him - with a reply.",7
29,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"In respect to the contemplated increase in the telephone Tates, will the Postmaster-General consider ithe question whether there should not be discrimination between the count r y and the capital cities?",7
30,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I shall review the whole question at the earliest opportunity, and let the honourable member know of my decision. ESTIMATES.",7
31,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I wish to ask the Treasurer whether he intends to place the Estimates upon the table of the House before the Christmas vacation takes place ?,7
32,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"It is not intended to lay the Estimates on the table of the House before the adjournment. They have not yet been finally dealt with . SMALL ARMS FACTORY. Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNSON - I wish to ask the Minister, of Home Affairs whether it is correct, as reported in the Sydney press, that, without waiting for parliamentary authority, it is proposed to proceed with the erection of a Small Arms Factory at Canberra ? If so, will the Minister further consider the matter with' a view of deciding whether, in the present crisis , it would not be more 1 advantageous to make additions to, and increase the output of, the factory already in existence at Lithgow ?",7
33,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,I shall give immediate consideration to the matter. CIVILANDMILITARY .SERVICE PAY.,7
34,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Will the Minister for the Navy, as representing the M in ister of Defence, cause inquiries to be made into my statement that a number of State and Commonwealth public servants are drawing double pay-on e as public servants and the other as military officers-at the Camps?",7
35,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I shall be glad to have an inquiry made and to report the result to the House. CONSCRIPTION .,7
36,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"I desire to congratulate the Prime Minister on his appointment and, in wishing him success, to ask whether, when the referendum is being taken, he will give the electors an opportunity of voting on the question of whether or not they favour conscription ?",7
37,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his congratulations. The Government will not put an eighth question, of that kind at all events, to the people. NA CONWAYTOWN.",7

41,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,Will the Minister of Home Affairs be prepared to reconsider the decision of his Department in regard to the application made by the mill-owners and mill-workers of Tasmania respecting the supply of sleepers for the transcontinental railway ? Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - I shall look into the matter ,8
42,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Mill s are closing down. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - I shall consider the matter tomorrow. NORTHERN TERRITORY. NATIONALIZATION OF THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC.  External Affairs state whether it is a fact that the nationalization of the liquor industry in the Northern Territory occasioned an immediate increase of 100 per cent, in the pay of those engaged in the trade, and whether such increases have been made contrary to the advice of the officers on the spot?",8
43,Mr MAHON,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"It is quite correct that, on the hotels at Port Darwin being taken over by the Government, a demand was made for increased wages on the ground that, having regard to the conditions of the country, those which had been prevailing for some time were inadequate In one or two cases, I think, the increase amounted to about 100 per cent., but the total increase is comparatively insignificant. The honourable member, I am sure, will be gratified to hear that the new industry taken over by the Commonwealth Government is flourishing, and is likely to be very remunerative.  know what are the reasons for the closing of Brock's Creek Hotel!",8
44,Mr MAHON,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"So far as I can make out, the reason seems to be that the patrons of this particular hotel have been reduced to some two white men and a blackfellow.  answer of the Minister is given on reliable information, and I therefore desire to know whether he will place the papers regarding this hotel on the table,or in the Library, so that we may see whether the patrons of the hotel do consist' of two white men and a blackfellow ?",8
45,Mr MAHON,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"I shall endeavour to give the honourable member all the information available in the Department.  ter of External Affairs think it derogatory to the best interests of the country that the Commonwealth should engage in a trade which he says is remunerative, but which means remuneration at the expense of the bodies and souls of many thousands of individuals?",8
46,Mr MAHON,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,The honourable gentleman has raised a very controversial question which he can hardly expect me to answer on the spur of the moment. I assumed he would be interested in the fact that the Commonwealth was not losing any money in this business.  make any money in such a business.,8
47,Mr MAHON,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"I assume, however, that the honourable member will he glad to know that we are at last engaged in a remunerative Conunonwealth enterprise.",8
48,Mr MATHEWS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Accordin g to the press, there has been a strike in connection with the hotels in the Northern Territory; and I should like to know whether the Minister of External Affairs has any information regarding it? Has this first strike finished, or is it still going on?",8
49,Mr MAHON,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,I think the strike is over.,8
50,Mr MATHEWS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"How long did they do without their beer? That is what I should like to know. Mr Mahon"" - As a matter of fact, the bars were all closed; but I believe the principal inconvenience was experienced in connection with the dining rooms. GERMAN TRADE NAMES.",9
51,Dr CARTY SALMON,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Has Prime Minister further considered the effects of the recent action of the Government respecting the issue of licenses to use certain German trade names, such as "" aspirin "" ? If not, wil l he give the House an opportunity to consider and take a vote upon the advisability of retaining such trade names?",9
52,Mr HUGHES,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"I explained yesterday the position of the Government in regard to this matter. I am afraid that no opportunity of dealing with this question can be given other than that which will be afforded honourable members on the motion for Supply ? If the honourable member has any suggestion to make-if he has any specific case in his mind where an in justice is being done, or an opening has not been availed of - I shall be glad to hear of it , with a view of taking what steps may be necessary. FEDERAL CAPITAL. PARLIAMENTAR Y BUILDINGS .",9
53,Mr FINLAYSON,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Is it true, as reported in the press, that the Government nave decided to abandon the competition for designs for the new parliamentary buildings at Canberra, and, if so, what are the reasons for such action ?",9
54,Mr KING OMALLEY,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"I have not yet had time to look into these matters. I find that my Ministerial digest has gone, and I shall not he able to afford the desired information u n t i l I get started again. MANUFACTURE OF MUNITIONS .  ister intend to confirm the reply given by the ex-Prime Minister to the railway employees of Sydney, who offered their services gratuitously in the manufacture of munitions?",9
55,Mr HUGHES,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"I must ask the honourable member to put that question to the Minister who represents the Minister of Defence, or to place it on the notice-paper, [253] when I shall endeavour to get the information and make it available-perhap s tomorrow. CONTINENTAL PASSPORTS.",9
56,Mr MANIFOLD,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"H as any complaint been made that the passports issued by the Department of External Affairs have been found insufficient in the case of the travellers crossing France? If no complaints have been made, will the Minister inquire into the matter, as I understand that people have had to pay heavy fees for neAV passports on arrival in that country?",9
57,Mr MAHON,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"This is the first in timation I have had of any complaint regarding passports. I cannot conceive of any objection to the passports, because they are issued in the latest form adopted by the Imperial Government, and I fancy that if any serious trouble had arisen the Department would have heard of it before now. However, if the honourable member knows of any complaints, and will let me know the particulars, I shall have in quiries made. PRICE OF MEAT .",9
58,Mr RODGERS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,On what constitutional authority does the Minister of Trade and Customs rely for his action in determining the price of meat in Australia ?,9
59,Mr TUDOR,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,I am not determining the price of meat in Australia.,9
60,Mr RODGERS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,You have just said you were.,9
61,Mr TUDOR,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"No . All I say is that when the meat exporters of Victoria enter into the same agreement that has been entered into in New South ""Wales and Queensland, they may export under similar conditions.",9
62,Mr RODGERS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,But what as to the price ?,9
63,Mr TUDOR,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"In New South ""Wales and Queensland meat is being made available to the butchers at the price at which it is placed on board ship.",9
64,Mr RODGERS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,You insist on that condition here?,9
65,Mr TUDOR,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,Yes .,9
66,Mr RODGERS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Right ; that will do. TELEPHONE "" LISTENERS.""",9
67,Mr SINCLAIR,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Is it the intention of the Postmaster-General to continue the practice of employing "" listeners "" to hear conversations between telephone subscribers ?",9

ENOGGERA BARRACKS . Report of the Public Works Committee, with an appendix, on the provision of barracks, quarters, gun park, & c , for the Royal Australian Field Artillery , Enoggera, Queensland, presented by Mr . RILEV , and ordered to be printed. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). PAYMENT OF SOLDIEBS AND DEPENDANTS.",10
71,Mr SPEAKER,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Corio, in which he expresses his desire to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" the inadequate system of the Defence Department in paying its soldiers and their dependants."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",10
72,Mr OZANNE,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Corio) [ 3 . 1 0 ] sire to enter a most emphatic protest in regard to the disorganization which exists in the Defence Department, particularly in connection with the payments made, or supposed to be made, to soldiers and their dependants. I regret that such a motion should he necessary when a Labour A d ministration is in office. This matter has caused me a great deal of work and anxiety during the last six months, and if I could see the slightest prospect of a discontinuance of the present state of disorganization, I would preserve silence. But, as time goes on, I find the conditions becoming worse. There are a number of cases of injustice to which I could allude, but I desire to bring under notice the particular case of Private P. Ryan. Neither this soldier nor his wife has received any payment from the Defence Department LONDON. since the month of August. Several letters have heen written to the Department by both Private and Mrs Ryan, but to not one of them did the Department have the courtesy to reply. On the 9 th September this case was placed before me, and I at once wrote to the Paymaster in Victoria, Mr Bolle, giving hi m all the facts. A f t e r waiting a week, I received a reply to the effect that Private Ryan and his wif e had received all the money due to them, and, as this soldier had lef t the Expeditionary Forces without permission, he would receive no further payment. I investigated the case thoroughly. I found that Ryan enlisted at Geelong, and was transferred to Seymour, where he was placed in "" S "" company. Becoming ill , he was sent into hospital at Sandringham House. A f t e r being there for some time he was advised to return home for a week's rest, and to then report himself at Seymour. At the end of a week spent at his home in Geelong he returned to Seymour, and found that his company had been transferred. He saw the Camp Commandant, who could only advise him to return to Geelong, and await further directions. He did so. While at Geelong he became ill again, and was placed in Osborne House, where he still remains. I placed all those facts before the Paymaster, and - asked him to have them verified. To that communication I received no reply. Again I wrote, pointing out that the wife was penniless, that one child was sick unto death, that the family was nearly starv- I de- ing, and that the owner of the house in which they reside had given them notice to quit, because they were in arrears with the rent. Still I received no reply. I then sent a telegram of ahout thirty-two words to Senator Pearce, placing the facts before him, and asking him to investigate the case at once. Receiving no answer to that telegram, I sent a further message that the child had died, and that the wif e had no money with which to make arrangements for the funeral. But for the charity of a few friends, God knows what would have happened to the unfortunate woman. Still I received no reply. After a few days I came to Melbourne, and got into touch with Colonel Thomas, a member of the Finance Board. He informed me that my telegram had been handed over to him. I asked him if he had done anything in the matter, and his reply was ""No, I am just about to make inquiries."" I asked him if that was a fair way to treat a man and his wife when they were giving their all for their country, and, like the usual official, he was silent. Ultimately he did promise that he would make inquiries. heard nothing further from him. Last week I interviewed the Assistant Minister of Defence, Senator Gardiner, and he agreed with me that the treatment meted out to Private Ryan was not that which a soldier should receive. He sent a note to Colonel Thomas, and we waited twenty-five minutes without getting any reply. Senator Gardiner then said, "" Apparently the officers cannot discover anything regarding the case of Private Ryan; we will go to lunch, and I will guarantee to have the matter settled this afternoon, and to advise you by letter of the result of the investigation."" I returned to Geelong, and next morning received a letter from Senator Gardiner. After nearly six weeks of writing, telegraphing, and personal inquiry, I was advised by Senator Gardiner that the Defence Department knew nothing about Private P. Ryan, and I was asked to send further particulars. The Assistant Minister's letter also stated that the Department was telegraphing to Ryan's mother for particulars. I do not know what she had to do with the case; she had never complained to me, and"" my representations to the Department were solely on behalf of the wife. This morning I received a letter from Geelong, stating that the agent had given Mrs Ryan until next morning to vacate the house. Apparently, some landlords think that it pays to preach patriotism, but not to practise it. It is a scandalous state of affairs when a woman to whom the Department is indebted, and whose husband is offering his life for his country cannot be trusted by the landlord for a few shillings.",10
73,Mr RODGERS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"If the Department had done its duty, there would not have heen any trouble with the landlord. [253]- 2 Mr OZAlSnSTE - Undoubtedly , the Department is to blame. But I may inform the House that I placed the whole of the facts before the agent. He is aware that certain sums are due to the woman from this Department, and why cannot he wait for his money until she receives that payment ? I have brought before the Department many cases of this kind. In the case of Private Hargreaves, after six weeks' hard fighting, I obtained an admission from the Department that 105 days' pay was due to that man. Is it just to keep a soldier and his dependants waiting 105 days for their money? ""What I would the Minister of Defence say, if he were at the front, and received word that his wife was to be turned out of her home, and that his children were starving? I fancy that, however great his patriotism might be, his resentment would be strong. I had no desire to occupy the time of the House in bringing forward these grievances, hut I am compelled to adopt tlus course when I am unable to get satisfaction from any of the officials. I have found that in many cases the wives have been short-paid. They receive the correct amount for the first fortnight, but they may be paid £ 1 or 30s. short for the next fortnight, while, in some cases which I have fixed up, as soon as the matter has been settled the Department has the happy knack of forgetting to pay for a fortnight. I could read many letters which would serve to place all the facts before honourable members, but here is one communication in reference to a case I took up on behalf of a private in GeelongI want to thank you for having inquired at the district head-quarters about pay being due to mc for the period 29th July to 15th August. I received the letter sent on by you saying that the amount due, £4 10s., had been received by me on the ith inst. Unfortunately, that statement is absolutely incorrect, because I have not received that pay yet. This was written on the 27th October. If the disorganization which undoubtedly exists in this Department which is managing our great Defence scheme, and on which the life of our nation depends, is common to all the Commonwealth Departments, God help Australia! I find also that as soon as a man is transferred from one unit to another, the Department seems to lose him, and he is missing from the pay-sheet. If a soldier becomes sick, and is sent away from his particular company, he receives no more pay, neither does his wife. Here is another letter which I receivedI beg to draw your attention to the unsatisfactory conditions under which we in camp suffer, namely, from sick pay. I enlisted the 3rd day of August, and the last pay I received was 15th August. I left camp on Friday last, 22nd October, and never received any money except for the first fortnight. My case is not the only one. There is a large number in the same position and worse. What is wrong with the Department? Cannot the official mind introduce a scheme to overcome the difficulty of transfers? I have told Senator Pearce that I have had considerable experience in dealing with large numbers of men, making out their payments of different values, and of transferring men from one unit to another, and that if his Department was not capable of introducing a system to meet this difficulty, I would be pleased to help him. Unfortunately, Senator Pearce is like some other Ministers. They are not desirous of receiving help. They do not seem desirous of fighting the various heads of their Departments, and are sufficiently complacent to let the machine run on in the good old way. the Prime Minister read a message fro m the K in g ; in which His Majesty called for more men to save the Empire from annihilation. I ask honourable members whether the matters that I have brought forward indicate a way to encourage recruiting. These men who are prepared to give their lives for their country want to be satisfied when they go away that their wives and children whom they leave behind w i ll be looked after, and this is the way in which a paternal Government, and particularly a Labour Government, is looking after them. These men are patriots. They are ready to fight and. die for their country, but the treatment does not seem to be peculiar to Australia. In yesterday's issue of the Melbourne Herald the following cablegram appearedIt is a scandal that convalescent Australian and New Zealand soldiers should be forced to sleep on the Thames Embankment. Even there they arc moved on by the police. They are enduring hardships, are friendless, receiving no pay, and are stranded. It is a most remarkable thing that when any highly-paid head of a Department or official makes a blunder, nothing is said, but if an unfortunate private does not return from leave in time to fulfil his duties, he is heavily fined. The other day Mr Ozanne. two privates who were escorting some p r i soners from New South Wales allowed two of them to escape. What happened? They are to be court-martialled. Is it not time that some - of the men in the Department who are responsible for the disgraceful conditions to which I have drawn attention should be court-martialled?",11
74,Mr BURNS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,They should be sent to the front.,12
75,Mr OZANNE,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"As they are of no use here, they would be of no use there. At the front, men of ability are wanted, men who will be able to uphold the honour of our country. If men would manage matters at the front in the way in which they manage them here, they would be useless there. We have had a reconstruction of our Ministry. It seems to me that reconstruction should extend through many of our Departments.",12
76,Mr SPEAKER,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,Order !,12
77,Mr OZANNE,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"However , I ask the Minister to consider these matters earnestly, so that all anxiety will be taken from the shoulders of the men who go to Yesterday the front. The men who have done such magnificent work at Gallipoli, the men who I am sure will follow in their footsteps, and the heroines at home who are giving these men to the Empire, are worthy of the utmost consideration from the Government, and I appeal to the Minister to go into the cases which I have brought forward, and re-organize his Department in such a way that a similar scandalous state of affairs will be impossible in the future.",12
78,Mr KELLY,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Wentworth) [3.2S] The House is indebted to the honourable member who has brought this matter forward, and I would like to trespass on the patience of honourable members for a few moments in the same spirit in which the motion was moved, in order to urge'with repeated emphasis on the Minister's attention the desirableness of effecting reforms by creating an atmosphere of responsibility among the officers who are administering the Defence Department. One thing that stands out at the present time, and which has always been patent to a certain extent, is the feeling that if a blunder is committed there will be no questions asked, so long as it has been committed by a person high in authority. I do not intend to throw bricks at those who are endeavouring to struggle with the difficulties connected with the organization of a force infinitely beyond the dreams of any person in Australia not so many months ago; but I am not forgetful of the fact that the great faul t in the Department for years past has been too great a concentration of responsibility and initiative in one centre in Melbourne, with negation of that responsibility and initiative at the head-quarters of the military districts in the various States, with the result that there is no one in Australia high up in the Defence Forces who is prepared to accept responsibility, display initiative, or do anything of his own accord. It is that negation of individual responsibility which is at the root of nearly all the chaos that there is in matters such as have been submitted to the House by the honourable member for Corio. Let me give honourable members an illustration. Some time ago it came to my notice that the dependants of a number of Australian soldiers, who had been sent on special duty from Egypt to Malta, were no longer being paid by the Defence Department here, on the ground that those on whom they were dependent had been struck off the strength. These men had not, in fact, heen struck off the strength, but notice had come from Egypt that they had embarked at Alexandria for some place not mentioned, and had been struck off the strength in Egypt. Thereupon the pay offices in the various States declined to meet the obligations of the Commonwealth in respect of them.",12
79,Dr MALONEY,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,How long ago was that?,13
80,Mr KELLY,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"A b o u t four months ago. I looked up the papers affecting men who had gone from Sydney, and ascertained that the paying officer in Sydney was aware of the true position. He had seen letters sent by these men from Malta to their dependants here, and knew that their allowances should be paid. He had wired and written to the Central Office for authority to pay, but had received no reply; and, in the absence of authority, he felt that he could not do anything. said, "" Do you not think that you could accept responsibility in this matter, and pay without authority?"" and, being a good man he agreed to do that. On my return to Melbourne, I mentioned the facts to the Minister, and made a statement on the subject in this chamber, when the ex-Prime Minister thanked me for having put things to rights in New South Wales. My public statement on the subject was made with the desire to secure in the other States the action that I had secured in my own State. One of the most important things that Ministers have to do is to get their executive officers in the various States to assume the responsibilities properly attaching to the positions which they hold. We want them to do tilings. There are two other matters to which I wish to refer. Nothing should move one to greater sympathy than a sight that can be witnessed in Sydney any day after the arrival of a transport in Port Jackson. Crowds of convalescents and other returned soldiers are then to be seen waiting all day long at the Victoria Barracks for instalments' of pay due to them. They have to hang about as if they were beggars, instead of being men to whom this country owes, not merely money, but the fullest gratitude and consideration. What happens in Sydney no doubt happens in the other capitals. I implore the Minister to give his personal attention to this matter, so that this affliction may no longer be thrust upon our returned men. Then there have been muddles in connection with the reception of returning soldiers, who, after having counted the hours to elapse before their arrival in Sydney, and their meeting again with their dear ones, have been kept on board their transport in harbour for twenty-four hours, merely because persons on shore were not ready with motor cars to take them round the city. What did the men care about a parade in motor cars? Their first wish was to meet again their flesh and blood; but, because of some muddle, and, perhaps, in the hope of covering it up, unnecessary suffering was imposed upon them.  ties were at the races. That is what the newspapers said.",13
81,Mr KELLY,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"I do not wish to raise that issue. I know that the Red Cross authorities had their motor cars ready. I But what the men most desired was to see again the wives, the mothers, the sisters, brothers, and fathers whom they had lef t behind. Ought they not to have been allowed to see their friends and dear ones as soon as was possible, instead of being kept waiting for twenty-four hours to cover up a departmental mistake? I do not know who was responsible for the blunder, but whoever he may have been, he should have been made to toe the mark, and then other mistakes of the k in d would not be likely. Again, nothing is'so calculated to discourage recruiting in a country like Australia as injustice to dependants. smallest town, as well as in the largest centres of population, men will say, "" How can I leave the wife whom I am supporting, or the old mother who depends on me, unless I know that she will be properly looked after in my absence ? "" Could anything be more calculated to destroy the enthusiasm of those who are f it - to serve with the colours than uncertainty as to the treatment of their dependants? I thank the honourable member for Corio for having given an opportunity for the ventilation of this matter.  listening to the remarks of the honourable member for Corio I felt that something should be said on the subject by other honourable members as well. As citizens of an Empire to which we are proud to belong, our first duty is to see that the dependants of those who are fighting for us are properly fed and clothed, and every man would be ready to raise his voice against such a state of things as the honourable member for Corio disclosed. In this case, when a father was away fighting at the front, and there was death in a home in which there was no money and no food, application was made to the Defence Department for assistance, but without response, although money was owing to the absent soldier. The case is one of the most cruel that I have heard of. Even had the mother been paid £ 5 or £ 1 0 too much, could not this great Commonwealth have afforded that expenditure on behalf of the dependants of a man who had offered his life for the defence of its existence? Some of those in authority must have hearts of stone. The honourable member for Corio appealed to them, and then received a letter from the Department telling him that they knew nothing about the case. If I were the Minister, I would make those responsible for such mistakes toe the mark. The honourable member for Wentworth said that no one would have thought twelve months ago that the Defence Department would have done as well as it has done. My opinion is that anything that military gentlemen touch they muddle. From the inception of this Parliament military administration has been a matter of muddle and mix, and get through as easily as you can.  business men.  repeatedly asked Ministers to appoint business men to deal with the business affairs of the Department. Fighting men cannot be expected to know much about business methods. Y ou would not go to the undertaker for steak, nor to the grocer for a motor car; yet our military geniuses are expected to know all about business methods, and are quite willing in many instances to give their opinions on business matters. I have never met one of them who did not think that he knew everything, not only about military matters, but also about business matters. At the same time, I agree with the honourable member for Wentworth that since the war the Department has done remarkably well. In Queensland, at all events, returned soldiers have been treated with the greatest sympathy by every man in the Defence Department, from .the officeboy to the Commandant. All assistance possible has been given to them, and their path has been made as easy as it could be made.",13
82,Mr FINLAVSON,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"No thanks to the Head-quarters Staff in Melbourne.  about that ; but surely the honourable member would give credit where credit is due? What has gone wrong in the other States can, and should, be rectified. We should not humiliate those who have served at the front, and it is not the desire of any honourable member that they should be ill-treated. But we know how careless military officers are concerning all except themselves. If there is promotion to be obtained, a captain will go to the other end of the world to be made a major, and will no sooner have attained his object than he wil l come back again to be made a lieutenant-colonel. But I have had a great deal to do with the Queensland branch of the Defence Department, and I know that everything possible has been done by its members to help the men who have returned. There are no complaints from Queensland. I hope that the Minister will look personally into the case mentioned by the honourable member for Corio. He will find that It is not the only one of the kind. There are hundreds and thousands of other cases, and the number is growing.",14
83,Mr MASSYGREENE,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Every honourable member has cases of this kind brought under his notice.  ever come to me from Queensland. Everything that the authorities there can do they do at once. But the accursed system of centralization hinders them. Sanction for everything has to be obtained in Melbourne, They dare not .buy a broom without authority from head-quarters. If they do, they are told that they are liable to have to make good the cost of their purchases. I hope that this will be the last we shall hear of the ill-treatment of the wives and families of the men fighting at the front .",15
84,Mr ORCHA RD,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Nepean) [3.45] - I congratulate the honourable member for Corio on having brought the case of P r i vate Ryan before the notice of the House. I believe with the honourable member that transfers are to a great extent responsible for the difficulties that pay officers frequently find themselves in . complaints are very prevalent in New South Wales. A man may become a contact, and be placed in the measles compound. A f t e r completing twelve days there, instead of being sent back to the base with which he was identified at the time he became a measles contact, he is transferred to some other company. result is that his name does not appear on the pay-sheets of his old company. Complaints are made not only in regard to the transfer of sick soldiers, but in regard to the ordinary transfer of men from one company to another. I am inclined to think that a good deal of the faul t is due to the fact that the pay corporals in many instances are not men possessing the necessary experience, and have not appreciated the necessity of sending the papers on at the time a transfer is made. Wives and dependants of soldiers may have been receiving their pay quite regularly, but immediately any transfer takes place, the pay system seems to break down, and the wives and dependants are unable to get their money. brought under my notice recently a case where the wife of a soldier-she had been dangerously ill , and had also lost an fant child-cam e from Manly to the payoffice in Sydney on three different occasions without being able to obtain her inoney. Her case is almost on a par with that mentioned by the honourable member for Corio. Difficulties arose simply because the man had been transferred fro m the Liverpool Camp to the Sydney Agricultural Ground. I have suggested-' that in the various camps in spectors should be appointed to interview the pay corporals every morning, and discover if during the previous day any men have been transferred from that particular company, and, if transfers have been made, whether the necessary papers have at the same time been forwarded..",15
85,Mr JH CATTS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,Surely some papers are forwarded at the time of transfer.,15
86,Mr ORCHARD,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Yes ; but I can assure the honourable member for Cook that there are hundreds of cases in New South Wales where something seems to have gone wrong on the occasion of transfers being made. Another case that came under my notice was a very hard one. Two months ago a constituent of my colleague, Brigadier-General Ryrie, wrote to me stating that she had received no pay since l l t h July. I made it my busiSimilar ness to inquire at the Victoria Barracks regarding her husband - A r t h u r John Smith-who , I understood, had l e ft with the 12th L i g ht Horse. A register was produced at the barracks, upon which Smith was marked as a deserter. I communicated with the wife, and when shea delicate woman with two children-on e The in her arms-cam e to see me. I asked her if she had any reason to believe that her husband had been left behind when his company sailed. She said she had not. "" We r e you on good terms""? I asked. "" Yes , "" she replied. "" W as he fond of his children""? ""Yes."" I told her I was sorry to say doubt has been raised as to whether her husband had actually left for the front, and that he had been marked as a deserter. I asked her if she saw her husband off. She replied that she went down to the boat and saw him on board, but did not wait u n t i l the boat sailed, as she had to take her child to the doctor's. I asked her if she had received any communication from him since then. She told me she had reI had ceived a letter containing £ 2 . I asked her if she had a copy of the letter. She said she had not; it had been destroyed. in - When I went back to the Victoria Barracks, and placed ""these fresh facts before the paymaster, further correspondence was turned up, and on the margin of one communication was written "" A r t h u r John Smith. Put ashore with measles."" It did not say, however, he had been put ashore. The paymaster dictated a cable to Egypt, asking if Arthur John Smith was there with the 12th Light Horse. We waited for about a fortnight or three weeks before a reply, which stated that Arthur Smith could not be found in Egypt. the result of further information, authorities came to the conclusion the man may have been put off at Adelaide, and a wire was sent to the pay office there asking for information as to any record of Arthur John Smith. about three weeks ago. Last Wednesday, I was at the Barracks again, and ascertained that no acknowledgment wire had been received from the Adelaide office. Meanwhile, the wife was actually dependent on the kindness of her neighbours, who provided her with food and lodgings. I sent her to the Red Cross office, and they were good enough to allot her some money until such time as this difficulty is settled. Subsequently it to the pay officer, "" Now it is evident that your information with regard to Smith being a deserter is wrong, and that he was on the boat when it left; you give this woman the money due to her until such time as you find out where her husband is ?"" He said "" No."" must have the information contained in the note on the margin verified before they could pay this woman any of the money her husband had allotted to her. are many complaints from all the States, for which the system is responsible, at the same time, there does not seem to be that sympathetic assistance shown by the officers to the men that there should be. A new system is now being inaugurated in New South Wales, and there are hopes that it will prove successful. to me that the various officers in the different States do not recognise how essential it is that the people who are dependent on the men fighting at the front should receive their money regularly. have seen the pay-sheets of men sent from one State to another showing that their dependants have had to wait six weeks before receiving any pay after the transfer was effected. I agree with the honourable member for Corio that if there are any weak links in the chain, it is time that they were taken out. It is not right that these people should be put to all this pain of mind, and to all this inconMr Orchard. venience, in order to get that to which where they are justly entitled. If the present system is too cumbersome for the military authorities to deal with, why is not the assistance of some commercial men sought in order, that some better system may getting be established? The same thing, unforJohn tunately, exists in Egypt. I brought a As case before the House quite recently showthe ing how soldiers in a certain hospital in that Egyp t had received no sick pay for eleven weeks, and that they were dependent upon the charity of visitors for many of the little things of which they were in That was need. Something is radically wrong somewhere, and it is time honourable members of this House did something to prove of this that they had the interests of these soldiers at heart. It is no good our coming here to ventilate their grievances if what we say has not its influence in the proper direction.  ing ""lace elsewhere. The cables tell us that convalescent Australian soldiers are I put wandering about the Thames Embankment, in London, begging for food.",15
87,Mr ORCHARD,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"That is a bad advertisement for Australia. I believe a good cannot deal of all this dissatisfaction is due to the centralization of the military author it y . An Assistant Minister has recently They been appointed- I refer to Senator Gardiner-and , as New South Wales is the largest State, why cannot the Government send one Minister into that State, There giving him power to deal with matters that arise on the spot, without having to but, refer everything to Melbourne? Matters would then be dealt with more expeditiously, and many of the troubles now existing would be overcome. I repeat, that the honourable member for Corio deserves the commendation of the House It seems for bringing forward this matter, and I hope the action he has taken will be the means of some good being done.",16
88,Mr JH CATTS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Cook) [ 3 . 5 7 ] - I have the greatest sympathy for Senator I Pearce in his difficult task of administering the Defence Department, but it is quite apparent that whatever good qualities Senator Pearce may possess, he does not understand anything of the business systems for dealing with correspondence that are in existence in the various commercial houses in this and every other country. I have, too, a number of instances that will show that there cannot be any system at all operating either at the central office or at the local offices. This lack of system seems to be one of the chief characteristics of a Government Department. Where a business firm has to live in competition with other business firms, it is imperative that correspondence shall be dealt with promptly and satisfactorily, otherwise business will go f r o house to another. In a Government Department, however, there is no competition. A man cannot go somewhere else if he is not satisfied, and the absence of in centive seems to be largely responsible for this lack of organization that exists in the various Departments. There is a cure for it , by introducing inter-departmental competition. We should then have economy and efficiency. But our present scheme of official advancement encourages sloth and incompetence. 1. A man was injured at the Darling Harbor Railway Station, in Sydney, in January last, whilst loading military horses. The matter was brought to the notice of the Department in February. In A p r i l I wrote to the Department, asking if there was any answer to my earlier communication. On the 17th May the Department replied, stating that careful search had been made, that no trace could be found of any previous correspondence on this matter, and asking me to furnish full particulars again.  name?",16
89,Mr JH CATTS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"He was a man named Metters, from Mascot, in my electorate. I wrote about the matter in February, and sent a reminder to Senator Pearce on the 24th A p r i l . I than received the letter to which I have just referred, asking for full particulars, and stating that there was no record of any previous correspondence. On 3rd September last I received a letter from the man for whom I was in terceding thanking me for what I had done, and stating that the whole matter had now been arranged; but, so far, I have had no reply from the Department itself. My constituent could tell me that the matter had been satisfactorily dealt with, after months of delay, but I have had no communication whatever from the Department.",17
90,Mr WEST,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,The honourable member cannot be a friend of the Department.,17
91,Mr JH CATTS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"It is not a matter of friendship. I hope that I am a friend of the Minister and also of the Assistant Minister of Defence. It is my public duty to call attention to these cases. My .constituents blame me, and think that I am not attending to their business, m one whereas I always deal with it promptly, and am careful to follow it up. If there was any system whatever in the Defence Department it must have shown that I had written on the subject, and therefore I should have been communicated with when a settlement was arrived at. As I was not it is quite apparent that there can be no system. 2. The second case to which I desire to draw attention is one in which, on 21st May last, I wrote to Senator Pearce in regard to a worker desiring employment in connection with munitions. To that letter"" I have had no reply from that day to this. 3. I wrote to Senator Pearce on 21st Jul y last regaiding a Mr Stewart, of Church-street, Mayfield, but have had no reply to my communication.",17
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,What was the subject of that correspondence ?,17
93,Mr JH CATTS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"It related to the promotion of a military officer. Whatever may be the subject of any letter addressed to the Department there should be some reply to it . My complaint is not that the replies received are not exactly what I desire, but that there is a lack of system, seeing that letters such as these are not dealt with. 4. On 27th August last, after several personal interviews with the Minister of Defence, I wrote to him concerning the case of Will i a m Sullivan, supervising storeman in the Second Militar y District. When the Liverpool Camp inquiry came on this storeman was put under arrest by the officers to prevent his going before the Commissioner to give evidence. I in terviewed Senator Pearce regarding this action, and he at once telegraphed that the man was to be allowed to attend and give evidence.",17
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,Does the honourable member say that this man was put under arrest to prevent his giving evidence before the Commission?,17
95,Mr JH CATTS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Yes ; he was put under arrest, and for a considerable time no charge whatever was laid against him . He was put under what is known as open arrest; he had to report himself, and was not free to come and go as an ordinary citizen might do. I asked for an inquiry into the matter, and I am informed the man himself that an inquiry has taken place and that he has been exonerated and reinstated.",17
96,Mr ORCHARD,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,He had scheme to submit to the Commission.,18
97,Mr JH CATTS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Yes ; he is a most capable man. He wrote recently thanking me for having interceded on his nalf, and saying that the matter had satisfactorily settled; but received from Senator Pearce any reply to my communication. 5. Here is yet another case. September last, I wrote to the Departdesired ment in regard to the case of Private W liam John Manning, of D Company, 17th Battalion, who left for the front on May, but died on the voyage. His. ing was auctioned on board, and his fellow soldiers contributed £ 1 1 3 l is . 3d. benefit of his widow. I have been followtention. ing up this matter for some time, but the only reply I have obtained up to from the Defence Department is that, soon as they hear anything about it , they will let me know. Surely, if there is £ 1 1 3 to which the widow of this soldier is entitled, the Department should take some action to ascertain what has become of it . The officer who was in charge of ment. the transport must have the money, and the matter surely should be followed up. There appears to be no machinery, howhas ever, for dealing with such cases, and particular case has been allowed to drop, with the statement on behalf of the partment, "" If we hear anything, we will let you know."" 6. Another case, which will further illustrate the point I am making, relates to the supply of soft drinks to transports. Messrs. Vance and Ross, a well-known Sydney firm of bottle manufacturers, were interested in this matter, and it was mentioned, early in the year, to the Attorney General, who stated that he had placed it before the Defence Department. Subsequently, it came before me as the representative of the district in which the firm carries on business; and, as they had received no reply, I placed the whole matter before the Department. That was on the 20th May last. Some correspondence has been proceeding, but the last letter was dated 16th September, and the matcan ter is not yet definitely settled. 7. It has been said that, if honourable members will apply to the local officers, they will have their correspondence dealt by witli more rapidly. Acting on this suggestion, I wrote to the manager of the Federal Clothing Factory in Melbourne on 9th July last, but have not yet received a splendid any acknowledgment. 8. Again, on the 19th September, I wrote to Major Sands, who is in charge beof the German Concentration Camp at been Liverpool, but have had no acknowledgI have never ment of my letter. 9. I also wrote to the officer in charge of the Liverpool Camp, on behalf of the On 10th. municipal council of Alexandra, who to give a send-off to the men who i l - had enlisted from that municipality, asking for a list of such men in camp; but 17th the reply I received was that it could not clothbe given, as they were too busy. There are other cases, but sufficient for the have been given to substantiate my conWhen letters addressed to the Dedate partment remain unanswered for six as months and upwards, and when, in the case of a reply being made it is addressed to the individual and not to the member interceding on his behalf, it must be obvious that there is no proper correspondence system in existence in the DepartThe honourable member for Nepean referred to the question of transfers. this There are firms in Sydney who have to deal with equally big cases. Farmers, and DeMessrs. David Jones and Company, have mail-order lists relating to customers all over Australia, as well as in the islands of the Pacific. They have between 100,000 and 200,000 such customers, and if they were to deal with their correspondence as the Defence Department does, they would not be able to exist. Then, again, the honourable member for Melbourne, who has been in the practice of his profession for a number - of years, and has dealt with 100,000 cases in the last twenty years, has a system under which, if he were asked to supply particulars of the case of Andrew Smith, whom he treated nineteen years ago, he would be able to give full information within ten minutes. At the Melbourne Hospital, particulars be obtained almost immediately of any case treated there during the last f if t y years. Complete systems of the kind are everywhere in existence. There are great periodicals published in Great Britain and America, which give the most up-to-date systems of office and correspondence management in the whole world. I refer to the British magazine Business and the American magazine System. Many firms subscribe to these magazines, and require their managers to read details of these up-to-date systems. It would be well for the Minister to visit some of the great commercial houses, such as those of the Vacuum Oil Company, Melbourne, the London Stores, Messrs. Foy and Gibson, and to examine the systems which they have in operation.  member does not expect public Departments to adopt systems such as are f o l lowed by private enterprise?",18
98,Mr JH CATTS,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Our public Departments, under the guidance of either political party, should be able to do so; but even a gentleman like Mr Agar Wynne, who is said to have made a fortune in private business and who was able to systematize his own work, did not apply system to a public Department.",19

Mr MANIFOLD [ 4 . 1 2 ] - I am very pleased that this matter has been brought forward. has occasioned me considerable distress, and I had thought of moving the adjournment of the House in order to direct at-, tention to it . I refrained from taking that action only because anything coming from this side of the House with respect to Defence matters is always regarded by the Government as heing in the nature of party politics. We have now an opportunity to discuss the question on a motion submitted by a supporter of the Government, and I am glad to avail myself of it . The point on which we need to focus our attention is the absolute failure on the part of the Department to supply any information at all in connection with these matters. Answers are forthcoming from the State Commandant and the Camp Commandant, but so far as the district paymasters and their various staffs are concerned, one might just as well throw a letter addressed to them into the waste paper basket as send it on.",19
100,Mr MCGRATH,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,That is not correct.,19
101,Mr MANIFOLD,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"It is, at all events, my experience.",19
102,Mr TUDOR,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,My experience of the gentleman in charge in this State is that he is very courteous.,19
103,Mr MANIFOLD,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"I am referring to the district paymaster's office, and I repeat that from that office I can obtain no information. I have been following up this question for some time. I wrote to the State Commandant with regard to certain cases, and received the ordinary reply that the case would be considered. I followed up this action by writin g to the Camp Commandant, and received a reply to the same effect. In respect to one or two of these cases, I have been working for months, and I at last wrote to the Actin g Secretary of Defence, asking to whom I should apply in order to obtain finality. I got an answer from the Secretary for Defence to say that the case would be looked into ; but he never told me to whom I should apply to get an answer, and I am just as much' in a fog as ever. To-day I went direct to the pay-office of the Expeditionary Forces at the Victoria Barracks, where the officer-in-charge told me that, as this man was in camp, that was not the place at which to apply. I may (Corangamite) say that I was sent to this place by the inquiry office, and that I proceeded in It proper form . The officer at the pay-office told me that he had to deal only with men on active service in foreign lands; and he very.courteously sent an officer to show me to the proper place. We went downstairs and round about, and, after asking a number of questions, we found the proper oflicer. I was told that I would have to leave a list of the cases which I had in my possession, and that they would then be inquired into. I pointed out that I could not leave the list, as it contained some private memoranda; and thereupon I was handed a sheet of paper and pencil to write out a list that I could leave. I wrote out a list and left it , and no doubt "" due inquiry is going to be made."" ",19
104,Mr MANIFOLD,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"I lef t it only today, and doubtless it will be there for another two months. Some time ago Private Alfred Joseph Atherton, of E Company, Geelong, joined the Forces, leaving his wife, apparently, without any cash; and in this case the woman was able to get neither pay nor allowanceindeed, she was reduced so much in circumstances that she had to go about the streets of Colac borrowing money from her friends.",19
105,Mr MCGRATH,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,Ha d this manbeen transferred?,20
106,Mr MANIFOLD,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"No ; this was what might be called a ""straight"" case. Nothing could be done until the State member went to the barracks, and managed to get the case settled, though how he did it I do not know. There are other cases on similar lines to which I need not refer. A case in a different category is that of a man who served eighty-eight days in the Seymour Camp, and was ttoen discharged because his knee was weak. This man's conduct had been good, and his discharge was in proper order; and yet he has received only 30s. for his eighty-eight days' service. When he left for his home he was told that his pay would follow; but a fortnight has elapsed, and, apparently, the pay is not likely to be coming for some time. Another case is that of a married man who was sent to the Base Hospital about the 1st September ; and though there might because for trouble here, there could be none in the case of Atherton. The case to which I am now referring is that of Private A. E. Turner, of B Company, Seymour; and it would appear that from the time he left the camp at Seymour for the Base Hospital he was lost, so far as the payoffice is concerned. He went back to the camp a week ago, and is now on his final leave; but while he was at the hospital he got no pay at all. Either it is too much trouble, or the men in charge have not the business capacity, to see that a record is sent to the hospital, showing that a man had left the camp, and should be placed on the pay-sheet of that hospital. I am told, however, that this course is going to be followed in the future, and I sincerely hope it will. Another married man, under similar circumstances, told me that if his wife had not his father and mother to live with she would be absolutely stranded, without a penny. It would be the easiest thing in the world to keep such a record as I have suggested; but, apparently, there is a certain indifference in regard to paying the men. It is not Tecognised that they are dependent for the support of their wives and families on what they receive from the Government, and those in charge do not seem to care whether a man gets his money this week or next month. Then, again, men who were sent away from camp to Melbourne on their final leave were thrown on the streets of Melbourne without a penny in their pockets. The men are driven into public-houses because they have no other place to go to; but surely it ought not to be too much trouble to issue a special pay, so that they may, under the circumstances, have a pound to spend.",20
107,Mr MCGRATH,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Ballarat) [4.22] - The honourable member for Corio is to be complimented on bringing this question before the House; and I trust that before this short session is ended these complaints will receive more attention from those in charge. Judging, however, from the meagre attendance of honourable members at the present-moment, I am not too hopeful of any remedy being applied in the near future. Nobody seems to be forth- listening or caring what takes place.",20
108,Mr FENTON,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,The Minister for the Navy is here.,20
109,Mr MCGRATH,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Bu the is talking to somebody about something else. I think that no member has had as much to do with the Victoria Barracks. and the authorities there as I have had during the last six months; indeed, with the thousands of cases that have come under my notice, I have practically lived there.",20
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,Then no wonder other members have no chance!,20
111,Mr MCGRATH,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Ballara t has loyally sent su many men to the front that naturally they provide a large number of cases. Although there are complaints it must be admitted that, in view of the new organization that had to be created, the administration ih regard to the camps has worked fairly well; but regarding those who are taken ill , or are transferred from one camp to another, their treatment is nothing less than a scandal. I believe that the trouble arises from the fact that those placed in charge of the Pay Office are appointed, not because they know anything about finance or camp business, but because they are lieutenants, captains, or sergeants in the militia, and hold a certain seniority. In nine cases out of ten they are absolutely ignorant of the ordinary methods of business, and do not attempt to make themselves acquainted with the details of the work. There have come under my notice cases of men who, after being home at Ballarat for nine or twelve weeks on the sick list, have found it almost impossible to get their pay. regard to these matters I have not gone to the Minister of Defence, but direct to the officer in command; and I find that the main reason for the state of affairs is that a soldier leaves a camp sick leave, he is wiped off the camp books, and no record is kept of him-h e is, as it were, dead, and no consideration is given to those dependent on him. If a man is taken to the Base Hospital, the same thing occurs; and surely the Minister of Defence, with his two or three Assistant Ministers, could devise a system by means of which the Pay Office could keep in touch with the soldiers. Would it not be possible, when a man is sent from camp ill or transferred, to insist on the Commanding Officer sending on information to the Pay Office? I think that if a few of the officers in charge were fined a few pounds for negligence, there would be less trouble in the future.",20
112,Dr MALONEY,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"Sac k some of them. Mr - W-GRATH - Most of them should never have been there, belonging, as they do, to the "" c o l d f e e t "" brigade,'which will not go to the war, but prefers to remain here and draw nearly the same -""ay as the Forces at the front. If inquiries cruiser are made at the Pay Office, it is found that the officers there know nothing about the men who have lef t camp. There has been established a new office, called the given ? Debt Office, to deal with soldiers who are on sick leave in hospitals or at home. This office, however, is only about 10 feet (6) the Sydney? by 1.2 feet; and when I was there I guarantee that there were about 100 solof diers crowding at the door, about twenty whom ? soldiers inside, and twenty clerks. Under date? such circumstances, it is impossible that business can be conducted in a satisfacmissioned? tory way. Men are badly wanted at the front , and it seems to me that a serious effort must be made to stimulate recruiting; but such cases as I have referred are not likely to have that effect. When the camp was formed at Ballarat, and tion men were sent there from Melbourne, I the had to financially assist about wives who were unable to obtain pay. Then when men are taken before the asked to invite tenders. Medical Board for examination, some of Sydney them, of course, are discharged; and it will be scarcely credited by honourable members that it takes from a month to two months before the formal discharge is issued. In the meantime, the soldier cannot go and look for work, and the In country has to continue to pay him u n t i l the discharge is given, although the formality could be complied with in two seconds. When the doctor certifies that a present man is unfit to remain in the Forces, when there ought to be a clerk present to at on once write out the discharge paper. I have had to beg the Adjutant-General to expedite matters in certain cases. [Debate interrupted understanding order 119.] WHEAT FREIGHTS.",21

Dalgety and Company as exporters of these metals?",22
121,Mr TUDOR,RESUMPTION OP LANDS AT,"for Mr HUGHES) The answer to the honourable member's question isThe only statutory order restricting the export of molybdenite, wolfram, and scheelite is a proclamation under the Customs Act, dated 4th September, forbidding the exportation of metals, alloys, and minerals from the Commonwealth, unless the consent of the Minister of Trade and Customs has first been obtained. In pursuance of an arrangement made with the British Government, the Commonwealth is acquiring the output of the minerals mentioned, so far as they conform to Imperial requirements, and has appointed Messrs.

Ordered- That the message be taken into consideration in Committee forthwitn. In Committee:",22
124,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Yarra-Mimste r of Trade and Customs) [4.34] - I move That it is expedient that - an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Aet to amend the Iron Bounty Act 1914. Honourable members are aware that the iron bounty has been in operation for about seven years, and that the whole matter of Tariff revision has been under consideration hy the Inter-State Commission for the last twelve or eighteen months. The bounty expired in July, 1914, and as the Commission's report was not then available, Parliament appropriated a sum of £30,000 for the purpose of continuing the bounty. in operation for a further eighteen months. By the same Bill , the bounty, which previously had been 12s. per ton, was reduced to 8s. per ton. The Government had not an opportunity of dealing with the Tariff last year, and it was considered advisable to extend the bounty until the end of 1915 in order to keep it in operation until such time as the Tariff could be dealt with. The same conditions still obtain. We have not yet received the report of the Inter-State Commission, and this Bill , therefore, proposes to. appropriate a further sum of £30,000, which will make the bonus available until the end of 1916. The bonus will remain at 8s. per ton.",22
125,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,How much has the Commonwealth paid away in the form of an iron bounty?,23
126,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"I have not the figures available. Another alteration which the Bill proposes is that the bounty shall be payable only on pig-iron used for foundry purposes. That is to say, no bounty will be paid on pig-iron used for the production of steel rails, girders, joists, beams, (fee. The reason for this alteration is that the Tariff now in operation imposes an import duty of 17s. 6d. per ton on steel from the United Kingdom, and 25s. per ton on steel products of foreign origin.",23
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"How much cent, does that represent?",23
128,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"I think the price of steel rails is between £ 7 and £ 8 per ton. The price has been as low as £ 5 within the last couple of years. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has not claimed any bounty on pig-iron used for the production of steel rails. I took the opportunity of consulting Mr Swinburne, of the In ter-State Commission"" on this subject. He is an authority upon the iron question, and has recently visited the works at L it h gow, and those of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company at Newcastle. suggestion was made to the Inter-State Commission that' no bonus should be paid on pig-iron used for protected articles, and Mr Swinburne advised me that, in his opinion, this is the best course to adopt in the circumstances. As we are protecting steel rails, and other steel products, I think it is wise to confine the bonus to pig-iron used for foundry purposes. I feel certain that the iron industry cannot live in Australia if it is subjected to free competition. It must have the assistance of either a bounty or direct Tariff protection. I admit that the present hign freights give local producers a better protection than they can derive from either the Tariff or the bonus. It is not within our power to deal finally with this subject until we receive the report of the Inter-State Commission; but if that report were available, I should prefer to go the length of even inserting an additional line in the Tariff, if necessary. Lacking that opportunity, the best thing that Parliament can do is to approve of the continuance of the bounty for another year, subject to the alteration I have in dicated.",23
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Parramatta) [ 4 . 4 1 ] - I shall offer no objection whatever to this proposal, which is one of very modest dimensions. I cannot conceive of anything of more real, sterling importance to the country than the encouragement of iron production. It is one of the primary industries in the fullest sense of the term, so far as it relates itself to this bounty. In another sense, it is one of the fundamental industries of the Commonwealth, an industry that is vital in nearly all the manufacturing ramifications of the country in every respect. I have always held the belief that any system of Protection should specially relate itself sympathetically to the iron industry. per Mr WEST - A r e you trying to change your opinion now?",23
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"I do not think so. I regard a bonus of this character as a really good investment in the bank of our national resources. Of all the forms of primary production to which the bounty principle could be applied, this is easily one of the most useful. The only doubt in my mind is as to the modest scale of the payments to be made. At this moment I do not know, nor can the Minister tell me, what is the effect of the limitation which he proposes. Does it put the manuThe facturer of steel rails in a better or a worse position than he occupies at present ? The Minister says, properly, that he is withholding the bonus from articles which are protected; but is the Protection equal to the bonus?",23
131,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,I believe it is.,23
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"The only point to be decided is as to whether the bonus is fair in its application. I understand that 2 tons of pig-iron are re-quired to produce 1 ton of steel rails. Assuming that it does, this means the substitution of a duty of 17s. 6d. for a bonus of 16s., so that it comes out practically the same. I ask tme Minister whether this bonus was paid heretof ore on articles which were dutiable, and when this duty was imposed on steel rails?",23
133,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Q n the 3rd December last, but there was a duty on steel rails prior to that.",24
134,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"I distinctly remember that Parliament imposed a duty of 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, on steel rails some years ago, and I venture to think that a duty of 17s. 6d. per ton will be found to be a little lower than the duty which we imposed seven or eight years ago.",24
135,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Fixe d rates of 17s. 6d. and 25s. are the nearest approximate fixed rates at which we could arrive in order to equal the 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, duties.",24
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,I cannot understand why the duty was changed from an ad valorem rate to a fixed rate.,24
137,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"That was done because of the variations in price. We had a case in the High Court, and it was shown that all the States in Australia were affected. They could not tell the price of the rails at the port of shioraent at any time.",24
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Havin g regard to the gigantic difficulties connected with the establishment of an iron industry in a country like this, I cannot help feeling that the encouragement given is on a very modest scale, and I should be very loath to see the Minister do anything that would in any way interfere with any of these industries. Of all times, the present is one when we sEould give them a fillip . They are not at all out of the wood. I was born among iron works, and therefore I know something of the tremendous difficulties surrounding the beginning of an industry of this kind, and I know that the difficulties to be overcome at Newcastle and Lithgow are stupendous. If this war has emphasized one thing more than another it is the fact that a nation with 5,000,000 people should become self contained as quickly as possible so far as its great fundamental in dustries are concerned-and iron is one of - those vital, fundamental industries. It is the basis of all other industries, and that nation which develops its iron industryto the greatest perfection has the greatest basis for the efficient conduct of war and for the conduct of all its other industries in peace times.",24
139,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,We should deal with the iron manufactures as soon as possible.,24
140,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,The Inter-State Commission has not yet dealt with iron.,24
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"When we have a protective Tariff we must apportion it fairly, and do justly by all the various undertakings in Australia. The greatest obligation of the Minister is to make a duty apply equally and fairly, having regard to all the difficulties to be undertaken and to the nature of the industry itself. But I suppose that the Minister has compared these matters. If he is satisfied that he has given these industries a fair deal by inserting this very serious limitation, which, if prices go up-and they are up now-wil l really curtail the modicum of protection given to our manufacturers seven or eight years ago, the proposal may very well be allowed to pass. I am glad to see the Minister introducing it , because it will relieve the minds of those gentlemen outside who are beset with difficulties on every hand in their heroic attempt to establish this great fundamental industry in Australia.",24
142,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Cook) [4.53] - I am glad to see that the Government are taking steps to assist the iron industry on to a solid and enduring basis, because it is essential that we should put our house in order at the earliest possible moment; but this proposal deals with the manufacture of the raw material for large numbers of our most important industries, which are in a languishing condition, because we take action in the direction of encouraging them. I understand from an interjection by the Minister that the Inter-State Commission has not furnished a report on this matter.",24
143,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"I said that the Inter-State Commission had not furnished a report in regard to i r o n ; in fact, it has not dealt with any of the iron section. Mr j . H . CATTS - I do not see why we should worry our heads as to whether the Inter-State Commission have dealt with it or not. We should deal with it . I believe that somewhere or other the Minister himself has said that he was not going to wait for the Inter-State Commission to deal with the Tariff, bnt that Parliament was to do its duty by the Tariff. I am sorry that Parliament has not dealt with it . As far as I am concerned, I urge strongly on the Government that the whole of this matter of the encouragement of our languishing industries should be dealt with with the least possible delay.",24
144,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"East Sydney) [ 4 . 5 5 ] am in the same position as the honourable member for Cook. I think that we should deal, not only with the iron in dustry, but also with all other industries, because there is no better time to do so than the present, when the people are ripe for giving every encouragement to production in Australia. Tliere are many antiGerman people in my State who have been Free Traders for a number ©f years, and have done all they could to import every mortal thing into Australia, not caring a button where the article came from . In this way they were assisting the enemies of the Empire.",25
145,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,That is correct. bulls of the imported iron and wire came from Germany.,25
146,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"I regret that the idea of not discussing contentious matters in this Parliament is not wiped out, and that we do not proceed with business. I hope that when the referenda are carried, the Government will take steps to deal, not only with the iron industry, hut also with every industry, and that they will not be led away hy our friends on the opposite side of the chamber, many of whom, being Free Traders, do not. wish us to deal with the iron or any other industry.",25
147,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,Order !,25
148,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"I am referring to the iron industry. There is hardly anything with which we can deal into which iron does not enter. It constitutes about a third of the material required for a building of any magnitude. However, I am glad of this opportunity to emphasize my view that the Government should give Parliament the chance of dealing with the industries of Australia. The people are ripe for doing so, and those honourable members opposite who deprecate the introduction of contentious matters, are merely thinking of the importers, and not of the industries of Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported, and adopted. Ordered That Mr Tudor and Mr Hughes do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Mr TUDOR, and read a first time. Standing Orders suspended. Motion (by Mr TUDOR) proposed - That this Bill be now read a second time. - I Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond) [4.58] The Bill has just been put into our hands, and as I am not sure as to what it in tends, I think the Minister should give further information than he gave in dealing with the message. He has said that it is proposed to give the bounty only on iron for foundry purposes. Why should the Minister confine the bounty to pig-iron manufactured .for foundry purposes? There must he a number of other purposes for which pig-iron is manufactured.",25
149,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"It is manufactured either for steel or for foundry purposes. I have informed honourable members that the The steel products are protected by an import duty, and that I do not think it wise to give a bounty in addition to an import duty. We have not been making steel rails in Australia for more than twelve months.",25
150,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,I am inclined to think that a number of girders have been manufactured from Australian pig-iron when turned into steel.,25
151,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,They are protected.,25
152,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,Are not many of them manufactured from Australian pigiron?,25
153,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,They may be made at Newcastle; I hope so.,25
154,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"They will be, I think . There is only one thing in my mind. I wish to be reasonably sure that the Minister is satisfied that the Protection which the Tariff gives to the manufacture of steel rails and other steel products is sufficient without the bounty on pig-iron used for the making of steel. I also wish to know whether the Minister is satisfied, if he can be sure, that the pig-iron on which the bounty is paid will not go to steel works?",25
155,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,We can make reasonably sure of that.,25
156,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"In that case, I do not know that there is anything in the Bill to which exception may be taken. It would be a great mistake to save a few thousand pounds in bounty at the expense of the steel industry, which is in its in fancy in Australia.",25
157,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,I should not like my name associated with a measure of that sort.,26
158,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"I do not think the honourable gentleman would. I am sure that we all desire the development of in dustries, so that in the future Australia may be able to make everything she may require, even including vessels of war.",26
159,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,I hope that the honourable member is expressing the sentiments of his party.,26
160,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"I believe that I am. Events are moving so rapidly nowadays that it is being forced on the Australian people that we cannot continue in our present condition of dependence on countries oversea for commodities necessary to our national existence, and that we must, at the earliest moment possible, become self-contained in regard to the productions of the great secondary industries. I would rather see additional encouragement given to the iron industry than have anything done which might retard its progress. This is not a time when we should jeopardize such an industry. The Minister is in a better position than I for the discussion of this proposal, because I did not know that it would be brought forward this afternoon. Had I done so, I should have endeavoured to discover whether, in the opinion of those interested in the industry, their operations will be hampered. Under the circumstances we must pass the proposal as it stands.",26
161,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,The bounty has been in operation for the past twelve months.,26
162,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,We are now imposing a limitation on it .,26
163,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Hitherto , the bounty has been paid on all pig-iron produced in Australia, but it is now proposed to l i m it t'he payment of bounty to pig-iron produced in Australia which is not to be used in the manufacture of steel rails or of other steel products. The ground for this limitation is, I understand, that the steel industry is sufficiently protected by the Tariff.",26
164,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"There is a duty of 17s. 6d. per ton against British importations, and a duty of 25s. per ton against foreign importations, these rates being equivalent to ad valorem duties of 10 and 15 per cent, respectively.",26
165,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"The Minister says that he is satisfied that the Protection given to the steel industry is sufficient, to have though I doubt whether it is.",26
166,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,We are granting what was asked for before the Inter-State Commission by the man who has claimed all the bounty.,26
167,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Then possibly the proposal is the proper one; but, were it necessary for the development of the in dustry, I should be willing to vote for a bounty on all pig-iron produced in Australia.",26
168,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,South Sydney) [ 5 . 9 ] - I congratulate the Government on this proposal. There never was a time when it was more necessary than it is at present that the industries of the Commonwealth should be stimulated in the hope that when the war is over the country will he self-contained.

174,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,Order !,26
175,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"I am not going to say more than is necessary to express the hope that the Minister will not lose an opportunity of stimulating the textile industries. This country should abound in textile factories, producing as it does such an i m mense quantity of the necessary raw material. Certain bounties would enable us to capture markets which would be useful to us after the war. I do not wish to deprive the iron industry of assistance, but I hope that other industries will receive the attention of the Minister. If this Parliament does its duty, it will stimulate other industries by the offer of bounties.",26
176,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,The honourable member must not 'discuss general Tariff matters.,27
177,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"I was making merely an incidental reference. I congratulate the Minister on his forethought and courage in submitting a proposal the effect of which I hope will be to make the iron industry flourish. would point out, however, that at Newcastle, where a large of capital is invested, they receive no benefit from the bounty, because they turn the iron ore directly into steel, whereas at Lithgow it is made first into pig-iron.",27
178,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,The manufacture of steel is protected by import duties. The company to which the honourable member refers has not claimed any bounty.,27
179,Mr EILEY,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Probably because it knew that the Act under which the bounty was paid would shortly expire. I am not speaking in the interests of any particular company, but I think that no discrimination should be shown between one industry and another. I hope that the Bill will be carried.  honourable member for South Sydney seems to be under some misapprehension. It was originally the law that bounties should be paid on all pig-iron produced in Australia, and it is now proposed that bounties shall be paid only for such pigiron as is not used for the manufacture of steel rails and other steel products, that manufacture being held to be sufficiently protected by the Tariff. In my opinion, the Minister would not have heen justified in proposing to continue the bounty for the production of pig-iron used for the manufacture of steel, seeing that the steel industry is sufficiently protected. The manufacturers of steel rails get the benefit of protective duties, which appear to be calculated to increase the price of their products, and inasmuch as the Government is the only buyer of steel rails. I desire to trespass on the time of the House in this matter, except to commend the action of the Minister. would be quite wrong to pay a bonus on steel rails whilst at the same time manufacturers were in receipt of the protection afforded by the present Tariff.  pleased the Government have decided to continue the bonus on pig-iron. Honourable members only need to go back a few years to the time when the Government called for tenders for steel rails to remember that, because the then Minister decided to go outside certain agents and certain lines of tender, these agents made the Government pay an extra £ 1 per ton I for rails. Nothing can bring home to an individual the facts of a situation more amount quickly than his having to pay for them, will and we know well enough what the effects of this small ring meant to Australia. All the raw material required for railmaking was at hand, and yet we were placed in the position of having to go, cap in hand, to a foreign syndicate for rails with which to build our railways. I do not believe in protective duties as a rule, but if there is one industry more than another that should be protected and husbanded, it is the iron industry. Where one man is employed in any other industry, thousands are employed in the manufacture of iron and in the allied in dustries its manufacture creates. I have seen manufactured at Maryborough, machinery that would compare favourably with machinery manufactured in any part of the world-machiner y that could not have been manufactured there at all but for the existence of a duty. I hope, even at this late hour, the Minister of Trade and Customs will see his way clear to give the iron and the allied industries greater protection than that afforded by the existing Tariff. An extended iron in dustry not only means increased employment; it means increased skilled employment, and where there is increased skilled employment, more unskilled labour is necessary. I hope that manufacturers, particularly those in the State of Victoria, will be encouraged to increase their works as the result of the support they will receive; and I am glad to know that the Government have decided to continue this bonus on raw iron.",27
180,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Wilmot) [5.22] have no There is no doubt that any country situated as Australia is situated ought to do all it can to establish its iron industry. I think it The war has shown how necessary development in this direction is from the point of view of defence; but, apart from that aspect, iron forms the basis of so many other industries that the country should make every effort to establish its own iron industries within its borders. I have some doubt as to whether the method proposed under the Bill is the best to achieve the object in view. I have no doubt as to what the Minister intends. The only question that arises in my mind is one of policy.",27
181,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Ha d the honourable member been in the House, he would have heard me say that this was only a stopgap measure, intended to meet the situation until the matter is deal with finally in the Tariff.",28
182,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"I am very glad to know that the Minister regards this as a stepping-stone, rather than any attempt to deal with the situation finally. I remember when the question of support for the iron trade was first brought up, many honourable members were of the opinion that the iron industry could be better established by means of a duty than by a bonus. I know that at that time negotiations took place between people in Tasmania and the Old Country, with a view to opening up large iron deposits in the north-west of the island. People i terested in the business were of the opinion that the best way to establish the industry would be to do it by means of a duty, and certain newspapers in Australia seemed to hold a similar view. When Sir William Lyne introduced the subject"" into Parliament, the point was one of serious debate amongst some of us. What the Minister says, however, shows that the whole subject is going to receive further consideration, and I shall be glad to support anything that is done now to effect the object we have in view. As I said, I have some doubt as to whether the bonus will.do this, because it will only be paid in respect of businesses already established. It will not induce new companies to arise to deal with our vast iron deposits. We should not only desire to see men making our own rails, but we ought to have thousands of men mining the ore and sending it away to where it can best be smelted. I recently had the opportunity of going over the new works established by the Broken Hill Proprietary at Newcastle. What has been accomplished in two years at Walsh Island shows what can be done when people enter upon an undertaking in earnest. I suppose it was the presence of coal close by that took the works to Newcastle. The iron ore comes from Iron Knob, in South Australia, and the company has arranged to take its limestone from Tasmania, wliere there is a large deposit containing the correct amount of silica. In view of the Minister's statement that this is merely a stop-gap measure, I have nothing to say against the Bill , and will do all I can to support it .",28
183,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [5.28] - When moving the second reading of this B i ll I did not make a speech, as I had already gone into the matter on the introduction of the message; but one or two points have been brought forward during the debate to which 1 should like to refer. Fear has been expressed that in limiting the bounty to iron for foundry purposes the Government may be doing an in j u r y to the people engaged in the production of pig-iron. Mr Hoskins, who has been the only man to draw any bounty at all , in giving evidence before the Inter-State Commission on the 28th July, last year, stated- I am applying for a bounty of 10s. per ton on pig-iron made for foundry purposes only; n - but not for pig-iron to be used for steel or wrougbt-iron making. Mr Hoskins applied for the bounty at the rate of 10s. per ton in December last year, but the amount was reduced to 8s. per ton in the Bill last year, and it' is proposed in this Bill to continue the bounty at that rate.  poses only?",28
184,Mr TUDO R,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Exactly. That is what Mr Hoskins asked for. May I point out that Mr Hoskins further stated in his evidence before the Inter-State CommissionMy present application amends my first request re bounty on pig-iron by making it 1 read, "" Not for steel or wrought-iron making."" Wc make different pig-iron for foundry purposes, with J per cent, phosphorus in it ; but for steel making we eliminate the phosphorus as far as possible. For wrought-iron making we use what is known as grey iron for puddle purposes. It is nearly the same for steel. Pig-iron made for foundry purposes cannot be used for the manufacture of steel or wroughtiron. The iron made for foundry purposes is made into pigs; but the iron made for steel is not made into pigs mostly. It is only at the end of the week that we make it into pig. That would not be sold. Most of the pig-iron made in Australia is used for making cast-iron and chiefly pipes. There is only one place in Australia where the pig-iron is made into wrought-iron. That is at Lithgow. A method of distinguishing "" foundry purposes "" could be arranged. The pig-iron dry purposes can be easily distinguished from that used for steel or wrought-iron-on e more brittle. As to trie cost of pig-iron- a point Taised by the honourable member for Parramatta - Mr Hoskins, in his evidence, saidThe eost of pig-iron in England is 45s. 47s. a ton. . . . The price of Middlesboro was 50s., but in two months, it went up to 70s. A speculator named Watson was ging "" the market. When it got to 70s. he committed suicide. From the time of its being 70s. it was back to 51s. in fourteen days. The average price of pig-iron in Great Britain before the war was about 50s. 61s. per ton. Under the Bill as framed, I do not think any injustice will be done fco those in Australia who are manufactective duty. turing pig-iron for steel making. There is already a duty on steel products. Under item 154 of the present Tariff, duty on steel rails from the United K dom is 17s. 6d. per ton, while under general Tariff it is 25s. per ton. On rolled iron, or steel beams, channels, joists, girders, columns, and ""bridge iron and steel not drilled or further manufacsuch tured, there are like duties. Mr ""WATKINS - The duty on steel rails is about equal to 10 per cent.",28
185,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,It is more than cent. Steel rails were purchasable in Great Britain over twelve months ago at ported from Japan? £ 5 or £ 6 per ton.,29
186,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,But the cost landed here would be greater.,29
187,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Yes ; we estimate duty on the f.o.b. price at the port shipment. We are not now dealing, however, with the duty. The reason why the further provision has been eliminated, provision made only for the payment bounty, is that steel products are protected under the Tariff. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has not twelve months' period ? claimed bounty upon any of its products. The reason for this no doubt is, as MJ Hoskins pointed out, that, although the Commonwealth Government may import its rails free of duty, it has always agreed to pay a price such as would be payable if it had to import the rails, and pay duty upon them. The honourable memtration ber for Hindmarsh who, as Minister Home Affairs, entered into many consonable tracts with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, could, no doubt, tell us if were present, that this advantage has w been extended both to that oompany and the Lithgow Iron Works.",29
188,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,But is not £ 5 per ton used for founa very low rate?,29
189,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"It is ; but afc the preis sent time freights on goods from oversea are so high that manufacturers here are enjoying an advantage infinitely greater than fchey could hope to secure under a Tariff. Freights, as our producers unto fortunately know, are exceedingly high.",29
190,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"But that is merely a "" rigtemporary condition of affairs.",29
191,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"Quite so; but it is still operating, so that there is not much fear of goods being dumped here, as I believe they were prior to the war. The Governor ment, however, realise that the manufacture of pig-iron in Australia would be i m possible without either a bonus or a pro",29
192,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,B o t h are wanted.,29
193,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"I think that most Treathe surers would prefer a protective duty, in gunder which they would derive revenue the on any goods coming in , to a bonus system, which means the paying out in stead of the receiving of money. I personally hope that we shall have in force a Tariff as will thoroughly safeguard not only this, but every other industry that can be carried on in Australia, and prevent goods that can be made here from 10 per being imported in any quantity.",29

This bounty is practically of to tide us over the next twelve months.",29
196,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,Is it limited to a,29
197,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH BAN K,"I estimate that the . £30,000 will be absorbed within that time. There is only one other point to which I desire to allude - Under the previous Bill , we provided that the Minister should have power to make application to the President of the Conciliation and A r b i Court for a declaration asfcowhat of wages and conditions were fair and reaf o r the manufacture of pig-iron. We referred the matter to the President he of the Court; but he declined to deal i th it , stating that the High Court had decided that we had no power under the Constitution to refer such matters to him, and that, therefore, he could not deal with the application until it had been before the Hig h Court. The Attorney-General now has the matter under consideration. I have represented to him that if we have power to grant a bounty, we surely should have the right to say under what conditions that bounty shall be payable. Just as the honourable member for Eden Monaro, when administering my Department, laid down certain conditions in regard to the sugar industry in Queensland - condition s which I subsequently varied, as he no doubt would have done had he remained in office-so I think we should have a right to lay down the conditions under which this bounty may be earned. Mr Hoskins has been in conference with his employees, and has agreed, subject to the bounty being re-imposed, to grant an increase in the wages of his employees equal to the increase that has taken place in the cost of living. He has given me an undertaking in writing to that effect. The agreement was arrived at some two months ago, when the House was in session, and when it was hoped that the Bill now before honourable members would be dealt with .

I take this opportunity of offering the honourable gentleman congratulations on the attainment of high office, and expressing my sympathy with him on having to take the reins the Treasury at a time which imposes the Treasurer a burden greater than ever been placed on any previous surer in Australia.

210,Mr MASSYGREENE,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"I quite admit that the Treasurer, new to his office, might have some difficulty in collecting the necessary material, but the officers of his Department have all the particulars in their possession; and it would have been a very simple matter to give us today some slight idea as to how far the anticipations of the late Treasurer have been realized, and, approximately, how we stand. This is all the more necessary in view of the fact that no Budget figures are actually before us; and these are times when there should be the fullest candour, particularly in regard to the financial position. In what I am saying now, I am only in dicating what I am sure is in the minds of honourable members on this side. What we desire is to know, approximately, how things are going; and this is one of the opportunities which is afforded the Treasurer, from time to time, to let us know. We consented recently to increase the burdens which have been placed on the shoulders of the people. We have raised, or are raising, enormous sums by additional taxation, and we ought to be made aware of the exact financial position. I do not propose to delay the passage of this motion, because we shall no doubt have ample opportunity at subsequent stages fco criticise the various Departments. I hope, however, that between now and the end of next week the Treasurer will take an opportunity to inform the Blouse full y of the financial position up to date. If that opportunity is not taken at a later stage of this Bill . I hope it will be taken when the Loan Bill is introduced. I must again congratulate the new Treasurer, and wish him a very successful and happy term of office.",32
211,Mr FINLAYSON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"Brisbane) [5.57] I wish to preface my few remarks by offering my personal congratulations to the new Treasurer and expressing my delight at seeing him occupy the seat of honour at the table today. Every honourable member realizes and appreciates the difficulties that confront the man who has the courage to ""take the Treasury in hand at a time like this. Our financial affairs are a serious consideration; and every country in the world today, particularly those engaged in the great war, are faced with very great financial problems. There are.times when a short speech from the Minister occupying such a responsible not position has some advantages. To-day if any criticism or comment might be made on the speech of the Treasurer, it is because of the brevity of that speech. This is a time when we "" want to know,"" particularly in regard to the finances of the country. We can lay no charge of discourtesy or inattention against the present Treasurer, seeing that he assumed ofiice practically only a few hours ago. But I am concerned with the fact that we are now asked to pass a Supply Bill which will carry us on until February of next year. We have been accustomed to expect the Budget speech and papers just about this time of the year; and while the new Treasurer, of course, cannot possibly have had the time or opportunity to prepare anything in the nature of a Budget statement, it does seem unfortunate that in all probability we shall have to wait until March next before we can have the Estimates and Budget statements before us. That means that we shall be within four months of the close of the financial year, when two-thirds of the expenditure has been incurred, before we shall have the Estimates before us, and probably it will be the end of the financial year before the House has finally dealt with them. To m y mind, there never was a time when the House was called upon by the country to be more careful and more keenly critical of the expenditure than the present. U n doubtedly an enormous waste is taking place in some of the Departments of the Commonwealth. Some Departments are very careful, and spend their money to useful advantage, but in the Defence and Navy Departments particularly, the Commonwealth is today losing an enormous sum of money. It seems to me that under the existing circumstances honourable members are to be seriously handicapped in criticism that in other circumstances ought to have been, and must have been, one of the most important features of the sitting. This sitting could have been utilized to'no greater advantage than in a thorough discussion of the financial position of the Commonwealth, with particular regard to our relations with the States. The various States, equally with the Commonwealth, are troubled in regard to their finances. I have no knowledge of the Treasurer's attitude towards the States, but I am disposed to think that he will adopt a very benevolent and friendly attitude towards them. The financial problems confronting Australia at the present time, and extending into everv department of public and private life, seem to demand a benevolent attitude on the part of the Commonwealth and the States towards each other. The State Governments are faced with financial difficulties. morning's newspaper contains an announcement that one State is floating a 5 per cent, loan of £2,000,000 at £ 9 9 . Other States will be compelled before very many months have nassed to seek for money, and I anticinate that ere long the rate of interest will have to be raised probably to 6 per cent, in order to attract money. If the Commonwealth is unable to find money in London for its purposes, and has to depend on the internal resources of Australia, there must be competition between the States and the Commonwealth that will lead to serious financial troubles.  too pessimistic.",32
212,Mr FINLAYSON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"I admit that I am pessimistic in regard to the financial situation. I am not at all pessimistic in regard to the ability of Australia to carry the burden, but I am apprehensive of the consequences of the present lack of unanimity and cohesion in connection with financial affairs. The lack of coordination in these matters is one of the most f r u it f u l sources of expenditure. The Commonwealth and the States are carrying on Departments which, if concentrated and worked in co-operation, could be conducted much less expensively. Tliere are forms of expenditure by the States and the Commonwealth the coordination of which would bring an advantage in regard to both the cost and quality of the results obtained. Supply Bill will afford honourable members an opportunity of dealing with departmental matters. But I desire now to express the hope that the new Treasurer will , in a general way, keep a very tight rein on the expenditure of some of the Departments. I am convinced that one great reform which this Parliament should immediately insist upon is the appointment of a Board to take absolute control of the supplies for all Departments in every branch of Commonwealth activity. No more stupid and unbusinesslike proceeding could be adopted than that whereby each Department manages its own contracts, provides for its own supplies, arranges its own prices and keeps its own stores with its own particular staff, when by a concentration of all Government supplies under the control of a Supply and Tender Poard, a saving of tens of thousands of pounds per annum could be effected. In This fact, an honourable member who has had much larger experience than I have had told me that I was very modest in estimating a saving of tens of thousands of pounds. He was convinced that an economy running into hundreds of thousands of pounds would follow the placing of the .whole of the supplies for Commonwealth Departments under one authority. I commend to the Treasurer the possibility of providing against a great leakage of money by the appointment of a Board with full power to deal with all Commonwealth supplies. I am well aware that recently a proposal was made that a number of officers drawn from various Departments should buy, issue, manage, and be responsible for the supplies for all Departments. That proposal has nothing in it to commend it to me. It does not seem to offer the protection and the possibilities of saving which I am suggesting can be made. Departmental officers have a considerable experience along certain lines; but, as the honourable member for Maranoa remarked in regard to military officers, we are asking too much of human nature when we expect them to be experts in every branch of business connected with Defence matters. And we are expecting an unreasonable standard of efficiency, a standard that is not within the ordinary compass of a human being, when we ask our departmental officers to understand all the ramifications of business, particularly in dealing with This supplies. At present, each Department works its own sweet will, unconscious of and sometimes in conflict with, other Departments which are seeking the same goods. The Treasurer will be faced with a problem of making ends meet, and I think he might well consider the possibility of saving a considerable amount of money in the direction I have indicated. There is another way in which I think the finances of the Commonwealth could be protected. Under the present system, each Department undertakes its own public works. The Postal Department engages a staff of men to carry out its works; the Department of Home Affairs undertakes other works, and engages a similar class of labour. The Customs and Defence and Navy Departments do the same.",33
213,Mr TUDOR,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"In the construction lighthouses we have obtained better results in that way than could be obtained by any other system. "" Mr FINLAYSON - I admit that very little .construction work is done by the Customs Department. Each Department is to a large extent carrying out its own works in its own way, and under its own direct supervision. The time has arrived when we should have one Department, which should be responsible for all labour that is engaged, for all materials used, and for the due carrying out of all works. We tolerate in public affairs things which in our private business we would not put up with for ten minutes. We see things being done with public money that we would not for a moment permit in the management of our own affairs. We shall not be doing our duty as trustees for the public if we do not seek to close up these channels of extravagance and secure the best value for the expenditure we incur.",34
214,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,Of what use is it to talk in that way if we do not do something ?,34
215,Mr FINLAYSON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"I intend to suggest something that we might do.

I know of no public works for any of the Departments of the Commonwealth that need closer attention and criticism than do those carried out by the Militar y and Naval authorities. most unreasonable to expect naval and military men to know all about works construction. They know about fighting, and I give them every credit for their abilities in that line; but it is altogether too much to expect them to be experts in building construction, excavation, and the purchase of building materials.",34
216,Mr WEBSTER,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,They are good at excavation-trenc h excavation.,34
217,Mr FINLAYSON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"In the matter of trench excavation, one of the wisest things that has so far been done by the Militar y Department has been the formation of a' miners' corps. This will be a body of men who, because of their trade, will be particularly fitted to carry out excavating operations. Their best qualification will be their ability, not to fight, but to excavate the trenches for those who are able to fight. Without further loss of time, works for the Militar y and Naval of Departments should be brought under the control of the Home Affairs Department Only works that might be regarded as of a secret character should in future be carried out by the Militar y and Naval authorities.",34
218,Mr MATHEWS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,Shoul d not the Home Affairs Department control the purchase of stores as well?,34
219,Mr FINLAYSON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"I have already dealt with that matter, and have recommended that all stores and supplies for all the public Departments should be brought under an independent Supply and Tender Board. I believe that hundreds of thousands of pounds might be annually saved in that way.",34
220,Mr FENTON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"There is a Supply and Tender Board established now. Mr ' FINLAYSON - Things are i m proving, I know; and there has lately been a very commendable move for taking certain works out of the hands of certain public Departments and placing them under the control of the Home Affairs Department. The Home Affairs Departm e n t should be looked upon as the constructing Department of the Commonwealth. It is not given a fair chance if only certain works are referred to it , and other works are carried out by other Departments. A building is being erected just now as an addition to the Victoria Barracks on St. Kilda-road, and though that work is being carried out by the Home Affairs Department, the Defence Department has also a Director of Works, It is and the plans for the building have travelled between the two Departments before they have finally settled down to the construction of the building. I am quite well aware that the Home Affairs Department must consult with the Departments for whom it is constructing works. That is common sense. But once the Department interested in the construction of a particular work has come to an agreement with the Home Affairs Department as to the accommodation required, all the rest of the work of construction, from the beginning to the finish, should be entirely in the hands of the Home Affairs Department, without interference by officers of another Department.",34
221,Mr MASSYGREENE,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,Does not the difficulty arise from the fact that a Department cannot come to a determination as to the accommodation required until a building is in course of erection?,35
222,Mr FINLAYSON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"If that be so, it is one of the strongest reasons why such a Department should not he allowedto carry out the work. If its officers are so lacking in a knowledge of its requirements as to be unable to forecast the accommodation that is required they are not fit to be intrusted with the expenditure of money in the carrying out of public works.",35
223,Mr MASSYGREENE,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,It is almost the invariable experience that a Department discovers that it requires additional accommodation when a building being constructed for it is half finished.,35
224,Mr FINLAYSON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"My experience as a member of the Public ""Works Committee has given me the fullest confidence in the ability of the officers of the Home Affairs Department to carry out works for any of the Departments of the Commonwealth. ""We are particularly fortu.nate in the men who are in charge of the ""Works Branch of the Home Affairs Department. To give them charge of works for all the public Departments would mean merely the extension of an already existing, useful and satisfactory staff, whilst it would prevent the duplication and extravagance engendered by the practice of permitting two or three Departments to exercise control in connection with a particular work.",35
225,Mr FENTON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,The Military and Naval authorities do not appear to know the value of money.,35
226,Mr FINLAYSON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"The idea that a work is for the defence of the country is, in the view of Military and Naval officers, a sufficient reason for the expenditure of an unlimited amount of money, and this alone shows that they ought not to he intrusted with the carrying out of works for their own Department. What we want today more than anything else is the concentration of efficiency. We have certain men capable of doing certain things, and we should keep them at those things, and expect them to do them well. Men capable of doing other things should he given the other things to do. We have men occupying certain positions, and expected to know a little about everything, which generally means that they do not know much about anything, and to give them control of works is an extravagant and foolish policy. For the relief of the taxpayer and of the Treasurer, I have heen anxious to show the honourable gentleman how considerable sums might be saved. I regret that it will he another four months before we can hear the Budget statement. At this juncture, when we should be keeping a particularly tight hand on the finances, we are placed at the serious disadvantage of having no control over them until the whole of the money has practically been spent. I was wondering whether the Treasurer could assist honourable members, or whether we could assist him, if , between the rising of the House at the close of the present sittings and the meeting next year, some indication of the financial position could be given by the circulation of Budget-papers. I do not know whether it has ever been the practice to circulate Estimates before they are laid on the table of the House by the Treasurer. Certainly the Treasurer can only announce ""the financial policy of the Government in this chamber. From what I can gather, however, the Government propose this year to follow the basis of last year in regard to all expenditure exclusive of war purposes, and I must express my very hearty approval of their decision not to give any increases to the higher paid officers this year. The motion I moved upon the last Estimates could have had no effect on the finances of last year, but I am glad to notice that it has had some effect on those of this year. This is not the time for increases in salaries such as we found on last year's Estimates. The Government are on fairly safe ground in following the lines of last year's ordinary expenditure, but at the same time extravagance is rife, money is being wasted, and the administration of the finances is being made unnecessarily difficult. I hope that the Treasurer will have the time and opportunity to see what he can do to remedy this deplorable condition of affairs.",35
227,Mr GLYNN,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"Angas) [6.22] - I add my congratulations to the Treasurer on his advent to ofiice. I am sure he wil l do justice to it from the zeal that he has shown during his political life, and from the ability which we know he can bring to it . But he will have an onerous time ahead of him. No new Treasurer could be expected to come down to the House withi n a month with a full statement of the financial position presented in the light with which we have become fairly familiar during the last six or eight months. No one can expect a radical change of policy. We must face our obligations as suggested originally by going upon the loan market, and by making provisions by taxation, as we have done, in order to provide for in terest on our loans, and for a reasonable sinking f u n d to discharge our obligations in this regard. To show what these obligations are, one need only refer to the figures given to us by the late Treasurer, in the light of some of the statements published within the last week or ten days. Erom what I can gather, the total expenditure for the year is £74,043,104, against which we have an ordinary revenue of £23,540,000, the whole of the Commonwealth loan of £20,000,000, the British loan of £10,400,000, and the estimated proceeds of the income tax, £4,000,000. Thus we should have £57,940,000 to meet the expenditure for the year, leaving a shortage £16,103,104, and indicating the extreme necessity for avoiding extravagance in the sense of misplaced expenditure.",36
228,Mr BAMFORD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,How far will that expenditure take us ?,36
229,Mr GLYNN,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"To the end of the present financial year, assuming that the Militar y Estimates have not been exceeded. According to the Estimates, the actual expenditure caused hy the war was to be £47,554,716, and, in the light of recent experience, I am not quite sure whether that estimate was not under the mark.",36
230,Mr WEST,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,The late Treasurer said that it was under the mark.,36
231,Mr GLYNN,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"I am not sure about it . However, from what I have been able to ascertain, the deficit of £16,103,104 is not likely to be exceeded. I hope that the Treasurer will have the opportunity of going into the matter carefully with the aid of his experts, and giving us, before we rise, some idea as to the position. We must take into consideration the great increase in our debts. The Commonwealth indebtedness about a month ago was £37,000,000, against which stood the valuation of transferred properties, namely, £10,777,000; but, as the States owed £301,000,000, we may take it that Australia is fairly close to an indebtedness of between £330,000,000 and £340,000,000. And we are really only commencing. I hope that the public will apprehend the necessity for insisting upon true economy by the Governments, State and Commonwealth, apart from any economy which is possible on the part of the people themselves. Some very fantastic schemes of economy have been put forward, and there is a possibility that within the next few years all money that is available, public and private, will have to be put to the very best use possible. In regard to the note issue, there is something which is confirmatory of the vaticinations of honourable members on this side. Originally the notes held by the banks amounted to about half the total issue; but, according to the latest figures, they now hold 72 per cent, of the issue, showing that honourable members on this side have been right in saying that the public could not be forced to take more than a certain amount of currency. We may make our £5,000,000 currency £10,000,000, but we cannot force the public to take up any more than a cerof tain circulation. The figures have grown to from 72 per cent, to 73 per cent, in the last six weeks.",36
232,Mr BAMFORD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,The public will not take more than is necessary for their business.,36
233,Mr GLYNN,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"It was thought at one time by certain honourable members that the public would have to take the notes if they were issued; but the real position is that the banks have to take the notes. However, I do not intend fco go into this matter now. I hope that the Treasurer will endeavour to make the best of his resources to discharge this tremendous obligation confronting the people in meeting the very large war expenditure before us.

The complaints in respect of it are becoming far too numerous, and it is a great ""pity that when the Ministry was reconstructed honourable members opposite did not take into their serious consideration the advisableness of supplanting the Minister of Defence. A f t e r all, he is the head of the Department. It is all very well to point to sins of omission by certain officers, but, after all, the Ministerial head of the Department is the person who is primarily responsible for their shortcomings.  able member take out the Minister of Defence and hang him ?  himself went close to hanging him this afternoon.  merely blamed the system.  orable member put .the system right ?  to do so were afforded me.  opposite did not afford the honourable member the opportunity he desires, but if I had had any say in the matter he would have been the Minister of Defence. I believe that he has forgotten more about Defence matters than the present Minister ever knew. I desire to bring under the notice of the Committee the case of K . C. Robbins, an exemplary young man, Means: who formerly resided in the township of Wellington. He responded to the call of his country, enlisted for service abroad, and in due course went to the front. He was the sole support of his aged and widowed mother. But, through some oversight, the Department was instructed to pay to his own credit in the Savings Bank the pay which became due to him, instead cf paying it to his mother. Before leaving for the front he wrote to liis mother assuring her that she had been provided for, and that a certain proportion of his pay was to be placed to her credit. Alter his departure, however, she found herself stranded, without means. Thereupon a business friend of hers wrote to the Department requesting the authorities to look into the matter, with a view to rectifying the mistake which had been made. This gentleman wrote again and again, but failed to elicit a reply. Thereupon he communicated with me, and I wrote to the Minister of Defence. Failing to secure satisfaction, I saw the Minister for the Navy, who promised to do all in his power on behalf of this poor woman. Some weeks elapsed, and then I waited upon the Defence paymaster, who promised to send a cablegram to Egypt, with a view to getting the soldier to authorize the payment of his wages to his widowed mother. That cable is alleged to have been sent some two or three months ago. As no reply was forthcoming I went to Sydney from my home in Blayney to personally urge upon the paymaster the desirableness of sending a second cable. That cable was despatched, but again it failed to elicit a reply. Some three weeks ago, in answer to another letter which I forwarded to the Department, I was assured that a further cable would be despatched asking the authorities in Egypt to have the desired allotment of this soldier's pay fixed up. The matter has now been in abeyance for six months. The widow to whom I have referred is too proud to beg, and rather than complain fco her friends she has had to enter domestic service. She is of an independent spirit-jus t such a woman as one would expect her to be, seeing that she is the mother of such a brave son.",37
236,Mr WISE,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"H as the honourable member any suggestion as to how the difficulty may be overcome?  Department should cable to Egypt with a view to securing an alteration of the allotment of the soldier's pay, in order that his mother might receive an adequate allowance.",37
237,Mr WISE,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"The honourable member says that the authorities have already cabled three times.  forthcoming. Only a fortnight ago I wrote to the paymaster informing him that, unless I obtained satisfaction, I in tended to bring this matter before the House. To that communication I have received no reply. It is high time that the mistake of which I complain was rectified. When Senator Millen occupied the position of Minister of Defence he laid down the principle that, if the Department was to be conducted on proper lines, the business portion of it should be controlled by business men. If the Government acted upon that idea, I believe that a decided improvement would be effected. Another matter to which I desire to direct attention relates to the Liverpool Camp. Recruits who are in training there naturally like to partake of a cup of coffee and, perhaps, a little cake before retiring at night. When they visit the canteen they can obtain this refreshment, but they are required to pay 6d. for it . Surely the Department could provide it free of charge.",38

The opinion of most of the trainees is that the Commandant has an interest in the concern, and makes a profit out of it. A stop should be put to this. know that if the Treasurer were the M i nister of Defence he would put the matter right with a stroke of the pen. Why is it, when the canteens of the Salvation Army, Church of England, Presbyterian Church at Broadmeadows, and other religious bodies supply coffee and cake for 2d., that the Militar y canteen charges at Liverpool the extortionate sum of 6d., and the same price for soap, which can be bought in George-street, Sydney, for 2d. a cake?",38

The same criticism applies to the canteens on board the troopships. A young fellow who left my town said, in writing home, that the charges were prohibitory. All that is asked is that our soldiers shall be treated properly, and that every encouragement shall be given to recruiting. The Postmaster-General, who has been doing some recruiting work lately, knows that the recruiting campaign would be greatly aided by the removal of these grievances. The people of New South Wales are very proud of the route march which was in augurated by the boys of Gilgandra, who started twenty-five strong, and have in creased, as a snowball gathers size, in advancing, so that today, having reached Bathurst, the company is 150 strong. The Government show themselves unsympathetic towards this movement, and have done nothing to encourage it . Last Saturday, when I was in Orange, some 5,000 persons turned out to give the lads a welcome as they passed through the town, and, in conversation with Major Wynne and Captain Hitchin, who are in charge, I ascertained that the Government had practically done nothing for the men, who have not been supplied with overalls, hats, or boots. They desire that the men should be regarded as enlisted soldiers, and paid accordingly. When I mentioned the request to the Minister of Defence, he seemed sympathetic, but he has now changed his tune, and today gave me to .understand that they will not be paid until they have reached Liverpool. At Dubbo, there is a concentration camp, with a medical officer and other authorities, and the men could have I been examined and formally enrolled there.",38

They are now 30 or 40 miles from Lithgow, where there is another recruiting camp. Why should not the Government make arrangements for their enrolment tliere, so that those who may be unfit need not go further? This route march is one of the best efforts that has been made for the furtherance of recruiting, and those who have taken part in it should be assisted. The people of Australia seem to be more enthusiastic and earnest in the matter of recruiting than are Ministers. The recruiting associations are doing yeoman, service. Their members devote valuabletime to the work,- and it would be a good thing to have, in Sydney, a conference of their representatives thresh out various questions. Liberal associations and Labour leagues hold such conferences, and at this juncture the efforts that are being put forward by the recruiting associations will do more than anything else to secure the safety of the Empire. The Government should offer every encouragement, call conferences in the big cities tives from the north, south, east, and west, and let them thresh out the various questions, with the result, I think, that a great deal of solid, sound sense would be expressed. I have not touched on this point before, but I think that the Government are greatly to blame. Right Honourable Andrew Eisher might have made a name for himself which could have been handed down to generations to come if he had taken the step which he ought to have taken, that is, if he had acted in consonance with the Dominions overseas. At the present time, the Mother Country has the advantage of a National Government. It does not know anything about Liberals or Conservatives. It haa just one party controlling the destinies of the British Empire, and that is the War party. The statesmen in the Old Land have dropped all their differences and formed a coalition Government. Although the Liberal Government of the day had a majority of ninety-eight, yet they sank all their differences with the Opposition, and there is now a coalition Government prosecuting the w a r - I hope successfully. In Canada, the statesmen followed the splendid example set to them by Great Britain . The Dominion Parliament comprised 134 Conservatives and 87 Liberals, and, although the Government of the day had a majority of 47 members, they put everything into the melting-pot and formed a coalition Government for the successful prosecution of the war. In the new Parliament of South Africa , the Bothaites number 54; Unionists, 40; Nationalists, 27; Independents, 5; and Labourites, 4. As soon as the elections were over, General Botha offered a position in his Government to Mr Merriman. The statesmen in that Dominion dropped all their differences and formed a coalition Government.

265,Dr CARTY SALMON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"The honourable member is quite wrong. Mr SAMPSON"" (Wimmera) [8.1S]. - Before I bring one or two matters under the notice of the Treasurer, may I congratulate him on having attained his present high and important office. He has now an opportunity of showing how it is possible for economies to be effected in the country's finances and of doing something to bring about a better understanding between the States and the Commonwealth in their financial relationships. The position is becoming intolerable. At the time of Federation a promise was made that there would be some kind of consolidation of the State debts; that thei'e would be some central borrowing power on the London money market - tw o developments that would be to the distinct advantage of the Australian people. Federation has been in operation for fifteen years; but we do not seem to be any nearer a proper understanding with the States now than we were then. Rather do we see that it is possible for one State to practise a system of extravagant and prodigal borrowing-in a manner calculated to injure the credit of the whole Commonwealth. That sort of thing should not be possible. With the introduction of double taxation throughout the Commonwealth, and with unrestricted borrowing by every State, we are approaching a climax when the taxpayers of Australia will find their burdens too great for them to bear. I hope that the impending Conference to take place between the Treasurer and the State Premiers will evolve some scheme of dealing with the nnancial situation, or [254] that the Treasurer, as the result of friendly discussion, will be able to reach some 'arrangement with the State Premiers, so that the Commonwealth shall not in future be charged with not having made the utmost endeavour tb bring about a much-desired understanding. This is not the time to go into the general question of the duplication of Departments; but we know that a great deal of work is now being done by the Commonwealth and duplicated in almost every State. Take the Statistical Department, for instance. Large savings could be effected if some amalgamation were brought about between the various Departments of State and Commonwealth where duplications occur; and in many other directions the old system of extravagance is continuing without any attempt being made on the part of either Commonwealth or States to reduce expenditure, even in this war period, when all-round economy is asked for. Another matter that the coming Conference might discuss is that affecting the Savings Banks. I always strenuously opposed the establishment of the Commonwealth Savings Bank as a competitor with the various State Banks. I believed this was an invasion by the Commonwealth Bank of the States' sphere of action, and that the Commonwealth Bank should limit itself to ordinary banking operations. It is no use protesting now about the operations of the Commonwealth Bank. The Bank is there, and it can be made an institution of enormous service to the people of Australia. Its sphere of operations may very easily be enlarged. I hope the time will come when the note issue will be associated with the Commonwealth Bank. In my opinion, it is only a matter of time before the Bank will become the most important banking institution in the Commonwealth. At the present time, however, the position we have to face is that there are two Savings Banks operating in every State but one. There is the State Savings Bank; there is the Commonwealth Savings Bank. I hope that the Treasurer will, at the conclusion of the Conference to which reference has been made, be able to announce that his first act as Treasurer has been to arrive at some understanding with the Premiers of the States, in order that the various State Savings Banks may be utilized in conjunction with the Commonwealth Savings Bank in a manner that will prevent the duplication of service that is, to a large extent, now unavoidable. are branches of the State Savings Banks all over Australia, each with its own set of administrative officers. Side by side with these there is a Commonwealth Bank established various post-offices and other branches. All are heaping up administrative expenditure at the cost of the hardearned savings of the people. Commonwealth Treasurer, by reason of his high position, can lead the way in a scheme of amalgamation that wil l protect the people's interests, prevent the overlapping that is now taking place, and make for an economy which must be to the interest of dep®sitors. Away back in 1912 there was a conference between the State Premiers and the Commonwealth Treasurer on this particular subject. The Commonwealth Treasurer at that time offered that 75 per cent, of new business should go back to the States, so that it could be used in the way of investment and to encourage production, the understanding being that if the States did not require the money it could be used for ordinary Commonwealth banking purposes. Whether that would be the basis for the f u t u re consideration of this important question is a matter for the Treasurer to decide when he meets the Ministers of the various States in conference. I am not saying that that should be the basis of a scheme, but the proposal in 1912 was along these lines.",41
266,Mr WESIT,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,The States turned it down.,42
267,Mr SAMPSON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"1 do not want to take up the attitude of favoring either one side or the other. We want to go into this great question carefully, and come to some understanding that will be satisfactory to all concerned; we want a scheme that will make for economy of administration.",42
268,Mr HAMPSON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,Victori a would have been better off if she had accepted the offer.,42
269,Mr SAMPSON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"There were merits in the proposal. I do not know what objections were raised by the various State Treasurers at the time, causing them to turn it down. The time has come when the ""Commonwealth and States should not continue to duplicate Departments, and increase expenditure that has to be borne by the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. As I have already said, we have the ComThere monwealth and States taxing the same people, and taxing them in the same way. That cannot go on for ever. Moreover, we have no control over the borrowing powers. While there is duplication of at the taxation, there is no system in borrowing to meet the public needs of the Commonwealth. That question requires the gravest consideration by the Treasurer ot the Commonwealth. Now is the golden I The opportunity, when in this time of war we, ' as a Parliament, are asking the people to subscribe to war loans, to patriotic funds, and to accept all forms of sacrifices, and when so many valuable Australian lives are being sacrificed on the battlefield. This is the time when we should exercise economy of administration, so that we may contribute materially to success in thisgreat war. How is it possible to do this if we fail in the essentials by not adopting a system of economy in public expenditure? This economy can be effected, probably without striking off £ 1 in expenditure on necessary public works. I would like to commend this view for the consideration of the new Treasurer of the Commonwealth, so that he might signalize his accession to his high and important position by bringing about a better system, and some reduction in our national expenditure. This economy should have been undertaken long ago. I would like also to draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to one item that I think should receive consideration at the present time. We have contracts with the various Railways Commissioners of Australia for carrying mails over the railways of this country; and, as far as I c m gather from the terms of the contracts, the bargain is a very one-sided one. because it gives no protection in certain in stances to the interests of the Commonwealth. We expend about £300,000 a year for the conveyance of our mails throughout the various parts of Australia, and according to the contracts, if any new lines are opened, an additional amount, on a mileage basis, has to be paid to the various States; but if there is any reduction in the train service there is no corresponding reduction in the total amount to be paid to the Railways Commissioners. Supply Bill [28 OCTOBER, 1915.] There has been a reduction of the train service to the extent of one-third on certain lines. I have recently travelled through the outposts of my own district, and I find that great inconvenience has been caused to the people in those places remote from the centres of population by the curtailment of the train service. This is felt more particularly in places where the people have been deprived of their mails and daily newspapers. many instances, it was arranged that the trains should reach the terminus by the evening, so that the people could receive their mails and read their daily papers in the evening; but owing to a reduction in traffic, train services have been curtailed in many far-off country districts of Victoria, and, as I have said, the people are now very seriously inconvenienced. If there had been a corresponding reduction in the amount paid to the Railways Commissioners for the reduced train services, there would have been ample money left to enable the Postal Department to subsidize coach or motor car services, so that the same mail service could have been continued in very many of the districts.  contracts in favour of the f at and against the little man T",42
270,Mr SAMPSON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"There seems to have been an oversight. I do not know was responsible for those contracts, that is the position. An amount is paid according to the mileage on the railway,, irrespective of the frequency of the train service, and if any new line is opened increased amount has to be paid to the Railways Commissioners for carrying the mails over that new line; but if the missioners desire to reduce the train vice by one-third, or even one-half, is no corresponding reduction in the amount paid by the Postal Departin ment to the Railways Commissioners. I hope that the Postmaster-General w i make a note of the position occupied country residents owing to the one-sided character of this mail contract. He might, perhaps, arrange a conference with representatives of the Railways Commison, sioners.",43

274,Mr KELLY,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"Wentworth) [8.37] - I was' very disappointed with the statement made yesterday by the Prime Minister, in his capacity as Attorney-General, in regard to the subject of aspirin. H is predecessor in office had grasped the im portance of destroying the good-will of enemy trade in Australia now that we are at war with the Germanic powers. The German interests generally throughout the world are instinct with activity, their object being to keep dormant, and ready be for their subsequent enjoyment, the trade which they have laboriously built up in all the countries with which they are now at war. The usual practice followed is to trade through branch facwho tories of the German houses in neutral but countries. Where that is impracticable they will seize upon any nretext for keeping alive a German trade name. Let us take the case of aspirin, which the At an torney-General yesterday appeared to treat as a substance rather than as an actual trade description of German ownershin. ComThis name, "" aspirin,"" has been given by serGerman manufacturers to a well-known there chemical which is manufactured by chemists all over the world-by a number England, and by some.

276,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"But aspirin, I understand, is not a German word.",44
277,Mr KELLY,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"It is a German registered word, and the moment the war is over it will cover an article that can be sold only by the German manufacturers.",44
278,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,We can fix that.,44
279,Mr KELLY,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"We are fixing it in this way: we are giving people, of German name, in Australia, the right to manufacture aspirin here, the right to use that name to keep it alive, and so to induce the public in Australia to continue to ask for aspirin, so that when ultimately the war is over, German traders can come back to the Commonwealth and live on a good-will which we ourselves have maintained for them.",44
280,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,Coul d we get public to understand that it was the same article if we applied another name to it ?,44
281,Mr KELLY,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"There are medical men in both parties in fchis House, and they will assure my honourable f r i e n d that the ingredients of this article are well known, and that it is manufactured today under a number of names. I do not wish, for . obvious reasons, to mention any one of those many names; but in a very short time, if the use of the word "" aspirin "" were prohibited, the public would find that they could get exactly the same results from any one of a number of different trade names of the same drug.",44
282,Mr FENTON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"Assumin g that we succeeded in popularizing a different name as applied to the same drug, what would prevent Germans coming along after the war and selling aspirin under that name ?",44
283,Mr KELLY,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"The use of a registered trade name by any person uot authorized to do so is an offence. A f t e r the war is over, if the honourable member, for example, proceeded to manufacture aspirin here he would be prosecuted by the German owners of that trade name.",44
284,Mr FENTON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"It all depends. Mr KELLY ' - It does not; it is the German ownership of the name that has to be considered. I do not think that the Attorney-General, keen as he is on these questions, has quite grasped this particular side of the matter. Some time ago he actually facilitated the visit of an enemy-born citizen to the United States in order to establish in Australia the manufacture of a particular German-owned brand of eau-de-cologne, although we have here, and had at the time, manufacturers of other brands of eau-de-cologne which would have been in competition with the German-started business which the Afctorney-Geueral was proposing should be set up in Australia.",44
285,Mr WEST,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,Can the honourable member tell me what is eau-de-cologne?,44
286,Mr KELLY,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,I can tell my honourable friend what it is not. The Attorney General seemed to be of the opinion that it would be a fine thing to bring about the manufacture of this particular brand of eau-de-cologne in Australia. All that would have resulted had this little scheme come off is that a factory would have been started in Australia to manufacture for the time being an article that the Germans would have manufactured and have imported to Australia for the benefit of the German capitalists so soon as the war was over. The same situation exists in respect of aspirin.,44
287,Mr HIGGS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,Is the honourable member losing sight of the Tariff?,44
288,Mr KELLY,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"On e cannot deal with a trade description through the Tariff. What I am anxious to see done; and what the ex-Prime Minister agreed should be done, is to prohibit the importation into Australia of goods bearing enemy trade marks and trade descriptions, from whatever country they come. We should utterly prohibit their importation, making the trade mark or trade description the basis of the enemy character of the goods, as it is, in reality.",44
289,Mr WEST,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"An y patent which has enjoyed a two years' monopoly in England must, then, be manufactured there.",44
290,Mr KELLY,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"The late Prime Minister agreed to that principle, but the present Prime Minister sees difficulties in the way. He has quite recently given a licence for the manufacture of aspirin to Messrs. Shmith, Nicholas, and Company, the members of the firm being Harr y Woolf Shmith, George Richard Rich Nicholas, Charles Shmith, Alfred Michael Nicholas, and Joseph Wilhelm Broady. These chemists with good Australian names have now a licence from the Government to keep alive a German trade description, that will ultimately be of immense benefit to the great chemical house which has created this good-will. We are under no obligation to treat German trade in our midst with any particular kindness. It is our duty to try to abolish it , and the only way to do it is to h it at the trade description and the trade mark which our enemies are trying to maintain. It ought not to be a hard thing to ask the Australian who has stayed at home to refrain from buying a thing with a German trade description upon it . Whilst our fellows are fighting for us, those who have stayed behind should at any rate refrain from trading for the ultimate benefit of the enemy.",44

I should not even given a licence to one particular person, thus giving a monopoly for the production of goods to a German trade name, but would throw the whole thing open to anybody who cared to manufacture. By that means we should guarantee that clever people were not keeping the name alive for the ultimate benefit of Germany. It is so essential to our trading interests to tackle this matter immediately that I make no apology for bringing it before the House again, and commend my suggestions to the earnest attention of the Prime Minister.  the Postmaster-General give the Committee an assurance that the new telephone rates regulation promulgated by the late Postmaster-General during the adjournment will be held in abeyance until he can go thoroughly into it and get all possible information from the different go States ? The honourable gentleman understands the position in regard to telephones both in the country and the cities as well as any man in the House, and I am sure that if he seeks further information and goes into the matter f u l ly he will reach a conclusion satisfactory to all concerned. it I have worked out a scheme in my own this mind, but what puzzled me was how to give the business people the cheapest poswith efficiency and good management. They the principal users of the service, and came to the conclusion that the wisest to course would be to allow them to remain as they are at present.

People in towns pay £ 4 per annum in rent to the Department for their telephones, irrespective of calls. Surely regular customers are worth considering ? A u d there is another factor that the Department has not taken into consideration. For night work an extra rate has to be paid, although the calls are exactly the same as in the day time, while for Sunday work time and a half, or double time, has to be paid, although there is no extra charge to the public at those times. Some honourable members may argue that if the charges be put up too high on Sundays or at night there will be no work for the attendants. that should be so, I should say "" good luck "" to the attendants. I should like to see the exchanges shut up altogether at such times, except for urgent business.",45

In the town of Brisbane alone I know of seventeen people who have notified the Department that if the new charges come into force they will give a month's notice to have their lines cut off. On Sundays, for the trunk lines, the rate has been doubled, and yet after 8 o'clock on ordinary nights the rate is reduced by one-half. Where the business management comes in, I do not know. On the very lines that people should be in duced to use as much as possible-long distance lines from country towns, and so forth-the rate has been doubled on Sundays, and yet town subscribers pay nothing extra. A man does not pay 2s. 6d. or 5s. for a telephone call merely for the f u n of talking. In any case, I do not believe in Sunday work, but would do away with it altogether; if Sunday is a day of rest and gladness for one set of persons, it ought to be the same for every worker. By charging a .3d. rate on Sunday I believe we should do away with a lot of social gossip over the telephones. If it be possible, I ask the Postmaster General to stay his hand in the matter of these new regulations. Of course, if - nothing can be done, the regulation must - stand; but my faith in the Postmaster-General is such that I believe that if he gives his mind to i the will find a means of making the service thoroughly efficient, pnd, if not cheaper, just as cheap as at present.",46
301,Dr CARTYSALMON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"Grampians) [9.0] - The honourable member for Oxley, referring to some remarks by the honourable member for Calare, said that an attack had been made on the canteen system in all the camps of the Commonwealth. That, however, is not so, because the honourable member for Calare was careful to confine his references to the camp at Liverpool. The systems at Broadmeadows and Liverpool differ very materially. At Broadmeadows, the canteen system was started by the then M i nister handing over to an individual, who had been engaged in the grocery business in Melbourne, the whole conduct of the If business, with the stipulation that the profits should be divided amongst the men. This person was given certain military rank because of his appointment, and the arrangement worked out very satisfactorily from his point of view, and with a certain amount of satisfaction to the Department, though not altogether to the' satisfaction of the men. In the first place, he prevented the men from getting certain articles which they desired, setting forth a list of those which he was prepared to supply. He had an actual monopoly, and utilized it in the most tyrannical and despotic fashion. Although requested over and over again, he absolutely refused to stock certain things, and the men had to take what he supplied. At the Liverpool Camp that system did not obtain, although I believe the advice of the gentleman from Broadmeadows was sought. The plan adopted at Liverpool was to give a monopoly to a merchant in Sydney, a monopoly which, I believe, is held today, for the supply of the. camp, the only stipulations being that he should place at the disposal of the soldiers an amount of money which would bear some relation to the profits made at Broadmeadows, and that no more than Sydney prices should be charged. It will be seen that the honourable member for Oxley is not altogether correct when he says that the whole of the profits go to the men.",46

It is not a question of profit ; the whole question is one of principle. Is the Government, or anybody else, justified in giving an absolute monopoly to an individual, and thus securing profit to that individual? And I can tell the honourable member that the merchant in Sydney has made a very decent profit. Honourable members seem to have a very hazy idea of what has really taken place, or they have no information at all on the subject. In the past, military canteens were conducted on an entirely different basis.

I am glad to find him so receptive, and I ask him not to dogmatize in future on a subject of which he has shown so palpably he knows so little. I am very glad, indeed, that it was not my business to inform the Committee, as the honourable member has just informed them, in the light of the further information which he has gained, that there is to be an alteration at Liverpool. No one will be more pleased to hear that announcement than the honourable member for Calare, who did not, and could not, know that such an alteration was contemplated. I should like to see an alteration made at Broadmeadows also, because I do not consider that, because a gentleman placed his land at the disposal of the Government, he has provided sufficient reason why he should be given such a tremendous power-whic h he has exercised in a tyrannical way-as was conferred upon him by the Minister of Defence.

Earlier in the sitting I addressed an in quiry on the subject to the Prime Minister, and he was good enough to say that he would be glad to hear something from "" me at the Committee stage of this Bill .

When I enter the House I regard myself as a representative of the people of Australia, and I place their desires and their welfare before any private feelings of my own. I am asking the Government to consider a most important and vital question of policy which does not affect only one drug or product. We all know that the industrial and commercial ence which the British nation has secured as the result of the struggle for supremacy through the centuries has been seriously challenged by those whom we are fighting today, and we ought to realise that when the present war is over we shall have to meet very much greater vigour on the part of that most serious competitor. Therefore, say that we are not doing our duty to those who are sacrificing their lives for the protection of this continent allow any means to continue whereby the fruits of victory snatched from us when peace is declared. After the sacrifices we have made, and must continue to make, we are entitled to some protection from the nation, which at the present time is treating us so cruelly. Our people are suffering today because they are not able to get those products for the supply of which they have relied upon the German nation. In the past we have supinely allowed the Germans to capture our markets. The Old Country is suffering even worse than is Industries are there languishing of the lack of those products or raw materials which were so enterprisingly plied by Germany. And in these trade names and keeping before the public German-made articles under liar titles we are preserving the Germanic trade. It is our duty to do our part at fchis particular juncture by so dealing with all the ramifications of trade and commerce as to secure for the people of Australia that which they are entitled to have. In regard to the familiar item of aspirin, honourable members seem to think that that drug cannot be here. It can be, and is being The process is comparatively more simple than the manufacture many of those other things which are now being produced in England adverse circumstances, and which viously were secured in large from Germany.

Directly the war is ovor German those to whom we have given the right to use the trade name may enable the German manufacturers to re-enter the field which they have exploited to their own advantage for many years past. The chemists of Australia have suggested that the name of "" s p i r p l "" should be substituted for "" aspirin.""

I am prepared to go with the honourable member to a certain extent, but I do not think that either himself or his colleagues are likely to accept the suggestion I make, to bring about that result.

I refer to those ""boodiliers"" whom honourable members opposite are always defending. If we were conducting a private business, and our initia l outlay, though a considerable one, was likely to result in a great saving, we should certainly allow it to be in oneration for a few years before readily making up our minds to inflict increased charges. I challenge any honourable member to disprove the figures that I have given. They have been supplied by experts, and they show that in five out of six capital cities the telephone business is showing a profit. In some cases, in putting the telephone lines underground, it has been necessary to all the tunnel through rock, where it has not been possible to use blasting material on account of the liability to damage the foundations of buildings. On this account the cost-as also the time occupied - ha s been greater than it would have been had the workmen been able to blast this rock instead of having to adopt the slow process of removing it by the use of chisel and gad. However, as the expenditure has heen incurred upon work which will last for at least a quarter of a century, surely we need not pop up the telephone rates at the first possible provocation. I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa that a large number of people will cease to be subscribers if the charges are exorbitant. Certainly if the increased rates will result in a loss it will be a bad business policy to pursue. In regard to some of the remarks of the honourable members for Wentworth and Grampians, I am not here to defend those who are fighting us, bu t at the same time. I am not here to condemn every man who may have a name with something of a German twang about it . If honourable members object to every such person, I ask them to peruse the lists of those who have gone away to take part in the battles of the Empire, for they will find among them a large number of German names, including the names of some of our best medical men, who are at the front administering to the welfare of our soldiers and tending our wounded. I dare say that the honourable member for Grampians knows some of them. A man or a firm need not have a German name to prove disloyalty to Australia or the Empire. Here and in Great Britain men possessing names that are exceedingly British are among the biggest traitors to the Empire. We cannot always judge men by their names.

My own idea is that at the end of the war we shall be called upon to face just as big and important name. problems as those with which we are confronted today-problem s which w i l perplex the highest statesmanship i every country of the world. At the present time there is being built up in Australia a trade with which it will be i m possible for anybody living under Australian conditions to successfully compete. Ships plying from various countries are discharging their cargoes here in such a fashion that if their operations continue unchecked, Australian industries will be wiped out and thousands of our own workmen will be thrown out of employment. We need to realise that today we are faced with industrial competitors who are really bigger enemies to Australia than are some of the countries against which we are fighting in a military sense. It is incumbent upon us to make preparations to meet this competition. There should be more organization in the Commonwealth. Australian manufacturers and chemists should be turning the out goods which are now' being supplied by countries in which the industrial conditions are far worse than those which obo r tain in Germany and Austria.'

359,Mr ORCHARD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"Nepean) [9.42] - As several references have been made this evening to the canteen system,, and as a fair amount of skirmishing has taken place around the Liverpool Camp, I may be permitted to inform honourable members that an alteration in respect of the canteen arrangements there is shortly to be made. For some time past the men at the Camp have not been satisfied with the existing conditions, and quite recently they emphasized their dissatisfaction in a somewhat drastic manner. On Monday last notice was given to the present canteen contractors that at. the expiration of a month their services would be no longer required. These contractors were paying £150 per month per. 1,000 men into the canteen fund . In other words, they were returning to that fun d a profit of 3s. per man per month. That seems a fairly generous concession; and when we consider that the number of men in the Camp varies from 8,000 to 12,000, we must recognise that the canteen fund is rather a big one. The honourable member for Oxley stated that this fund was disbursed amongst the men who leave for the front . To some extent, that is so; but whilst the inquiry into the conditions which formerly obtained at the Liverpool Camp was in progress, I was not altogether satisfied with the way in which this f u n d was allocated. It was then explained to the Court that when a company was leaving for the front, the officer in charge was given an amount proportionate to the time his men had been in camp, and proportionate, also, to their number. The money thus handed over to him was supposed to provide the men under his command with sports on the voyage, and with other requisites after they had reached Egypt. But as the result of personal interviews with many returned soldiers, I do not hesitate to say that there appears to be a great deal of mystery surrounding the disbursement of this money after it has been handed over to the various officers upon leaving camp. I do not say that the money has not been spent, but the men have not been told that the goods, if any, were purchased with canteen funds.",52
360,Dr CARTY SALMON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,It was said tonight that the money was given to the men.,52
361,Mr ORCHARD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"That has rarely happened. Recently Is. 6d. per man was distributed; but it is the only case that I have heard of. The contractors lease the various stores in the camps, and charge a fair rental for them. I believe that at Liverpool between fifty and sixty persons are doing business with the men, and paying fair l y high rates for the p r i v i lege. For some time past I have been voicing to the authorities the complaints of the men, and have spoken of the need for their representation in the disbursement of the canteen funds. At Liverpool the contractors on Monday last received notice of the cancellation of their contracts, the authorities having determined to run the canteens in the interests of the men. We ought not to make a profit out of these canteens; the goods sold should be given to the men at cost price, plus expenses. A suggestion that I would make is that returned soldiers should be employed in the camps as barbers, waiters, and in other positions. That would give employment to a large number of men who have served at - the front. At the Liverpool Camp Is. is charged for a hot bath; but at the German camp those who are interned can get a hot bath for 2d. It is said that the latter rate does not cover the expense; but if money is to be lost, we should lose it in providing comforts for our soldiers rather than for our enemies. During the recess I visited the various camps, and am pleased to say that they have all greatly improved. The camps at the Agricultural Ground, Sydney, and at the Warren, demonstrate that the short cut to efficiency is to make the men contented with their surroundings. At these camps the men are entering into their work with an enthusiasm which is refreshing; there being a healthy rivalry between companies as to the performance of the duties that have to be undertaken. At Liverpool the cooking arrangements are much better than they were, so that the food is better, and there is more variety, and, consequently, less dissatisfaction. New showers and other conveniences have given much satisfaction. The dust nuisance, however, is serious, and, I believe, largely responsible for the sickness that prevails, it being reasonable to assume that where large bodies of men congregate the dust must be laden with germs. My suggestion is that the ground surrounding the huts, cook-houses, showers, and latrines should be asphalted. The honourable member for Brisbane spoke of the extravagant way in which some of our public works, and particularly military works, are undertaken; and I can illustrate his remarks by reference to what has occurred at Liverpool. Some months ago I advised the Government to copy the huts that had been erected at the German Concentration Camp. Those huts are enclosed on three sides only, so that the inmates sleep practically in the open air. At the time about twenty huts had been erected at Liverpool; but now there are fifty or sixty huts there, enclosed on all four sides; and, the ventilation being found insufficient for the summer, one side is now being opened again. Had the suggestion been adopted at first, a considerable sum would have been saved. Apparently economy does not enter into the official mind. Another question I wish to bring under J the notice of the Government-and this applies to all the camps in New South Wales-is the question of week-end leave. A very great deal of dissatisfaction exists because the men are only getting leave once in five weeks. The married men, who have their wives in Sydney and suburbs, consider that they have just cause for complaint in that respect. Considering that the men knock off at noon on Saturday, and that there is no other work for them to do until Monday morning, I cannot see the sense of keeping them unoccupied in the camps for all those hours, when they might just as well, many of them, be at home with their families. As many of these soldiers may never return, why not give them more leave than is allowed at the present time ? Twenty per cent, are allowed off each week, yet, strange to say, in the management of the various camps no consideration is given to that fact by those who provide the food for the camps. The same quantity of food is issued on Sunday as on Saturday, notwithstanding the fact that there are 20 per cent, less men in the camps. The result is that in one camp I know of-onl y a small camp, comprising about 600 to 700 men-it is quite a common thing on Monday morning for close on 200 lbs. of meat to be placed in the incinerator, with a considerable quant it y of bread, through the men not being in the camp on Sunday.  waste.",52
362,Mr ORCHARD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"There does not seem to be proper supervision in regard to the quantity of food issued. It ought to be easily rectified, because if a man applies for leave he must give twenty-four hours' notice. There should be an easy means of checking the number of men absent from a camp on Sunday. This waste is taking place in the camps throughout the Commonwealth.",53
363,Mr WEBSTER,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,Has the honourable member brought this matter under the notice of the Minister?,53
364,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,He is doing it now.,53
365,Mr WEBSTER,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,He could do it in another way if he has the information.,53
366,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,It ought not to be necessary.,53
367,Mr ORCHARD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,I think that if the Postmaster-General has been reading the daily press he w i ll know that there have been frequent comments of this kind.,53
368,Mr WEBSTER,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,I do not mind the press. The Minister is the proper authority to refer to.,53
369,Mr ORCHARD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"There is another very just cause for complaint in regard 'to the various camps, and that is the quality of the bread which has been issued to the men by the State bakery.",53

374,Mr ORCHARD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"In spite of the fact that Mr Black, the Chief Secretary, has issued a regulation compelling private bakers to make even their fancy bread 4 lbs. in weight, the State bakery is continually serving loaves to the various camps which are not up to that weight.",53

379,Mr ORCHARD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"Her e is a letter fro m a foreman who, I understand, went with the deputation to Mr H all I wish to bring under your notice the fact that the State bakery is one of the most slumming bread-manufacturing factories that I know of. I have information from some of the men that have been employed in the above factory, and also from a man that is working there at the present time. They tell me that the dough is done up ready for the oven straight off the scale. Now, in my opinion, as a tradesman of twenty-six years, and also foreman of a large bakery, this way of baking is only spoiling flour. It will make the bread a bad colour, very dry when about twelve hours old, very crumbly. It will lose a lot more weight in the oven, and also when it is taken out of the oven. A few months ago our union approached Mr Hall about this, what we bakers call, sweating in the baking trade, and still the thing goes on just the same. We as a trade union expect a better example than this slop-up, sweating style of manufacturing bread from a State Labour Government. These loaves are becoming known in the camps as "" ironclads.""",54

409,Mr ORCHARD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"I wish now to refer, to the case of a constituent of mine whose husband, a soldier named Private Beasley, was killed at the front. The first information that the widow, who has eight children, received of her husband's death was in a letter from his commanding officer, Lieutenant Hart, conveying the news that Beasley had been unfortunate enough to lose his life by the bursting of a nitro-glycerine bomb. She has not received any official confirmation of that notification yet. Some months ago I urged upon the Government the necessity of endeavouring to set aside a sufficient number of officers to systematize the supply of lists of killed and wounded in Egypt, in order to relieve the anxiety of relatives at the earliest possible moment. I was then informed that this was an Imperial matter, and that our own officers were doing their best; but as complaints are continually being made, I feel satisfied that our own officers are not doing all they possibly could in this matter. The Government should take some steps to alleviate the anxiety of the relatives by letting them know at the earliest possible moment of either the wounding or death of their relatives at the front. Recently a lady writing me on this particular subject enclosed a communication that she had received from the Canadian Red Cross Society's officer in London. This lady had one son fighting in Flanders and another at the Dardanelles, and both were wounded. On 24th May last she received from the Canadian Red Cross Association a letter as follows:DEAR MAOAM - I beg to inform you that Corporal VV. J.

It is a source of comfort to this mother to receive tliese communications, which show that somebody is taking an interest in her boy, and there must be in Egypt many women who would he only too delighted to give their time and services as authorized visitors to hospitals where Australian boys are lying wounded.  even find out where their wounded children are.",55
412,The CHAIRMAN,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"Order ! The honourable member has reached the time limit . Mr J . H . CAT TS (Cook) [10.14] The honourable member performed a public service when he called attention to the position at the Liverpool Camp; but I want to assure him, as one who probably knows as much about bread as he knows about watches, that in this particular matter he is absolutely wrong. Although honourable members may not be aware of it , I have made hundreds of tons of flour into bread. I conducted a business for a number of years, during the course of which I often carried out contracts for bread for public institutions. Bread is not sold to these institutions at so much per loaf. It is always sold at so much per pound. The loaves are put upon the scale, and if the weight is not what it ought to be, other loaves are put on to make up the requisite weight.  in the Chief Secretary's regulation ?",56
413,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"I remember that Sir George Reid once said that if ever he had an expert witness in the box, he always took care to get bim out as quickly as possible, and did not ask him too many questions, as he could not contend against expert knowledge. I would suggest to the honourable member for Hume that he might remember that.  where is the point in Mr Black's regulation?",56
414,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,The regulation issued by the Chief Secretary of New South Wales applies to private bakers who are selling bread to the public at per loaf. That regulation provides that the loaf shall be of a certain weight. But the bread from the Government bakery is not sold to the public at all. It is supplied to public institutions. This is one of those cases which looks differently when you come to know the facts.,56
415,Mr ORCHARD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"What about the quality, of the bread ?",56
416,Dr CARTY SALMON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,Will you tell us how it is issued to the soldiers ?,56
417,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,I do not know how it is issued to the men.,56
418,Dr CARTY SALMON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,I do.,56
419,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"In any case, that has nothing to do with this question at all.",56
420,Mr FENTON,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,It is a mere subterfuge.,56
421,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,The question now at issue is as to whether the State bakery is giving to the Militar y authorities value for their money in supplying this bread. I presume the honourable member for Nepean does not complain that the soldiers do not get enough bread to eat ?,56
422,Mr ORCHARD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,I can hardly say that.,56
423,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,The honourable member evidently has been misled in his contention that the State bakery is not giving proper value in weight to the Military authorities.,56
424,Mr ORCHARD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"When the bread is issued to the men, sqme would get more than required, while others would not get sufficient.",56
425,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,The difference of an ounce or two in the weight of a loaf is not going to make much difference to the amount of bread the men eat.,56
426,Mr ORCHARD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"But one loaf is 10 ozs. short, and the other is 8 ozs. under weight.",56
427,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,When did the honourable member weigh it ? Mr 'ORCHARD - On Tuesday.,56
428,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,Has the honourable member weighed it since then ?,56
429,Mr ORCHARD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,No .,56
430,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"Evaporatio n is a big element to be considered. The honourable member contended that the State bakery was practically defrauding the Militar y authorities by selling bread less than the standard weight; but, as I have shown, the regulation refers to private bakeries selling bread to the public. Now, as to the quality of the bread, I want to say this loaf was baked on Monday. There is nothing wrong with its quality. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - You would not eat that bread upstairs?",56
431,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"Well , I have seen much Worse bread than this upstairs. Of course, if ah honourable member breaks this bread now he will find it stale, because, as I have said, it was baked on Monday in the daytime-and this is Thursday. It s appearance is darker than a sheet of paper with which the honourable member for Calare compared it . The bread, I admit, is not of a very good colour; but that is due to the fact that, as there was a shortage of wheat in New South Wales, flour was imported from America, and that flour is dark in colour. Manitoba flour will bring probably four times the price of ordinary flour, and two or three scoopsful added to Australian flour make a wonderful difference in the quality of the bread. Mr RICHAB D FOSTER - But this is not Manitoba wheat.",56
432,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"I am aware of that. But , generally speaking, flour from American wheat is darker in colour than Australian flour, and thus the appearance of the bread may be affected. In the same way, the imported sugar sold recently was much darker than ovr own product. Australian sugar is the whitest and' best in the world. Now,, aa to the condition of the State bakery, I desire to say it is in my torate, and I have never worked under conditions anything like as good as those under which the men are working there. The conditions are as near perfection it is possible to get them",57
433,Mr OBCHABD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,What do you say with regard to the contention of the man whose letter I read!,57
434,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"I think probably that man had been to the State bakery expecting to get a foreman's job, and because he did not succeed, he turned ""sour."" I have known cases of the not gospel. k in d ; and, as a matter of fact, men have come to me in that frame of mind; and I have advised them not to follow a certain course of action. Only a few days ago, I was at the State bakery, and saw the bread being turned a first time. out. The most up-to-date machinery is installed, so that the bread is handled by the men at all. The old order of things has changed. The men have no longer to bend over bread troughs and mix up flour by hand. A half-a-ton of flour has no longer to be mixed by couple of men. Everything is now done by machinery. Instead of a man having printed. to stand with his head halfway into a [255] hot oven while putting in the bread, there has been installed the most up-to-date ovens, amongst which is an automatic oven whose floor slides out. In this oven a batch can be baked every hour during an eight-hour shift.",57
435,Mr OBCBARD,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,The Militar y authorities themselves have had to complain to the State bakery of the quality of the bread supplied to them.,57
436,Mr JH CATTS,BREAD FROM NEW SOUTH WALES STATE,"If my honourable friend were a supplier of foodstuffs, he would know that some people at times will complain when supplied with a first-class article, while on other occasions they accept without demur an article concerning which there is room for complaint. A great deal depends on the state of their livers. If they are a little out of sorts, they will complain freely, even without cause; but if they are .in good health they will take no notice of the supply of an article which may he a little inferior. If my honourable friend has brought into the House this loaf of bread, which is four days old, as a sample of the bad bread which he says is supplied to the Militar y authorities, I can only say that I hope electhat when the men now in Camp reach the trenches they will be supplied with bread of equally good quality. In the main, I think he is quite in error, so far aB as the bread supply is concerned. I know nothing, of the other matters to which he has referred. He has rendered a. great public service in connection with.the Liverpool Camp; and I may say in passing that, after he brought forward the conditions of affairB there, I did a good' deal to help him. He may accept my assurance, however, that everything that bas heen told him about the bread supply is Progress reported. EIVER MURRAY WATERS BILL.
