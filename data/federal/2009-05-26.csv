2,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Minister for Home Affairs will be absent from question time today and that the Attorney General will answer questions on his behalf. NA North Korea,17
3,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-As members will be aware, North Korea claimed it had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test on 25 May and subsequently carried out a short-range missile test. This is an unacceptdelivery able, provocative and destabilising act by North Korea. All indications point to this being another deliberate step by North Korea in its systematic efforts to acquire a nuclear capability and the means of delivering it. These actions obtain the absolute condemnation of the government of Australia as fundamentally inconsistent with the security of our region and Australia's own long-term national security. While formal verification procedures have not concluded, all indications point to a test having been carried out. Seismic signals consistent with a oneto three-kiloton nuclear explosion in the vicinity of the site of North Korea's last nuclear test in October 2006 have been detected by monitoring stations of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation around the world, including in Australia. Confirmation there has been a nuclear explosion will depend on collection and analysis of emissions from the explosion and is still expected to take some days. The fact that North Korea also tested a short-range missile yesterday was a calculated and further provocation following its 5 April ballistic missile launch, and there are now reports of further possible missile tests by North Korea. This behaviour is unacceptable on the part of the North Korean regime and further undermines regional security. If substantiated, this North Korean nuclear test represents yet another step towards North Korea refining an effective working nuclear weapons capability which directly affects Australia's national security. First indications suggest this test was larger than previous tests. Clearly, this demonstrates North Korea's intention to proceed down the path of developing nuclear weapons in the face of international condemnation. At the same time, North Korea appears to be making steady progress in its ability to refine mechanisms, especially in the area of missile technology. I note the recent missile tests and the clear intent to refine and improve this missile technology. The marriage of these two parallel developments is of the greatest concern to the Australian community and to the international community. Australia and the international community must work in concert to thwart North Korean efforts to marry its nuclear weapons capability with an effective long-range delivery vehicle. North Korea's reckless actions have earned the condemnation of the international community. It is critical that the international community takes a strong and unified position against this unacceptable act aimed squarely at escalating tensions within our own region. The Republic of Korea, Japan, the United States, China and Russia have all condemned in the strongest terms North Korea's latest test. It is important the international community works together to address this serious threat to the peace and security of the region and of the world. North Korea is displaying a pattern of reckless disregard for the international community in its behaviour and it represents a flagrant breach of UN Security Council resolution 1718, which condemned North Korea's 2006 nuclear test and called for an end to missile testing and imposed sanctions on trade in a range of goods with North Korea. The UN Security Council met in an emergency session overnight and agreed to move straight to consideration of a new UN Security Council resolution. Australia is fully supportive of this decision. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said this morning, Australia shares the UNSC condemnation of the North Korea nuclear test and supports a new UN Security Council resolution which will not only reinforce UN Security Council resolution 1718 but also contain new, additional measures against North Korea. The foreign minister has asked Australia's acting ambassador to the United Nations to contact the permanent representatives of all 15 current members of the UN Security Council to register the importance of a decisive response by the international community to North Korea's action. Australia currently has strong, autonomous sanctions in place against North Korea: a visa ban applies to all North Korean nationals, North Korean flagged ships are banned from entering Australia and all bilateral aid is suspended. The North Korean test reminds us of the importance of the international community insisting on adherence to the norms set out in the comprehensive test ban treaty, which prohibits nuclear tests. The North Korean action only strengthens the government's conviction that Australia play an active role in enhancing the CTBT regime, because this directly affects Australia's national interests. The Australian ambassador in Vienna is also currently chair of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation and is working hard to take forward international adherence to the CTBT. We also call on North Korea to re-engage with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and co-operate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency. I am also pleased that the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament, established a year ago and co-chaired by Australia and Japan, is working to bring about the consensus needed to make these non-proliferation regimes more effective for the future. Today I have spoken with President Lee of the Republic of Korea and I am scheduled to speak to Prime Minister Aso of Japan this afternoon. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has spoken to the United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, and Foreign Minister Yu of the Republic of Korea. At my request, our ambassador in Washington has reflected the government's position with the National Security Council of the United States and with the US Special Representative for North Korea Policy, Ambassador Steven Bosworth. In all of this we are registering Australia's deep concern at the North Korean test and considering further ways that we can work together to thwart North Korea's future nuclear ambitions. North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs are an increasing threat to regional security, to Australia's national security and to the wider international community. We must work with our friends and our allies around the region on this threat now to ensure that this emerging threat is contained in the future.",17
4,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Turnbull (Leader of the Opposition) speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 7 minutes. Question agreed to.,18
5,Mr TURNBULL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"On behalf of the coalition, I join with the Prime Minister in condemning the extremely provocative decision of North Korea to detonate another nuclear device. This blatant act of defiance amounts to a direct repudiation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1718. In effect, the North Korean regime has returned to its default setting of brinkmanship and confrontation. Its delinquent behaviour not only challenges the authority of the United Nations Security Council but also represents a profound threat to peace and stability in our region. North Korea cannot feed its starving population and yet, ignoring the basic needs of its own people, it has diverted significant resources to develop and detonate a nuclear device which, according to some estimates, had the same explosive power as the Fat Man atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki in August 1945. Today is not the time or place to engage in theorising about what drives this belligerent, destabilising and frankly bewildering behaviour. The fact is that North Korea is dangerously unpredictable, the one relic of the Cold War era that has not come in from the cold. What does seem to be clear is that yesterday's test was significantly more powerful than North Korea's 2006 nuclear weapons test. That attempt, by almost all estimates, failed. But the sad truth in this most dreadful of sciences is that weapons engineers can sometimes learn more from failure than from success. On this occasion the magnitude of the explosion has been estimated to be as high as 5.3 on the richter scale. Russia and South Korea have released estimates suggesting a 10to 20-kiloton yield from the underground explosion. By contrast, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation has released estimates in the low, singletionally digit kiloton range. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs told the House yesterday, definitive assessments must await the testing of atmospheric samples which will take some time to emerge. But what is not in doubt is the message of provocation North Korea intended to send and the apprehension and anxiety it has deliberately sought to generate, coming only weeks after its firing of a long-range missile towards the Sea of Japan. We note the solemn reactions around our region. We note that South Korea has been forced to place its military on heightened alert. We were honoured to meet in Sydney recently the new President of the Republic of Korea, Lee Myung-Bak. As he is the leader of a key democratic partner of Australia in this region, I was glad to hear of his resolute and principled approach to dealings between Seoul and Pyongyang. We note also, and support wholeheartedly, Japan's demand for strong and effective international action and we welcome the signals from the emergency meeting of the UN Security Council in New York overnight which would suggest a more robust, binding resolution may be negotiated by as early as tonight. We in the opposition believe that all possible pressure must be brought to bear upon the North Korean military regime to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. Under the Howard government, Australia took part in the Five Plus Five talks, an attempt by the broader region to persuade North Korea to abandon its illicit weapons program. Likewise, we strongly supported the six-party talks-involving the US, China, Japan, Russia and the two Koreas-as the best mechanism involving the major powers of East Asia to convince North Korea to become a constructive member of the international community. We have joined in proactive efforts regionally and internato stop the illicit trade in nuclear weapons technology, through our contributions to the proliferation security initiative. The need for a resolute international response to North Korea's delinquency relates not just to peace and stability in our own region but to the wider imperatives of global security, for the fear and concern of everyone who aspires to peace must be that where North Korea goes others soon will follow. I note that the Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is refusing to hold talks over his country's nuclear programs with the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. It raises this question: has the world's failure to respond appropriately to North Korea's flagrant defiance of international protocols had the effect of emboldening others to do the same? It represents a stark reminder, if one is needed, that the world cannot afford to stand back and allow the UN Security Council to be defied. We welcome the efforts of our acting ambassador at the United Nations to press for a robust international response and we trust that the United Nations can and will agree to deliver new and additional measures that will persuade and impress upon North Korea that its policy of blackmail and brinkmanship will not be rewarded.

6,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement in the House yesterday that government debt will peak at $300 billion. I also refer him to the Treasurer's statement minutes later that government debt will reach $315 billion. Can the Prime Minister inform the House whether public debt will peak $15 billion higher than he advised the House yesterday?,20
7,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question. Gross public debt peaks at $300 billion,20
8,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,20
9,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said to the House yesterday, gross public debt",20
10,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,20
11,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The question having been asked, I would have thought members would be interested in the answer.",20
12,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Gross public debt peaks, as I advised the House yesterday, at around $300 billion, which is 21.7 per cent of GDP. When it rises in aggregate terms to $315 billion, that is 21.4 per cent of GDP. As I advised the House yesterday, therefore, ‘peaking' is at 21.7 per cent of GDP, which is around $300 billion. Budget",20
13,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, how is the government building Australia out of recession and laying the foundations for recovery from the global recession for its nation-building agenda?",20
14,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question because he, like various members of this House, is proud of the government's nationbuilding strategy for recovery. Our nationbuilding strategy for recovery involves construction of infrastructure right across Australia, including in Corangamite-and including in various of those seats which were referred to in this House yesterday when it seemed that honourable members from benches opposite were pleased to attend local launch ceremonies while pretending in this chamber that they did not support the measures through the House which gave funding for those local launch ceremonies of infrastructure. I am surprised by that. Under the Nation Building for Recovery plan, there are 115 projects underway in the member's electorate at a cost of $49 million. These include 87 projects under the largest school modernisation program in Australia's history across 72 schools in the Corangamite electorate. There are 18 social housing units being built. There are 10 projects under the government's black spot and boom gates programs, including $510,000 in black spot funding for the Princes Highway West in Belmont. There is $6 million going to five local councils under the Community Infrastructure Program, including $2 million towards a wide-ranging sports facility at Bannockburn which will include new netball, football, soccer and tennis facilities for young families moving into the area. These projects are supporting jobs and small businesses in suburbs like Ocean Grove, Torquay, Grovedale and Colac. This is part of the government's Nation Building for Recovery plan-supporting jobs, small business and apprenticeships for today while building the infrastructure Australia needs for tomorrow. If the Liberals had their way in this House, not a single one of these 115 projects would have ever seen the light of daynot a single school would be upgraded, not a single black spot would be repaired and no social housing would be built. The contrast with those opposite is clear for all to see. Right across the nation we have the same construction work underway-investments supporting 200,000 jobs next year and the year after. This is being done through the vehicle of investing in 35,000 projects across the country by year's end. Let us just take a few of these as examples, because those opposite need to be put up close and personal with what is actually going on around the country. Have a look at the Cootamundra to Parkes railway upgrade. This photo shows the first of 301,000 new concrete sleepers being unloaded near Parkes to commence the Cootamundra der. The rules with respect to props are very clear. The Prime Minister has a whole stack of hard-hat photographs he wants to show to the House and I ask that he not do so.",20
15,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat.,21
16,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,21
17,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So you are not interested in a response to your point of order. There is no point of order and the honourable member for Sturt knows it quite well.,21
18,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To the great disappointment of those opposite, members on this side of the House will be attending ceremonies right across the country, also making sure that these projects are being rolled out right across the country. Ministers will be attending in each one of the electorates represented by those right across the country, because each of those projects equals jobs, equals infrastructure, equals our nation-building strategy for recovery. The Seymour-Albury rail upgrade-here we go. This photo shows concrete resleepering work being done in the Seymour to Wondonga rail project.",21
19,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,21
20,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I assume that the relevant local member is not interested in this. Work will involve the laying of around 225,000 sleepers to complete an upgraded Melbourne to Sydney corridor, which has seen the laying of over one million new concrete sleepers. Again this is about nation building for recovery.",21
21,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,21
22,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let us see those opposite laugh and sneer about this. Here we have defence housing in Brisbane. This is a housing site in Brisbane where 41 new defence homes are already under construction.,21
23,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The member for Mackellar will resume her seat.,21
24,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,21
25,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Sturt is warned. Member for Oxley, there is no need for any encouragement.",21
26,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. On the matter of precedent of this particular display, is it now permissible for the opposition to come in here tomorrow with cardboard cut-outs of the Prime Minister in his jacket and hard hat?",22
27,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call.,22
28,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The great thing about Wilson is he is always on song. For Wilson's benefit, in the seat of O'Connor, there are 265 projects, at a value of $37.3 million. Perhaps the member for O'Connor would care to identify which in his electorate he would not wish to proceed-which of these schools would he prefer not to have upgraded? I am surprised; he is normally so quick to his feet. Mr Crean-He's gone silent!",22
29,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Nothing. What about the social housing units being constructed? Black spot and boom gate projects-there are 19 in the electorate of O'Connor, worth $5.9 million. You want none of the 23 boom gatesis that correct? Six million dollars for 48 local councils-he wants none of that. I see surprising silence on the part of the member for O'Connor. Defence housing: near and dear to the heart of those opposite, near and dear to the heart of those in the governmentMrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Time and again you and other Speakers have ruled out of order the use of props. Why is there an exception on the part of the Prime Minister and will you rule them out of order?",22
30,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,From time to time Speakers have ruled the use of props in order if they are used incidentally to the question.,22
31,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,22
32,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! This is an opportunity for me to indicate, when I hear the interjection ‘use of a PowerPoint', that it would be a wonderful thing if this chamber was so mature that it could actually use things like PowerPoint and photos and that was enabled for everybody. But I think that one of the problems is that, again, we have this insider's view of the way in which the chamber operates. We do not often reflect upon how we are looked upon from outside. I will watch carefully the use of these props, but to say that they have been blanketly banned is an incorrect observation of the way in which this place has operated. Mr Schultz interjecting",22
33,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Hume has a very great habit of making comments by way of interjection on the Speaker. I think the reference that he is making he well and truly understands was deserving of the action that was taken on that fateful day of last year. I will listen to the Manager of Opposition Business, but he should understand that this will not be an occasion to abuse the opportunity that he has in speaking to a point of order which I have already ruled on.  Mackellar raised a point of order which you have quite correctly ruled on from your opinion of the standing orders. You did, however, in doing so, say that the standing orders said that props were entitled to be used incidentally to the question. But I would put it to you, with due respect, that the Prime Minister is not using these props incidentally; they form the major part of his answer to the question, which has now been going for almost eight minutes, and if you expect the House to maintain its decorum",22
34,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will resume his seat. I thank him for his observation. It will not dissuade me from my ruling. I will just add another observation of the eight minutes that this has been going ononly five minutes of them have been an answer.,22
35,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her intervention, as, given that she is wearing her own highvisibility vest today, she is obviously entering into the spirit of the occasion in terms launching infrastructure projects across the nation. Also, Manager of Opposition Business, in the electorate of Sturt there are 82 projects, worth an investment of $40 million. Perhaps the member for Sturt, given he comes to the dispatch box so frequently, could identify which of those 82 projects he would not wish to support-82 projects in 48 schools, $34.5 million into the schools in Sturt. These are funded under the February package, Building the Education Revolution, which those opposite are-supporting or opposing? It is hard to work out. What about the $4 million for the Campbelltown Public Library redevelopment-supporting or opposing? Hmm, there is an interesting silence again on the part of both the member for Sturt, surprisingly, and the member for O'Connor, equally surprisingly.  of order. Previously, you have ruled that the Prime Minister, in asking members of the opposition to answer questions, knows that they are not entitled to do so, and you said the Prime Minister should desist from doing so the last time this occurred. He is doing it again today. If he wants to be able to give us the facility to answer",23
36,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call.,23
37,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, how sensitive they are about infrastructure construction! I would say to those opposite: with each one of these 35,000 projects across the nation, we will be there participating in each of them, including in those electorates where the local members are pretending they are not supporting them. With respect to defence housing, I hold up this illustration of 41 new defence homes already under construction. Just two months have elapsed between the announcement of the stimulus plan and the start of construcof tion of these homes. The Defence Housing Authority has been provided with $251 million",23
38,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, I think that members have the picture. Mr Randall interjecting",23
39,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Canning should be very careful. He should not think that anything has been set as a precedent for that type of behaviour. Mr Randall interjecting,23
40,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"People around the place raising signs. You know. Mr Baldwin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. If the Prime Minister is going to show photos, he could at least show ones with him wearing a hard hat!",23
41,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Paterson may leave the chamber for one hour understanding order 94(a). The member for Paterson then left the chamber. ,23

46,Mr RUDD,NOES,"Therefore, the government's strategy-nation building for recovery-is clear: supporting jobs, supporting small business and supporting apprenticeships, right across the nation today, by investing in the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. That is why we are taking strong and decisive action to achieve this on the groundinfrastructure like rail, road, ports, broadband, solar energy and the biggest school modernisation program in Australia's history. This is investment that supports more than 200,000 jobs that would otherwise be destroyed as a consequence of the recession. The government has rightly stepped into fill the gap left by a private sector in retreat because of the global economic recession. The government has rightly decided to invest 70 per cent of its stimulus in nation-building infrastructure. This is a strategy for the future. It is a positive strategy is a government which is in the business of building the economy up, rather than an opposition seeking to tear and talk the economy down. NA",24
47,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Minister of Housing and Minister of Fisheries, Philip Heatley, from New Zealand. On behalf of members, I offer him a warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Economy",25
48,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement yesterday that in 2020 his government will have left the country with a net debt liability of $75 billion. Will the Prime Minister inform the House in which year his ‘temporary' debt will be finally paid off?,25
49,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am advised by the Treasury it will be within about two years of that time.,25
50,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the reactions from industry and market economists to the budget's emphasis on nation-building infrastructure?,25
51,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dobell for his question. There are something like 74 projects underway in Dobell, including 54 school projects. Isn't that tremendous? It certainly has the support of this side of the House. These projects are supporting jobs and small businesses on the Central Coast of New South Wales. They are a central part of our nation-building plans for recovery. If those opposite had their way, not one of those 74 projects would ever see the for the future. It light of day. What we see in these projects is economic stimulus in action, supporting jobs in local communities and small business in local communities and making up for the fact that private demand has withdrawn. That is what economic stimulus is all about. And that is what the budget has been about-phase 3 of economic stimulus. Phase 1 last year gave cash to cash-constrained consumers to boost demand and employment, particularly in retail. Phase 2 was in February-our nationbuilding plans for investment in schools, investment in energy efficiency and investment in social housing. It was economic stimulus for jobs in action. It was nation building for recovery. That is why this program has had the support of the business community. I quote from Peter Anderson, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who said: The investment is overdue and will contribute to a more efficient and competitive economy when the recovery arrives. That is what he had to say about the nationbuilding investment in infrastructure in the Budget recent budget. Heather Ridout, the CEO of the Australian Industry Group, said, ‘This spending on infrastructure will be directly supportive of jobs.' Trevor Martyn of the Australian Trucking Association said: Australia's truck drivers will be using the roads funded in tonight's Budget for many years into the future. Our journeys will be safer and faster, with lower transport costs for businesses … The endorsement from the business community goes on, because they recognise the importance of economic stimulus. Those opposite do not. We know they do not have an alternative budget plan or fiscal policy. We heard nothing about it in the Leader of the Opposition's reply. They do not want to admit that they would not borrow one cent less or pay debt back one day earlier. They will not admit that because they want to go around the country and campaign against economic stimulus that creates jobs now and into the future. They cannot bring themselves to support this vital investment in our community. But I certainly take great heart from the fact that Australians, right across this country, understand the importance of economic stimulus and understand the importance of economic stimulus in local communities. That is why governments borrow and that is why they borrow responsibly-to support jobs and to leave a lasting legacy for the nation. That is what this government has done and that is what those opposite are opposing. Economy",25
52,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer Prime Minister's last answer today when he said the government net debt will be paid off in 2022. In order to now pay the debt off, the government would have to run record surpluses of more than two per cent of GDP for eight years straight. Treasurer, when ever in the history of our country has a government done that?",26
53,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We know those opposite could not find savings in recent budgets. We on this side of the House are up to the task of making the savings in budgets. We made them in the last budget, and we have made them in this year's budget. We are entirely up to the mark in terms of charting a path back to surplus. Of course, those on the other side of the House went on an unsustainable spending spree at the height of the mining boom and they spent like drunken sailors. We know what they did because the member for Higgins blew the whistle in John Howard's biography, where he complained about the spending of the former Prime Minister and his own inability to stop it. What we will see from this side of the House is fiscal discipline. We have put in place a spending cap of two per cent real when growth returns to trend. That is why our objectives are entirely reasonable and achievable. And it is a bit rich when those on that side of the House cannot front up and find any alternative savings in the budget. Mr Dutton- Mr SPEAKER ",26
54,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Both the Treasurer and the member for Dickson will resume their places. To assist the member for Dickson, I indicate to the Treasurer that he should relate his remarks to the question. Mr Dutton-Well just say you don't understand!",26
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Regrettably, the member for Dickson is now warned!",26
56,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Prime Minister indito the cated before, net debt as a percentage of GDP is expected to be 3.74 per cent in 201920, charting the path back to surplus and paying down the borrowings in 2015-16. This government has been entirely responsible in supporting the economy in our hour of need. This government has had the courage to support jobs through economic stimulus, to put in place a medium-term fiscal strategy and an expenditure cap to bring the budget back to surplus and to pay down debt. If only those on the other side had the courage to front up to this parliament with an alternate budget policy or fiscal policy. They do not have that courage because they want to play the scare campaign. They are so opportunistic and so devoid of a commitment to the national interest, all we get are these silly political games.",26
57,Mr BIDGOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the minister update the House on the impact that Building the Education Revolution is having on jobs in local communities?",27
58,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dawson for his question. I note that in the member for Dawson's electorate there are 216 projects that are being invested in through the government's economic stimulus. Of these, 201 are Building the Education Revolution projects in local schools. The member for Dawson knows that that is great news for his local schools and great news for local jobs. He also knows, of course, that the Liberal Party is opposed to each and every one of those projects in his electorate because the Liberals are all about talking the economy down while we build the nation up. The member for Dawson would also know that the projects in his electorate are being joined by projects right around the country in almost 10,000 schools. This is being well received right around the country. The endorsements for this program have been flooding in. To take just one example in the member for Grey's electorate, a primary school on the Yorke Peninsula, where Nick Goodge says: This is seriously once-in-a-lifetime stuff. It's really exciting prospect for a little school. This is an endorsement about how important this is for local schools. But of course this is also important for local jobs. The Leader of the Opposition has been known to say that Building the Education Revolution is a poor quality spend and that it will not support any jobs. Well, Australians in local communities know the truth and the truth is Building the Education Revolution is there supporting local jobs. To take one example, in the AusBudget tralian on 8 May there was a report about the impact Building the Education Revolution was having on architectural services. It says: Within a week of the federal Government's announcement of a $14.7 billion schools upgrade program, Law Architects had 10 new projects on its books, worth $20 million. Not in [their] lifetime had the economy been so bad-and business quite so good. The article goes on to quote Ms Law, of the business, who says: When the announcement came out, we were leaping for joy, and when the phones kept ringing we kept leaping … We are flat out. We haven't been this busy for many years … Another firm, which specialises in building and architecture for education facilities, is in the process of hiring up to 12 architects in order to deal with the economic stimulus work. Given the National Party has been left in charge of the House today, we might note that in the member for Riverina's electorate her local newspapers are noting that the Building the Education Revolution program is supporting local jobs. One of her local newspapers reports that Laing O'Rourke will manage the overall project and its time frames and has been inundated with applications from the local department of commerce, accredited builders, tradespeople and small businesses with school experience who want to play a role in the program. He is goa ing to base teams in the local area in order to back this program. Then we have the endorsement from the contractor responsible for overseeing the maintenance at a school called Alexandria Park Community School. The head of that contractor says that ‘there is little doubt several of those small and medium-sized businesses would not have survived the global financial crisis without benefiting from government infrastructure contracts'. So the evidence is clear from people in local communities who are in touch with what is happening in their communities. On the other side of this House, all we see is continued opportunism. Depending on the moment, they will blurt out whatever comes into their mind next. In terms of blurting out whatever comes into their mind next, some days they blurt out ‘debt' and ‘deficit'. Some days they blurt out that they proudly voted no. Some days the member for Gilmore and others are going thumbs up for local projects. Some days the member for Wentworth is trying to get himself into the local photograph. People obviously notice this cheap opportunism and these inconsistencies. The members opposite, in their embarrassment and shame because they did not stand up for jobs in their local communities, are yelling out, but the Australian community knows the truth. This side of the House stands for Building the Education Revolution; this side of the House stands for supporting local jobs; this side of the House stands for building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. Those opposite stand for talking the economy down and the sort of carping we have just seen. Budget",27
59,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his own budget papers and particularly Budget Paper No. 1, 10-6, the table relating to the underlying cash balance. I note that since 1970 on only three occasions has the government delivered a surplus of two per cent or more: 1970, 1971, some time ago obviously, and two per cent in 2000. Does the Treasurer seriously believe that Australians will believe him when he says that to pay off the Rudd government debt this that government will deliver eight years straight of two per cent surpluses?",28
60,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The very first point that needs to be made is that I do not accept necessarily the premise of the question. I do not accept the assertions about the levels of surplus whatsoever. I do not accept them at all. What I do know-and this is something the previous government did not do-is that we have published more information on our medium-term fiscal strategy than any government prior to now. We have done that for a very serious purpose. We are in the middle of a once-in-75-years event, which has had a dramatic impact on this country. Mr Hockey-On a point of order, Mr Speaker, on relevance: I would ask the Treasurer to answer a simple question about his Prime Minister's own numbers.",28
61,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The Treasurer will respond to the question.,28
62,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am responding to the question, Mr Speaker, because what has occurred in this budget year is that taxation collections have dramatically fallen, by $210 billion over the forward estimates. There has been a dramatic collapse in taxation revenues, and the responsible course of action for a government in those circumstances is to borrow to support the economy-to support jobs and to support small business. That is precisely what we are doing. The responsible course of action in the circumstances is to chart a course back to surplus, to bring the budget back to surplus as soon as we possibly canin 2015-16-and to pay down those borrowings. That is the course that we have set out in the budget papers. In addition to that, we have put in place some tight fiscal rules. We have said-we said this in UEFO; we said it in February of this year but it was not the subject of any questioning in this House at that time-that there would be a two per cent, real, cap on spending. We said that because we have been prepared to take the courageous and decisive steps to support employment in our economy, to support business, and we have had the support of the business community in doing that. They recognise how important it is to borrow to build infrastructure-the jobs for today and the jobs for tomorrow. They do understand the importance of investing in our educational facilities and the need to bornear row to do that to bring a lasting benefit to our nation and our children. They all understand that. The only people in the country who do not understand it are those opposite. We do have the support of the business community and we have the support of most responsible economists because they all understand that when revenues collapse governments borrow to support their economy. That is precisely what we are doing. The levels of net debt here are low by world standards-very, very low by world standards. We can afford to support our people and we are doing that and we are proud of it. But we also understand our responsibility to pay down those borrowings. We understand that totally, which is why the budget papers contain so much information on our medium-term fiscal strategy. Our strategy is very simple-to bring the budget back to surplus in 2015-16 and reduce the levels of net debt to 3.7 per cent of GDP by 2019-20. That is a reasonable thing to do. It is a responsible course of action and the only irresponsible course of action is the one being taken by those opposite in this House today. Roads",28
63,Mr TREVOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Will the minister outline how the government has expanded its Black Spot Program as part of the economic stimulus plan? How has this increased funding being received by local members and the community?",29
64,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Flynn for his question. Indeed, in the Flynn electorate alone, 13 projects worth some $2.3 million have been approved under the Black Spot Program as part of our stimulus plan. There is $100,000 to fix a black spot in Tannum Sands on Hampton Drive St Francis Catholic school, $1 million to fix a black spot on the Capricorn Highway in the small town of Comet, $60,000 to fix a black spot at the intersection of Falcon Street and Duck Street near the day care centre in Longreach, and 10 other projects in the electorate of Flynn, every one of them leading to support for local jobs, every one of them stimulating the local economy and every one of them leading to an improvement in road safety for all the residents of Flynn and those who travel through the electorate of Flynn. This is just one component of the stimulus package, which is delivering 412 projects for Flynn, worth some $65.7 million. The Black Spot Program was increased by $150 million as part of the economic stimulus plan, meaning that over the next couple of years we are spending a quarter of a billion dollars on black spots, part of the 70 per cent of the economic stimulus plan that we are putting into infrastructure. This additional funding is delivering an additional 607 black spot projects around the country. I am asked also how this has been received by local members and by the community. You can always rely upon the National Party-always good for some material. The member for Gippsland, when he was in Canberra on 26 February, said this: What I'm saying is the government has gone for a very low quality spending spree. We have seen a very low quality spend of taxpayers' money. In accordance with that principle, he voted against the expansion of the Black Spot Program; he voted against the Building the Education Revolution program; he voted against the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program; he voted against all the measures in our stimulus package. So I was a bit surprised to look at yesterday's copy of the Latrobe Valley Express, where there is a lovely photo of Mr Chester at an intersection upgrade that he voted against declaring how terrific it is-in fact, speaking on behalf of the federal government. So I went to the Nationals website. A press release by Mr Chester was headed ‘Dangerous roads to be upgraded'. There are at least two press releases. He has gone through each of the programs, outlining how terrific it is that the federal government is doing these projects and supporting the projects that he voted against. His press release also says: … he would continue to work with State and Federal Government Ministers to secure more funding to improve the safety of local roads. I will give you the hint, brother: just vote it! When these packages come before the parliament, just vote for them. Just sit on side of the chamber and vote with the government. That would be a good start. Of course, the opportunism does not stop there when it comes to the National Party. Indeed, it is just beginning. The member for Mallee put out a press release also, and he said this about black spot funding: This sort of essential infrastructure upgrade spending must be sustained in regional Australia despite economic recession. Correct. Black spot funding goes to the heart of road safety. Correct. There's plenty more that needs to be spent, so I'm hopeful this Black Spot funding does not become a casualty of the May Budget. Listen to this, folks: Expenditure on economic infrastructure is the best way to generate sustainable jobs into the future. Then he goes through the 20 projects in Mallee that he voted against. But there is more-although I must say I am not sure about this. I want to give the member for Maranoa the benefit of the doubt because, when I looked at the press release welcoming our funding that he voted against, I looked at the date: Wednesday, 1 April 2009. Given he voted against it, it might just be an April Fools joke. But there he is, praising the green light for Kingaroy road funding, praising the right move for Dalby road funding. I table that release; I table the releases from Mr Chester; I table the Latrobe Valley Express; I table the media release from the member for Mallee. It is quite clear, when you look at why they say one thing in Canberra and something else in the electorfor ate, that they know that what they do here is not fair dinkum. They know that our ecothis nomic stability package is not only good for their electorates; it is good for the nation. Budget",29

73,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women. How is the government's commitment to build 20,000 new social housing dwellings supporting jobs?",31
74,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for her question. She, of course, well knows that there are 132 projects underway in her electorate. She is very supportive of those projects, because they bring local jobs. As well as building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow, they are providing the jobs we need today in electorates like hers, particularly in suburbs like Hallett Cove, Seaford and Woodcroft. Indeed, in the area of housing, there are 20 new homes being built in her electorate at a cost of $6.1 million in the first stage of the social housing stimulus package. If the Liberals had their way, not a single one of those 132 projects would be going ahead-not the education, not the social housing, not the large infrastructure and not the small grants there either. It is clear that, while we are building the economy up, the Liberals are talking it down-constant negativity on the issue of jobs for the future. Just three weeks ago, I visited Hackham with the member for Kingston and saw the work about to commence on 16 homes in her electorate. While I was there, I spoke to Bradley Jansen, the Managing Director of Qattro, the company that are building these homes. Qattro currently have 14 employees but, of course, as is the way with building companies, they have about 40 to 50 full time-equivalent contractors on their books at any one time. Prior to the announcement of the stimulus package, Qattro were considering laying people off. Instead, when they heard about the stimulus package in social housing, they attended an information forum Budget about it. They saw the opportunities for their business and, instead of laying people off, they are now putting people on. Indeed, they decided against redundancies that they had planned. As well as the project that we are talking specifically about, Mr Jansen wrote to us and said: The social housing stimulus package gave us confidence to plan positively for the future. This confidence, coupled to responsible management, has helped us view this economic cycle as one of opportunity as opposed to one of doom and gloom. Thanks again to your team and the Federal Government for supporting our business, our staff and supplier subcontractor base. It is well worth remembering that, as well as this particular project of 16 homes, the investment that is provided through the stimulus package has unlocked equity that Qattro have. It has meant that they have been able to go right through their building supply chain. Projects that they had stalled because of the very tight finance environment will proceed because they have been able to do this deal with the South Australian Housing Trust to build these 16 homes. Qattro say: This has allowed us to plan for the re-utilisation of the equity and profits on other projects books that are currently stalled due to tightened institutional funding. It is also worth saying that, as well as putting on a new trainee just yesterday and putting on a new contract manager in the next few weeks, Qattro attended a local jobs summit last week that was organised by the member for Kingston. She is a very active member and, indeed, on the day that we were in her electorate she spotted a fellow across the road from the Hackham Business Association-a very nice man; Lloyd I think his name was-and said: ‘Lloyd! Lloyd! Come over and meet these people.' She introduced them to Qattro, and Lloyd said, ‘Yeah, we've got a brickie up the road and we've got an electrician down here.' Qattro have attended the local jobs summit in Kingston and have been able to make connections with local tradespeople and local suppliers there. So the flow-on effects of jobs in that area are supported by this investment in social housing. The Daily Telegraph has been reporting over the last two days on homelessness in Western Sydney. As well as these fantastic job benefits, it is also worth remembering that we are building 20,000 new units of social housing and fixing up more than 10,000 homes that would have been lost as accommodation because of their poor state. Through these 30,000 extra properties and another 50,000 properties through our National Rental Affordability Scheme, we are putting roofs over the heads of families that need to house their children and that need help at a time when they are particularly vulnerable. I would love to hear from the opposition what their plan is to support these families that need a roof over the heads of their children and I would love to hear from them what their plans are to support jobs in construction. If they have a plan, they did not enunciate it in the budget reply speech and they did not enunciate it down there at the on our National Press Club, when they could have. There was not a word on homelessness, not a word on housing these people and not a word on construction jobs. Budget",31

80,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is one hour and 16 minutes into question time and there has not been a single question from those opposite on action on climate change-not a single question on the topic which dominated the joint party room this morning amid such a celebration of party unity, or cross-party unity, as I have heard it described. What the Australian nation saw today was the Leader of the Opposition rolled in his own joint party room. What we saw today was, once again-as on Work Choices, so today on climate change-the Leader of the Opposition rolled by the ideological hard right-wing of his own party and the National Party. The Leader of the Opposition came to the leadership of the Liberal Party rolling his predecessorMr Hartsuyker- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order-that of relevance. The question related to certainty on climate change.",32
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,33
82,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The relevance to certainty on climate change goes to what happens in the Senate through the votes of the National Party and the Liberal Party. That is why this question is of direct relevance to business certainty, certainty on the actions to be taken at Copenhagen, actions which would be necessary to provide Australia with hope on acting on climate change, to help save the Barrier Reef, to help save Kakadu, to take necessary action for the future",33
83,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,33
84,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and those opposite scoff at that possibility. The Leader of the Opposition undertook a political campaign within the Liberal Party to roll his predecessor, with one of his causes being he would be strong on climate change. He accused his predecessor of being weak on climate change. That was the political attack. What happened today was that the Leader of the Opposition was rolled in the Liberal Party party room, rolled in the joint party room, by the climate change sceptics-the self-proclaimed climate change champion rolled by the climate change sceptics. That is what happened on the part of those opposite. Let us go to what currently constitutes the position of those opposite, given how intimidated the current leader of the Liberal Party is by the person who seeks to replace him as the leader of the Liberal Party-that is, the member for Higgins. Remember in the joint party room the member for HigginsMr Hartsuyker- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order-that of relevance.",33

He did so in the joint party room some time ago when he said there are two thingsMr Randall- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is relevance. On any measure the Prime Minister was not in the coalition party room, so he would not know to be able to say this at all.",33
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question went to the importance of business acting to reduce carbon pollution. The Prime Minister will respond to the question.,33
88,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The dynamics of the Liberal Party party room and the joint party room is of direct relevance to what happens in the Senate. The reason we know what happens there is that you leak it all out. That is why we all know-and we know within an hour of it occurring. As my colleague said, there are in fact many emissions from those opposite when it comes to the way in which they leak from their own party room. The next leader of the Liberal Party, the member for Higgins, said in the party room recently that the two things they have got to do are stand against action on climate change and support Work Choices. What have we seen in the most recent few months? Precisely that course of action being supported here in the chamber. The leadership of the current Leader of the Opposition has been fundamentally undermined by his inability to stand up to the climate change sceptics in his own party. The reason those opposite are silent during this debate is they know it to true. It is exactly what has transpired. Let us go to the current position of those opposite, which is that action should be deferred on climate change pending-wait for it-another review. Let us quickly go to the evolving position of the Liberal Party on this question. What did they say back in December 2007? The then spokesman said, ‘We will set both mediumand long-term targets after the Garnaut review.' The Garnaut review was on 30 September 2008. Then they went on to say, ‘We won't set any figures until we see the government's modelling.' Treasury modelling was released on 30 October 2008. Then they said, ‘We will look at what the government comes up with in its white paper and see what the Treasury modelling is when it comes out.' Well, that was released on 15 December 2008. Then they said that they would take a position after the Pearce report was delivered-that is their own internal inquiry. The Pearce report apparently delivered its findings on 30 April 2009. Then we had the member for Goldstein say, ‘Well, we'll finally sort out our alternaroom tive once the Senate inquiry has been concluded.' The Senate inquiry, they have ensured, has been delayed until 15 June 2009. Then they say it is going to happen once we have a Productivity Commission inquiry. There is no fixed date. What you have here is a rolling series of excuses to underpin the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has not had the courage to take on the climate change sceptics in his own party. It is an absolute failure of leadership on his part and he knows it. What Australia is looking for at present on climate change and what the business community is looking for on climate change is certainty. They have called publicly for certainty. When you look at the statements by the Australian Industry Group and by the Business Council of Australia, they want be certainty for the future, and the Leader of the Opposition in response to this call for business certainty has simply gone missing. When those in the broader Australian community want action at Copenhagen to provide Australia with some hope of appropriately helping to protect the Barrier Reef and Kakadu in the long term, the Leader of the Opposition has gone missing. All Australians wanted this Leader of the Opposition to stand up and to defy the climate change sceptics in his own party, but instead of acting in the national interest he is acting in the narrow interest of the Liberal Party all the way through this.",33
89,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,34
90,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I heard an interjection from those opposite saying that this represents a misrepresentation on our part. I have gone through seven reasons they have given in the last 12 months to prevent them from taking a final position on climate change and carbon pollution reduction, and those opposite say that we are misrepresenting the facts. Those opposite had an opportunity in their party today-most particularly the Leader of the Opposition-to show some leadership, to take a position, to actually stand up for the national interest rather than to act purely in terms of the Leader of the Opposition's personal interest. The moral authority of the Leader of the Opposition on climate change, and more broadly, was shredded once and for all in the joint party room today. The member for Higgins, representing the next leadership of the Liberal Party, went in there a couple of months ago and said, ‘The Liberal Party cannot support this action on climate change,' and what we saw today was the current Leader of the Opposition buckle to that pressure. Australia demands action in the national interest and what we have seen instead is partisan action on the part of those opposite, an absolute failure of leadership and an undermining of the national interest.

They are embarrassed by the fact that they have no structural savings whatsoever.

A fundamental save to bring the budget back to surplus and to pay down debt, and who is opposing it? All of those opposite. So they are not sethe rious about a serious medium-term fiscal policy.

107,Mr DREYFUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Will the minister outline the importance of investment certainty in the transition to a low carbon pollution future and what has been the response to the government's proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme?",36
108,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Isaacs for the question. The fact is that certainty is absolutely critical to the business community and to the Australian community in determining what appropriate measures and actions should be taken to respond to the dangerous threat of climate change. The fact is that action on delivering the necessary investment for clean technologies and for energy efficiencies is absolutely central to our efforts to reduce Australia's carbon pollution. And for that investment to take place, business needs certainty. The Prime Minister has just referred to that. The Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and others have made clear on many occasions how important, in terms of economic planning, certainty really is. The government recognise this because we have brought forward a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme for this parliament to consider, and we recognise it because we are bringing the largest ever rollout of a clean energy initiative seen in this country. I notice today a statement by the Australian renewable energy company Pacific Hydro, who, in responding to a major financing deal that they have announced today in relation to Chile, said: Australia will benefit from similar significant investment and job creation opportunities once climate change and energy policies proposed by the Rudd Government are put in place. Pacific Hydro went on to say: We call on the Australian Parliament to ensure passage of both the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) and the 20% Renewable Energy Target (RET) this year so we can set about the task of transforming our stationary energy sector into one that is substantially less carbon intensive and better able to compete on the world stage. That was the message today from one of Australia's leading renewable energy companies. But what was the message that we got from the opposition? What we have seen today is a comprehensive failure of the position that the Leader of the Opposition has held ever since he came into political life. What is more, it is a position that shows that economic policy in the opposition has been abrogated to the National Party. The opposition's position seems to be: ‘We aren't prepared to do anything, but we'll call for another report.' Let us just see how long this has been going on. In 1997 the then environment minister, Robert Hill, established an inquiry into emissions trading. In 1999 the Australian Greenhouse Office released four discussion papers on emissions trading. In 2002 the previous Prime Minister announced Australia would not ratify the Kyoto protocol. In 2003 the then Treasurer and the environment minister took a submission to cabinet to establish an emissions trading scheme, only to see it vetoed. That was six years ago. Six years ago, the opposition, when they were in government, were looking at an emissions trading scheme. In fact, as the opposition leader said on Lateline on 9 July: The Coalition's policy, the Howard Government's policy last year was that we would establish an emissions trading system not later than 2012. And he went on to sayMr Hunt interjecting",36
109,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This will interest the member for Flinders: It was not conditional on international action, was obviously done in the context of international action. What has happened today is this. On one side of the opposition benches we have the National Party, who are sceptical about climate change and want to deny its impact and to delay it. On the other side we have the Leader of the Opposition, who previously has held that climate change is an issue that needs to be addressed. But, when the press releases came out today, I could not help noticing that the press release by the coalition announced that the coalition wants to be in touch with the rest of the world on this issue. I thought to myself: why would that trouble the opposition when, in government, they were perfectly happy not to be in touch with the rest of the world on this particular issue? Mr Truss-You're out of touch!",37
110,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad that the member for Wide Bay, the Leader of the Nationals, has made a timely intervention because it gives me the opportunity to respond to his comments about an emissions trading scheme in which, if I read them correctly in the Age, he said something to the effect that it is a ‘job-destroying rabid dog' scheme. So imagine the instructions that the Leader of the Opposition gives to the Productivity Commission: ‘I want you to consider the matter of an emissions trading scheme. Ignore the comments from my senior colleague that it is a job-destroying rabid dog scheme when it comes to your views.' Seriously, that is where members of the opposition are at on this issue. And then we saw the release from the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate, Barnaby Joyce. Senator Joyce has seen fit to put his views on the record and state with absolute crystal clarity what the Nationals' position on an ETS is. It has got nothing to do with deferring. It has it got nothing to do with referring matters to the Productivity Commission. It has got nothing to do with waiting for any more time to allow other countries to do what the opposition cannot get its act together to think about: what it wants to do. It is all to do with the fact that the National Party do not want one at all. Why do we know that? Because Senator Joyce says that ‘delay is a vote against the ETS' and then goes on to say that the goal of the Nationals is: … to stop the scheme and utilise whatever mechanisms it possibly can to do that … So what we have today is a position that has come out of the party room of the opposition, where economic and climate change policy is being determined by climate change deniers, agrarian socialists and hokey contrarians. Frankly, it is not good enough, and the opposition leader should show some leadership on this issue. Budget",37
111,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister in her capacity as the Minister for Education and it is particularly relevant to regional members like me and to my seat of MCMillan. What advice has the minister received from her department as to how many young Australians currently in their gap year will be penalised by the government's changes to the eligibility criteria for the independent youth allowance?,37
112,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question and I can tell him very clearly what advice I have received. I have received advice that over 100,000 students will be better off-that is, 68,000 students will receive income support for the first time and 35,000 students will receive higher payments. What the changes to the parental income test mean is that parents can earn more before their children start to lose income support-and I think that, as a regional member, the regional member will be very interested in these statistics. The way the scheme currently works is that, for a student to receive the maximum away-from-home payment of $371.40 a fortnight, the income of their family has to be $32,800 or less. Unas der the new scheme, that threshold will increase to $42,559. And then we have changed the taper rate. The current taper rate is 25 per cent. The taper now will be 20 per cent. For the regional member-and I know he will be concerned about this because he will know about incomes in his electorate-I point out that, under the Rudd government scheme, that means a family with universityage kids of 17 years and 21 years living away from home can receive support up to a family income of $139,388. That is compared with a family income of $75,324 now. He would know, as a regional member, that the average annual household wage and salary index study shows us that in regional and rural areas we are talking on average about household incomes of $54,500-that is, on average the constituents in his electorate into this scheme and will get student income support. That is before we moved to the question of the scholarships that we are ing under our scheme. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question specifically asked for a figure, the number of students currently in their gap year who will in fact be disqualified",38

114,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The deputy leader will resume her seat. I refer members to page 552 of House of Representatives Practice, which indicates that, no matter how specific members think that the question is, the Deputy Prime Minister is being relevant in some way or in part to the question and that is being held to be relevant under the standing orders.",38
115,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, this is a serious topic and I am treating the answer seriously. The Rudd government is also introducing student start-up scholarships. Some 146,000 students will get these. That is a major increase from the 12,900 scholarships available now. And we are introducing 14,200 new relocation scholarships. That is also a major increase on the number of relocation scholarships available now. The member also asked me about the characterisation of who is ‘independent' for student income support. This goes to the question of the gap year, which was just raised with me. I can say to the member this on the question of the gap year that he has raised and on the independence test for student income support: the Bradley review found that, in relation to that test, income support was poorly targeted. The Bradley fit review found that 36 per cent of independent students living at home were from families with incomes over $100,000, 10 per cent in hav- that situation were from families earning more than $150,000 and 10 per cent came from families earning over $200,000. When I received that information from the Bradley review, I was concerned about poor targeting. But I was not the only one. Let me quote something to the member which I think he will find very relevant. Let me quote the following advice I got along the way: If the government is serious about reform, then come Budget time we should see some consideration given to reforms suggested by Bradley in student income support-to ensure that sufficient support is going to those who need it. I accepted that advice. It came from the shadow minister for education. Mr Ruddock- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have sought your call to ask whether or not the minister would table the advice, which I found very valuable.",38

120,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister update the House on the government's plans to improve the health system for all Australians and on any other policy proposals?,39
121,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. It is nice to get a question on health. It has been a number of days since the budget and we have not had any serious questions from the opposition on health, we have not had one on infrastructure and we have not had one on family and community services. In fact, even as I stand here today there does not appear to be a health spokesperson or an education spokesperson even here in the chamber. We are determined to invest in health. It is why in our budget we are making historic investments in hospitals, in primary care and in infrastructure in a whole range of different areas. The fact that every Australian can receive free treatment in a public hospital, no matter where they live and no matter what their income level is, is something that Labor is absolutely committed to. It is why the government has invested more than 50 per cent more into our public hospitals than the previous government did in its last agreement. It seems clear to me that the opposition are really struggling to come up with any alternative health policy. I can imagine after the budget the Leader of the Opposition sitting down, perhaps with the member for Dickson and perhaps sharing a Bacardi Breezer or something, and having a chat over what sort of a response they might make. I would not be surprised if the member for Dickson does not have any suggestions and I imagine that the Leader of the Opposition might decide to call an elder statesman of the Liberal Party, so put a call into say, ‘What sorts of ideas do you have for our health polHealth icy?' I am pretty sure that call was made because shortly after we saw some comments coming out that seemed to be the formulation of health policy. We heard the member for Dickson exclaiming, ‘We need to get private patients out of public hospitals.' Then we heard the Leader of the Opposition speaking fondly of his utopian vision that every Australian would have private health insurance. It seems to me that the view was becoming clearer and clearer about what the Liberal Party sees as a sensible health policy: take money out of public hospitals and force everybody into private health insurance. I am sure it will not be long before they are attacking Medicare. So you might, on this side of the House, be asking: ‘Who was it? Who was it that the Leader of the Opposition called in his hour of need?' I want to give the House a bit of a clue. It is an elder statesman in the Liberal Party. It is a person who has been in the parliament for a long time. He is a man of ideas-I know that does limit the people that it might be. He is a man of vision, which does rule out the member for Higgins, in case anybody thought it was him. The Leader of the Opposition decided to call somebody with real policy gravitas and I would like to give you a quote, before I tell you who this person was. Listen to this interview conducted with the then Liberal shadow minister for health. The interviewer says simply, ‘So the proposal is the end of Medicare and for everyone to pay for private health insurance?' The shadow minister says: ‘Yes, no Medicare. Yes, everybody to be privately insured.' And who do you think the architect was-the true ideological grandfather?",39
122,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It was me.,40
123,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, that is right. Malcolm would turn to the member for O'Connor for advice on health policytaking us not just a decade back but two decades back into Liberal Party thinking on health policy. No wonder there have been no questions from the opposition on health after the budget. We are determined to invest in public hospitals. We are determined to support those who have private health insurance. We are determined to get the right balance, and we expect the Leader of the Opposition to be prepared to do the same. He should recant on his view that every single Australian must have private health insurance and he should start backing our investments in public hospitals so that every Australian can get their care in a public hospital free of charge if is what they choose.

149,Ms GILLARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (3.52 pm)-by leave-International education has made a significant contribution to Australia. It has grown to now be our third largest source of overseas earnings, generating $15.5 billion in 2008 and supporting more than 125,000 jobs. In 2008, nearly half a million students came to Australia. It is lead sector in terms of export earnings in Victoria and the second largest in New South Wales. But international students do much more than contribute to our economy and create jobs. They build on Australia's long multicultural history that has created a friendly, tolerant and secular country. International students enrich our society. They help to provide a diverse and rich education experience for Australians. This diversity enables our education institutions to offer a much wider range of courses and campus facilities. People coming to Australia to study and Australians studying abroad promote cross-cultural experiences that benefit us both now and in the future, building understanding that underpins tolerance and stability here and abroad. The relationships formed by students support long-lasting diplomatic, research and business links. From the early days of the Colombo Plan through to the current day Endeavour scholarships, we have provided scholarship opportunities to students from across the Asia-Pacific. Many have gone on to be leaders in their own countries and the contacts and relationships they forged as young students have proved of invaluable benefit to us. Australian government support for international education The Australian government has provided significant support to facilitate the development and growth of the highly regarded international education sector we now have. We have done this through an integrated approach to policy, regulation, international engagement and promotion, both here in Australia and overseas, using our international network of counsellors. In March 2009, I announced the Study in the Australia 2010 strategy, a $3.5 million drive to support Australia's international education and training sector during the global recession. It is underpinned by four key themes: showcasing Australian education and training excellence; positioning Australia in the global market; enhancing the student experience; and supporting the Australian international education sector. The Australian government's 2009-10 budget continues our drive for a world-class education system, planting the seeds for Australia's future growth and positioning Australia as an education leader, with modern facilities and high-quality teaching. Australia has a long record of providing scholarships. Our Endeavour scholarships are internationally competitive, merit-based scholarships providing opportunities for citizens of the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Europe and the Americas to undertake study, research and professional development in Australia. Importantly, awards are also available for Australians to do the same abroad. The Endeavour scholarships have recently been enhanced by the Prime Minister's Australia Asia Endeavour Awards, a $14.9 million initiative over four years that will further enhance the internationalisation of Australian education. These new awards will develop internationally-aware, skilled future leaders in Australia, build human capital within Australian businesses and contribute to productivity gains and innovations, establish enduring education and professional linkages and develop a network of people across Asia which has a strong affinity to Australia. Moving forward-focusing on two key areas Today I want to focus on two aspects of international education which I believe will be fundamentally important to the future of Australian international education: quality and the student experience. To remain competitive we need to: - continue to enhance our quality education and training system and ensure that Australia's reputation for world-class education is maintained and strengthened; and - further improve student experiences, particularly students' living experiences and safety. Quality-a cornerstone Australia needs a highly regarded, highquality and internationally relevant education and training system, one which provides students, both Australian and international, with the skills and knowledge they need to participate fully in our globally engaged economy and society. The Bradley review found that the future of Australia's higher education system rests on continuing to ensure its quality and reputation. In responding to the Bradley review the Australian government has committed to the creation of Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA), which will oversee the new framework for quality assurance and regulation. It will accredit providers, carry out audits of standards and performance and streamline current regulatory arrangements and provide for national consistency. A national approach to regulation and quality assurance will mean Australia's knowledge and skills needs can be met in a more efficient and transparent way, enabling higher education providers to focus on what they do best-providing quality higher education. Australia offers students a high-quality education and a choice of education providers. Australia cannot afford poor-quality provision of services damaging the international reputation of our education and training. The government has developed a close working relationship with the states and territories on these issues. This strong relationship has resulted in initiatives like the recent program of targeted swift audits by the Victorian government. We will work with other states to implement similar initiatives. As part of a strengthened compliance regime, we are increasing our scrutiny of education providers. Our focus is to assist them to better understand their legislative obligations, through workshops and other educative material, at the same time ensuring that providers are fully aware that the Australian government will not hesitate to use the full extent of its legislative powers to sanction those that breach the law. To further enhance quality and protect students, the Australian government will also review the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 in 2010-11 in consultation with state and territory governments, the sector and students. The review will make sure that the framework for regulation of overseas education meets world's best standards before it becomes the responsibility of TEQSA. I am also working with my colleague Senator the Hon. Chris Evans, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, on student integrity measures to support genuine students to come to Australia to realise the benefits of an Australian education. Student experience-a cornerstone I am aware of and am concerned about the reports in the media of international students' safety being compromised and of their having unsatisfactory experiences while in Australia. I was personally particularly disturbed by recent violent incidents which occurred in my own electorate. Most international students report that they do feel satisfied with their social experiportant ence while in Australia. However, reports of any violence or discrimination directed at international students can do much damage to our international reputation as a welcoming country. The Australian government is working with state and territory governments, through its Joint Committee on International Education, to enhance the student experience. This group is: - building on the learnings from the Victorian and New South Wales task forces to improve the experience of international students nationally; - identifying and addressing gaps in support services and information for international students, including addressing the question of the performance of education agents; and - addressing key concerns around social inclusion, safety and accommodation, including by promoting greater diversity and raising Australians' understanding of the benefits of international education. Today I am announcing that the government will invite international student representatives to participate in a round table to discuss issues affecting their study experience, such as accommodation, welfare and safety. I will also be asking the round table to consider how the government can best hear and respond to their views on these and other issues of vital concern to international students, on a continuing basis. I will shortly call for expressions of interest from those wanting to participate in the round table. Participants will be selected on the basis of their ability to represent the views of international students. The round table will include participants from across all international education and training sectors, and all states and territories. With over 430,000 international students visiting Australia annually, it is imto me that their views and concerns are heard and addressed by government. The outcome of this round table, along with other international education issues, will inform discussions with state and territory education ministers at the inaugural meeting of the Ministerial Council on Tertiary Education later this year, and we will agree on what more needs to be done to promote and protect Australia's reputation as a safe destination for top-quality study and research. Conclusion I am committed to working towards a sustainable international education sector that delivers high-quality, internationally recognised courses which maximise international students' experiences and outcome. I want international education to continue to positively contribute to Australia's productivity, participation and society. In this parliament today-and I am sure, in this regard, I speak for all members of this parliament-I also want to send a message loud and clear that international students are very welcome in this nation and Australia will not tolerate discrimination against or victimisation of any of our international students. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Boothby to speak for 12 minutes. Leave granted.",42
150,Ms GILLARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Dr Southcott speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 12 minutes. Question agreed to.,45
151,Dr SOUTHCOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"As the shadow minister for education is unavoidably absent, I will be responding on behalf of the opposition. I have a response that has been prepared by the member for Sturt, the shadow minister for education. As the Minister for Education said, education represents Australia's third most significant export industry after coal and iron ore. We cannot overstate the importance of this industry to Australia's economy, Australia's university system and the quality of Australia's skilled migration intake. A strong international student community provides immense benefit to Australian students at our universities too. They contribute to an enhanced cultural experience for our local students and, as many of our international students later take up leadership roles in business and government when they return to their home countries, our own community and business leaders have excellent networking opportunities with our regional leaders. Many international students emerge from our institutions and choose to migrate to Australia, providing us with highly skilled new citizens who contribute greatly to our nation throughout their lives. I myself remember with appreciation the good friends I met amongst international students at Adelaide university when I was studying in the late 1980s, some of whom I have been fortunate to maintain contact with in the years since. The elephant in the room when discussing the contribution of international students is that the government's 2008 decision to abolish the right of Australian students to take up full-fee places at Australian universities has left our higher education sector dangerously dependent upon the international student sector for its continued financial viability. In her recent review of Australian higher education, Professor Denise Bradley paid tribute to the great success of our university sector during the stewardship of the former Howard government in developing a remarkably strong international education sector. Indeed, it was during the Howard years that education rose to become our third largest export earner-and to that end I acknowledge the valuable work of former Ministers Vanstone and Kemp as well as the members for Bradfield and Curtin. As Professor Bradley wrote: Australia has been a world leader in international education. It has also been extremely successful in developing education as an important export industry and Australia's universities have been central to the development of this industry. Professor Bradley also gave a warning that the new government cannot afford to rest on its laurels, particularly in a shifting global environment. Professor Bradley said: But the Australian Higher Education sector will need to build on this success and broaden the focus of its international education activities if it is to remain globally competitive. A critical issue is whether our approach to promoting and regulating international education needs to change in recognition of the current stage of development of the industry in Australia and the strategies adopted by Australia's international competitors. The opposition has previously signalled its disappointment at the low priority placed on higher education by the current government. As I said earlier, last year this government created a funding crisis in our universities removing their right to allow any intake of full-fee domestic students. This group of students had provided an important funding growth stream for our universities that was providing significant and increasing funds that could then support improved courses. In this climate of increased demands for funds, the government's own Bradley review provided a series of recommendations that Minister Gillard released in December. At the time, the budget was not $58 billion in deficit. Our current generation of university students had not yet been consigned to spend their working lives paying back this government's $315 billion worth of debt. As the government was looking for ways to spend billions and billions of dollars, higher educapects tion did not even make it to the starting gate. $3.7 billion was spent on pink batts-not a penny, not a cent, for higher education; $22 billion was spent on cash handouts. Our universities could only look on with longing. It took the government six months to respond in the budget to the Bradley review, by which time they had already spent all of the Australian people's money. No wonder there was only $1.5 billion in new spending for teaching, despite Denise Bradley's call for more than four times as much. Our universities will therefore remain dependent upon the international student market for their continued viability. There are many other reasons why we should cherish our international students. They deserve better than to be considered primarily as a funding source. For all of these reasons, the opposition welcomes the minister's announcement today of a round-table discussion with international student representatives to discuss ways to improve the experience of international students, to identify and address gaps in port services and information for international students and to address key concerns by around social inclusion, safety and accommodation. I believe it is particularly important to address some of the safety concerns that a number of international students, or indeed potential international students, may have. We are all aware of our shared national shame when we see media reports of international students who may have come to some harm while on our shores. The minister mentioned her distress upon learning of recent violent incidents in her own electorate and it is a distress that would be shared by all members when these incidents occur. While Australia is a safe country by many measures, some students from different cultural backgrounds come to Australia and find asof our city night life, for example, quite confronting. There are areas in some of our major cities that are near to our educational institutions and student accommodation, which perhaps many members of this House might choose to avoid at night. It is important that students be given appropriate support while acclimatising and orienting themselves to life in Australia. I would hope that the minister's round-table will contribute to the suite of resources available to international students as we work to continue enhancing Australia's international reputation as a high-priority destination for study and research. I hope that, in addition to the minister's promise to include representatives from all international education and training sectors and all states and territories, the government will work to ensure that as broad a range of cultural backgrounds are represented in this round-table as is possible-recognising the different sorts of challenges that are faced by students from different backgrounds. I confirm the opposisup- tion's support for this sensible measure. NA Budget",45

153,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have been hearing a lot of concern lately in cricketing circles about the future of spin bowling in Australia. Do we really have a quality spinner whom we can send on the Ashes tour? Is spinning a lost art in Australia? I wonder who it might be that spins better than anyone else. Frankly, I was rather surprised when the Australian team was named the other day and the craftiest and trickiest spinning was actually left on the bench. He is someone who can spin with the best of them. He can spin to the left, the left and the Leftperhaps the most extraordinary spinner we have ever seen. But he was left behind. That man, of course, is the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. In less than a fortnight since the budget was handed down, the Prime Minister-ably assisted by his spin twin, Treasurer Wayne Swan-has tossed up more leg breaks, googlies, doosras and flippers to the Australian public than even the great Shane Warne. But it has been spin without substance. Perhaps the most stunning example of the spin was the extraordinarily stubborn refusal of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to use the words ‘$58 billion' or ‘$300 billion' together in a sentence to describe the government's deficit and debt. Of course they were back at it again today, where the Prime Minister could not bring himself to use the word ‘dollars' after the confusion about whether in fact the maximum debt is $300 billion or whether it is $315 billion. Now there might not be much guile in a lot of that spin, and it is perhaps not surprising that the journalists were considering the actions of the Treasurer, and, for that matter, the Prime Minister, as just silly games. It was silly games, but it was not silly games by the media or the public. They had a right to be told in the budget speech how much the deficit was going to be and how much the debt was going to build up to in subsequent years. Is it any wonder that the disease spread to the member for Petrie? She had not heard these numbers used together, so she could rightfully plead ignorance. She did not know what the deficit figure was; she did not know what the debt figure was when she was rostered for her perhaps once-a-month turn to do a doorstop on arrival to Parliament House. I guess she is off the list now, like the talent member for Dawson and others, who dared not to use the carefully chosen lines for the spin of the day. For a full 13 days, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer seemed to think that if they did not mouth the words ‘$300 billion debt' or ‘$58 billion deficit' then the light bulb would stay off above the head of every Australian. They thought they could go on and bore interviewers, without the mere mention of any real numbers that would actually mean something to the people of Australia. But this $315 billion debt is in fact a lot of money. When the public come to appreciate how much this debt really means to them and to their future, they will know it is an awful lot of money. It is a debt bombshell like our country has never seen. And, when the spin doctors finally realised that this message was in fact starting to grate on people, they could not stop using the word ‘billion'. They were at it all the time, time and time again. Then they accuse the coalition of talking down the economy when we make frequent reference to the fact that this incompetent and incapable government has, in just 18 months, turned around a government with a surplus, a government with money in the bank, to one that is now borrowing from people around the world and heading towards a debt of $315 billion. With all of the political spin in the world, no-one can make that sort of money sound like nothing. A billion dollars is a lot of money; a billion means a lot. In fact, if you are going to pay back this $315 billion at the rate of $1 a second, it would take more than 10,000 years to recover the debt. Labor has mounted, in just 18 months, a debt that, if it is paid off at the rate of $1 a second, will take 10,000 years to repay. It is real money; it is the money that should be in the hands and the pockets of the men and women of Australia. Mum and dad and their children will have to go without because they will be paying off the spending of this government. This government might be master spinners, but they are completely incompetent when it comes to economic management. The children of today will not be able to go to the cricket because they will be paying off the spinners' debt. They will not be able to go to the school camp in the future because they will be paying off their share of this enormous debt. They will not be able to enjoy the things that they should have in life because we will be paying off the debt of this government. It is simply an inevitable fact that there will be less money available to spend on roads and rail infrastructure, on schools and hospitals, on youth allowance, on cataract surgery-there will be less money in the future to spend on all of the important things in our society because one of the biggest items in every federal budget every year will be paying off this government's debt, paying it off year after year. The debt bombshell will be blowing up in every budget between now and, the government says, some time in 2022-but that assumes record budget surpluses. It is the kind of surplus Labor have never achieved in their history, and yet we are being asked to believe it will come in, year in year out, in the future. I have a bit of news for the spin twins: the public is brighter than they may think. The public knows a bad deal when it sees it. People were happy to get a $900 cheque to pay off some of their personal credit card bills or to enjoy a day at the poker machines or wherever else they may have chosen to spend it. I pointed out during the MPI in budget week that the interest bill for this $900 cash splash, and everything else that Labor was proposing, amounted to $900 a year. In fact, now that it has been confessed that the debt figure is $315 billion, the interest will be about twice the $900 cheque that these people have got once, except the interest bill is going to have to be paid every year until the debt is finally repaid. So, for one $900 cheque, people get a $1,800 interest bill every year of their lives until this debt has been paid off. It is all about spin. There was plenty of spin before the budget, but when it came to budget night the ball hardly turned at all. The reality was the government was unable to make the tough decisions that were necessary to rein in its expenditure. All that is left, after all of this spending, is the debt bombshell. The chief spinner has gone off at the drinks break, leaving $315 billion worth of debt-and that is no small number. And, just because the government can think of other countries that have a bigger debt, that does not make this debt acceptable. Have they forgotten that only 18 months ago we had no debt at all? The wonder down under economy did not have a debt, but the government has wound it up so that now we can compare ourselves with the great spenders of the world. The government seems to think that there is some great, intrinsic merit in spending more than others can spend. But it is not spending that matters; it is what you pay for that counts. The reality is that they have started to wind back a couple of the budget measures. It was not long before the union bosses came on the scene and said: ‘Hey, we won't have this new share ownership scheme. That's not for us.' Now the captain, the chief spinner, did not come out to tell the public they were backing down on this story; it was twelfth man who was sent out to break the news that in fact the government was going to bow immediately to the union mates. It only took a few hours for the union mates to get their message across, and their servants, the people in government, decided to back down on this measure. The reality is that there are plenty of people in just as much need. What about the students who are going to lose their Commonwealth accommodation scholarships because Labor has abolished them? What about students in their gap year who are not going to get access to the independent youth allowance that they had expected? And what about those people who will no longer have access to cataract surgery because the government has decided to cut the benefit? This is the kind of approach that this government has taken to expenditure-splashing money around but, when it comes to people in need, it is time to cut and cut. This government, like all Labor governments, spends a lot of time and spin on all sorts of things that they are going to do, and after a while the public realises that they have not actually done anything. Then we get to the next stage of the spin. The Prime Minister, or in the case of Queensland Anna Bligh, the Premier, goes out in a hard hat. They are seen in a tunnel every day pretending that something is actually being donethat they are actually a government that is delivering something. The spinners are out wearing the hard hats. Usually, in cricket when the spinner is bowling it is the close-in fieldsmen who wear the hard hats. In this case, it is the spinner himself who is wearing the hat. They run this kind of spin that the government is spending more than the coalition did on this, that or the other. But what is important is not how much you can spend but how much you are actually paying for. Any five-year-old can go out and spend money, and spend more than the five-year-old down the street. What we really need is an understanding of where the money is going to come from. In our first eight years, we had to pay for what Labor had spent the last time. So, when they criticise us for not having other spent money on roads, it was because we were paying money for the roads that Labor had built during their time in government. They have not learnt any lessons from that. They are out spending again now but not paying for it. That is a debt for future governments to pick up. The real test is how much they are paying for, not how much they are spending. So, when they go to openings-the opening of the new assembly hall that has been dumped in the schoolyardthey should not say how much has been spent on the project; they should say how much debt is being left to the children of that school to pay back: about $15,000 for each of the children in return for the school building that they get. When they have the plaque at the official opening saying how much was spent, it should also say how much debt has been left behind as a result of this spending spree. Labor makes much of the claim that it is spending on infrastructure. But the fact is that Labor will spend less on road and rail construction over the next six years than the coalition committed to spend over the next five. For all the talk of $22 billion in new infrastructure spending in the so-called nation building for the future package, only $1.7 billion will be spent this financial year when the stimulus is supposed to be occurring. Only $1.5 billion will be spent in 200910. To construct all the projects that are funded in that package, other levels of government or the private sector will have to stump up another $60 billion. Nowhere in the budget papers or in the national infrastructure priorities are there any cost-benefit analyses to demonstrate that the project chosen is in fact the right one. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government comes into this place frequently demanding accountability and talking about auditors' reports. Now he is in charge, he is asking us to believe that Infrastructure Australia has done some kind of cost-benefit analysis on these projects and these are the ones that are chosen. But he will not release the figures. He will not tell anybody about it. This has all got to be confidential. We are not being told what the numbers are and why these projects have been chosen. It sounds very smelly to me, like Labor's infamous Better Regions program-closed before it was even open. The only projects being funded are those promised by Labor members of parliament and Labor candidates at the last election. No-one else need even bother applying. I am looking forward to the Auditor-General's report on the Better Regions program. It is a scam beyond belief. It is funding projects that have been specifically rejected by the department on the basis of their being unworthy. Despite all the spin, this is an infrastructure package that means it is basically business as usual. It is about what the previous government would have spent in good times or in bad. The reality is that Labor is all spin and no substance. They are also very good at criticising opposition members for being involved in openings and similar occasions for projects that might be funded under this package. Do they remember the $1.2 billion Investing in Our Schools Program? Labor members all partover the place now are turning up to open Investing in Our Schools projects even though they abolished the program. Even the Treasurer turned up in his electorate to open one of these projects. He put it in his newsletter and said it was a government initiative. It was a government initiative all right-they axed the program! The hypocrisy that has been associated with this government's criticism of opposition members for doing their job in their electorates is mind boggling. I can produce hundreds of letters from Labor members backing projects that they voted against, and their criticism is typical of the spin that the government is mounting around its budget. It is just like when the Prime Minister arrives at a site and the machines have to start up to provide a television picture so there is a pretence that there is something happening, and then all the machines stop when he leaves. This is the kind of government we have. Once the television pictures are done, then the project is done as well and the tab will be picked up down the track. (Time expired)",47
154,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy and Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation) (4.28 pm)-I am just trying to draw a diagram to summarise what the Leader of the Nationals had to say. He started off saying it was all spin, and then he went on to say that Labor's spending is creating too much debt. ‘Spin' suggests that there is no spending. The next proposition is that Labor's spending is creatthirds ing too much debt, and then he says the Nationals would have the same level of spending that Labor in government has had-they would have done it anyway. I am advised by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry that during the last matter of public importance the Leader of the Nationals complained about spending cuts the entire time. So this is the problem-they say one thing in one matter of public importance debate and another thing in another; one thing in their electorates and another thing in the parliament. They hope that no-one notices, but we do notice. This government is engaged in nation building for recovery, yet this MPI criticises the two stimulus packages that have been brought down by the government. I will go through some of the economic context very quickly so there is an appreciation of the environment within which the budget was formulated and the two stimulus packages were brought down. Australia has experienced the biggest fall in export earnings in half a century. The coalition in ernment enjoyed the highest commodity prices in half a century. Labor has come to government at a time when Australia has experienced the biggest fall in export earnings in half a century. That has contributed directly to the carving of $210 billion off Commonwealth taxation revenue-$210 billion has been lost from Commonwealth taxation revenue. Sounds like a big number? It is a big number. It is one dollar in every five of Commonwealth taxation revenue wiped out as a consequence of the impact of the global recession and its impact on commodity prices, meaning that the Commonwealth has lost one dollar in every five of Commonwealth taxation revenue. That $210 billion deterioration accounts for two-thirds of the total deterioration in the budget bottom line. These are the external influences-twoof the deterioration in the budget bottom line caused by a $210 billion loss of Commonwealth taxation revenue. Yet the coalition, through this pamphlet and through their websites, which I have inspected, are giving the impression that they would not have any debt-that debt is bad and the coalition stand for no debt. Not only that, the Leader of the Opposition was asked about this very topic on the AM program on 13 May this year. Chris Uhlmann asked: But just quickly, you would have engaged in some stimulus spending and there would have been a deficit? Malcolm Turnbull gave quite long answer, but he said: … it may have been in deficit by a very small amount or it may have been in surplus by a small amount … There you have the Leader of the Opposition saying that if in government the coalition would have a small deficit, a small surplus or a balanced budget. They are saying they would eliminate the deficit. That is their pubgov- lic statement-and yet the fall in Commonwealth taxation revenue accounts for two-thirds of the deterioration in the budget bottom line. So the Leader of the Opposition is really saying that he can fix the fundamental problem here, and that is the collapse of commodity prices. I can just see him nowKing Canute: ‘I command commodity prices to rise.' The King Canute of Australian politics, the Leader of the Opposition: ‘I'll fix it all. I command you to rise, commodity prices.' So absurd is the economic prescription of the Leader of the Opposition. If he is going to go around saying that Labor's net debt is no good and we should have a balanced budget or a slight surplus, you would think he would have used the opportunity to say so on the Thursday night of his budget reply speech-a golden opportunity. Expectations were raised. I was waiting in breathless anticipation for the Leader of the Opposition to come in here, show some courage and say, ‘This is how we would move from deficit into a balanced budget. These are the taxes that we would increase. These are the savings, the reductions in government spending, that we would make.' What did he do? He produced not one dollar of net savings when he had a golden opportunity in his budget reply to do so. He does not have the courage to put his money where his mouth is, say where the money is coming from, say which taxes he would increase and say which programs he would cut. He is guilty of duplicity. He is guilty of hypocrisy. Let us see what the Leader of the Opposition said about the first stimulus package, about which he has subsequently become so deeply critical. On 14 October last year he said: … we are not going to argue about the composition of the package or quibble about it. It has our support. It will provide a stimulus to the economy, that's for certain. Here he is supporting the stimulus package, saying it is great. On the same day, he went on to say: … we're not arguing about the size of the stimulus. We support these measures and we are particularly pleased about the measure, the payments to pensioners. What did he subsequently describe it as? A cash splash-a total waste of money. This is the duplicity and the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition. He says something one day to suit his purposes and then something different the next. I will not have time to list them all, but there was a litany of quotes from the Leader of the Opposition subsequently saying, ‘We never liked that stimulus package at all. We voted for it, but we never liked it and never said it was good.' But they did say it was good-they supported it at the time. On the second stimulus package, of course, the Leader of the Opposition said, ‘We wouldn't have introduced the same stimulus package; we would have had one about half the size.' So instead of Labor's net debt of $188 billion they are saying they would have $168 billion. Half of 42 is 21. Take 21 from 188 and you have 167. Mr Anthony Smith-You're not good with numbers, you lot, are you!",51
155,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think I am actually a lot better with numbers than you, mate. You are the numbers man for your bloke, sitting up there on the back bench, the member for Higgins. The member for Higgins is not even here in the chamber, so do not talk to me about being good at numbers, mate. You are hopeless at numbers-absolutely hopeless. We had the Leader of the Opposition saying that under the coalition the deficit would be $21 billion lower-$188 million; $178 billion; $168 billion; $167 billion. There it is, right on the money-$167 billion is good; $188 billion of net debt is really bad. That is really what he is saying. But even then in his budget reply he did not identify the $21 billion that he would save. He had the opportunity to do so. At least he said, ‘We don't support this package; we're voting against it'and vote against it they did. Why? Because the member for Higgins, the guy for whom you are the numbers man, up there on the back bench and on Lateline, described the stimulus packages as a ‘low-quality spend'. Then it caught on. Here in Canberra the coalition, full of courage and full of bluster, said: ‘That's a low-quality spend. We're not voting for it.' At least you can respect them for that. Here they are in Canberra saying that they are not going to vote for all this infrastructure and school modernisation stuff. It is far too expensive-a low-quality spend. Okay, that would be understandable, but what have we got? This matter of public importance has been put by the Leader of the National Party, the friend of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry hereMr Burke-I love him!",52
156,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He loves him. He is very, very fond of the Leader of the National Party. Why? Because he gives us so much material. He gives us so many lines. There are two Nationals here now from the guilty party. You are both guilty. Why? The member for Maranoa, on 1 April, put out a media release headed ‘Green light for Kingaroy road funding'. It stated: Federal LNP Member for Maranoa Bruce Scott welcomed $650,000 in funding from the Federal Black Spots Program … Ain't that grand! The very program that he voted against and that they described as a ‘low-quality spend'. On the same day, April Fools' Day, in another press release headed ‘A right move for Dalby road funding' another $70,000 was welcomed. And then we have the National Party member for Mallee-and his name is John Forrest. I would not use the name ordinarily in parliament, but I am quoting directly from a press release: Federal member for Mallee John Forrest says Black Spot funding approaching $2 million for the Mallee Electorate announced by the Federal Infrastructure Minister today will be money spent. Money that they voted against! Now we have the member for Gippsland. Thank you for coming along, because you probably thought you would get a run in this MPI and you are. The article's headline is ‘Dangerous roads to be upgraded'. It states: The dangerous MCKean Street intersections with Victoria and Dreverman streets in Bairnsdale will be upgraded following an announcement of $500,000 from the Federal Governmentwhich the member for Gippsland voted against. So you are all brave here in Canberra, but when you go back to your electorates you are cowards. You are cowards because you do not have the guts to say to your local constituents, ‘Listen, I've got to be honest with you, I've got to be frank with you, I've got to level with you: we voted against this; we are against these measures; we are against these local initiatives.' The member for La Trobe is writing letters to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government saying, ‘Look, it would be terrific, Minister, for the city of Knox if we could establish an indoor stadium and regional soccer facility.' I have another one from the federal member for Swan-and this I think is a lovely personal touch: Dear Minister'‘Minister' is struck through and replaced with ‘Anthony'; we call him ‘Albo'The City of Canning in my electorate of Swan has submitted an application for assistance towards the development of replacement playground equipment, pathways and sports field lighting under the above program. I would be grateful for your consideration of the application, which I strongly endorse. What! Out of a program that they voted against? He strongly endorses an application well from a program that they oppose in Canberra but do not have the guts to tell their local constituents that they are opposing. I have three more letters-and I will not go through them all. There is one from the member for Wannon talking about three different proposals that he has asked Minister Albanese about-there is a strike-through there as well; he has changed it to ‘Minister/Anthony'. He thinks, ‘Maybe that will maximise my chances of getting the application approved.' We have got more and more of these proposals. Sometimes you cannot be sure if they are bogus, because you cannot really believe some of the stuff that they on with. I know people in the past have said, ‘We've been set up, it really wasn't us.' Is that really Steve Irons, the member for Swan, having a look at the new civic centre library in South Perth-the government contributing $2 million? It sure looks like him. I think that is him. And who is this handsome fellow here? Rowan Ramsey, the member for Grey, at the announcement of $2.5 million for Port Pirie Library and Internet Centre. He looks particularly pleased. He is very happy with the program that he voted against but which he pretends in his electorate that he supported. Here we have a fairly recently elected member who replaced Alexander Downer. His name is Jamie Briggs, the member for Mayo. There he is, happy at the announcement of more than $2.3 million for a new swimming pool in Strathalbyn. And then we have the thumbs up: here is Joanna Gash with Senator Arbib. ‘Go Mark!' says Joanna Gash, the member for Gilmore. She is really happy with her thumbs up. And who is this guy here? You can only see part of the photo. We have got Albo, the minister, here. Doesn't that look like the Leader of the position? There he is, the member for Wentworth, at the announcement of $2 million for a new pavilion at Waverley Park. Isn't that terrific! That is the problem, though-they just do not have any guts. Here we are, as a government, investing in roads, rail, ports, broadgetting band and the biggest school modernisation program in Australia's history and supporting small business and jobs, with Treasury estimates that 200,000 extra jobs would be lost if it weren't for the stimulus packages and the budget measures that we have announced and are implementing now. Here are the questions for the coalition: where is the money coming from? Where are you going to cut spending? Where are you going to ingo crease taxes? We are building the economy up while you spend all your time talking it down.",53
157,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is my pleasure to support this matter of public importance by the Leader of the Nationals. I tried to listen to every word that the previous speaker uttered. There was a touch of verbal anaesthetic there, I have got to say. It was like listening to a lawnmower going over wet grass. With all his bluff and bluster and all his histrionics that those opposite have to put up with on a daily basis, you did a good job, members of the Labor Party backbench, of smiling painfully on cue. But once again he still could not bring himself to mention the $58 billion deficit in the budget. Here two weeks ago today it was budget day. The Labor Party caucus were preparing to be briefed on the budget. When you look at the language we have had from those opposite, the conduct of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and you measure the extent to which they have gone out of their way not to level with the Australian people, this last three weeks has really begun to show the Op- true side of the Labor Party. Before the budget we had the astonishing use of language, with ‘six years of temporary deficits'-‘temporary'! In budget week the Treasurer and the Prime Minister did not blush when they talked about ‘temporary' and ‘six years' in the same sentence. Imagine a temporary car when you get your car serviced and having it for six years. Imagine a road being temporarily closed for six years-although my colleague the member for Cook points out that this does happen in New South Wales. I thought to myself: where would the Labor Party have got this language, because they are so programmed? Did someone just think of it or did they delve back into their history? What has come to my attention is that the Labor Party, fond of their history as they are, indeed delved back into their history. Wayne Swan and Kevin Rudd, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, were not the inventors of the term ‘temporary'. Actually the inventors of it were Gough Whitlam and Rex Connor during the loans affair, where they said in an executive minute-that famous minute that summed up so much the economic incompetence of the Labor Party, that saw them thrown from office in 1975-that the borrowings would be for ‘temporary purposes'. Now we are starting to get a true picture of the Labor Party. Then we had the extraordinary revelation of the Treasurer not being able to utter the budget deficit figure during his speech. A budget is four documents and a speech, and all these documents come down to the outcome. They all add up to one figure-the deficit or the surplus-and he could not mention it on budget night. When the Labor Party were briefed on the budget just before the budget speech it is now quite clear that they were not briefed on the figure either. There has been a lot of criticism of the member for Petrie, but she cannot say what she has not heard or what she does not know because the Treasurer did not tell his own people and deliberately omitted the budget deficit figure from the speech. As he did so, it just demonstrated the extent to which this government will go to conceal the truth from the Australian people-and those opposite know it. They know it. They know it is wrong. We have seen that time and time again. Instead of caucus members being issued with facts and figures on the budget, what we have seen in the week after the budget is that they were all issued with hard hats and fluorescent vests! That is what we have seen all over the country. The extent to which this government will go to bring on a stunt and avoid the substance is breathtaking. This is not a government; it is a stunt factory. That is all we see from those opposite. For 100 years the budget papers were as you would expect: plain old, boring, black-and-white budget papers. Then, when this government got elected, you can see one of their biggest decisions-they probably spent the day on it was: ‘Let's make them blue.' You can imagine, can't you, the Labor strategist saying, ‘What's the really important thing to do?'",54
158,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,They should be red.,55
159,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is exactly right-they should be red. That is what we have seen from those opposite. We have seen the Prime Minister join the Treasurer and refuse to mention the level of debt. The previous speaker uttered the words ‘debt' and ‘deficit' but he would not say how big the deficit was. The Prime Minister spent an excruciating week going out of his way to conceal the most basic figures from the Australian people. No matter how hard it is to conceal it, the Prime Minister was determined to. We had the infamous interview on Lateline, where he was asked over and over again and refused to let the words pass his lips. It made the John Clarke interview look like a serious interview. That's how pathetic it was. When asked the debt figures both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer took the fifthand so they should, because those figures do incriminate them. Those opposite know that. They did everything they possibly could all week to avoid levelling with the Australian people. The Australian people are beginning to wake up to it. They are beginning to wake up to the fact that Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan, our Prime Minister and our Treasurer, are not up to the job of economic managers. They might be up to the job of media pictures. I think it was probably a lineball call from the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's office on whether they should actually wear their hard hats here into the chamber!",55
160,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,And the vests.,56
161,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And the vests. Whenever you see fluorescent vests and hard hats coming, you know the Labor caucus and a few ministers are on their way. You should have one of those safety signs there‘Danger! Reckless Spender'-because that is what we get from those opposite. What we have seen from those opposite in the last week tells the whole story. That is why the Prime Minister, grudgingly, after a week of evasion, finally uttered the budget debt figures and the Treasurer finally uttered the deficit figures. But this is their stock in trade. As we have seen with the employees share scheme fiasco, the has been two weeks of chaos-absolute chaos. The first instinct when a mistake has been made is to cover it up, to ignore it and to babble on like demented cockatoos. The public are beginning to wake up to this. Those opposite get given their lines, they get given their fluorescent vests and they get given their hard hats. If they are prepared to stick to the script, the public will very quickly wake up to them. But those opposite know in their heart of hearts that for a Treasurer not to release the budget deficit figure during his speech is extraordinary. That sums it up very much for this Prime Minister and Treasurer. Of every Labor Prime Minister and Treasurer-and this is a big statement on Labor Party history-this duo is easily the most economically incompetent and irresponsible in our history.",56
162,Mr GIBBONS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Bendigo) (4.53 pm)Today's MPI has to be one of the greatest examples of hypocrisy that I have witnessed in 11 years in this House. The opposition have already acknowledged that had they been in office they would have done almost exactly the same as the government has done. On 13 May, the Leader of the Opposition told ABC Radio's Chris Uhlmann: It is hard to imagine a circumstance in which the Budget this year would not be in deficit. And, on the same day, the opposition's Treasury spokesman said that the deficit would be only $25 billion less under a coalition government. This government is borrowing for a legitimate purpose: it is borrowing to cushion this country from the worse effects of the global economic downturn; and it is borrowing to rejuvenate this country's infrastructure-its roads, its railways, its ports, its schools, its broadband and its other community assets. These are investments that the Howard-Costello government should have financed out of budget surpluses from the commodities boom while it was in office. The Rudd government is borrowing to stimulate economic activity at a time when the private sector is either reluctant to invest itself or cannot raise finance because of the freezing up of global credit markets. The government's borrowings will result in thousands of Australian businesses, large and small, getting government contracts to supply goods and services. This will keep thousands of Australians in jobs who would otherwise be on unemployment benefits and therefore unproductive. As the government has acknowledged, there is no doubt that the remainder of 2009 and beyond is going to be tough. As with other advanced economies, the International Monetary Fund expects our economy to contract over 2009, but the IMF also believes that Australia will weather this global crisis better than virtually any other advanced economy. That is partly because of some of our strengths, like the stability of our cial system and the fact that our banks are amongst the safest in the world. But a big part of the reason we are much better placed than most other nations is-apart from the superb economic foundation built by the previous Hawke and Keating Labor governments-the decisive action taken by this government to stimulate growth, to support jobs and to mitigate the impact of the global recession on all Australians. That decisive action started last year with stimulus payments to give the economy a short-term boost, particularly in the vital retail sector, which employs over one million Australians. We saw the results of this in figures which showed that the value of retail sales increased by 2.2 per cent in the month of March. Monthly retail sales are now 4.5 per cent higher than they were in November last year before the government's first economic stimulus payments started to flow to pensioners and families. By way of comparison, over the same period retail sales fell 2.5 per cent in the United States, 3.1 per cent in Japan, 2.2 per cent in Germany, 3.1 per cent in Canada and 1.7 per cent in New Zealand. Following the rollout of the stimulus payments, the next stage of the government's economic stimulus package is well underway. Two-thirds of that stimulus is infrastructure investment and these construction projects are starting now. In 12 months time there will be around 35,000 individual construction projects around the country, including the largest school modernisation program ever. All of these will be boosting thousands of local economies and small businesses right across Australia. They will be keeping contractors, tradies, truck drivers and small businesses working and employing Australians. As the minister for infrastructure informed the House yesterday, even members opposite are welcoming these investments in their own constituencies. They cannot get finantheir hard hats and safety vests on fast enough for all the photo opportunities. But we hear nothing but criticism from them in this House and in this chamber about the enormous amount of economic activity that is just starting around the country, including in their own electorates, where they line up to try to claim some of the credit. They roar like lions here in Canberra and squeak like mice in their electorates. Let me highlight some of those investment projects. The first sod was recently turned on the $164 million Midland Highway-Brighton bypass project in Southern Tasmania, six months ahead of schedule. This bypass and the associated transport hub are expected to create up to 380 jobs directly with additional flow-on benefits to local businesses. Work has started on installing flashing lights and advance warning systems at 13 high-risk rail level crossings in Tasmania. Builders have been selected for the new Mandurah Entrance Road in Western Australia. Work will begin in the coming months, a year ahead of schedule. Investment in other transport infrastructure projects continues, with 268 rail level crossing projects announced in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia, Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory. Contractors have been named for the Tarcutta and Woomargama bypasses on the Hume Highway in New South Wales. Black spot projects have been announced across Australia-160 in Victoria, almost 200 in New South Wales, 93 in Queensland, six in the Northern Territory, 27 in Tasmania and more than 50 in both South Australia and Western Australia. Approval has been given for $250 million worth of projects by 564 local councils across Australia under the first round of the $800 million Community Infrastructure Program. Councils have now lodged applications under the second round for projects like sports grounds, community centres and town halls. Work has started on stage 1 of social housing construction all around Australia. Almost all of the 667 homes to be built in my home state of Victoria have planning approval and 503 projects are expected to start this financial year. The education sector has been a significant beneficiary of the government's economic stimulus package. The National School Pride program, which represents 13,176 projects in 9,461 schools, has been approved and work has begun or is about to begin. Under this program each school will receive between $50,000 and $200,000 for things like building refurbishments, water tanks, sports grounds and specialised infrastructure support for students with disabilities or special needs. I estimate that close to $142 million has been allocated to my electorate of Bendigo in central Victoria in some of the programs I have just mentioned. That, in just the first months of the Rudd government, is more than the Howard government delivered in almost 12 years, if you exclude the Calder Highway funding-and remember that the Howard coalition government had to be dragged kicking and screaming for four long years before they finally allocated the promised funding for the Calder Highway. These are just some of the projects being funded by the government's borrowing program, which will create opportunities for businesses across the country to get involved and support thousands of jobs. The importance of economic stimulus measures such as these was emphasised recently by IMF Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard. He noted that ‘fiscal policies have made a gigantic difference'. The IMF estimates that, without these stimulus measures around the world, world growth in 2009 would be somewhere between 1.5 per cent and two per cent lower. Mr Blanchard went on to say: ‘Therefore, we would be in the middle of something very close to a depression. So I think we have to understand that the strong policies which have been taken have made a difference.' The Reserve Bank of Australia, in its recent quarterly statement on monetary policy, cited the government's ‘substantial fiscal initiatives' as a key reason why Australia is outperforming other countries. It noted that Australia's economic activity is slowing at a significantly more gradual pace than many other advanced economies. So the government's response to the global economic crisis has been swift and decisive and is obviously working well. But what has the opposition got to offer Australia in these difficult times? Not one speaker from the opposition in today's debate has mentioned anything about what they would do or any policy initiatives. There has been plenty of carping and whingeing but no policy substance. There has been no leader18 ship, no viable policies and no direction except scaremongering about the forecast levels of government borrowing. Depending on which spokesperson you listen to, either they would be doing almost exactly the same as the government or they would be fiddling around while the global economy collapsed about them, taking Australia and Australian jobs with them. The Leader of the Opposition will undoubtedly go down in history as the Andre Rieu of Australian politics. He does bear a striking resemblance in more ways than one, except for the hair, of course-they are both fiddlers. Come to think of it, fiddling around is probably the Leader of the Opposition's true vocation in life. Of course, he is nowhere near as good at it as his international look-alike; Mr Rieu can at least boast of considerable talent. The opposition leader's fiddling over economic management is woefully out of tune. He and the parties opposite are out of tune with the needs of the times. They are out of tune with the actions being taken by the governments of other developed countries around the world and they are out of tune with the wishes of the Australian people.",56

166,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister will desist from holding up those props. He does not have the call.,59
167,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Can I pass it over? It's the same shirt and tie.,59
168,Mr IRONS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am glad to note that you are also taking notice of what I am wearing. I rise to speak on this matter of public importance in relation to the impact of the government's reckless spending and the debt explosion on Australian families. It was interesting to hear the member for Bendigo take a very positive spin on the debt. The government putting a positive spin on debt as being good for the country is like when the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy said in this very place, ‘Spending money on capital equipment will improve cash flow.'",59
169,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I didn't say that.,59
170,Mr IRONS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is not how it works. Money coming into your business actually improves cash flow, not money going out of it. You said it in this very place. Dr Emerson interjecting",59
171,Mr IRONS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You did. It just shows that this government and its members have no idea about the consequences of their decisions and their effects on the economy, which small business people do understand. The more debt you get into as a business means that you are taking away your ability to run that business because you have to focus on meeting your debt repayments instead of running your business. Just to make sure that the government know what debt is, because they do not seem to have any concern about debt, I googled ‘debt' as a definition and have brought the response in here to tell the government so that they will know. The definition says: - Something owed, such as money … - An obligation or liability to pay … - The condition of owing - An offense requiring forgiveness or reparation … Debt is an offence. The plain fact is that the Labor government have lost control of the nation's finances. The easiest thing any government and any person can do is to spend other people's money. This is money earned by hard working Australians and hard working families, by people who raised a sweat, people who wore hard hats for the correct reasons and not just a photo shoot. It is the people of Australia who have earned the money and paid the taxes. That money was not earned by the Labor government and they should not treat it as their own money. You have also spent the money they have not yet earned; you have mortgaged the futures of Australians, their children and their grandchildren. Today during question time the Treasurer spoke about paying down debt. Let him come into this place and tell the people of Australia how much debt he has paid down. I would like to bet that while the government are running around and spending like a drunken sailor, which the Treasurer accused the Howard government of today, they have not paid off any debt at all. They are not even spending this debt wisely, and we need only look to the member for Fowler, who was quoted in the Canberra Times today in reference to the government's budget. She said, ‘I have to ask the question of whether its programs are targeted as well as they could be.' I always look to see what the electorate is saying, and I will read a letter printed today in the West Australian. The letter is from Sean Hefferon, from South Fremantletraditionally a Labor area but now a Greens safe haven, recently wrested away from the Labor Party in a by-election in Western Australia. The letter is to the Treasurer and Kevin Rudd, and I will read it out in total. It starts off with, ‘Please explain,' and it is not from Pauline Hanson, either: The Rudd Government is keen to gamble with other people's money. The Government wants us to believe that the record debt (that the Treasurer would not mention in the Budget) will be paid off over five or six years of annual GDP growth of 4.5 per cent. This is sheer optimism at best-a lie at worse. We are an export nation, so which of the ailing international economies are going to provide us with this 4.5 per cent growth year in and year out? The mining boom that Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan go on about, saying it delivered ‘rivers of gold' to the previous government, delivered only an average of 3.25 per cent growth a year over 10 years. This was, as Mr Rudd told us ad nauseam in 2007, apparently a ‘once in a lifetime' boom. Now we can expect an even bigger boom when the IMF and the RBA are predicting a protracted recovery? Kevin07? By the time the debt is paid off it may be Kevin27. Now we hear that Messrs Rudd and Swan want to cut tax breaks on people's superannuation funds-like a pair of Nambour safe crackers creeping through the night, oxy torch in hand. This reminds me of a scene in the first Harry Potter movie when the wand maker says words to the effect, ‘I wondered when I would be seeing you.' Similarly I have to say, I wondered when they would start to raid super. If only all of this was fiction-like the movie. But why are we surprised with these ‘casino economics'? Wasn't it Mr Rudd who offered in 2007 the bizarre idea that WA's future (post-mining boom) lies in investing Chinese savings in real estate in Latin America? Such an idea was a clear sign of things to come. And come they have with Communications Minister Stephen Conroy, charged with overseeing the national broadband network, stating that the $43 billion project doesn't require a cost-benefit analysis! This is contrary to common sense and this Government's duty to the Australian people. (Time expired)",59
172,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I seek leave to table a photograph of the previous speaker, the member for Swan, at the new civic centre library in South Perth, to which the government contributed $2 million. Leave not granted.",60
173,Mr BIDGOOD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"By raising this supposed MPI the member for Wide Bay has once again shown in this place just how out of touch he and his party are. The Nationals have shown that they do not want the government to invest in jobs and infrastructure for the future. They are a party of no ideas. They are more content to mock and block in opposition because when in government they never stood up for their communities. The Nationals today are a party without vision and a party that stands for nothing. The Nationals do not want the government to invest in education, schools, community infrastructure, roads, rail and ports. I think The Nationals like opposition. They are comfortable there. It means they do not have to fully realise what is going on in the community. We, however, are listening. The nation-building economic stimulus plan includes $14.7 billion over three years for the Building the Education Revolution program. It will fund the building and rebuilding of primary and secondary school infrastructure and the maintenance of Australia's schools, including combined schools and special schools. The government is listening. I have a list of all the projects here, which the Deputy Prime Minister numbers at around 216. Millions and millions of dollars are being invested in the seat of Dawson, and the opposition are against it. I went to Victoria Park State School in my electorate and met with the principal of the school and the President of the P&C on Friday just gone. They were not against it. They were over the moon. Maybe someone in the National Party could explain to them why their school does not deserve the federal government funding they are getting. The Australian government has also brought forward $110 million of funding for the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program from 2010-11 to 2009-10. This will provide additional support for the economy now and also fast-track measures to improve the skills base of the workforce. I am pleased to announce that a $6 million trade training centre will be built at the CQUniversity site. The previous member for Dawson promised and promised this but never delivered. We have delivered for the people of Dawson. Maybe someone in the National Party could explain to Mackay North State High School, Mackay State High School, Mirani State High School, Sarina State High School and Pioneer State High School why their schools do not deserve this federal government backing. The National School Pride Program has now successfully been implemented, with the second and final round of funding announced on 21 May 2009. Together with round 1, the NSP Program will deliver $1.3 billion to 9,490 eligible primary and secondary schools across Australia for minor infrastructure and refurbishment projects. In Dawson that has totalled over $5 million in funding. I suppose the member for Wide Bay believes they do not deserve federal government funding either. Round 1 of Primary Schools for the 21st Century saw 1,499 eligible primary schools across Australia receive $2.8 billion in funding for a variety of projects, including libraries and multipurpose halls. This is all targeted spending on important nation-building infrastructure, including $800 million for the Community Infrastructure Program. This is all about infrastructure for the future and creating jobs now-something which we, the Labor Party, have a core commitment to. We do not only give it lip-service; we deliver real dollars, real investment, for real projects on the ground that will serve this nation for generations to come. Shame on The Nationals for voting against it.",60

177,Mr BUTLER,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the second report of the committee for 2009 relating to the proposed redevelopment of RAAF Base Edinburgh, Adelaide, South Australia. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",62
178,Mr BUTLER,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report addresses the RAAF Base Edinburgh redevelopment stage 2, in Adelaide, South Australia, valued at $99.56 million, which was referred to the committee on 26 February 2009. Notably, these works come on the back of a number of other works particularly relating to the Hardened and Networked Army initiative, which in total means that around $800 million of capital works is either underway or is about to be underway, assuming parliament approves this report. At the one base in Edinburgh in northern Adelaide over the course of this year, next year and into 2011, there will be an extraordinary amount of capital works on a very important base, which is well overdue for refurbishment. The redevelopment stage 2 proposal will provide a range of refurbished facilities to meet the functional requirements of several Air Force units, to enhance base security and to upgrade engineering services at the base. The local member, the member for Wakefield, who is a member of our committee, in public hearings on this referral and on prevition-only ous referrals relating to Edinburgh particularly raised questions about the impact of the project on local employment and the capacity of local businesses to access work under the project. The committee is satisfied that local companies and workers will be competitive in securing contracts on the project and welcomes this level of employment activity in the Adelaide region. During the lic hearing and the private hearing for this referral, Defence was able to give us some figures on the number of local workers and local businesses who have been able to access the Hardened and Networked Army initiative work. Some 1,300 workers have already been inducted to that aspect of the refurbishment and it is very clear that the area of northern Adelaide is benefiting significantly in employment and business terms from the refurbishment of the base. The committee was also pleased to hear that the Department of Defence is taking steps to alleviate traffic congestion, which is quite significant around the Edinburgh Defence Precinct. The committee commends the environmentally sustainable initiatives taken by the Department of Defence at the Edinburgh Defence Precinct, including installing electricity submeters and implementing strategies to reduce demand for potable water. The committee considers that these initiatives will provide a good example of sustainable building practices for other Commonwealth agencies involved in the provision of public works. In the report, the committee has made additional commentary encouraging all Commonwealth agencies to lead by example by implementing sustainable water initiatives in government construction. The committee intends to monitor those issues in future referrals by this parliament. While a number of issues were raised with the committee, it has reported on an excepbasis on issues that it thought warranted further comment-which is now its practice. I would urge those interested in this work to supplement the report with the transcripts and submissions available on the committee's website. The committee has recommended that the House resolve that the works be carried out. I would like to thank the members and senators on the committee pubfor its work in relation to this inquiry. As always, I thank the secretariat for their support, although I note that, as I table this report, the inquiry secretary, Ms Siobhan Leyne, is at the moment sunning herself on the Iberian Peninsula and in the northern areas of Africa, which is instilling some level base of jealousy in me. With those few words, I commend the report to the House. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 2009-2010 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 2) 2009-2010 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 1) 2009-2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 May, on motion by Mr Swan: That this bill be now read a second time.",62
179,Mrs HULL,COMMITTEES,"It is in continuation that I will focus my issues particularly on the concerns raised on the changes to Youth Allowance. Continuing with my speech from last night, I would like to explain to the minister the unintended consequences and the impacts of this policy. I would seriously ask the minister to look at the consequences of her changes and to rectify the issues relating to the way in which regional students will be able to study in ture. I will use my electorate of Riverina as an example. We are extremely fortunate to have Charles Sturt University campus in Wagga Wagga, the largest city in my electorate. The electorate, though, is over 42,000 square kilometres, so it is only those students who actually live in Wagga Wagga itself who can attend the university without having to leave home and relocate. Even if the students decided that they would be able to study at Charles Sturt University, the majority of them come from well outside travelling distance and will be unable to undertake that travel, bearing in mind that we do not have the public transport system that is available in the cities. So not all students can attend Charles Sturt University; some will need to go to other universities that cater for their specific needs. Those students who must move towns or states to attend the appropriate university for their career of choice some form of financial support. For some students, due to course commitments it is literally impossible to hold down a part-time job in order to support themselves. For example, a fourth-year veterinary science student at Charles Sturt University spends around 80 hours per week dedicated to his or her degree through combined personal study and in-class lessons. If he or she had to move to Wagga Wagga to study and their parents could not support them then they would need to receive student income support. If their parents do not come in under the family tax benefit part A and still do not have the means to support the child, and the child cannot work due to their university commitment and the heavy lift of the degree study, how does one suggest that these kids live, eat and pay for their rent and their upkeep? The reality is that they cannot. The individual in this example represents the situation of so many students. Under the fuproposed changes, this student would have to take a two-year break between school and university and attempt, with no guarantee of success, to hold down a full-time job or at least 30 hours a week for 18 months over two years. Let us consider this: we have a rise in unemployment, particularly in regional Australia but also right across Australia. The logistics of finding full-time work or 30 hours per week for at least 18 months during a twoyear period in regional areas and towns is extremely precarious. Many of my constituents believe that they or their sons and daughters will not be able to accomplish this. We have singularly been in drought for seven years, so the opportunities for employment are vastly reduced. A large percentage of my constituents' employment is dependent on agriculture. This type of work is often unreliable due to environmental impacts and, in many cases, is seasonally structured. With need the area having been in drought for seven years, for many of my kids from right across my electorate from areas such as Hay, Ivanhoe, Temora, Rankins Springs, Merriwagga or Bland shire, it will be just simply impossible for them to meet this requirement. The third element of the current workforce participation criteria, which the government intends to scrap, is an extremely practical and appropriate criterion for regional circumstances. A person can earn, in an 18month period after leaving school, an amount equivalent to 75 per cent of the maximum rate of pay under wage level A of the Australian pay and classification scale generally applicable to trainees. Currently, this requires earnings of around $19,532. This criterion has enabled so many regional students access to student income support, enabling them to attend university. It is imperative that the government see that the criterion of working full-time, or 30 hours a week, for 18 months over a period of two years in order to be independent is not appropriate for regional residents and, for many, will simply be absolutely unobtainable. As I have previously mentioned, I have received considerable amounts of calls, emails and letters from concerned parents and potential students. I can seriously stand here and say to you that this issue alone has generated more phone calls, emails, letters and counter inquiries than any other issue that I have had in 11 years, such is the concern. The minister stands up at the dispatch box and tells us that it is all good for us and that we are just scaremongering, but I have said nothing to elicit the phone calls and concerns that have come in; they have come in off their own bat. People in rural and regional areas are not stupid; they do not just blindly follow the leader-they know how to work things out for themselves. They have worked out for themselves that they have got a major issue. I will certainly not mention any names in this, but I received a letter from a person from a tiny little town that has been drought stricken and on its knees for seven years. The person wrote: I have grave concerns for the future of many rural students following the release of changes tender for the Youth Allowance scheme in the 2009 budget. I will not go into the specifics of the person but they talk about seeking the advice of Centrelink after the daughter had completed her HSC in 2008, with regard to eligibility for independent youth allowance. She has been working toward the goal of earning that $19,500-odd I spoke of earlier. In order to do this, she deferred her university studies in a particular field for 12 months. The staff at the university that she was going to attend also recommended that she defer so that she could qualify for youth allowance, understanding that she had significant financial pressures that could hinder her heavy study load. This young lady has been living in quite a remote town and working really, really hard to meet the criteria. As the writer of this letter said: Should the changes to Youth Allowance be implemented, it will be almost impossible for rural students to find a full-time job for 30 hours a week for an average of 18 months out of two years. That is because they are living out in these isolated towns and there is no work there. That young woman's community is identical to most of the communities across my electorate that sadly will be impacted by this measure. This person has driven tractors for wheat harvesting, worked on building sites and done an enormous amount of seasonal work, two lots of which involved living away from home, because of course there are no employment prospects for her in the local community. There are no jobs in those local communities. Sadly, this girl has now been denied the opportunity to meet the criteria that were in place at the time, as a result of the minister making these changes retrospective. If you are going to make these changes, in surely you would make them prospective, for the future, so they would not impact so on these regional students, who have no choices. The letter goes on to say: These changes, if implemented, will be particularly unfair for the students who deferred for 2009, as they have left school, followed the guidelines of Youth Allowance eligibility criteria as set by legislation, only to have the goalposts changed halfway through the year. It says: We need to make sure the Rudd government does not sacrifice the 2008 HSC class in order to make their bottom line look better. And, seriously, that is the issue. A drastic mistake has been made; fix it. Please do not just stand on this issue and let the students of Australia down. (Time expired)",63
180,Ms GEORGE,COMMITTEES,"In my introductory remarks on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and cognate bills, I want to say a few words about the very opportunistic campaign that is being run by the Leader of the Opposition and the members of the shadow ministry concerning the issue of deficit and debt without ever putting the reasons for our budget deficit and the reason for our borrowings in any kind of genuine context. The opposition must surely know-the Australian people know-that most of the deficit projected in this budget, the deficit of $57.6 billion, has been caused by an unprecedented global recession coming at the end of the mining boom. The previous government was not cognisant of the impact the end of the mining boom would have; hence we are now looking at debates about the issue of a structural deficit, the legacy of the Howard era. So the global recession and the end of the mining boom have naturally led to a huge loss of revenue both now and in the forward estimates, and it is in this context that the government has seen the need to borrow. In the last couple of days and constantly in question time, we have seen exemplified this ongoing political opportunism that we first saw displayed in the rejection of the nationbuilding and jobs bill earlier this year. As we continue to point out, the most obvious demonstration of the insincerity and hypocrisy of members of the opposition is that they voted against our stimulus package but cannot wait to get out there and be photographed when the results of that package are being made known to their local constituents. I looked back to see what I said in the debate about the legislation for the earlier stimulus package. I just want to quote a bit of what I said then, because I think it is highly relevant to the debate on this budget and these appropriation bills. I said that it was ‘an unprecedented package for unprecedented times', and so it is with the bills before us. We are living through an unprecedented era, an unprecedented global meltdown-the worse since the Great Depression. If the opposition do not get that then I think the Australia population at large clearly does and is thankful that at least we have a hedge against the worse excesses of this downturn, which is being experienced by many comparable nations. As I said back in February in the debate on the nation-building and jobs bill: We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the consequences of this crisis and its impact on Australia. We cannot affordas a governmentto sacrifice jobs and economic output, because to sit around and not take bold actionwhich is where the opposition were heading with their rejection of the packageor not give a clear and consistent commitment to solving the problems, would leave our economy and our nation even more exposed … So it is as a result of these unprecedented global circumstances that, inevitably, we have had to revise projections on several occasions, and those revisions have been based on the best advice from competent Treasury officials-and I find the consistent attacks on their integrity by members of the opposition really shameful and totally unwarranted. And what does the best advice tell us? As the budget indicates, we are looking at zero growth in 2008-09, with a contraction of 0.5 per cent in GDP in the subsequent financial year. It is precisely because we that kind of recession that our focus as a government has been on stimulatory packages and public demand-to offset the contraction in private demand within the economy so that we can minimise the overall negative impacts on households and jobs. Our strategy all along has been to support the jobs of today by building the essential infrastructure we will need when we come out of this global recession. It has always been about a stimulus that provides some assistance in the form of disposable income for those who are feeling the pressures of the recession. And, as we know, a substantial proportion of allocations went in the first round to the Community Infrastructure Fund. Every council that I have heard from has welcomed that stimulus. What else does the budget tell us? It tells us that unemployment is expected to peak at 8.5 per cent in the second half of 2010. Let us hope that prediction is right, because it far lower than the unemployment rise that we saw in previous downturns. There is no doubt that if it were not for the stimulus packages the peak of unemployment would rise to around 10 per cent. That is what would happen if we did what the opposition urge us to do, which is to sit around and fail to act decisively. All we continue to get from the feeble opposition is politically opportunistic attacks not just on our strategy but on the integrity of Treasury advice, never with any clear enunciation of the alternative egy that they would put in place to deal with these unprecedented circumstances. What really appals me about that is that this debate is about real people, real jobs, real households and real families. The budget tells us that without the stimulus there would possibly be some 200,000 additional Australians feeling the brunt of unemployment were it not for our nation-building investare in ments. We have heard a lot about cash splash, but they never tell you, do they, that 70 per cent of our economic stimulus is for nation-building infrastructure. This budget provides the biggest school modernisation program in our nation's history. It provides unprecedented levels of investment in roads, rail, ports, hospitals, broadband and major solar energy projects. Treasury estimates that the budgetary stimulus will see the real level of GDP some 2.7 per cent higher than otherwise would be the case in this financial year and 1.5 per cent higher in 2010-11. The whole purpose of our nation-building investments is to shield real people and real jobs from the negative consequences of the global situation. As the budget also indicates, tax revenues will be $210 billion less over five years, with a budget deficit of $57.6 billion. It is patently dishonest to present this as some kind of reckless spending spree by a Labor governis ment without understanding that, naturally, we have to borrow to cover the deficit which has been caused by a downturn in revenuethrough no fault of the government. It is a consequence of the meltdown in global circumstances. The forecasts in the budget show gross debt reaching $300.8 billion in 2012-13 and net debt of $188 billion in the same period-or 13.8 per cent of GDP. When the opposition are out running their terrible scare campaign about debt and deficits, they never tell you how Australia is farstrating by comparison with other countries. They hide that truth from the electorate. As our Prime Minister indicated yesterday in question time, Australia's net debt performance is the lowest of all the major advanced economies. He indicated that, when net debt peaks for Australia at 13.8 per cent of GDP, the average for the major advanced economies will be 88.7 per cent of GDP. The figure for Australia will be 13.8 per cent at the peak and for major advanced economies it will be, on average, 88.7 per cent. The figures are: Japan, 131 per cent; the UK, 80 per cent; the US, 80 per cent; Italy, 125 per cent; Canada, 28 per cent; France, 79 per cent; and Germany, 84 per cent. Why don't you tell the Australian people, when you are out there scaremongering about the level of debt and borrowings, what the true position of our nation is by comparison to all others? As the Prime Minister said yesterday in answer to a question, when our net debt peaks at 13.8 per cent of GDP, it will represent not just the lowest of the other major advanced economies; it will be something like seven times lower. No-one wants to be in the situation of ing large borrowings, so we have made a conscious commitment that we will put a cap of two per cent on future spending. With the expected bounce-back in economic growth, our plan is to return the budget to surplus in seven years time. Again, another debate rages about the forecasts that are made for economic growth. Treasury have told us that they are forecasting economic growth in the order of 4.25 per cent in 2011-12 and 201213 and four per cent a year thereafter. There has been ongoing debate about those figures. Some claim that they are overly optimistic. The Leader of the Opposition has said that those projections are ‘completely unbelievable'. Let us look at the explanations for those figures. I think they are pretty compelling. I would like to hear an argument as to why those projections are not compelling. The projections do indicate a strong bounce. Why? Because after three years of below trend growth there will be an upswing, particularly due to the nature of this recession, which people have described as a U-shaped recession. We will expect a strong bounceback when the economy turns. So there will be higher rates of growth because we will be coming off a low base of three years of below trend growth. Coupled with that, the slashing of interest rates has been stronger and stimulatory spending has occurred faster than in earlier downturns. We acted quickly and decisively early in the piece to shield our economy as much as possible. The earlier boom in mining investments, together with public investment in infrastructure, should make a bigger contributionto productivity growth in the upswing. As I said earlier, the Leader of the Opposition just asserts that the projections are completely unbelievable but never gives us hard data on which he bases those misguided judgments. For example, he does not tell us hav- that in the 1990s there were six years of growth above four per cent. So when we are talking about four per cent beyond 2012-13, that is not completely unbelievable. It is, in fact, comparable with six years of growth above four per cent in the 1990s. I like this little quote from one economist. He said, ‘The debate is a little surreal,' because Australia's position is so much stronger than other countries, and that ‘folks with mortgages five times their income need to understand that the government is taking on gross debt of less than 100 per cent of revenues'. So, again, what we have had is scare campaigns, scaremongering and talking down the economy. Ross Gittins, who always makes economic issues understandable to the lay person, said: The budget's forecasts are plausible. But plausible doesn't mean omniscient. I take his point. They are the best estimates, the best forecast, based on the professional advice and integrity of Treasury officials, who do not have a political agenda to run. The budget, shaped in very difficult times, has generally been well received in my electorate of Throsby. I just want to refer to a couple of features of the budget. The longoverdue increases for pensioners, especially for single age pensioners-whose plight did not touch the Howard government, in all the time it was in power, in terms of raising the level of the basic pension rather than supplements that were handed out-has been very well received. I also particularly mention and commend the Minister for Health and Ageing for what appears to be a small measure but which has a marked impact on families whose children who suffer from epidermolysis bullosa, commonly known as EB. Our budget provides a national $16.4 million program which will substantially improve affordability and access to specialised bandages and dressings. Two young children in my electorate, Jayden and Billy, were diagnosed with EB at birth. Their parents, on a single income, have up to now spent around $900 a month on bandages, pain relief and other medical needs, with no financial assistance. I know members of the opposition have also spoken on this issuethe member for Cook raised the matter in parliament, and I spoke in that debate. This commitment shows that, even in the most difficult times, Labor values can still shine through. The budget announcement in relation to the raising of the qualifying age for the age pension, however, was not well received. That is not surprising in an electorate like mine where many workers are involved in difficult manual labouring jobs in a labour market compounded by ongoing and persistently high unemployment rates. But I have to point out there has been some confusion about what this change means. The change is about raising the qualifying age for the age pension from 65 to 67 by 2023. The change is not about raising the retirement age or the age at which workers can access their superannuation. Even so, as a government we will need to give a lot more compassionate consideration to the implementation of this measure or else it is inevitable that thousands more workers will end up on the disability pension or at the end of unemployment queues, with no job opportunities and no just the light at the end of the tunnel. I take the liberty tonight of referring to the want to comments in today's media by my long standing friend and former Secretary of the ACTU, Bill Kelty, and former Prime Minister Paul Keating, the architects of Australia's wonderful superannuation system. Bill Kelty rightly argues that, in the negotiations between the then Labor government and the unions, it was agreed that ‘superannuation wasn't simply a substitute for the old age pension'. He went on to say that raising the preservation age would be ‘an abrogation of the fundamentals' on which the retirement system was built. Well said, Bill. I have no doubt this debate will continue. On our side of the House we must surely remain committed to maintaining one of Labor's proudest social achievements. I welcome also the provision in the budget to our local university. The budget provided $43.8 million to the University of Wollongong for a new Institute for Innovative Materials-Processing and Devices. That comes on top of the $35 million injection of capital funding into the SMART Infrastructure Facility. Our university is a wonderful one, and it is through the university that we are able to diversify our local economic base, which has always been heavily reliant on coal, steelmaking and other manufacturing jobs. So well done to Gerard Sutton, the vicechancellor, and his staff for presenting an excellent submission to government. In all, the university has benefited from more than $100 million in capital funding from the Rudd Labor government, on top of the wonderful investment we are getting from Building the Education Revolution. That is a wonderful investment that the opportunists on the other side of the House voted against, but of course they are out there wanting to be photographed when the announcements are being made. Let me end on a positive note which I hope highlights why I am so pleased with the budget. In March this year the unemployment rate in the Illawarra region was 8.3 per cent. In April it had fallen to 7.4 per cent. the Wollongong statistical region, the trend was down as well, falling from 9.1 per cent to 7.4 per cent. Let us hope this trend-a one-month trend, but at least it is heading in the right direction-is sustainable in the months ahead. I believe that, if not for the stimulus packages and the infrastructure investment that is continued in our budget, this decline in the unemployment rate would not have occurred and the trajectory would have continued to rise. This, in my view, is the best advertisement for the government's economic strategies, the strategies that underpin the decisions made in the budget. And of course, as always, if the truth is told, those strategies are based on contending with global circumstances of an unprecedented nature that every country in the world is living through. On that, I rest my case.",66
181,Mr RANDALL,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to be part of the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and cognate bills and to make my contribution. This budget reveals the high price all Australians will pay for Labor's reckless spending spree. After inheriting the most favourable set of economic conditions, it has taken only 18 months to achieve a record $58 billion deficit, put one million Australians out of work by 2010-11 and record a net debt of at least $188 billion by 2012-13. So much for working Australians! Labor introduced tax hikes which increased revenue by $26 billion. Have you noticed that the Labor Party have stopped talking about working families? Because they will continue to put them out of work. The annual interest bill paid by the Australian people in 2012-13 will be $8 billion. That is more than $9,000 a year for every Australian. Sadly, Labor have lost control of Australia's finances. In my electorate of Canning, 68 per cent of residents will be affected by changes to private health insurance through higher preFor miums because of Prime Minister Rudd's broken promise to not change health insurance rates. While I welcome the rise in the rate of the single pension, my office has been inundated with calls from local pensioners trying to cut through the spin. Let us not forget that the government did not really want to raise the pension. They stalled and waited for a review. The increasing pressure from the opposition and age groups forced this move. No doubt Mr Rudd's spin doctors, Hawker Britton, had told him that it was inevitable. The government talks about corporate greed and golden handshakes. Surprise, surprise-in an effort to tackle the growing epidemic the government has launched a new review. I understand that the Productivity Commission will report on executive remuneration by the end of the year, and today I want to raise one of the worse examples of corporate malevolence in this country. I have been an ardent critic of Telstra in recent years. After Sol Trujillo's appointment as CEO, Telstra's mantra was complete domination and thuggery, played out in a highstakes game of aggressive bluff. Telstra wanted to reduce the regulation that applied to it, limit competition and, in turn, cost everyday Australians more for the privilege. Mr Trujillo and his American mates ripped apart Australia's national carrier but made sure they looked after themselves in the process. But now we, including Prime Minister Rudd, have said ‘adios' to Sol Trujillo, his four amigos, and chairman Donald MCGauchie. I can only hope a new era for this country's leading telco has dawned. But I fear it may be a case of blink and you will miss the change. Armed with a $600,000 relocation bonus, Trujillo arrived in 2005 with a throng of American consultants in tow-Bain and Co, which was paid $54 million, led the way. His amigos-Greg Winn; Bill Stewart; the belligerent so-called government relations manager, Phil Burgess, who probably did more damage to government relations than any other single Telstra executive; and Tom Lamming, senior vice-president of transformation-came to implement his vision and have all now departed, or have announced their departure, from the sinking ship, significantly richer personally for their efforts. Sol came with a plan but was ignorant as to doing business in Australia. He wanted $12 billion to turn Telstra around. Sol's plan was so anticompetitive no-one could come at it. He offered to build a fibre-to-the-node network for Australia on the condition that Telstra did not have to share the network with any of their competitors. If they did have to share it, okay, fair enough: they would just have to make it so ridiculously expensive that no-one could afford it. Contrast this with the recently announced sharing of rail-line infrastructure in the Pilbara. Sol's plans did not work. Let us look at scorecard. While sales are up, Sol promised that costs would be held at 2005 levels. They have risen by eight per cent. He said he would cut thousands of jobs to reach ciency targets. He achieved that-10,000 good Australian workers lost their jobs. While pretending to be as nice as pie, he sacked Aussie workers and stripped them of their entitlements. A complacent and weak board led by Donald MCGauchie let this happen and even Geoffrey Cousins, who was appointed to the board by the former Prime Minister, John Howard, was complicit in these decisions. Sol promised up to 30 per cent of revenue would come from new products. This is not the case. Net profit is down by 14 per cent. But one statistic he made sure was looked after was his own salary: this increased by 54 per cent. Sol was one of the worse corporate executives that this country has seen. At the expense of Australian shareholders he travelled the world and stayed in lavish hotels. He was already an obscenely wealthy man, having netted an estimated $70 million to $90 million payout from his former telco job. By all reports he was particularly fussy with his tastes, which had to be catered for. For example, Pepsi Max had to be available at all times, maybe because he was a former board member of PepsiCo, and he even indulged in making sure that there were almonds, bagels, Las Vegas trips, private jets and suites with up to $10,000 a night price tags. Mr Bradbury interjecting",70
182,Mr RANDALL,COMMITTEES,"Absolutely. While local staff lost their jobs, Telstra's top executives earned $46 million between them in 2008 and lived the lifestyle to match it. Meanwhile, the workers were used, abused and conned. Mr Trujillo's travelling habits were well known and well reported. Once he defended his travelling habits, ironically just before taking off to Barcelona on his corpohis rate jet to announce a major upgrade to Telstra's mobile network. How this announcement benefited the people of Barcelona is beyond me and, no doubt, the mum and dad his effi- investors of Australia too. Mr Trujillo pocketed $34 million over his four years at Telstra. Last year he took home a staggering $13.4 million. That is almost $260,000 a week. He stands to pocket $3 million in ‘termination payment' but his final figure is likely to run into being substantially more when bonuses for the current financial year are calculated this August. The fact that he is to actually receive a termination payment is ludicrous in any case because he resigned and chose to leave before the expiration of his contact. In fact, he was paid three times more than his predecessor, Ziggy Switkowski-so compare the value. Shareholders have every right to be unhappy with his performance. Telstra's share price fell by 37.8 per cent during his reign. Despite Mr Trujillo's protests that the share value holds up against other shares considering the global market, Bloomberg's data reveal that Telstra shares underperformed the rest of the market by a staggering 18 per cent. When Sol took over, the shares were at $5.06. They opened at $3.08 this morning. They reached a low of $2.96 on 19 March this year. So much for rewarding somebody with a massive corporate salary package for advancing the company! He has actually driven the company, its share price, its profits and its income earnings down. Sol destroyed relations with both the Howard government and the current government. This had a costly impact on shareholders and the reputation of the once proud national carrier. Under Trujillo, Telstra became no more than another big, bad corporate bully and a corporate thug, showing complete disregard for shareholders, customers, the regulators and the government. This is Trujillo's legacy. Never was Telstra's arrogance more evident than in its token submission for the National Broadband Network under this current government. Owning much of the existing copper network and other infrastructure, Telstra holds complete dominance over the market and continues to push the bounds and to use its advantage-bringing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy to the brink on this issue. Its lack of effort in its bid for the National Broadband Network caused shockwaves. Its game of chicken with the minister and the government came with a $4.7 billion windfall to Telstra-if it got to build it, obviously. Sol was on a corporate jet out of the country when all the big decisions were being made. In fact, when that decision was being made he was not in Australia. Unlike Optus, who lodged documents and more documents in box after box for their bid, Telstra lodged an insulting 12-page submission. Even a letter from shareholders included in the October 2008 Telstra AGM notice was not enough to tell Telstra to pull him into line. It said that Telstra's tactics on the NBN tender were ‘increasing the likelihood of negative outcomes for shareholders'. Sol's claims to be a man who puts customers and shareholders first are as much spin as the current government uses. As we know, Telstra was ruled out of the bid but won a reprieve because the government's shambolic handling of the process may mean it has an opportunity to inject itself into further negotiations. It was being rejected from participating in the National Broadband Network that finally showed Sol the door. That day shares fell 11.5 per cent-the largest one-day fall since 1997. His amigos had deserted and soon MCGauchie would follow. Sol has still got a job, if only just. After 15 years tenure on the board of the American retail giant, Target, Sol is hanging on by the skin of his teeth. There is a push to unseat him shortly because of his lack of retailing nous. A poll in the Australian on 27 February, following the Telstra resignation announcement, showed that 69 per cent of people rated his performance as bad-not just average but bad. Trujillo managed to alienate everyone during his reign-shareholders, government, customers and workers. Do not forget when unionised Telstra workers protested after Telstra refused to negotiate on wage increases, causing far-reaching network outages. Interestingly, last week Mr Trujillo was holed up in what is no doubt a lavish resort in San Diego. Spruiking the wonderful job he had done in Australia at the Future in Review conference, he may have gone a little overboard with his self-praise. Following Sol's claims that Next G was the envy of the world, one astute investor questioned how Telstra managed to get 21 megabits per second to mobiles when the network in Silicon Valley could get only seven megabytes per second. Sol's exaggerations were publicly caught out when he had to admit that 21 was the absolute optimum and unfortunately most services operated well below this. He was sprung by a real telecommunications expert. This revealed that his bragging and boasting was all about touting for another lavish executive position-this time probably in the US. The industry and his American peers can see through him, unlike the gullible Telstra board that was fascinated by him. Telstra's billing procedures and IT changes pushed calls to the company to unsustainable levels. This is by their own admission. A new cash grab has come in with 30-second billing blocks for STD and overseas calls. Reports indicate that this will crease revenue by tens of millions, costing small business owners and families up to double. Complaints are skyrocketing. In just 90 days earlier this year, Telstra's complaints increased by 90 per cent. This is no surprise to me as complaints about Telstra and broadband access are among the most common calls to my office. Interestingly, according the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, complaints about Telstra rose by 241 per cent through Mr Trujillo's reign. Last year, complaints were averaging 250 a day about phone services and over 50 about broadband. These figures will give you some idea about the number of Telstra complaints that come across my desk. I will not go through the examples in detail today but, needless to say, my constituents often call me to seek assistance when they feel as though they are hitting their heads against a brick wall. Fortunately, I have had the great assistance of senior Australian Telstra operatives who have gone to great lengths to see that my constituents' complaints are rectified. Despite their efforts, it is a testament to the ineffectiveness of Telstra's procedures that I have had to go to such high levels to have basic administrative and reception complaints rectified. It was Telstra's arrogance that ultimately led to the demise of the chairman of the board, Donald MCGauchie-along with his unwavering support for Sol. As an editorial in the Australian stated: Mr MCGauchie calculated Mr Trujillo and the gang of American mates would crash through, instead they crashed. With the rest of the board-Charles Macek, John Stanhope, John Mullen, John Stewart, John Stocker, Peter Willcox, John ZeglisMCGauchie walked Sol's straight line. Even Geoff Cousins, who the other members did not want on the board, became weak and compliant, focusing much of his attention on in the Tasmanian pulp mill rather than the job that he was actually paid for. MCGauchie worshipped the ground that Sol walked on. He was instrumental in luring him to Australia in the first place. In the article ‘Who killed MCGauchie?' on 10 May 2009, the Financial Review reported that MCGauchie fell on his sword when he was outgunned by to Future Fund guardians who said: The Board of Guardians is focused on seeing value returned to the fund's Telstra holdings and looks forward to engaging with the new chair and the board. It was another example of Telstra's arrogance when the Future Fund board-Telstra's major shareholder at more than 16 per centrequested a meeting with the full Telstra board on 30 March. Only MCGauchie showed up. That, combined with support for John Stanhope as new CEO, as another import, put the writing on the wall for his future at the company. Like Sol, Mr MCGauchie will not be at a loss after leaving Telstra. He remains on the board of the discredited James Hardie, which has spent $20 million battling the corporate watchdog and has suffered a 44 per cent fall in operating profits. After his failed role in the wharf dispute of 1997, he became a corporate gun for hire, willing to prostitute himself for a fast dollar. MCGauchie also sits on the board of Nufarm, as well as having been reappointed to the Reserve Bank by former Treasurer Mr Costello until 2011. I am sure he will not survive after that. In Canning, my electorate, broadband is a serious issue. I have had many calls, as I have said, about how we can get broadband into the electorate, but time prevents me from continuing on that. All I can say is that, under NBN Mark II, Serpentine, Mundijong, Dwellingup, North Dandalup and Jarrandale will be battling to get the rollout touted. Finally, the government will now have to deal with the CEO's replacement, former enterprise executive David Thodey. The real concern is that it is not clear that anything is actually going to change. Mr Thodey has already said on the record that Telstra's strategy and values are not going to change. Oh, dear-it is the same strategy that got them into this mess to begin with. He recently said that the strategy of differentiation and competing for customers on value that Sol and the whole executive team set for Telstra is not going to change. While many believe that the incoming chairman, Catherine Livingstone, has seen the results and could not possibly make the same mistakes, one has to wonder. She was a member of the former board and therefore complicit in every poor decision and every bad judgment. I suspect the Future Fund guardians-and not only them but of course every Telstra shareholder in Australiaremain concerned. One can only assume Ms Livingstone played a role or was complicit in the many ill-considered decisions that were made, as I said. She has also said what a good bloke Mr MCGauchie was. What hope is there for the future, then? People are questioning Ms Livingstone's ability to work through the mess she has been left with. I note today that Sol is complaining that Australia is something of a racist country. The sad irony is that Sol and his amigos brought this focus on themselves by their greed and unnecessary antagonism. In that context I would like to say, as they would say in a good western movie: ‘Adios, gringos; you've just been run out of town.' I hope this draws to a conclusion the worse case of corporate malfeasance that Australia has ever had to endure. I seek leave to table an email from Mr that is being John Houston. Leave granted.",71
183,Mr RANDALL,COMMITTEES,"Mr Houston is the one who actually encouraged me to take a closer look at Mr Trujillo when he first came to this country. As you will see, the email is dated 2006. To paraphrase, he said he had worked with Mr Trujillo on international telcos. He was the chief operating officer of Orange in Switzerland. He said, basically, ‘Watch this guy; he's no good.' So I did, and I watched him carefully. I want to thank Mr Houston for sending me that email. In it he then goes on to explain some of the reasons why he said to watch him. He says, ‘Accordingly, I am glad to see that someone in the government'-this was when we were in government rather than opposition-‘has stood up for the real issues with Telstra now.' He says that Telstra is in the worse possible leadership hands under Mr Trujillo and his imported team. He finishes by saying: ‘Good on you. Continue to call for his sacking.' I can say to Mr Houston: your wishes have been delivered. He might not have been sacked but he is gone, and I hope for a new dawn of Telstra in Australia. Seriously, as a Telstra customer myself at home and in my office, I want Telstra to work and be the national carrier, the pre-eminent company in Australia, that it should be. It is there to serve not only corporate Australia but the mums and dads of Australia who want to communicate in the modern age in the most modern way possible. It needs governance. I hope the new board are up to it and the new CEO and the new chair will deliver that professional management. I thank the House.",74
184,Ms GRIERSON,COMMITTEES,"I am very pleased to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and related bills, which support the second budget of the Rudd Labor government. The 2009 budget was a positive, responsible and appropriate budget for the future of Australia, given the current global financial crisis. I must put record my respect for the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, for the hard work that has gone into the planning and the execution of what is one of the most important budgets for generations. Let me also state my admiration for Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Lindsay Tanner, and of course the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, for delivering such a responsible and responsive budget, one that significantly contributes to economic reform even though it was delivered during the most challenging economic times we have known since the Great Depression. I would also like to thank the Assistant Treasurer, Chris Bowen, who visited my electorate last Friday to speak with business and other stakeholders on the content and impacts of the 2009 budget. This is a budget that will support the jobs of today while building the Australia of tomorrow, investing in the infrastructure to create the wealth that our nation needs to not only weather the current financial storm but come out stronger for it. The extent of the global financial crisis cannot be ignored. In the Howard-Costello era we saw the equity market grow at an incredible pace, with a variety of new obscure and opaque financial instruments called ‘derivatives' introduced onto the American market. This was an unregulated and grossly speculative market and we are now all paying the price. The involvement of commercial banks in the derivatives market boomed in America-they joined the investment banks in promoting the trading in debt and risk. This coincided in America with the subprime mortgage lending spree and saw investors exposed to ever-growing credit risk and potential losses. But whilst profits rolled in there was no international inclination for tighter regulation or for shining a light on the extent of the risk and the debt being accumulated-debt that on was never affordable or even repayable. In fact, the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, encouraged Australians to put all their excess cash into superannuation, which of course was heavily weighted toward equity market the investment. To their detriment, they didborrowing against their mortgages, taking out loans and salary sacrificing to build their super fund investment. Corporate executive remuneration skyrocketed even when the cracks began to appear in what had become a globalised practice. Toxic products were traded over and over again, especially in the form of credit default swaps, trading the risk of default from one institution to another. Finally, with the crash of the subprime mortgage market in 2008, the derivatives market imploded. Taxpayer funded bailouts and guarantees swept the world, but, with credit frozen and investment funding dried up, with debt now unrecoverable, economies around the world quickly slipped toward recession and depression. So let us not forget what led us to this nancial crisis: the promotion of market economics. The market is always good and government intervention is always bad, so they thought-read, ‘Greed triumphs over common sense and collective good exercised through elected and representative governments-or, as the Prime Minister so aptly described, the folly of unfettered neoliberalism, so slavishly espoused by the coalition opposition throughout their time in government, to which they still adhere today. The International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook statement in April 2009 describes the US as the epicentre of the crisis and details the impact on economies around the world. Their data projects Australia as having only one year, 2009, where real GDP will contract, predicting a return to positive growth in 2010 but experiencing unemployment growth peaking at 7.8 per cent in 2010, significantly below the projection of an average of 9.2 for advanced economies. In April our unemployment rate was 5½ per cent. Europe's rate was 8.9 per cent; the US, 8.9 per cent; France, 8.8 per cent; Germany, 7.6 per cent; Canada, eight per cent; the UK, 6.6 per cent; and Spain, 18 per cent. Those figures represent quite an achievement by the Rudd Labor government. So whilst Australia has not been able to escape the global financial crisis, the Rudd government, through its financial stimulus packages and this budget, has met it head on, reducing its impacts upon the people of Australia and protecting the quality of life we appreciate. Already, before this budget was brought down, Australia was placed in a strong position to face the challenges of the global financial crisis. The Rudd Labor government's stimulus packages of December 2008 and February of this year provided much needed support to the Australian economy and won international praise for their fi- implementation. One IMF spokesperson stated that if ‘the Rudd government hadn't responded early with stimulus packages last year and this year, the world would probably be experiencing a depression right now, not a recession.' So now to the details of the 2009 budget. There were many big-ticket itemsimportant ones. The budget contained $22 billion in total infrastructure spending to offset the lack of investment by the previous Howard-Costello government, to compensate for the lack of investment from the private sector and to enrich the lives of all Australians into the future. This included $3.4 billion for roads, $4.6 billion for metro rail and $389 million for ports and freight infrastructure. It also committed $4½ billion on new clean energy initiatives; $3.2 billion to modernise hospitals and improve cancer facilities; $2½ billion over five years for hospital and health workforce reform; an extra $64.98 a fortnight for single pensioners and $20.28 for couples; $731 million over four years to phase in paid parental leave, a landmark decision and one we all celebrate on this side of the House; an increase in the Medicare levy surcharge, to encourage private health insurance and means testing for the Medicare rebate so that all Australians make a contribution; an extra $150 million to the ABC over three years; and tax cuts that were delivered as promised. Significantly for members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, all which I chair, this budget gave due recognition to our report into the impact of the efficiency dividend on small agencies, Size does matter, and removed the two per cent efficiency dividend. Through funding allocations it also recognised the difficulties being experienced by some particular agenciesthe Australian National Audit Office, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and CSIRO particularly. We do accept the economic challenges of the time, but we encourage Finance to continue to implement the recommendations of our report. All in all this is a conscientious budget that will deliver for the working families of Australia. It will provide greater support the age pensioners of Australia as well. And it will give invaluable assistance to the dents of Australia, from kindergarten all the way through to postgraduate. I am pleased to say that the budget also delivered for the people of my city, Newcastle, and for the Hunter region, specifically allocating $35 million for the Hunter Medical Research Institute over four years and an extra $3.6 million to various projects at the RAAF Base Williamtown. It also funded important upgrading of weather radars at numerous Bureau of Meteorology weather stations within my electorate, a measure that I know will be particularly welcomed by our keen fishermen in the region. At the regional level the budget allocated $1½ billion for Hunter F3 link-or the Hunter Expressway, as it will now be known-and $5½ million for Tocal College's Rural VET Infrastructure project. These projects will all, in their way, sustain employment and help to maintain the Newcastle economy through enhancement to our services, the diversification of our economy and the support of important infrastructure. On top of the more than $1.1 billion that has already been spent in my electorate since the Rudd Labor government took power, these projects are further recognition of the input and contribution our city makes to the nation. The $1½ billion for the long-awaited F3 link between Seahampton and Branxton, near my electorate of Newcastle, will relieve pressure on the roads in my electorate. The link road will be a 39.5-kilometre-long dual carriageway freeway with two lanes in each direction, running generally north-west from the F3 at the Newcastle Link Road interchange to the Belford Bends Deviation on the New England Highway north of Branxton. The road will allow traffic to bypass the Maitland area-one of the fastest growing for regions in Australia-and will significantly reduce travelling times between Newcastle stuand Sydney. After years of delays and neglect from the Howard government this incredibly important development for the people of the Hunter will finally come to fruition under the Labor Party. I congratulate my colleague the Minister for Defence, Joel Fitzgibbon, for his strong advocacy and his insistence on due process. Undertaken with the support of the Rudd government, a Lower Hunter transport needs study found the new road will deliver $1.3 billion in economic benefits. We look forward to those benefits flowing to support our economic future. I would also take this opportunity to congratulate the people of Newcastle. We have the gained tremendous dividends from the Rudd government stimulus packages and from the 2009 budget. But a key factor in this has been the successful diversification of our own economy. I can only feel for my Illawarra colleagues, who struggle still with that challenge. Historically a centre for heavy industry, Newcastle has established itself as a hub for innovation and research, knowledge based manufacturing, collaborative and investment friendly business sectors and a first-class service sector operating across many fields. By building a strong skills base, complemented by sound social and economic infrastructure, Newcastle is reaping the benefits of a multidisciplinary, diversified economy. In particular our movement toward clean energy research, innovation and business services, supported by the CSIRO Energy Transformed Flagship and energy division, by the Rudd government's National Solar Institute and by the Clean Energy Innovation Centre, all located in Newcastle, we will continue to attract more industry and more investment into Newcastle and the Hunter. I note that the two stimulus packages have seen spending in Newcastle thus far of over $86 million. I would like to elaborate on that. In the first stimulus package last year, individual payments exceeding $42 million were received. Although that has been described as a cash splash by some in the House, I have to say that when I read about these single age pensioners, age pension couples, disability support pensioners, veteran service pensioners and carer payments; we all know that we are talking about some of the most vulnerable people in our communities. Those cash payments were very much welcomed and were certainly needed in my electorate. In the second stimulus package earlier this year-and that money is continuing to roll into electorates around Australia-the Building the Education Revolution has seen almost $19 million spent towards infrastructure. Community infrastructure on other projects exceeds $10 million, with $8.5 million going to the museum redevelopment project in the CBD. It is very much needed in these times. Public, community and Defence housing spending has thus far exceeded $5 million. And spending on roads has thus far exceeded $9 million. Just a measure like the insulation and the solar hot water rebates has delivered $291,000 to the electorate. People in my electorate are taking up those measures with great enthusiasm. We have seen over $44 million in infrastructure stimulus spending in my electorate, and I look forward to the benefits flowing to the people in my electorate. But the budget has not been just good news. There have been some tough decisions taken to pave the way back to surplus when the economic recovery from recession emerges. These measures include the following: the long standing 30 per cent private health insurance rebate will be reduced for those earning more than $75,000 for singles and much higher for couples; tax breaks on salary sacrificing into superannuation will be scaled back; the eligibility age for the age pension will rise to 67; tougher income testing for pensions; means-testing of the health insurance rebate; the introduction of less generous arrangements for family payments and superannuation; the rationalisation of student income support programs; and the introduction of safety net measures to drive down specialist fees for important and common procedures. Naturally, there have been concerns by some in our electorates about those measures, but they are all aimed at reducing future spending and getting the budget back to surplus, as well as achieving fairness and assisting those Australians most in need. The budget forecast tells us that the economy will shrink overall. Unemployment will hit 8.5 per cent by mid-2011 and debt will rise significantly, as we have heard. As the Treasurer has stated: Now, of course we will have to take hard decisions, hard decisions to support jobs, hard decisions to make sure we put that long term investment in place and to make the Budget sustainable over the long term. With the global recession wiping more than $200 billion from Australian government tax revenues, we have had to deliver a deficit budget with significant debt projections. With the private sector unable to access credit, with commodity prices falling and earnings reduced, it falls to government to invest in the economy to avoid the full brunt of the global financial crisis. Net debt is forecast to peak at 13.8 per cent of GDP in 2013-14. But Australia's debt level is the lowest of equivalent economies in the world, with net debt of 80 per cent of GDP projected for advanced economies in 2014. The UK are facing a 22 per cent debt level, Canada 60 per cent, the United States 71 per cent and Japan 196 per cent of GDP. These are serious times and they require serious financial decisions. We have all heard the opposition talking up our debt and talking down our economy-we have all heard that the sky is falling-but they have no solutions. It is important to realise that through this spending-70 per cent of which is going towards infrastructure-future generations will have in place first-class schools and versities; major investments in our public health system; the advantage of significant training and reskilling opportunities; roads, rail, port infrastructure to support trade, port and commerce; and investments in first class research and innovation to create solutions for the future. That is a wonderful legacy for future generations. This is a budget that builds the future of Australia. There is $22 billion in infrastructure spending, combined with $52.4 billion of economic stimulus packages, that will all help to push Australia through the GFC. And it will work. But you do not need to take my word for that. According to a CommSec briefing given by Craig James-the Chief Equities Economist of the Commonwealth Bank-in my electorate of Newcastle this month, apart from six economies that will experience growth, Australia will experience the third lowest fall in GDP out of 52 countries. Let me share their forecast with you. They say that we will have a small fall in economic growth in 2009 but that we will see growth in 2010 of between two and 2.5 per cent. That will be, of course, the beginning of a much better time. They say that inflation will be between two and 2.5 per cent on average this year, rising to 2½ per cent to 2.75 per cent on average in 2010. Unemployment is projected by CommSec to be seven per cent by the end of this year and 6.5 per cent by the end of 2010. The cash rate benefiting everyone at the moment will, they say, rise from 2.75 to perhaps three per cent at the end of 2009, rising to 3.25 per cent at the end of 2010. The share market will be at 4,000 at the end of this year and will rise to 4,300. The Australian dollar-and I think they are just about spot on-will move from 75c to 77c this year. I am very pleased to share other people's views of the economic projections for this country. Just remember, though, that the only uni- ones talking down the Australian economy and its management are Malcolm Turnbull and the members of his coalition opposite. I would like to end my contribution to this ex- debate by quoting the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Lindsay Tanner, in a recent interview with Tony Jones on Lateline: If we were to take Malcolm Turnbull's approach, you would see a further contraction of the economy, thousands more jobs lost, thousands more businesses going broke. What we have to do is to sustain activity through short term spending which our stimulus package involves, through investment in infrastructure, and longer term investment to improve productivity which is also central to the budget, and that means that we have to live with that debt. But we've got a strategy to get out of it, medium term, and we'll follow that. Of course, we will, and the Australian economy will be much stronger for it.",75
185,Mr CIOBO,COMMITTEES,"Moncrieff) (6.30 pm)Labor is back. We see in this year's budget the old-style Labor Party is back in control of the finances of Australia. We see that the Labor Party, true to form, has reverted to its old ways-running up debt, losing control of finances, driving up unemployment, costing people their jobs-and the net result is that Australians are less wealthy today than they were when the coalition left government. In summary, if you listen to the whole debate between those opposite and those on this side of the chamber, it essentially comes down to this: the Australian Labor Party likes to pretend that this is all a result of the GFC, as it calls it-the global financial crisis-being thrust upon the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party likes to claim that it is the victim here, that the decisions that it makes are largely irrelevant and that Australia is where it is today as a consequence of external factors affecting the Australian economy and not as a result of government policy. But what is the real story? What do we know, once we scratch past the superfluous arguments-and, I have to say, in many respects the spurious arguments-of the Australian Labor Party that we hear from so many members opposite time and time again? What is the real story that lies behind the actual budget numbers that we see? Contrary to Labor's claim that this $57 billion worth of deficit, this $300 billion worth of debt, is all a consequence of a $210 million write-down, we discover that that is not entirely true. The truth of the matter is that thirds of the debt this country faces is as a consequence of this government's reckless spending. There has been $124 billion of new spending announced by this government in the 18 months since it was elected in November 2007. That equates to some $230 million a day of new spending announced by this reckless and irresponsible Rudd Labor government, some $10 million an hour. It is no wonder that the ministers on the front bench hang their heads in shame. And so they should. I notice that the Minister for Youth is in the chamber. I wonder whether the Minister for Youth has the courage to talk to young Australians and say, ‘As a consequence of our government's decisions and as a result of the reckless spending of the government, you are now in debt to the tune of $9,000.' I am sure that the Minister for Youth has not had that conversation with young Australians. The ministers opposite are ashamed about the true state of affairs and the parlous state in which this government has left the nation's finances. Because of this reckless spending spree that we have seen over the past eight months, we know that Australia today is fundamentally less strong than it was when the coalition left office. Bear in mind that the coalition spent a decade, or the best part thereof, repaying the $96 billion of debt that the Australian Labor Party left Australia last time. Those who have been around for a while will recall that last time it was also a consequence of circumstance-not a result of Labor's bad policies, not a result of Labor's mismanagement of the economy, not a result of the myopia that seems to be part of the incumbency of the Australian Labor Party but, rather, a consequence of a government that simply was the victim. And so we see again, now that Labor has been in government for 18 months, all of the same arguments being trotted out. What we see is that, twodespite having spent a decade paying off that $96 billion of Labor Party debt, despite the coalition reducing unemployment to a 33year record low, despite the coalition saving for our nation's future-through the Future Fund, through infrastructure funds, through the health fund, through the education fund; putting aside tens of billions of dollars, if not hundreds of billions of dollars, in forward forecasts under the coalition-all of that counts for nought. In 18 short months, the Australian Labor Party has undone all of that work. I stand in this chamber and question why the Australian Labor Party has been spending $10 million an hour since its election and question the wisdom of those spending decisions when we know that it simply threw $22 billion straight out the door. It borrowed money and threw it straight out the door and concocted a story that it was a necessary precursor to stimulating the economy. But what do we know is the truth? We know that it did not stimulate the economy. Australians have paid a very heavy price, and will for decades pay a very heavy price, as a result of the last 18 months alone of this reckless Rudd Labor government. Unfortunately, it will be the case that the Rudd Labor government, even in the most optimistic forecast as contained in the budget papers, will not even commence repaying Australia's debt until 2017. It is forecast that we will be a nation that borrowing until 2017 under this Labor government. Under this Labor government it is no wonder that the 33-year record low in unemployment, consumer confidence and the money we set aside for future investment have all been lost. We know already that the Labor Party is going to drive unemployment up to one million Australians. We know that debt will reach $300 billion under this government-a $58 billion deficit this year alone. Australians are rightly very concerned, because this deficit and this debt amounts to some $9,000 of debt for every man, woman and child in this country. That is an appalling legacy after only 18 months of the Labor Party in power. The concern that we have on this side of the chamber also extends to the fact that the Australian Labor Party have the most optimistic forecast in their budget papers-$300 billion worth of debt and then we see that their so-called plan for recovery, which all Australians are rightly so cynical about, is predicated upon the fact, according to the Australian Labor Party, that we are about to re-emerge from the GFC into the most glorious economic renaissance that this country has ever seen. Under the Australian Labor Party, Australians are about to enjoy, if you believe Labor's budget papers, six years of around 4½ per cent of GDP growth. This has never occurred in Australia's history, and I daresay it is unlikely to occur any time in the near future. There might be one or two years where, probably only as a consequence of good luck rather than good management by the Australian Labor Party, the economy does grow at 4 or 4½ per cent. But six years is unlikely. Economic commentators have made that point repeatedly. So, we know already that the Australian Labor Party forecast which predicates the way they will pay down this mountain of debt and deficit is completely false and based is on the most optimistic scenario-so optimistic as to be completely and utterly useless. We can expect, therefore, to see a situation arise where this mountain of debt and deficit just continues to grow. I know from speaking to my constituents on the Gold Coast that they question Labor's forecasts when there is not even incorporated into the budget papers money for Ruddbank, which is predicted to be around $28 billion, $43 billion for the National Broadband Network and who knows how many tens of billions of dollars, if not a hundred billion dollars, on defence spending. That is not even in the budget papers. It behoves all Australians to look very closely at the forecasts in the budget papers. It is a most blue-sky scenario that the Labor Party has attempted to portray here, when this government has predicted some $300 billion of debt but then excludes $43 billion for the National Broadband Network, $28 billion for Ruddbank and, as I said, perhaps a hundred billion dollars on defence white paper spending. The real level of debt in this country over the next decade or so could quite conceivably and easily touch a half a trillion dollarsup to $600 million or $700 million. That is, of course, also predicated on the fact that the Labor Party seeks to have no new spending initiatives between now and 2017. That again is part of Labor's policy. I will bet the member for Blaxland will not speak about these matters in his contribution to the debate. The Labor Party is silent on each of these things. The Labor Party will not speak about the fact that their forecasts are so optimistic. The Labor Party will not speak about the fact that their $300 billion of debt excludes the National Broadband Network and Ruddbank. They will not talk about the fact that they have been spending $10 million an hour, and the Labor Party certainly will not talk about the fact that they have racked up $124 billion of new spending since they were elected. They will run the line that they are the victims, that one million unemployed Australians is acceptable and that people just need to understand that it is all because a $210 billion revenue shortfall has been thrust upon them. That is not good enough. With the passage of time, it will be on each of their heads that they have been part of a government that has allowed the Australian economy to go to rack and ruin. In my capacity as shadow minister for small business, tourism, independent contractors and the arts, I would also like to make some comments about small business. We know on this side of the chamber that small business is the lifeblood of the Australian economy. This side of the chamber understands small business. That side of the chamber certainly does not. It is the truth for the vast majority of those members who occupy the government benches, the closest they have come to a small business is when they have stepped inside one to buy themselves a cappuccino or perhaps to sip on a chardonnay. That is typically the extent of small business knowledge and understanding in the Australian Labor Party. That was highlighted in the budget presented recently by this government. There was so little provided to ensure that those 2.4 million small businesses that employ around 3.8 million Australians have what they need to carry themselves forward when times are tough. The Australian Labor Party like to crow about the fact that they made one announcement-and it was, to all intents and purposes, the third time they had made the announcement, in some variation or otherabout the tax effective investment allowance. It provides a 50 per cent investment allowance for small businesses on the purchase of new plant and equipment. As the shadow minister I have taken the view that that announcement will be of some benefit to small businesses. But it really does not do much at all. The Labor Party just does not understand that the reason it does not help most small businesses is that, when times are tough, cash flow is king. When you are in a small business you need every dollar you can get your hands on and, if revenues are down and costs are up, then your small business may be teetering on the very edge and at the point where it may be difficult for it to survive. When that happens, one of the first things that small businesses do, especially if they have employees, is reduce the hours of their employees. We have seen that occur in the last 12 months. The next step after that when small businesses are starved of cash is that they reduce their labour force. They put people off. That, unfortunately, has also been that happening because this government has done nothing for small business and, as a result, we see the 3.8 million young Australians employed in small business starting to lose their jobs. The problem with Labor's big announcement about tax effective investments is that it does nothing to assist small business cash flow. In fact, it does the exact opposite of helping small business cash flow-it makes it worse because it requires small businesses who want to take advantage of it to actually use cash or credit to purchase new plant and equipment. If the Labor Party understood small business they would know that was the case. Let members opposite-the member for Blaxland or the member for Adelaidetake a look at a dynamic business blog and see what small businesses say about Labor's policy. They will see it in black and white: ‘We can't use it because we don't have the cash to spend on plant and equipment.' Those on this side of the chamber understand that, and that is why a key part of our policy is to assist small business. That is the reason why the Leader of the Opposition stood up in his budget reply speech and focused fairly and squarely on small business. He said to them, ‘We will help you with your cash flow in these tough times.' One of the initiatives we put forward was the tax loss carryback. I do not intend to go into detail on that in this speech. I have done so on numerous previous occasions and, of course, there are opportunities for interested members to look at our very comprehensive small business website to see our policy ideas. I encourage members opposite to do that because, frankly, they need some ideas for small business. Turning to the tourism industry, this industry is just so crucial to Australia's future. Around 500,000 Australians are employed in this industry. It generates around $22 billion or $23 billion of exports in an industry worth around $80 billion. The Australian tourism industry has once again been completely left in the lurch by the Australian Labor Party in this year's budget. Admittedly, this budget was not as bad as the previous year's, when the Labor Party imposed $1 billion of new taxes on the tourism industry. This year they simply cut a lot of the funding. There were no new taxes for the tourism industry, and I guess tourism operators might be grateful for that-after they were bashed up last year they will just be pleased that they were not bashed again this year by the Australian Labor Party. But let me make it clear again: from the coalition's perspective the Labor government will cost thousands of jobs in the tourism industry. They have already started the rot with such failed budgets as last year's, and they have continued it this year by axing the Australian Tourism Development Program, a $27½ million investment in tourism which the government walked away from. There was no media release about that. We saw a spiffy release from the Minister for Tourism announcing $8½ million for the tourism industry. He forgot to mention that he was axing $27 million. The tourism industry is angry with the government. The 500,000 people employed in the industry are angry with the government because they know that the reckless financial mismanagement of the Labor Party government is costing thousands of jobs. I would like to discuss the very real impact of this Labor Party budget on my constituents in Moncrieff. Around 55 per cent of my electorate has private medical insurance. People take pride in the fact that they do something to help provide for their own health. Many of them sacrifice on a weekly basis to keep their private health insurance. They do so because they do not want to be a burden on the public system; rather, they are willing to provide for themselves. This government is now going to strip away the affordability of private medical insurance. The Labor Party will claim that it is only for the top end, but, of course, nothing could be further from the truth. The problem is this: as people shift from private medical insurance, premiums for everybody will go up. As more people drop out of the system as premiums go up, the downward cycle will continue until we reach the socialist nirvana that all those opposite believe in of no private medical insurance. We know that that is the ideology that drives them. We know that the Labor Party would like to see one massive public health system with no-one in private medical insurance. If you cast your mind back you can remember the former Prime Minister Paul Keating, a man, at the time on $200,000-plus a year, who proudly boasted that he did not have private medical insurance. That is the nirvana that they are after, but this side of the chamber will stand up for those Australians who are willing to put their shoulder to the wheel, work, earn an income and provide for their medical insurance. Finally, we hear so much about infrastructure from the Labor Party. We have seen them crow about an alleged-and I use that term advisedly-investment in light rail for the Gold Coast. A close look at the budget papers shows that it is contingent upon so many different things that I doubt the people of the Gold Coast will ever see one cent from the Australian Labor Party.

186,Mr CLARE,COMMITTEES,"It is not often that you meet a bloke named Kevin and even rarer that you meet two in one place, but that is where I found myself a couple of weeks ago: between Kevin the Prime Minister from Queensland and Kevin the builder from Bankstown. Kev the builder from Bankstown told Kev the PM from Queensland what the government's actions had meant for his business. Kev is in the building game. His family business, CoWyn, has been around since 1954. The government's nation-building infrastructure plan means that Kev has a lot of work on at the moment. He employs 13 full-time staff, including two apprentices, at Co-Wyn and he is about to sign another one on. After the Prime Minister visited Co-Wyn, a young bloke saw the story on television, was interested in a job and rang Kev. He rifled through the Yellow Pages, found the business and gave him a call. Kev was so impressed by his initiative that he promised him a job the end of the year when he finished school. That is the sort of bloke that Kevin is. On every single job site he subcontracts a whole raft of different jobs to local tradespeople who do everything from clearing the site to wiring it up. I asked him for a list of the sorts of people who work on his job sites: demolition contractors, excavator operators, truck drivers, landscapers, concreters, concrete suppliers, form workers, timber suppliers, steel fixers, bricklayers, block layers, structural steel fabricators, carpenters, roofing contractors, window and door manufacturers, plasterers, joinery contractors, renderers, metal fabricators, fire safety contractors, signage companies, waterproofing contractors, ceramic tiling contractors, vinyl and carpet layers, painters, plumbers, electricians, refrigeration and air-conditioning mechanics, lift suppliers and installers, and industrial cleaners. A lot of people work there. On any given day, up to 50 subbies work, as Kev does, on a $3 million project to build halls for schools in the Catholic education system on the Central Coast. He tells me that over the life of the project he is employing between 300 and 400 workers. I asked him about the 30 per cent rebate for small businesses. He knew all about it. He told me that he had recently bought an $80,000 bobcat with the money and bought two new cars for the business. I asked him a little bit more about the budget. He told me that two of his apprentices had just bought their first home with the first homeowners boost, supporting more jobs in the local community, in the car industry, in the bobcat industry and in the housing industry. It is a story that is being replicated all around the country. It is the story of this budget. It is a ‘Kev the builder' budget. We know from the Treasury modellingand, if you look at Budget Paper No. 1, on at pages 1-7, you will see-what life would be like for people like Kev if the government was not stimulating the economy and if it was not injecting money into the economy. Budget Paper No. 1 says that, if the government had not acted, there would be more people unemployed and the recession would be deeper. It says that, if the government had not acted, 210,000 more people would be an out of work in the next financial year and the recession would be deeper than in the United States. That is the consequence of not acting and it is a consequence that would be felt by people like Kev the builder and by people in my electorate of Blaxland. They are the sorts of people that would bear the brunt of this. Blaxland has borne the brunt of 10 interest rate rises in a row-we were the mortgage stress capital of Australia for a long, long time. Now we are bearing the brunt of the global recession. I have got some horrifying statistics to provide to the House: in the last month 6,000 people lost their job in south-west Sydney-194 day. Unemployment is currently 8.6 per cent. It is up 3½ per cent in the last 12 months. That is twice as fast as the national average. We are, in many respects, the canary in the coalmine. It is a place where many people work in manufacturing, and so it has been hit hard by the downturn in trade and overseas demand. There is a big company in my electorate called Dane Automotive. They are in YennoraMr Ciobo-It is not as big as it was.",84
187,Mr CLARE,COMMITTEES,"It isn't; that is a fair comment. Four hundred and nineteen people have lost their job in the last two years, 65 in the last month. Two years ago the workforce was 580; now it is 161. I spoke to the managing director, and he told me that the global recession meant that they did not have a choice. Fixed costs are still the same but demand has gone through the floor. There are other companies in my electorate that tell the same story. I spoke to an employee at one business the other day. They usually have a monthly turnover of around $5,000. In the last three weeks they sold about $78 worth of stock. Good businesses, businesses that have been around for a long time, are hitting the wall, and they are not the only ones. People who have never sought help before are suddenly going to places like Vinnies, the Salvos and organisations like Creating Links, a local NGO around the corner from my office. They have just had to increase the number of food vouchers that they hand out each week to meet the surge in new demand. Often they are seeing people who have lost their jobs, who are behind in their rent and who are looking to help. Most of us now know someone who has lost a job, someone who has been the victim of the global recession. It is a devastating experience. Louise is the manager of Creating Links, and she tells me that people that she sees are just in a state of shock. I know what it was like when my dad lost his job when he was made redundant in the early 1990s. The whole family was in a state of shock. It left a real sense of uncertainty and fear. But we were one of the lucky ones, because Dad got another job in just four weeks. If you find yourself out of the workforce for an extended period of time, the long-term effects can be really crippling. The last recession left a generation of people unable to find full-time work again. We cannot let it happen, and that is why this budget is so important. That is why we need to protect jobs, and that is why we need to borrow. That is what this budget does: it builds infrastructure and it protects jobs. That is why it has my support. It is a budget for the people of Blaxland. For the 25,400 pensioners in Blaxland it means an extra $32.48 per week for single pensioners and $10.14 per week for couples. But, more than that, it means a better quality of life. Herman and Dora Saavedra, good people from the Grevillea Court Retirement Village, tell me that in Yagoona the 82 people who live at the retirement village were absolutely delighted. They said the increase is going to make a tremendous difference to their way of life. It is going to mean that can buy more fruit and vegetables and they will have more ingredients to cook with. I spoke to a bloke called Stan Quirke, who is the president of the Greenacre Senior Citizens. It is a great organisation, and he is a great bloke. He told me that what this budget means to single pensioners is that instead of sausages for dinner they can have steak. That is the sort of difference it means on the ground, and it is the sort of thing that the former government should have done years ago when gold bars were raining from the ceiling. When $300 billion worth of transfer payments were splashed across the economy between 2002 and 2007, there was not a dollar spare for pensioners-not a dollar spare for people who needed the money more than most. I am proud to be part of a government that has given some priority to pensioners, that has made this massive reform that makes a difference for people like Stan Quirke and for people like Herman and Dora. For the thousands of young families that are in Blaxland, the budget delivers a national paid parental leave scheme. It is a historic decision, one that is long overdue-one that will make it easier for parents to be with their newborn child in those critical first six months and one that will boost female participation in the workforce. It is an important reform, and I am proud to be part of a government that is finally delivering it. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Elizabeth Broderick, described it as ‘a major triumph for not only mothers and parents, but for our community'. I agree. It demonstrates the value that this government places on family relationships. For women in lower paid jobs, it will be even more significant because this is where, currently, there is very limited access to maternity leave. It is also where a lot of women in my electorate currently work. This will give them the financial support that they need, it will ease the pressure to return they to work and it will give them extra time to spend with their beautiful new baby. Every mum will tell you that the first few months go too quickly. This will help more parents to enjoy that precious time. For the young people in Blaxland the budget marks an equally dramatic and important shift in public policy. It is a budget that means more young people from low socio-economic backgrounds will get access to university. The budget allocates about $400 million to encourage universities to draw students from areas of social and economic disadvantage-from places like Blaxland. Social disadvantage begins early. In Blaxland, fewer children go to preschool than elsewhere around the country, fewer finish high school and even fewer go to university. It is these sorts of lost opportunities that entrench social disadvantage and that account for a youth unemployment rate of 36.2 per cent in Bankstown and 41.6 per cent in Fairfield, double the national average. Education opens this door and gives us a chance to turn this around. This budget recognises that. For small businesses in Blaxland, the budget increases the tax offset for assets over $1,000. It was 30 per cent; it is now 50 per cent. It will help more businesses to grow and expand-businesses like Kev's. Kev has told me that in the next few months he plans to buy a truck, an excavator and a generator. It also, importantly, has a multiplier effect. It means that more businesses will benefit from these assets being purchased. That is why this is a ‘Kev the Builder' budget. While Kev the Builder is building classrooms on the Central Coast, $99 million is being pumped into the 52 schools in my electorate-fixing leaking rooms; carpeting and painting classrooms; and building covered outdoor learning areas, libraries, halls and classrooms. The principal of Punchbowl Boys High School was here in the parliament just last night. He is over the moon. They are getting $200,000. They are going to paint the school with itthe school has not been painted in decadesand they are going to do it by employing local tradespeople. Never underestimate the difference that this program can make to schools in places like Blaxland. For some schools it means a new hall or a new library. For a school like Bankstown North it means something special indeed. They do not have a hall; they do not have a library; they do not even have permanent classrooms. All of the children in that school are taught in demountables. This program will mean that for the first time they will have permanent accommodationpermanent classrooms where those children will be taught. The Building the Education Revolution program gives children in Bankstown, Cabramatta, Guildford, Punchbowl and Fairfield the type of quality learning environment that they deserve-the type of environment that you find elsewhere in Australia. Mark Diamond, who is the principal of Lansvale Public School, said it like this: ‘I cannot think of a more appropriate way to stimulate the economy.' I agree. The first home owner boost is also changing the face of Blaxland. I am glad to see that the budget is extending the first home owner boost. Last year we were the mortgage-stress capital of Australia. Sheriffs were flat out evicting people. This year, real estate agents are flat out finding places for people to buy. The number of repossessions in Blaxland in the last few months has dropped by two-thirds and the number of homes for sale has increased by 20 per cent due to massive cuts in interest rates and things like the first owner boost. What it means is that we are saving more homes and buying new ones. The government is involved there as well, helping to build new homes. The first of 20,000 social housing homes that are being built as part of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan was completed on the weekend in Blaxland. It is a four-bedroom house. It took 52 tradespeople 13 weeks to build it-more money and more jobs for my local community. I spoke to a bloke called Adam. He is from Degree Constructions, the business that built the home. He told me the same story that Kevin did. He has just put on another apprentice, a young bloke called Jack. He is probably going to have to put on more, he tells me, just to cope with the flood of work coming his way. Down the road there is a suburb called Potts Hill. Potts Hill is a place where Landcom is busy. They are about to build 400 new homes. It is going to require 1,000 people to do the work. It is a great project in a place where people are still doing it tough. It is the sort of project, I think, that is purpose-built for the Housing Affordability Fund, for which there is $459.8 million in this budget-it is one that I will be lobbying for. The budget also has $186 million to redevelop the Villawood detention centre. It is a soulless place in the heart of my electorate. It is one of the first places I visited when I became a member of parliament. I was shocked with what I found. It is what the Human Rights Commissioner described as ‘a shameful, miserable place'. This redevelopment will help fix that. It is the biggest infrastructure project in Blaxland and it will create a lot of local jobs. That is what this budget is all about. A couple of weeks ago the Prime Minister visited Bankstown. That was the day he met Kev the Builder. It was the first time that a home Prime Minister has visited Bankstown in 13½ years. Bankstown was not on the priority list of the former Prime Minister. It was on his priority list to get rid of government jobs. He got rid of 650 jobs from the tax office when he shut that down. It was on his priority list when he got rid of 150 jobs from the immigration office in Bankstown when he shut that down. But apart from that it was not on his priority list. But it is on this ernment's priority list and it is on this Prime Minister's priority list. It is one of seven ority areas around the country-seven areas hardest hit by the global recession. My area, Blaxland, south-west Sydney, is one of those. It is now an area that is backed by a local employment coordinator and the $650 million jobs fund. This is the sort of thing that governments should do. It is the sort of priority that places like Blaxland deserve. We cannot as a parliament, we cannot as a government, wave the magic wand and hope that we can wish the tide of a global recession away. But we can act in a responsible way. We can build sandbags around these communities to protect these sorts of jobs. That is exactly what this government is doing and that is what this budget does. If you have a look at the budget papers you will see the sort of money that is being injected into my local community and the difference that it can make. In the last few months we have seen more than $3 billion injected into south-west Sydney. The impact of that you see in the story of Kev the Builder. There is more of that in this budget. Of course the budget is bigger than just Blaxland, but Blaxland is a place where the impact of good policy is felt most, where universal access to preschool can make a difference, where extra money to encourage young people to go to university can really make a difference, where paid parental leave makes a difference and where extra money for pensioners that can turn a meal from sausages into steak can make a real difference. Blaxland is also the sort of place where bad policy can hurt-where it can really make a difference. We see that in the budget papers as well, because if this government had not acted, if it had not done what it did in October last year and again stimulating the economy in February this year, the consequences of that would have been wrought on gov- the streets of Blaxland. There would have been 210,000 additional unemployed people. priThat is the equivalent of two Olympic stadiums; it is the equivalent of 25 schools full of young people, who would not have had a job and would be on the unemployment queue. They would have been the real human consequences of not acting. That is what this budget is built all around: protecting employment and keeping people in work. Malcolm Turnbull talks about jobs, jobs, jobs. You then need to build a budget around jobs, jobs, jobs, if you think that it is important. It is very easy to have a budget in surplus if you want to. If the government had so chosen, it could have delivered a surplus budget. It would have meant hiking up taxes, it would have meant slashing services, it would have meant not a cent for hospitals around the country, it would have stymied recovery and it would have meant a recession deeper and longer than the United States will experience, but it is possible. It is not an approach being recommended by the opposition though. The opposition's approach, from all accounts, is that they acknowledge that when $210 billion is ripped out of tax receipts governments have to borrow. I think that most people on the other side recognise that. The budget is built around making sure that we protect jobs; that we keep unemployment as low as we possibly can-that it does not go as high as it may have otherwise. The budget papers show that unemployment would reach 10 per cent or more if the government had not acted. Every job is precious and every job is important. We need people in apprenticeships and training. We need people working-working for people like Kev the Builder. We do not want people on the unemployment queue. That is why everything that this government has done is responsible, right and important. I support this budget because it is a budget that supports jobs; it is a budget for Blaxland.",85
188,Mr TRUSS,COMMITTEES,"After 18 months of Labor government, the coalition's $22 billion budget surplus has dropped to a whopping $58 billion deficit. The $70 billion in savings has plunged to a staggering $188 billion worth of debt and the government has now acknowledged that the gross debt figure will reach $315 billion. Unemployment is predicted to double to 8.5 per cent. This budget has to have been one of the great shockers of modern government. Labor's so-called temporary deficit is predicted to last until at 2015-16, but even that date is ridiculously optimistic. It will simply require the return of a coalition government for an extended period if this debt is ever to be repaid. The Prime Minister and Treasurer have proven yet again that Labor simply cannot be trusted to manage money. Give Labor something in good working order and it will soon be broken. They simply lack the competence to manage a national economy. The only budget strategy the Rudd Labor government have unveiled is one of debt, deficit, recession and higher unemployment. Labor lacked discipline and control in the lead-up to their budget and we are now left with a directionless mess that offers little for our regions. Labor has turned to its usual hit list of tims to fund its budget spending: self-funded retirees, people saving for their retirement, those with private health insurance, people on hospital waiting queues, as well as primary producers and exporters. And of course it is the exporters that we will be expecting to help drag our economy out of the Rudd recession. At the last election the Prime Minister promised to maintain the private health insurance rebate, but now it will be means tested. His written promises were empty. This will mean that fewer people will have private health insurance and there will be longer hospital queues. People will be waiting longer-poor people will be waiting longer-for necessary hospital treatment because the Rudd Labor government is continuing its vendetta against private health insurance. The Prime Minister promised to maintain superannuation co-contributions but now they will be cut back. There will be $3 billion in cuts to concessional superannuation arrangements. Mr Rudd promised to mainleast tain the Medicare safety net but the thresholds will be lifted and a means test applied. Labor also plans to implement full cost recovery for export inspection certification services, scrapping the 40 per cent rebate provided by the previous coalition government to exporters. The increase to the age pension, for which the coalition had campaigned for over a year, will be appreciated by those who receive it, but many people will actually lose some of their pension entitlement because of a tougher means test. In the future, Australians will have to wait until they are 67 to get a pension. The budget will also deliver belated tax cuts that nearly match the former coalition vicgovernment's tax plan, but the effect of the cuts will be eroded by massive rises in fees and charges and cuts to key government services. The government's changes to Youth Allowance will cut off the opportunity for a university education, particularly for people who live a long way from a capital city. Those people who have no choice but to move to a city to be able to undertake a tertiary education are particularly adversely affected by the changes Labor has announced in this budget. They are not only making it harder for people to get the independent youth allowance but they have decided to abolish the Commonwealth accommodation scholarships. These Commonwealth scholarships paid $4,500 a year for students to meet some of the extra costs of living away from home. That is being replaced by a relocation allowance of only $4,000 and then $1,000 for the subsequent three years. What is the government's justification for taking away the opportunity for people in remote and regional parts of Australia to obtain a proper education? They ought to know that country people already have a much lower level of tertiary education. Fewer people living in country areas have a tertiary qualification and now they are implementing measures designed, it seems, to entrench this disadvantage. Labor talk a lot about sticking up for the battlers but, in reality, they have well and truly lost any interest and concern about people who live over their horizon-and their horizon is the outer suburbs of the tal cities. The last budget saw more than $1 billion stolen from regional Australia, and I heavily criticised the government then for penalising the people who did not vote for it. This budget is no different. In fact, it is worse, and the undeclared war on regional Australia continues. Last week my colleague the member for Calare and shadow minister for agriculture criticised Labor for an astonishing $908 million cut from the department's budget for next year. The Treasurer accused the Nationals of not being able to count, but the reality was that in his budget the Treasurer said that there was a special efficiency dividend being required from that department. The figures that the minister criticised us for using came from his own department-they are there in black and white. All the spin that he likes to use is to no avail. The truth of the matter is that exceptional drought funding disappears next financial year and has not been replaced. In fact, there is a specific statement in the budget saying that drought assistance has been terminated. The government says it will come up with something at some stage in the future, perhaps in 18 months time. But it is quite obvious that the government intends to make it more difficult for farmers to qualify for drought assistance, and therefore many of those people who have endured the toughest and longest drought in memory can expect to have their support from the government terminated. Of course, if the government is going to introduce a new drought assistance program it will cost money-and it is money that is not in the forward estimates. That means the budget predictions will blow out even further. If there is even one more dollar of expenditure than has so far been acknowledged by the government-and who could believe that the Prime Minister will be able to go a single day without spending more capimoney-that will add to the $315 billion government debt which has to be paid for by the Australian taxpayers. Looking again at the department of agriculture, 312 departmental jobs are to go. The respected Land and Water Australia is to be abolished, so there will be no funding available anymore for critical research into conservation and environmental issues in rural areas. Labor only want one sort of funding in that area, and that is to deal with their agenda for climate change and emissions trading. They do not want any kind of independent advice, and the loss of Land and Water Australia is a critical blow to the research capabilities that support industry and life in regional areas. The Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation has had its funding slashed as well. I felt sorry for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry at the rural women's awards dinner last night, a function hosted and sponsored by the RIRDC-he was there only a few days after he had slashed the funding. He stood up and expressed his interest in women's issues but, in reality, he has slashed the funding to the very organisation that sponsors those awards. Also, I am told that 60 graduates will not be taken on by the department of agriculture this year, so the staff renewal which is so important in any department will not occur. The minister for agriculture, who represents the least agricultural electorate in country, must stand up for his department. He cannot expect others to do it for him. He cannot expect the opposition to save the jobs of people who work in the department of agriculture or the rural programs. He has got to stand up to his city mates and the union heavies and say that there are other people Australia and there are worthwhile programs that need to be maintained. The last time. I checked, the Land's FarmOnline was running a poll that rated the minister's performexplained ance. A mere 5.5 per cent thought he was doing an excellent job, while 26 per cent said his performance was poor and 34.3 per cent said it was terrible. There were more than 700 votes, so it was a much larger poll than many we read about in the newspapers. The government's priorities for agriculture were well and truly spelt out when it announced on budget night a new $460 million program that will support farmers in other parts of the world as part of its foreign aid program. This $460 million program is to support food and agricultural programs overseas while the government is cutting double that amount from the department of agriculture in Australia. This precious UN seat that the Prime Minister wants for himself is costing Australians dearly. At a time when there are cuts right across the board in the Austra30 lian budget, one area that has had a substantial increase is foreign aid. Why are we going to spend a significant amount more on programs overseas, including in areas such as the Caribbean and Africa, where our aid program has not been strong in the past? Why are we cutting programs in Australia so that we can fund this kind of activity in other parts of the world? The reason is simple: Labor want a seat on the UN Security Council and they are prepared to pay any price, and then they want a job for the PM after he has outlived his welcome in Australia. The cost of that will be simply enormous. It the seems a seat at the UN is more important than a hospital bed in Australia when it comes to this government's priorities. I want to turn to the activities of the minister for regional development. In fact, I do not think he has got a right anymore to be called the minister ‘for' regional developin ment; he is the minister ‘against' regional development. Again, he is a minister who comes from the centre of Sydney. I thought his idea of the regions was well and truly when he provided $3.4 billion for a ‘regional rail project' in Melbourne. The definition of a regional rail project in Melbourne was out to Bacchus Marsh and to Werribee. That is this federal government's definition of the regions. The Labor government has failed in this budget to deliver on its election promise that there would be a new regional development program. At the last election Labor committed to expanding the role of the area consultative committees and rebranding them as Regional Development Australia. According to Labor's election policy, the ACCs were to play a leading role in facilitating development in the regions. However, the federal government will no longer have any direct or specific responsibility for regional development as the entire ACC network is to be closed down from June. There are no continuing arrangements yet negotiated for a number of states, but the doors are going to shut on 30 June, the leases are not being renewed and 150 employees do not know what their future will be. This is in spite of the fact that the minister personally stood in front of these employees and assured them that their jobs were safe. His words were not worth the time he spent to deliver them. This whole network is to close and, in fact, the government will no longer have any direct connection with the regions or any mechanism so that advice can come direct from the regions to the federal government. They are going to be absorbed into the state government structure. In the case of Western Australia, where the agreement, the MOU, is reasonably public, the state government is to take over complete control. They will get the money and they will make all the appointments and the Commonwealth will simply have no role. We understand that the situation is broadly similar in other states. I feel the cities. sorry for the parliamentary secretary because obviously he has been held out to dry. I think he has genuinely tried to come up with a good solution. He has tried hard, but it is obvious that Minister Albanese has stomped over the top and decided that the area consultative committees and the regional elements of his department are to be wound back. The state offices are largely closed and, to add insult to the injury of regional communities, the government has set up a new Better Cities unit in Sydney. That is now going to be one of the major policy advice bureaus for this government. Indeed, the government seem to have an active campaign to strike the word ‘regional' out of as many programs as they possibly can. We know that what was once the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program is now just the Community Infrastructure Program. As well, there is legislation before the House to strike the word ‘Regional' out of the name of the Regional Strategic Roads Program. The Black Spot Program is to have its funding redirected to national highways. These sorts of changes are specifically designed to ensure that there is a shift of funding away from regional areas and into the cities. That has been classically illustrated by the announcements by the Infrastructure Australia Fund and Labor's commitments under AusLink 2. There is a substantial shift in funding away from roads in regional areas, and I note that one of the members sitting in this room comes from a comparatively regional area. He needs to be aware of the fact that funding in his sort of area is going to be cut so that more money can be spent especially on urban public transport projects. I know that urban public transport is important but it is being funded by stripping away a range of significant projects that were committed for regional areas so that Labor can fund what it proposes for Labor have developed their own regional development program, called Better Regions-rorts personified. This program, as I said earlier today, has never been open for public nominations. The only projects to be funded are those that were announced by Labor candidates at the last election. It is exclusively set up to fund projects that Labor announced in marginal electorates around the country. No-one else should even bother to apply. There is no assessment as to whether the projects are worthy. Indeed some of the projects funded had been specifically refused by the previous government because they lacked merit, but Labor promised them and those are the projects to be funded. Let me say I am looking forward to the Auditor General's report on the Better Regions Program. If the Auditor-General was critical of the former government's Regional Partnerships program, then the administration and choice of projects under the Better Regions Program is a national scandal. The minister, who has spent so much time in this House on personal attacks on and criticism of me and the other members on this side of the House, should be ashamed of himself for introducing a program that is a rort beyond rort and has no scrutiny and no public accountability whatsoever. While I am talking about public accountability, I will note the choice of road projects by Infrastructure Australia. We were told that Infrastructure Australia was set up to be independent so that it would make a separate and independent judgment about the projects to be funded. However, the government will not release any of the reports done by Infrastructure Australia or any of its costings or any of its assessments. They are all secret. We are asked to believe that it is an open and transparent process except nobody is allowed to see any of the documents. It is a sham from beginning to end. We all know that Labor mates were appointed to Infrastructure Australia and Labor's projects were chosen. They were not chosen on the basis of merit; they were chosen for political reasons. It is quite appalling that the minister would come into this place and try to pretend that he is some kind of high moral ground on the basis of having a transparent and open process when it is clear that exactly the opposite is happening. This budget also fails to address a number of other significantly important issues in rural and regional areas. The appalling state of rural health needs to be fixed. The Prime Minister said that the buck would stop with him by 1 July, but changes to his means tested private health insurance rebate will increase the pressure on the already overburdened public health system and there are simply no measures in the budget which are likely to lead to improved health services for people who live outside the capital cities. Some of the changes to the Medicare Benefits Schedule for things such as cataract surgery will mean that country people will no longer be able to have that kind of operation in their regional city. They will have to go to mass clinics somewhere or other in the city because that is the only place where this kind of surgery will occur. Even Labor's decision to quarantine losses from unprofitable businesses for people with higher incomes will have a significant, adverse effect on regional communities, particularly poor communities. It has often been those so-called hobby farmers who have done a lot of the spending that has kept little country towns alive and has made those regional communities stronger. Some of these hobby farmers have also been the most innovative of farmers, and they have employed people. So this attempt to try to stamp out investment by wealthy individuals in country areas will affect poor people in country towns just as much as it will affect the lawyers and wealthy business people in the capital cities. I also mention Labor's decision to axe the en-route charges subsidy scheme for aviation services. It is tough enough as it is for country air services to survive but Labor are now on going to take away this support for aviation services. This is a vendetta against regional Australia that seems to know no end. If you want any further evidence, let me finally mention the broadband scheme. Two million country Australians have now been left out of the promise that the government made at the last election. Two million Australians are not worthy of the same level of broadband coverage as is occurring in the cities. Country people have to pay their share of the debts but they do not get the services.

189,Mr HALE,COMMITTEES,"I rise tonight to make my contribution to this debate and to support Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and cognate bills. We need an economy that is stimulated and that helps cushion Australia from the full impact of the global recession while also laying the foundation for a strong and more prosperous future-a budget that realises that we need to build and build upon infrastructure. Unfortunately, the previous government did not do this. The Prime Minister and the very hard working executive have delivered a budget in tough economic times that focuses on supporting jobs today by building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. The Treasurer outlined clearly to the people of Australia that this budget is designed to meet the challenges we face. In a recent address to the National Press Club, the Treasurer said: No modern Australian government has had to prepare a Budget under such testing economic times. We are in a situation where we are trying to implement an ETS to make real progress on climate change; to bring back fairer industrial relations laws and get rid of Work Choices; and to build infrastructure for all Australians, not just those in marginal Liberal seats. We need our defence forces; we still have about 14 different engagements around the world. We have had floods and fires. And then on top of all that there is the global financial crisis. As the Treasurer said at the National Press Club: The biggest global recession since the Great Depression has hit our economy and government tax revenues hardsome $210 billion. A temporary budget deficit was simply inescapable, increased government borrowing likewise. But I'm determined this will not be an excuse to abandon either the vision we have for Australia, or the program for which the Rudd Government was elected, or the goal of getting our Budget back into surplus. Even in the hardest times, we remain true to the vision we were elected to pursue: advancing the Education Revolution, advancing the cause of working families, tackling social inclusion, tackling climate change. The budget demonstrates this. The Treasurer continued: … we want to pursue these goals in a way that sets our economy up for a strong recovery as fast as possible. This budget also charts our path back to a surplus, after the global recession wiped more than $200 billion off government revenue. Our government has a clear strategy that currently expects to see the budget returned to surplus in 2015. In my electorate of Solomon, we are not immune to these hard economic times. Fortunately, in Solomon we have not yet suffered nearly as badly as many of our fellow Australians. I speak often to my colleagues on both sides of the House, and they talk about high youth unemployment in their areas as well as massive job losses on a daily basis. This budget is the third stage of our economic stimulus plan, which we know is working to help cushion the Northern Territory economy from the worse global recession in living memory. Today I will outline for the House the commitments that have been made in the 2009-10 budget and, more importantly, the commitments that will be delivered by our government to the people of Solomon. This budget provides a strong emphasis on vital pieces of infrastructure for Northern Australia-infrastructure projects that demonstrate our government's commitment to the north, unlike the previous government's focus. An example of that commitment is investment in health initiatives for the Northern Territory. It was with a great deal of pleasure that the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, and I announced that the Rudd government will invest a massive $85 million in three key health projects for the people of Darwin. This budget allocates $28 million to Flinders University to build a dedicated network of hospital and community based medical education facilities to allow a full medical program to be delivered in the Territory. The new facilities will be centred around two sites, the Royal Darwin Hospital and Charles Darwin University. Importantly, our government will also provide in excess of $4 million over four years to the NT government to support increased teaching spots and medical places for local students. These investments are expected to increase the number of graduates who choose to practise in the NT after finishing their medical degree and help tackle medical workforce shortages and retention issues in the NT. Construction is expected to begin in 2009-10, with the first student intake in 2011. No longer will our kids have to go interstate to complete their medical degree. This is the best opportunity to keep local graduates working in the Territory. The clinical dean of Flinders University, Professor Michael Lowe, is obviously excited about the project and was reported as saying, ‘It will help to deal with the Territory's unique health issues.' This is a fantastic tiative and one I am very proud of, and I know it will be a lasting legacy for the people of my electorate. The budget also provides over $18 million to build an accommodation complex of 50 units on the grounds of Royal Darwin Hospital for patients and their carers. This much needed investment will alleviate problems caused by the current shortage of short-term affordable accommodation in Darwin for people from regional and remote areas and the effect this shortage has had on access to medical services and discharge from acutecare facilities. Construction is expected to begin in January 2010 and be completed by 2011. More than $34 million will also be invested in building a Centre of Excellence in Indigenous Health and Education in Darwin. The aim of this centre is to assist researchers to develop the evidence base needed to drive improvements in Indigenous health. An improved understanding of diseases affecting Indigenous communities will translate into better health care. Research, integrated clinical care and workforce training will focus on interventions related to early childhood, education, chronic diseases, substance misuse and child abuse. The facility will mean increased Indigenous employment and training at the Royal Darwin Hospital campus and in remote communities. The project is expected to begin later this year, 2009, with construction due to be completed by mid-2012. From what I heard on ABC radio the other day, Dr Jonathan Carapetis, from the Menzies School of Health, is jumping out of his skin about this. He is very happy with this result and is excited about the government's focus on training, education and Indigenous health. These investments build on the Rudd government's investments of $19 million in an oncology facility at Royal Darwin Hospital iniand $10 million in a GP superclinic at Palmerston, both of which are progressing well. It is proof that the Rudd government is committed to providing improved health care to the great people of my electorate of Solomon. These investments will also be welcomed by the construction industry, providing employment to construct all these health investments in Darwin. It will provide immediate job benefits for local building workers. Another significant budget initiative highly relevant for the good people of Solomon is the delivery of $134 million for a landmark package of measures to tackle shortages of doctors and health workers in rural and remote communities in Australia. This initiative will encourage doctors to go and work in rural and remote communities as well as help to keep them there. These benefits will be seen because the Rudd government's Office of Rural Health looked into how rural and regional programs could best benefit those in our community most in need. As I have said, this is a budget that focuses on supporting jobs today by building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. An example of that is the $50 million going to the Darwin port expansion. We have also committed $3.2 million for a feasibility study on the port. I have already met with the port authority, and they are very happy as there are a number of projects that they can use this money for immediately-shovel-ready projects that will not only continue to develop the infrastructure that we need in the north but also give jobs and surety right now, when the economy and working families need it. In this budget the Rudd Labor government is investing nearly $130 million in Northern Territory roads, rail and infrastructure, an investment that will support local jobs and local businesses during the current global recession. All up, the budget delivers an increase in federal funding of $51.4 million, or 66 per cent, over 2008-09 for Northern Territory road and rail projects. As well as putting in place the modern, well-planned transport infrastructure vital to the Territory's and the nation's long-term prosperity, our record investment program will support jobs and provide an immediate stimulus to local communities. This budget sees $25 million allocated for stage 2 of the Tiger Brennan Drive East Arm Port Access Road. This project stalled under the previous government. It was never going to get over the line. The member for Wide Bay made a comment about roads in my area; well, I am happy to say that at the election there was a $74 million commitment from the Rudd Labor government. Stage 1 is completed and we are now going on to stage 2. Not only is this a vital piece of infrastructhe ture for working families that commute from Palmerston to Darwin on a daily basis but it gives seamless access to the port facilities by rail and road, including for road trains coming up the Stuart Highway. It was well overdue, and I am glad to say that we are delivering this commitment to the people of Darwin and Palmerston. Work is expected to commence shortly on stage 2, and the entire project is scheduled to be completed by 2010. As I said before, our government is committed to completing this important link between the growing rural region and the expanding Darwin and Palmerston areas. This major investment will improve safety and travel time for people commuting between Darwin, Palmerston, the northern suburbs and the rural areas. Completing this extension is an issue that is close to my heart, as I and thousands of others who live in Palmerston and the rural areas sit in gridlock every morning and afternoon getting to and from work. This project is also part of a national projects initiative that is designed to deliver major benefits to the business community by allowing easier access for industry to the East Arm Port and the trade development zone. When it is completed, this major infrastructure spend will have significantly improved both efficiency and safety. Minister Albanese and I have also committed to reducing crashes on Northern Territory roads. The Black Spot Program is vital to improving road safety. In this budget we deliver $1 million to the Woolner Road in Stuart Park under the Black Spot Program. The Black Spot Program complements the funding that I have already secured for major national infrastructure links in the Territory like Tiger Brennan Drive and the Stuart Highway, which I have just mentioned. On top of the additional money for upgrading Territory's road network, we are funding a range of initiatives designed to improve road safety. Over $1.5 million dollars is being committed to continue installing boom gates and other safety measures at three high-risk level crossings. There is $1 million to address the lack of safe, modern roadside facilities for truck drivers, including new and refurbished rest stops, parking bays and decoupling areas. This budget improves road safety at both the national and the local level. The member for Wide Bay touched on community infrastructure. Last year in December I had the pleasure of being here with the lord mayors. I have had fantastic feedback from my lord mayors, who have spoken at length to me about what the budget has meant to them. The Darwin City Council is to receive $313,000; the City of Palmerston Council, $196,000; and the Litchfield Shire Council, $152,000. Recently the Palmerston City Council received a further $2 million for streetscape improvement. I spoke to the lord mayor today and he is very excited about and thankful for that money. It will make a great deal of difference in replacing pavers and the like and making it a better area. The Darwin City Council is receiving $3.6 million. These are projects that are hitting the ground running. The member for Wide Bay tried to say that it was pork-barrelling, but, in fact, of the top 10 councils that received money, eight were in Liberal-held federal seats. Both the member for Lingiari and I are very excited about the $159.4 million for defence infrastructure spending for the Northern Territory that was announced in this year's budget. This vital commitment will enable significant upgrade and improvement of defence facilities in the Northern Territory. The expenditure is going to cover a number of projects in the Northern Territory. Key capital works projects, for which $115 million is allocated in 2009-10, include the following. There is $19 million for the $72 million Robertson Barracks redevelopment project. Construction is planned for completion in 2011. There is $16 million for work on the $49.8 million RAAF Base Darwin redevelopment project stage 2. The project will provide a new fuel farm, maintenance and administrative buildings, and a workshop and a vehicle wash bay, and construction is scheduled for completion in 2011. And there is $9.8 million in 2009-10 for approved medium capital works at the Darwin Naval Fuel Installation and RAAF Base Darwin. During 2009-10 Defence will spend around $43 million on estate upkeep in the Northern Territory. Estate upkeep works provide for the ongoing maintenance of Darwin's extensive existing base infrastructure, with a rolling maintenance program being developed and revised each year focussing on areas of highest priority. Works to be undertaken as part of the program in Solomon include painting of bulk fuel storage tanks at RAAF Base Darwin and refurbishment of living accommodation for soldiers at Larrakeyah Barracks. This budget ensures the Australian government's strong commitment to the Defence Force and, through a significant military presence, it also builds on the economy of Solomon. This budget is fantastic for local businesses in the Darwin and Palmerston area. That is because the government will continue to source goods and services from within Solomon and will continue funding of both Defence facilities and personnel serving in the Solomon electorate. This budget shows that the Australian Defence Force is front and centre this financial year with the government funding programs. This significant investment in Defence infrastructure will benefit jobs and the Northern Territory economy. Two very big issues that came out of the budget related to pensioners and paid parental leave. This budget addresses these two important issues, I believe. Both are things that I think our government can be truly proud of. We all know that many seniors in our community do it tough. I have spoken to countless seniors in my electorate about the weekly struggles they face to get by on a pension, particularly those on a single pension. This budget recognises the fact that people in the community who are getting on in age deserve support from their government as they approach their twilight years. We all know pensioners thoroughly deserve this extra support and it is great that, even the hardest of economic times, the Rudd government has delivered. In Solomon there are over 15,000 age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers, wife pensioners and veteran income support recipients. They will all benefit from the sustainable and responsible reforms announced in the budget to increase their pension payments. The reforms will improve the pension system and make it simpler and more sustainable into the future as the population ages. These changes have been a long time coming but they deliver a stronger and fairer pension system that will serve pensioners and Australia well into the future. These are the people who have seen us through our darkest hours and we should support them in their old age. The total increase will comprise a rise in the base rate for single pensioners and a new pension supplement for all pensioners. The reforms will deliver for pensioners on the full rate an annual total increase in permanent payments of $1,689 for singles and $527 for couples combined. I know that Graham Suckling from the Council on the Ageing NT was extremely happy about what has happened. He has been lobbying very hard for probably over eight years for an increase. The budget also allocates $5.5 million for investment in the Australian Institute of Marine Science facility in Darwin. That is a fantastic initiative. We welcome the injection of $5.5 million in new funds for the Australian Institute of Marine Science facility in Darwin announced in the 2009-10 budget. Darwin is a crucial gateway to Australia's northern waters. It is an ideal base from which to run ocean monitoring exercises, and this has been recognised by the important funding to upgrade the AIMS Darwin facility. Here in the Northern Territory coastal developments are coming on at a rapid pace. We need to balance this great new development with in attention to preserving our important natural environment. By enhancing the capacity of the AIMS Darwin facility we will be wellplaced to achieve this balance. The AIMS is increasing its research activity in the Arafura and Timor seas. The expansion of the current facilities will enable this increased research to continue. This budget has delivered for the people of Solomon. This budget will be good for families and it will be good for families with children in child care. It is fantastic for the people of Palmerston and the rural areas, who for so long have missed out on vital health services and infrastructure upgrades. I join other members in congratulating the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the executive in putting together this budget. The people of Solomon were let down by the previous government. As the Prime Minister recently said, the Labor government is the party of hope and the coalition is the party of fear. I commend the bills to the House.",93
190,Mr COSTELLO,COMMITTEES,"It is worth remembering that Labor's first budget, the budget that was brought down 12 months ago, in May 2008, forecast an economy which would grow at around 2¾ per cent. When Mr Swan, the Treasurer, brought down that first Labor budget some 12 months ago he said in his speech: We are budgeting for a surplus of $21.7 billion … 1.8 per cent of GDP, the largest budget surplus as a share of GDP in nearly a decade. He went on to claim that it was a ‘surplus built on substantial savings' and, further, a ‘surplus built on disciplined spending'. When he brought down the first Labor budget in May 2008 what Mr Swan was saying was that he was no girly-man; he was going to produce a huge budget surplusnone of these wussy coalition budget surpluses of 1½, 1.3 or 1.4 per cent. He was going to produce a budget surplus of 1.8 per cent of GDP. Of course, none of what he forecast came to fruition-none of it. As I said at the time, the 2008 budget is best filed in the fiction section of the Parliamentary Library because the forecast could not be held from May 2008 to May 2009. And when he came back here in May 2009 he adopted a somewhat different approach. He had had no trouble telling us about the bottom line in May 2008, but in May 2009 he was strangely silent about what the bottom line of the budget would be. A budget is a statement of how you are going to manage expenditures and revenues over the course of the year. The most basic, fundamental thing about a budget is what you are budgeting for. It makes no sense to say: ‘I'm budgeting for an undisclosed bottom line. I can't tell you whether I'm budgeting for surplus or deficit. I can't tell you how much it's going to be.' The crucial thing about a budget, particularly a Commonwealth budget, is to actually inform the nation what the budget is. Is it for a surplus? Is it for a deficit? Is it for X billion dollars it for Y billion dollars? We had the extraordinary situation on budget night this year where the one critical fact that governs the parameters of any federal budget was actually omitted from the speech because apparently, we are told, the spin merchants of the Labor Party had said to the Treasurer, ‘You cannot utter those words in the parliament; it will go on film and it could be used against you.' Chalk one up for the spin meisters; chalk one down for accountability and transparency in public debate in this country. The $22 billion surplus which was forecast in May 2008 came in as a $32 billion deficit. I want to make this point: that was driven by policy decisions. Do not let anybody claim that the failure of the government to deliver its forecast in 2008-09 was driven by revenue downturns. As this year's budget papers make entirely clear in table 5 of budget statement No. 3, it was policy measures, new spending of $33.3 billion, that turned that forecast surplus into a deficit. In addition to that there was a parameter change. But it was not the parameter change that drove the budget into deficit; it was the new spending. In October, there was the spending on the Economic Security Strategy. In December, there was the spending on the nation-building strategy. In February, there was the spending on the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. It was policy measures that drove the projected surplus of 2008-09 into deficit. As table 5 of budget statement No. 3 shows, again in this fiscal year $32 billion of new spending, of new policy measures, will drive the budget into deficit. In addition to that there are parameter changes of $45 billion which will drive it into a deep deficit. Discretionary policy measures drove the budget into deficit in 2008-09, as they will drive the budget into deficit in 2009-10. Why do I emphasise the failed forecasts of last year's budget? Only to make this point: or is if the government's budget forecasts between May 2008 and May 2009 were interrupted by new discretionary policy spending, we should take with a grain of salt the forecasts and projections which it now wants us to believe in this document out over the next seven, eight and in some cases 13 yearsbecause this government would have you believe that, even though it was wildly inaccurate between May 2008 and May 2009 on growth forecasts, and indeed on policy measures, you can believe the projections that it gives for six years of continuous growth to bring the budget back into balance in 2015-2016, and, what is more, you can believe the projections for another seven years of continuous growth after that to retire in 2021-22 the debt they are building up. Let us just consider this for a moment. The government would have you believe that for seven years, from now until 2015-16, we will have: a contraction of half a per cent year, followed by 2¼ per cent growth, 4½ per cent growth, 4½ per cent growth, four per cent growth and four per cent growth out to 2015-16, which will bring the budget back into balance. The government is very confident, apparently, in growth figures between now and 2015-2016. It then says there will be above-trend growth after that, and then returning, once we have got to full employment of five per cent-interestingly defined as five per cent in the budget papers-to continuous growth to 2021-22. That will be in 2021-22, as we heard from the Prime Minister in question time today. And what will be the great achievement by 2021-22? We will be back where we were in 2006. The Prime Minister says that he has a plan to get us back, by 2021-22, to where we were in 2006, which is debt free. Maybe this is what Labor meant by its education revolution. Think of those tiny tots who started school this year. After they have done seven years of primary education, the budget will just be getting back to balance. After they have finished all of their primary education and all of their secondary education, according to the most optimistic forecast in this budget, just as those tiny tots who started school this year are coming out of the education system after 13 years of education in 2021-22, we will be coming out of temporary debt. I wonder if those kids who are going into 13 years of education regard it as a temporary education. I wonder if those kids who are going into primary education regard seven years of primary education as a temporary period. That is how this government regards it. It regards it as a temporary deficit, just as it regards 13 years of debt as temporary debt. That is even on the most optimistic of assumptions-that is, two years of growth at 4½ per cent followed by four years of four per cent followed by trend growth, with no interruption over that period. Let me say this this to the House: it just will not happen. The Treasurer said today in question time that he has put a ceiling on the growth of outlays. Has he? What has he actually done? Has he legislated a ceiling on the growth of outlays? No. What he means by saying that he has put a ceiling on the growth of outlays is that, in order to make his figures add up, he intends that there will be no more than two per cent growth in outlays over all of those years, just as he intended in May 2008 to produce a budget surplus. And there is no reason to believe this intention will come into reality any more than his intentions of last year came into reality in the past 12 months. ‘That fixed that,' he said. ‘I've put a cap on outlays; two per cent real growth every year.' If only it were that easy; if only you just had to say it for the word to become a deed. This is a Treasurer whose one and only budget had an increase of outlays of 13½ per cent and who now says, ‘Over a period of seven years I'll restrict it to two per cent per annum. And I'll restrict that through the election in 2010 and 2013. And then, in order to pay off debt, we'll go through the election of 2016 and 2019 and we'll be back where we started in 2021-22.' Of course, all of the assumptions in relation to that assume that there will be no tax cuts, that inflation will take off again as the economy grows and the revenues will come back through bracket creep. Before the 2007 election, I recall the now Prime Minister saying, when he refused to follow the full coalition tax plan, which was to cut the top marginal tax rate from 45 to 43 to 42 in this term, that in his next term, if he were re-elected, he would be looking at bringing the top marginal tax rate down to 40 per cent. But of course there is no capacity to do that in these budget papers. These budget papers assume getting the budget back into balance without tax cuts and without indexationbracket creep. It is sometimes claimed that all of this is the result of some kind of collapse in the terms of trade. Well, the terms of trade are forecast to fall 13¼ per cent this year off the all-time record of 2008, when the Labor Party was in government, and it will take those terms of trade back to 2007 levels. But they will still be substantially higher than they were under the coalition government. There has been no collapse in the terms of trade. In fact, the budget papers themselves say on page 2-30: Even after this fall, the terms of trade would remain around 45 per cent higher than the average in the decade prior to the commodity boom … So it is not as if the terms of trade are going to be at some historical low. They are going back to 2007 levels as a result, higher than what they were when I was Treasurer from the period of 1996 to 2007-much higher, in fact. And this government is blessed, according to these forecasts, by terms of trade which will be much higher than they were during that period. In fact, this is where the budget story becomes very puzzling indeed. On the one hand we are told this is the greatest downturn since the Great Depression and yet, on the other hand, the budget forecasts a contraction of half a per cent of GDP. In the year to June 1983, in that recession, there was a contraction of 3.4 per cent. In the recession to June 1991, there was a contraction of 1.5 per cent, so the government is in fact forecasting a much milder recession than 1991 or 1983. It is forecasting in this recession that unemployment will rise to around nine per cent compared to 10 per cent in 1982 and 11 per cent in 1991. When the Treasury does its analysis of how we will come out of this recession, it does its analysis comparing the experience of 1982 and 1991, not the Great Depression when unemployment peaked at around 20 per cent. The Treasury is comparing this with 1982 and 1991, and indeed forecasting that it will be milder than both of those recessions. The only thing that will be greater coming out of this recession is the budget deficit, because in neither of those recessions did the budget deficit ever blow out to five per cent of GDP. So, on the indicators of growth and employment, this will be a milder downturn than 1982 and 1991and bear in mind we have had many recessions over the last 50 years-but the budget deficit will be of a greater dimension. Indeed, the debt build-up will be of a greater dimension. From trough to peak, debt will build up about 18 per cent of GDP compared to the Keating recession where, from trough to peak, it built up about 14 per cent of GDP. And when the government says, incidentally, that Australia will have a debt to GDP ratio that is far better than those of comparable countries around the world, it is not because of anything this government has done. This government is building debt to GDP up by about 18 per cent of GDP. It is because it started from a net asset position. It is because the coalition paid off all debt and established the Future Fund and had a negative net debt of about four per cent of GDP. Countries like the US and the UK started with debt to GDP ratios of about 50 per cent. While the coalition was delivering surplus budgets through the late 1990s and early 2000s, in the UK and the US they were running up deficits. While we were paying back debt, they were building debt up. The strength of the Australian position comes not from anything the Rudd government has done, but from its strong starting point-and it would be an honest thing for Mr Rudd to actually acknowledge that. If we had gone into this downturn with a debt to GDP ratio of 50 or 60 per cent, we would have built it to 80 too. But we went in with a negative net debt and asset position because we had sat here and retired debt and built an asset position without the help of the Labor Party through those periods when comparable countries, such as the US and the UK, were running deficits and building up their debt position. Undoubtedly there has been an international downturn, but the government's response here in Australia reminds me of the statement of Rahm Emanuel, Chief of Staff to President Obama, who said that you never want a serious crisis to go to waste. This government has not let this crisis go to waste-dusting off spending proposals which we could not afford when we had the money and introducing them now that we do not. These are spending proposals like giving out cheques, as the government did before Christmas; spending proposals such as insulating houses, a spending measure which was rolled up to me which I did not believe we could afford when we had the money, but which the government now believes we can afford now that we do not have the money. It is funding projects which it hopes will boost its election prospects. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have heard in question time the Prime Minister, equipped with graphs and pictures, talking about projects he is funding with borrowed money in order to try to buy electoral appeal. This is the biggest increase in outlays this country has seen since Gough Whitlam. Whitlam increased outlays by 15.7 per cent in 1975-76 and Rudd increased them by 13½ per cent in 2008-09. But I will say this for Whitlam: Whitlam at least did not flood spending out into the community from borrowed money. Under Whitlam we had no net debt. The difference between Rudd and Whitlam is that Rudd is borrowing the money that he is flooding out into the community-much more Peron than Whitlam, this approach, to borrow money and flood it out into the community in an effort to try and buy votes. Let us be honest about this. Under the cover of the global financial crisis, a whole host of policies were advanced for political gain. These debts will be with us for 20 years at least-maybe forever. The Australian public will pay for this recklessness.",98
191,Ms NEAL,COMMITTEES,"I rise in the House today to inform members about the significant achievements brought to the residents of my electorate of Robertson by the sound and decisive economic management of the Rudd Labor government. It is a proactive budget which acts decisively to protect Australia from the worse fallout from the global economic crisis. It is a budget of vision and of hope. It is a nation-building budget of optimism which builds our infrastructure and protects 220,000 Australian jobs. This budget shares the heroic optimism of the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy of October 2008 and the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan of February 2009. These measures together have delivered great benefit to Australia and to my electorate of Robertson. The government has also provided funds that have brought substantial investments in community infrastructure and that have had a direct, immediate and positive impact on the household budgets of Robertson and on the wider economy of the that Central Coast. Today I would like to make members aware of the measurable nature of this positive impact in my electorate. In the lead-up to the federal election that brought the Rudd Labor government to power in November 2007, we made a range of commitments to the electors of Robertson. I am delighted to report that the Rudd Labor government has delivered in full on all of these election commitments. All of these commitments are major infrastructure projects that are now making the Central Coast a better place to live, work and raise our children. The Rudd Labor government has indeed proved to be the architect of hope for regional communities like those on the Central Coast. A major election commitment that I have been pleased to deliver to the people of Robertson was an $81 million investment in a water pipeline from Mardi Dam to Mangrove Creek Dam. This missing link pipeline will ensure future water security for the people of the Central Coast. A sum of $840 million is being invested in creating a dedicated freight rail track between Sydney and Newcastle. This will separate freight from passenger traffic, taking significant freight fic off the vital F3 freeway, and improve travel for the tens of thousands of commuters who travel to Sydney every day to work. An amount of $7 million was allocated to make available an additional 400 car parking spaces in the Gosford CBD for those same commuters. An amount of $150 million was provided for preliminary planning work for a vital road link between the F3 freeway and the M7 motorway in Sydney, and $900,000 was provided to build a multipurpose community sporting facility at Erina High School that can be used for students and community groups, who can share much needed support and recreational facilities. The Rudd Labor government has also provided $680,000 to Gosford City Council to install 24 CCTV cameras in three important shopping centres at Umina Beach, Woy Woy and Ettalong Beach. The rollout of these cameras has already begun and when completed they will make the three CBDs on the peninsula safer and more friendly places to work, live and shop in. The improvement of community services and the provision of new and upgraded infrastructure have been among the highest priorities for me and the people of Robertson. All these election commitments have been delivered in full. Despite the downturn in the global economy, the Rudd Labor government has reasserted its commitment to invest in the practical infrastructure projects that Australian communities need to keep their economies strong. Projects such as these are a down payment on a prosperous economy for the Central Coast, providing the community with the capacity to grow again when times improve. The delivery of infrastructure projects of great significance has continued over the year and a half since the election. In September of 2008 the government allocated $4.5 million to assist Gosford City Council upgrade the quality of drinking water at Woy trafWoy and on the peninsula. This provided a practical solution to what has been a serious problem for peninsula residents for many years. The state of roads is also a crucial factor for the safety of motorists and pedestrians all around Australia. Through the Roads to Recovery program and the government's Black Spot Program, local authorities are funded to redress some of the backlog of roadworks that are urgently needed in many areas. In 2008 Gosford City Council received $1.58 million in Roads to Recovery grants, an increase of more than $500,000 on what was provided when the former Liberal Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads was the incumbent member for Robertson. In March 2009 the Rudd government allocated a record $5.4 million in Roads to Recovery funding over five years to Gosford City Council. This unprecedented level of funding for roads in Robertson helps maintain and upgrade our local roads, but it also supports local jobs and businesses during the current global recession. The funding under this program is untied so that councils can spend the money on local road priorities identified by members of the local community actually using the roads in question. Black Spot Program funding for this year in Robertson has helped remediate conditions at four serious accident sites on the Central Coast, with funding of more than $900,000. The Rudd government's $800 million Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program has brought many significant improvements to thousands of local communities across Australia. The program provided $1.345 million to Gosford City Council for nine groups of projects in Robertson in March 2009. These were all practical but very necessary on-the-ground projects that would have been left in the too-hard basket or the unfunded basket by the local authorities without a substantial injection of federal funds. They included upgrades to scores of community facilities, including sportsground lighting upgrades, playground refurbishments, disabled access at community halls and centres, and oval and park upgrades. These initiatives greatly improve social infrastructure in the Gosford City Council area, which has essentially the same boundaries as my electorate. They also boost local jobs, providing a stimulus to the local economy and adding to national productivity in the long term. The Community Infrastructure Program also included $500 for strategic projects that were shovel-ready but which could not have proceeded without additional funds. Gosford City Council was provided with more than $3 million to build the world-class Peninsula Recreation Precinct at Umina Beach. This precinct will include the renovation of tennis courts and the associated clubhouses; upgrades to the skate park and BMX track, including safety and visibility upgrades; upgrades to the sports oval, much used by the local Umina soccer, cricket, Rugby Union and Rugby League clubs; construction of a new super-playground, including playground equipment, lighting and a large shade cloth; recreational infrastructure such as park furniture, barbecue and picnic facilities, new pathways and cycleways, and fitness equipment for all ages and abilities; and renovations to the Umina Eagles clubhouse. Projects such as these are vitally important to local communities like those on the peninsula, which has shown a growth rate and population increase for many years that has far outstripped the provision of community infrastructure. This community-building initiative will address a real demand on the rapidly growing Central Coast for better sporting facilities, parks and playgrounds. It is facilities such as these that help keep our young children and families active and healthy. The delivery of better infrastructure and community facilities to the people of the coast was a strong election commitment of mine. I will keep on fighting for funds to make the coast a healthier and more pleasant place to bring up children. I am pleased the Rudd Labor government is willing to accept this challenge through innovative initiatives such as the Community Infrastructure Program, but perhaps the biggest commitment from the government is the revolution now taking place in schools across Australia. One of the major components of the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan, itself the largest one-off investment in infrastructure in Australia's history, is the Building the Education Revolution program, or BER. This is a broad-ranging initiative of historic proportions that is transforming schools and bringing them into the 21st century. The various components of BER have all made great contributions to schools in Robertson. More than 2,960 computers have been provided to 17 secondary schools in Robertson from the government's $1.9 billion National Secondary School Computer Fund. This amounts to an allocation of more than $2.96 million for local schools in my area alone. It will allow a computer-to-student ratio of one to two in our secondary schools for years 9 to 12. For example, the two campuses of Brisbane Water Secondary College will receive 439 computers between them. This program will help our local students get access to the tools tomorrow's digital learning landscape. In March 2009, St Joseph's Catholic College and St Edward's Christian Brothers College received more than $1.4 million to establish the East Gosford Industry Training Pathways Project. This is part of the Labor government's $2.5 billion Trade Training Centres in Schools Program. The schools built metals and engineering workshops, construction workshops, new commercial cookery rooms, art rooms and new administration areas. They now offer certificate II and III courses, greatly enhancing local students' access to quality accredited trades training and helping to address areas of skill shortage in Australia's economy and also in areas of the Central Coast economy. The federal government has also integrated $10 million from the Australian technical colleges initiative into trade training in our local schools. This will provide greater access to trade courses for children still at school who might otherwise have left school before completing their higher school certificate. Other components of the Building the Education Revolution program are now having even greater impacts on our local schools. In two rounds of the National School Pride program, 43 Robertson primary and secondary schools received between $50,000 and $200,000 each to undertake vital infrastructure improvements and refurbishment works. This represents a direct investment of $6.8 million in the schools of the Central Coast. This program will help support many local jobs as tradespeople and local businesses help transform the physical environment of our schools. The National School Pride program will help improve the quality of education for our students. It will also provide a massive boost for the local economy. The $12.4 billion Primary Schools for the 21st Century Program is helping primary for schools in Robertson with major infrastructure improvements such as libraries, multipurpose halls and new classrooms. In round 1 of this program, two schools in Robertson received a total of $2.85 million to refurbish administration areas and classrooms and to build a primary information resource centre. I am looking forward immensely to round 2, when the rest of about 40 schools in Robertson can begin to rebuild and refurbish. Building the Education Revolution has so far delivered a great deal to the schools of Robertson. Taken together, the four major programs-computers in schools, trade training in schools, National School Pride and Primary Schools for the 21st Century-have delivered more than $14 million directly to the schools in my electorate. This is a massive investment just for my area. When this is multiplied across all the electorates in Australia-including those of the coalition members opposite me, who may or may not support the provisions for their electoratesyou can begin to gauge the scale of this historic undertaking. The Building the Education Revolution initiative is a $14.7 billion program, a program of immense proportions. The greatest proportion of the stimulus funding provided over the past 1½ years has gone into nationbuilding infrastructure programs that will transform the Australian economy in the long term. It will be clear from what I have said tonight that a transformation has been underway in my electorate of Robertson as well. The impressive list of funding achievements that I have outlined here is a testament to the soundness of the economic management of the Rudd Labor government in these extremely difficult times. The government has taken timely and decisive action to lessen the impacts of the global recession. It has taken action to save and preserve and it has also charted a way forward to recovery. We have seen the positive impact of those measures in my electorate of Robertson and we are seeing similar positive results of string?' across Australia.",102
192,Mr BALDWIN,COMMITTEES,"I rise tonight to speak in the budget debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010-an appropriation bill which outlines the price Australian families will have to pay for Labor's reckless spending spree over the past 18 months-and related bills. As a consequence of Labor's senseless budget, projections indicate that there will be one million unemployed by 2010-11, a record $58 billion deficit and a record net debt of at least $188 billion by 2012-13. These figures are all key markers of the failure of the Rudd Labor government's economic management. It is important that all Australians are aware of the damage that the Rudd Labor government has inflicted on our national economy. Twothirds of the debt owed by taxpayers in 201213 will be due to spending decisions taken by the Rudd Labor government over the past 18 months. Paterson families are far worse off under Rudd, as are all Australian families. Since the November 2007 election, Labor has announced measures which have increased Commonwealth spending by $124 billion. That is an average of $225 million of new spending every day. The Rudd Labor government must not continue to pretend that the destruction of our nation's balance sheet is an unavoidable consequence of the global recession. It is a result of its economic mismanagement. The proposed budget highlights that the Prime Minister and Treasurer have failed to deliver a credible plan for recovery for the Paterson electorate. I listen to my constituents in Paterson electorate who call my office daily to tell me how they fear for the nation's future under Kevin Rudd. jobs, They ask: ‘How can one man waste so much money?' and ‘Will I ever be able to retire?' Many add, when asked this difficult question, ‘I think to myself: how long is a piece What this budget reveals is the biggest tax and spending binge in Australia's peacetime history, driving an expansion in the size and scope of the public sector not seen since the Whitlam years. The electorate of Paterson is as diverse as it is large. Scoping south from Nelson Bay, north to Forster and Tuncurry and out west to the township of Gloucester, Paterson is filled with an array of industry, infrastructure and colourful individuals. However, as diverse as all the 91,000-plus Paterson constituents are, they all have one thing in common: they are fundamentally and absolutely worse off under a federal Labor government. From broadband to education, health to energy and resources, Labor's budget reveals that Paterson's constituents will be left in the dark due to Labor's reckless spending over the past 18 months. Not only that but, due to the Rudd Labor government's incompetence, the constituents of Paterson will pay the price through higher future taxes, higher future interest rates, higher future foreign debt and higher unemployment. As I mentioned, no portfolio is safe from the Prime Minister's tornado of destruction. In the lead-up to the last federal election, the current Prime Minister declared that he would fix health by mid-2009. Instead, Labor's reckless spending means that Australians will now pay more for their health care. Alarmingly, whilst Labor splashed $23 billion in cash around the nation, not one cent went to health. Labor's budget reveals that Australians will now pay more for their health care, with a tax on the private health insurance rebate, the Medicare safety net, and pathology and diagnostic services. Labor's budget delivers a significant blow to the private health sector, despite the Prime Minister and Labor promising not to alter rebates for private health. One million, seven hundred thousand. Australians will be immediately affected by changes to rebates for private health insurance, facing either higher premium payments or higher tax payments through the Medicare levy. This includes nearly 50 per cent of all enrolled voters in the Paterson electorate-58,289 people who were deceived by the Prime Minister when they took him at his word that their private health insurance costs would not increase. It is an absolute disgrace the way that the Prime Minister has misled the people of Paterson in his pursuit for power. Debate interrupted. NA",106
193,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 8.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Paterson Electorate: Tea Gardens Public School Parliament",107
194,Mr BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Paterson) (8.30 pm)The area of Port Stephens, in particular the north shore area, was put forward as a possible home for the Parliament of Australia. Sadly, the proposal did not progress. That being said, I rise tonight to recognise the oldest parliament in my electorate of Paterson. By that I mean the Tea Gardens Public School parliament, which celebrated its 20th official opening on Friday, 22 May. This is truly an amazing achievement. It recognises the commitment of the school community as a whole in ensuring the parliament is an ongoing success. The Tea Gardens Public School parliament was established following a visit to Canberra 22 years ago. The staff at the school were keen to implement a parliamentary system to give the students a voice in implementing change at the school, which continues strongly today. The school parliament, which is based on the Westminster system, is highly valued and well respected by the students, staff, parents and the wider community. The ‘Prime Minister' and the ‘ministers' have designated roles and responsibilities and are supported by the ‘Governor General', the principal; the ‘senators', the teachers; and the parliamentary advisor. The school parliament plays a significant role in implementing change at the school. Simply put, the voice of the children is listened to and acted upon. The parliament sits each fortnight, and ideas, motions and questions are put to the student members for discussion or vote. Each year the students receive their badge of office from the current Tea Gardens/Hawks Nest Lioness Club Citizen of the Year at a special school leaders induction service. The Tea Gardens Public School parliament has been a model for many other schools in setting up their own parliaments and is an outstanding example of student leadership within a school. I would like to report to this parliament that the 2009 school committee is: Prime Minister, Sky Boonon; Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Building and Health, Lachlan Hole; Minister for Special Events, Candice Cotterill; Minister for Transport, Ray Finch; Minister for the Environment, Jessica Treacy; Minister for Education, Thomas Ross; Minister for Pupil Welfare, Lindsay-Jean Banks; Minister for Sport, Jackson Page; Leader of the Opposition, Nash Johnson; Speaker of the House, Ryan Howarth; Deputy Speaker, Lauren MCCaul; Serjeant-at-Arms, Ethan Schloeffel and Alex Bartholomew; Usher of the Black Rod, Luke Fenner; Hansard reporters, Taylah Cooke, Kant Richardson and Kiarna Eddy; and Parliamentary Advisor, Ms Annette Benton, who has been in that position for the whole of the 20 years the parliament has been established. And, of course, the principal, Sue Estens, is the Governor General. The motions that were put to the Tea Gardens Public School parliament at the 20th official opening of parliament were: (1) that the school get games to use during wet weather lunches, such as Twister and other board games-that was carried; (2) that the school set up a ‘Bully Bank' where bullies are fined and the money given to charitycarried; (3) that the school get speakers put in every classroom so the principal can say messages to classes and she does not have to leave her office-carried; (4) that we get new play equipment for the younger kidsunfortunately defeated. Following the parliament, the Senate-the teachers-meets to discuss the motions that were carried by the students. Some of the more memorable motions from the past 20 years have included: that we do 30 minutes of exercise a day at school; that we do not have to tuck our shirts in; that the canteen sells stationery; that we raise money for a professional DJ for the year 6 farewell social; that the art area gets fixed; that the school get some new sports equipment, including pogo sticks; that we start soccer practice early so we have a chance to win; that we are able to go down the back at afternoon recess; that the school get a toilet down the back; that teachers should not be able to keep children in at lunchtime; that school get an alarm down the back; and that each classroom gets a telephone in case there is an emergency. The students have some great ideas. However, sadly, not all their motions are passed in the Senate-that is replicated here. I would like to acknowledge that the inaugural Prime Minister in 1988 was Chris Hall, followed in 1989 by Olivia Meek. In 1990 at the first official opening, the Prime Minister was Anya Cole and the Governor General, the principal, was Daryl Martin. Even though Daryl Martin has been retired for some time now, he has managed to attend all of the official Tea Gardens Public School parliament openings. What I observe at each and every parliament opening that I have been able to attend over the past 13 years is that the children are well behaved and that they speak with unbridled passion yet with absolute respect for their peers. I congratulate the Tea Gardens Public School parliament on achieving its 20th official opening and 22nd year of operation. Braddon Electorate: Promoting Australian Produce Program",107
195,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, you will be aware, as are some of my colleagues on this side, that I live in the village of Forth, which was the hometown of Edward Braddon, whom the electorate is named after. I have said many times that Forth has such a fertile soil that if you throw a toenail in the ground it will grow a foot. It is in the Forth Valley itself that we have the Forth based nut producers, Webster Ltd, who can now develop a new marketing initiative-which I would like to highlight tonight-for its product, thanks to a $212,500 grant from the Rudd government. The funding comes from our government's Promoting Australian Produce program. This program is all about assisting the Australian producers, such as Webster, to promote their product nationally and internationally. Webster Ltd will use the grant to develop a marketing initiative to form a legal entity called Australian Nut Growers, which will serve as a marketing alliance to supply Australian-grown tree nuts to domestic and export markets. Webster Ltd will form the alliance with Nut Producers Australia and Stahmann Farms and focus on the supply of walnuts, almonds, pistachios, pecans and macadamias. This grant will go a long way to helping the north-west nut industry continue to be competitive with its mainland counterparts. The grant, for those interested, is part of nearly $2 million being delivered across Australia to agricultural and seafood industry organisations in the first round of the Promoting Australian Produce program. Under the program, grant recipients are required to match the funding dollar for dollar. I congratulate Webster Ltd and its associates on matching that $212,500 from the Rudd government. Promoting Australian Produce is a three year, $5 million program that aims to assist Australian food industries to develop their capacity to promote and market Australian produce more effectively to both domestic and export markets. Under the program, matched-funding grants between $50,000 and $750,000 are available for food industry organisations to undertake projects based around one or more of the following activities: enhancing industry marketing and promotional capabilities; developing new strategies for industry marketing; gaining consumer insights; and strengthening links with domestic and international markets. As an industry leader, Webster has obviously seen the opportunity to again blaze the trail for its own operation, and others, to inyear. crease their competitiveness. Webster Walnuts is Australia's largest commercial walnut grower, currently owning or managing about 2,000 hectares in Tasmania, mainly on the east coast, and in Griffith and Leeton in New South Wales. Webster also owns Australia's only commercial walnut nursery. The nursery is part of Webster's headquarters at my home village of Forth. It is just up the road from my own house and in the heart of one of Australia's most productive farming areas. Webster Fresh is a counterseasonal producer and marketer of a range of vegetable products, primarily onions and carrots, for both the export and domestic markets. Webster's Field Fresh Tasmanian brand has a strong reputation in the competitive world market as a reliable producer and an industry leader in production and product safety. Webster also maintains a strong strategic position in the salmon industry through its 26 per cent ownership of the salmon industry leader, Tassal Group Limited. The Australian food industry, as our nation's largest manufacturing industry, is a major driver of employment, wealth and prosperity, and that is certainly the case in my electorate, where we specialise in vegetable growing, dairy, beef production, significant horticulture, fishing and a growing viticulture industry. The north-west coast is the food bowl of Tasmania. Australia's and Tasmania's competitive advantage in food production is underpinned by an abundance of arable land that is used to produce a wide range of food commodities across temperate, sub-tropical and tropical agricultural systems. I applaud Webster for their success in gaining the grant and I also applaud the Rudd government for this program to promote Australian produce. I hope others can also benefit from the Promoting Australian Produce program in this coming financial Re-Engineering Australia Foundation",108
196,Mr RUDDOCK,ADJOURNMENT,"Berowra) (8.40 pm)Last November, members may recall being invited to attend the national final of the Schools Innovation Design Challenge, which was held here in the Great Hall of Parliament House. I saw on the evening that 25 members attended. The final result saw schools from the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia triumph. On the night, federal funding to help support their work for the next three years was announced, and that is something I welcome. Tonight I would like to highlight the role of the Re-Engineering Australia Foundation, the headquarters of which is located at Pennant Hills in my electorate. In 1998, it was established as a non-profit organisation with aims to interest and inform students about engineering as a career. It provides technology, motivation and opportunities to students nationally through a series of structured experimental education programs which aim at developing employability skills. The design challenge commenced in 2003. It was aimed at students from years 7 to 10 and it was offered to high schools throughout Australia. It develops the creativity and innovation of high school students through design of projects based on the development of a Formula 1 racing car. The program is linked with the international F1 in Schools challenge, which now runs in 18 countries. The foundation's projects link schools, dustry, TAFEs, universities and parents in stimulating interest and skills in students. 2007 over 30,000 students from 280 secondary schools directly participated in the gram. The foundation has had significant corporate and government organisational support. Dassault Systemes contributed $450 million in engineering technology and software to schools. From 2008 until at least 2011 the Department of Defence, through the Defence Materiel Organisation, will be a major supporter. Telstra and Toyota have provided cash contributions and state and local governments have also made contributions. The benefits are very significant for students. It sows the seeds of inspiration. They can respond to their heroes-there are positive role models and mentors. They gain benefits from participating in national programs and the skills make them eminently employable. For the schools there is the benefit of having enhanced enthusiasm amongst teachers, there is a boost for participating schools' reputations and the number of students interested in taking design and engineering subjects has seen an increase of some 400 per cent. And of course there is increased involvement and collaboration with industry. For universities and TAFEs there is heightened morale and enthusiasm, there is mentoring, it creates a national funnel for students interested in undertaking engineering courses and it improves connectivity with industry. For industry, there are increased linkages and involvement with local schools and access to potential staff. I am particularly interested in this matter because schools in my own electorate have participated. Barker College-which I think has four ex-students in this parliament, including me-was third outright place winner in- in the Fl in Schools world championships. It is important to note that Australian schools In have won places in the world championships each year from 2005 to 2008. And Repro- Engineering Australia has won much recognition from Engineers Australia and has also won the Prime Minister's Award for Skills Excellence, to name just a couple. They have future plans. They continue to grow the program and members are encouraged to promote this project in schools in their electorates. This year will see the implementation of the first hub with direct defence industry links and collaboration in the ACT through the Navy and ADFA. The future is very exciting. A pilot program entitled Oz-Blobs Challenge is presently underway in a number of primary schools. Students are provided with 3D modelling software and make their own design, which is then sent to the ‘Blobs factory', where it is prototyped. With an extension activity of F1 in Schools, the proposed hybrid design competition students will be given a real opportunity to design components for cars in the future. This is a project that deserves members' support and encouragement. It does a great deal for education and it will do a great deal for Australia and Australian productivity if we encourage students' participation. Kingston Electorate: Rail Infrastructure",109
197,Ms RISHWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I am very pleased to rise tonight to speak about some of the very important budget measures that are happening in my electorate of Kingston. Probably the most significant investment announced for my electorate is for the rail extension from Noarlunga to Seaford. This is not the first time. I have risen in this House to speak about how important this project is to the local community. In fact, I have spoken many times about how the outer metropolitan area is starting to grow, especially the outer southern suburbs of Adelaide. Areas like Seaford, Seaford Rise and Seaford Meadows are growing at a significant rate. Previously, the metropolitan area ended around the point of Noarlunga, and the growth has led to an increasing need for more public transport to be available in the area. This budget measure-a commitment of $291 million-is a perfect example of how this government is supporting jobs, small business and larger businesses in Australia by investing in the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. I want to talk about some of the community that called for this rail extension. It is not just a few people who have called for it; overwhelmingly, people in my electorate have called for it. The Seaford District Residents Association has been campaigning for this for many, many years. In fact, it might be of interest for the House to know that this rail corridor has been mapped out for the past 30 years. However, no previous government has committed to actually build it, and this has been a great frustration for the residents. The Seaford District Residents Association, with people like Ron Jenkins and Harold Warburton, has been out there fighting to try to get this on the agenda because of its importance. The local council has also been talking to various people to explain how important this is. I was very pleased that the South Australian state government put this project to Infrastructure Australia as one of its top priority projects. I made my own submission to Infrastructure Australia to illustrate just how important this project is. Some of the statistics speak for themselves. It is estimated that the extension from Noarlunga to Seaford will result in about 1.5 million extra public transport trips per year and up to 400,000 passenger hours each year. What that means is that there will be fewer cars on the road. I have spoken to a lot of constituents who have been very frustrated that they have not been able to get easily from Aldinga or Seaford to the rail line. This will make it easier for them to use public transport. It will mean fewer cars on the road, less carbon emissions and more people using public transport. That is a great thing for the future. The rail extension will coincide with the state government's commitment to electrify the rail. It is projected to start next year and to be finished in 2013. That is a good time line that has been welcomed by residents. It will also play an incredibly important part in stimulating the Australian economy. This project, with the many other infrastructure projects that have been announced by the Rudd government, will help cushion Australia from the full impact of the global recession, while laying the foundations for a stronger and more prosperous future. That will certainly occur as a result of this rail extension in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. My challenge tonight is not only to raise this issue but also to urge the opposition to support this measure. They have not indicated whether or not they will support the infrastructure measures. There are reports that the Leader of the Opposition has said he will review all the infrastructure projects. My message is that the residents in my electorate do not want this reviewed again. They do not want to continue to talk about it. They want to see action on the ground. They want to see the result of this great investment in the area that will take the outer suburbs of south Adelaide well into the decades to come. I would like to hear from the opposition. Will they support this project? (Time expired) Sunshine Coast Health Services",111
198,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"The residents of the Sunshine Coast, which is one of the areas I represent in the Australian parliament, face a risk of diminishing health services as a result of changes announced in the budget that will affect only a limited number of communities in Australia. The area to the east of the Bruce Highway between Coochin Creek and Forest Glen and roughly diagonally across to Coolum and then east of the Sunshine Motorway to Noosa has been reclassified as a metropolitan area as a result of the government switching from the Rural, Remote and Metropolitan Areas health region classification system to the Australian Standard Geographical Classification: Remoteness Areas system. The explanation is that the former system utilises population data dating back to 1991 while the new system is based on data from the 2006 census and, allegedly, is more accurate. Explanations aside, the new classification has the effect of making the coastal areas of my electorate no longer eligible for various incentives for doctors who wish to practise in the region. These lost incentive programs include the GP registrar placement program and the rural upskilling program. My office has been advised that this affected area will retain Medicare bulk-billing incentives and benefits under the District of Workforce Shortage classifications. Areas in the electorate of Fisher that are outside this coastal strip, I am advised, will continue to have access to all of the incentives. However, for residents in areas like Kawana Waters, Caloundra, Currimundi, Little Mountain, Alexandra Headland, Mooloolaba and the local adjacent areas on the coastal side of the Bruce Highway in my electorate, the fear is that some services will dry up as it becomes more and more difficult to attract doctors to work in the area as a result of those changes announced through the budget. I ask the Minister for Health and Ageing to recognise the unique situation that the Sunshine Coast finds itself in; that is, it is too regional to attract doctors who wish to practise in a metropolitan area and it is too metropolitan to offer incentives to doctors wishing to work in a regional or rural area. I ask the minister to reverse the classification system so that we can deal better with our doctor shortages. I fear that it may be the case that doctors actually decide to leave the area to relocate in ‘greener pastures', as any advantages that were previously to be gained by basing themselves professionally in what is a regional area have been struck out as a result of the government's underhanded budget red pen. The greener pastures for these doctors may well be in Brisbane or, ironically, in areas more remote than the coastal regions of the Sunshine Coast. This may prove to be an advantage for areas like Beerwah, Landsborough, Maleny, Woodford and Kilcoy, which are still classified as rural and therefore have additional incentives available to local doctors. However, the major population areas along the coastal strip will be struggling. Come 1 July, and with the introduction of the Australian Standard Geographical Classification: Remoteness Areas system for classifying health regions, the Sunshine Coast will be treated the same as the capital city of Brisbane. This change in turn means that doctors who would in the past have come to the region to work because of additional government benefits-which aim to ensure health professionals and adequate services are available in regional and rural areaswill no longer be eligible for allowances and subsidies such as the remote area incentives. Despite the loss of these incentives, young doctors will theoretically be able to secure a similar income whether located in this part of regional Queensland or in Brisbane. Gone is the incentive for doctors to practise away from Brisbane in the regional area of the Sunshine Coast. It is my understanding that the Sunshine Coast is one of only two areas in Australiathe other being Gawler, north of Adelaidethat have had the health district status changed to ‘metropolitan' as a result of the budget. The difference between Gawler and the Sunshine Coast is that Gawler is able to employ overseas trained doctors but we are not, due to our classification as a District Workforce Shortage. I am sure this situation is an unintended consequence. I am positive that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer did not intend to disadvantage the area from which they originated. This is, in my view, a bureaucratic mistake and I do call on the minister for health, the Prime Minister, also the Treasurer and, for that matter, the Minister for Ageing, who is from Nambour on the Sunshine Coast, to look at this matter again to make sure that people on the Sunshine Coast are treated with equity and are treated as people who reside in a regional area. We have desperate doctor shortages and yet this unintended change by the government mistreats our area terribly. (Time expired) Flyn Electorate: Roads",112
199,Mr TREVOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Today during question time. I asked a question of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. I asked the minister to outline how the government has expanded its Black Spot Program as part of the economic stimulus plan. I also asked how this increased funding was received by local members and the community. My government, following on from earlier announcements, made significant announcements as to my electorate of Flynn under the economic stimulus plan for black spot funding. These announcements were opposed by the opposition. Here are some of the announcements they opposed. They opposed $100,000 in funding to improve safety at the intersection of Hampton Drive and Langton Street in Tannum Sands. This intersection is an extremely busy one, especially around school drop-off and pick-up times at St Francis School. Unfortunately, it has also been quite a dangerous intersection over the years, with many members of the community of reporting that something needed to be done to improve safety and the flow of traffic. We have listened to their calls. The funding will be used to modify the signals and incorporate right-hand arrows at the intersection as well as to resurface and re-mark lines to improve motorists' and pedestrians' safety. They also opposed a further $937,000 in black spot funding, including $702,000 to widen the existing floodway to eight metres at seven locations throughout the Muttaburra-Aramac road section near Aramac. They opposed funding for two black spots in Winton. They also opposed a single-lane roundabout at the Falcon Street, Duck Street and Wompoo Road intersection in Longreach. They also opposed funding for two notorious road black spots near Thangool. Some $200,000 will be spent by my government to improve the intersection of the Burnett Highway and Blackmans Yard Road and a further $150,000 will be spent to improve the Burnett Highway near Thangool. In addition to those, they opposed a $1 million announcement to improve a notorious road black spot near Comet. That $1 million will be spent by my government to improve the intersection of Comet River Road and the Capricorn Highway to make this road safer not only for local residents but also for the high volume of traffic that passes through the intersection. The upgraded intersection will include the construction of a U-turn facility as well as an acceleration lane. The $1 million allocated for this intersection is part of $2.2 million in funding allocated to fix 13 black spots, all of which the coalition opposed, throughout the Flynn electorate. These black spot funding announcements have been well received by my community of Flynn. Apart from the safety aspect, Flynn residents are finally seeing their fair share of funding coming from Canberra after being abandoned by the previous government for 10 long years. Treating the people of Flynn with contempt, I believe, lost the coalition the seat. I know the coalition are sour about it, but nothing has changed. After shortchanging the electorate for 10 long years and paying at the ballot box at the last election for doing so, they have only themselves to blame. They continue to oppose important announcements for my community of Flynn, just as they did for 10 years prior to losing the seat to Labor. The people of the electorate of Flynn are a wake-up to them. Again, they will pay dearly at the ballot box if they continue to oppose our measures. I am proud of what my government is doing for the people of Flynn. I am proud to be part of a government that is looking after their health and also their safety while protecting their jobs and putting food on people's tables",113

Mrs Moylan to move: That the House: (1) notes: (a) that the Area Consultative Committees (ACCs) were first formed by the Hawke Labor Government as regional advisory bodies to Federal Parliament; (b) the Howard Government gave them real purpose by restructuring their activities to act as a ‘shop front' to assist regional communities through the process of applying for Commonwealth government grants; (c) the ACCs had an advisory role in regards to community benefits and assessed the viability of proposed projects; (d) there were 54 ACCs Australia-wide and they were not-for-profit incorporated bodies under the relevant State associations incorporation Acts, operating with around $300,000 per ACC of operational funding from the former Federal government; (e) the Boards are voluntary with a ministerially appointed Chairman and Deputy Chairman; and (f) that by contrast to Regional Australia's loss of national resources and control over development, the Government has established a Better Cities unit in Sydney; (2) condemns the Government for: (a) its decision to eliminate ACCs; (b) its lack of commitment to locally generated initiatives through the ACCs; (c) the loss of about 150 jobs around the nation; (d) its failure to facilitate a seamless transition of staff to the new State based bodies despite an assurance from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, earlier last year; (e) its failure to value and recognise the volunteer effort, including the unpaid skills and abilities of community members; (f) its lack of leadership and clarity of decision making in the handling of the transition process; (g) the disingenuous way the Minister has treated the chairmen and executive officers of ACCs over the past 18 months; and (h) being willing to pass to the Government of Western Australia the total operational funding for ACCs in that State without any process of transparent accountability; (3) recognises: (a) the tremendous work carried out by the ACCs and the important role they played in business development and job creation in regional and rural Australia; (b) the work carried out by the executive officers, staff and the Board chairmen and the voluntary contribution by members of the board; (c) the value of the decentralised nature of the ACCs and the capacity, therefore, to consider the needs and interests of local communities and local areas in rural and regional Australia; and (d) through community effort, the relatively small amount of funding of $300,000 granted to each of the ACCs was multiplied many times due to the voluntary effort by the committees, local governments and members of the community; and (4) calls on the Government to: (a) reconsider its decision to ignore staff of the ACCs and take steps to re-locate them in the new arrangements; and (b) recognise and acknowledge the detrimental effect the current Government policy is likely to have on the development and job creation capacity and the fair dispersal of funding for projects across the regions. Ms Parke to move: That the House: (1) expresses its concern about the grave humanitarian situation of the Tamil peoples of Sri Lanka, many of whom are presently detained in camps following the recent conflict in Sri Lanka; (2) calls upon the Sri Lankan Government: (a) to allow full access to United Nations and other humanitarian agencies to the camps to provide all necessary aid; and (b) to agree to an independent international investigation into war crimes alleged to have been committed by both parties during the recent conflict in Sri Lanka; and (3) expresses its hope that Sri Lanka can move forward from this difficult period in peace and with full respect for the human rights of all its peoples.",114
