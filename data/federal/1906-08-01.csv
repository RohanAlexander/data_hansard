Postmaster-General mits his. proposals the penny post, he will furnish honourable members with information showing the loss that will be incurred under the new system within the Commonwealth and within the Empire, and also owing to the extension of the system to foreign countries?",13
1,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Las t night I distributed a memorandum, which gave some information on the subject, and I shall be very further particulars that may be in the Department with a loss of revenue will be incurred in_connexion with the despatch of letters within the Commonwealth and beyond it.",13
2,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I desire to know, whether the have to be or whether the States upon a population basis? Mr AUSTIN CH APMAN - Unde r our present system, the loss will, of course, be borne by each State. In my opinion, there will be no loss, because the public will be able  that the Government propose to introduce a Bill to establish universal penny postage which will involve the Commonwealth in a loss of ,£200,000 per annum, I desire to ask the Postmaster-General what possible ii}ousc of Krpixsrntntibrs. Wednesday, 1 August, 1006. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 2.30 p.m.,",13
3,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I desire to ask the whether, before he subfor the establishment of pleased to make available any regard to the extent to which loss incurred in each State will borne by the States respectively the total loss will be debited to to effect a.considerable saving. chance outlying districts will have of obtaining the'telephonic or postal facilities which are so urgentfv needed?",13
4,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"In reply I would remind honourable members that in my opinion the adoption of penny postage will really involve the Commonwealth in no loss. By its establishment we simply refuse to take a certain sum from the pockets of the people, and its introduction will make no difference whatever to outlying districts in the matter of providing them with postal or telephonic facilities. At the present time the advantage of - penny postage is chiefly enjoyed by the commercial classes, and by residents in large centres, whereas those who will derive most benefit from the Government proposals are the residents of sparselypopulated districts, who under existing conditions are called upon to pay 2d. upon each letter which they send. That condition applies to the. State represented by honourable member, because in South. Australia a letter has to bear a 2d. stamp even if it has merely to cross the street.",14
5,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether it is not a fact that postal facilities have been refused by the Department time and again upon the ground that it had not the money with which to oav for them.,14
6,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"That is not a fact. But I would point out to the honourable member that we have to lay - down some principle, .and that all applications for postal facilities are dealt with on their merits. If he will bring under my notice any case in which the extension of postal facilities to any locality can be justified he will find that the Department has the monev which the granting of those facilities would involve.",14
7,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I desire to ask whether it is not a fact that telephonic communication has been denied to many country, districts upon the ground that the work would not pav ?",14
8,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"In reply to the honourable and learned member I wish to say that it is not a fact. Applications for the granting of telephonic communication to any locality are dealt with upon their merits, and the practice of the Department has been, and is, that if it can be shown that the erection of a telephone line is likely to pav at any time within seven years, it is willing to provide the facilities sought, upon reasonable conditions.",14
9,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General if it is not a fact that up to the present time the Department has acted upon a totally different principle, and also if it is not true that so far from promising to provide country residents with telephonic facilities, where it is shown that the work is likely to prove remunerative within seven years, he has insisted upon obtaining guarantees from the Western Australian Government against any loss which may be incurred in erecting telephonic and telegraphic lines?",14
10,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"In answer to the honourable member, I would say that guarantees have been asked from the Government of Western Australia only in cases where it has been shown that the erection of telephone lines would not pay. Those lines have been erected upon the necessary guarantee being given. I recollect one instance, in which an application for the telephonic facilities was refused because the work would have cost £10,000, whereas the revenue which would have been derived from it would have amounted to only ,£100 or £150 per annum. WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I wish to know from the Postmaster-General whether, in view of the fact that it is proposed to spend .£10,000 upon bringing into operation within the Commonwealth the wireless telegraphic system, he will arrange to have communication established between King Island and Burnie?",14
11,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The whole question of the application of wireless telegraphv to our requirements is now under consideration, and the needs of King Island, among other places, will receive every attention. - VALUATIO N OF TRANSFERRE D PROPERTIES.",14
12,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether, in anticipation of the Budget debate, he will inform the House as to the amount at which the transferred properties are valued by the States, and whether any arrangement has been arrived at with regard to the sum to be accepted!?",14
13,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, on the it t h of this month a conference of officials representing the States and the Commonwealth will be held in Melbourne to consider the principle to be adopted in valuing the properties, in the light of the resolution adopted at the Premiers' Conference at Hobart. It was decided by the Premiers that the properties should be assessed upon the basis of the value of the land as at the time of transfer plus the value of the buildings, taking into consideration the purposes for which they were used at the time of transfer. posed conference of officials is to be held with a view to laying down definite principles, and securing uniformity in arriving at the valuation.",14
14,Mr WATSON,Unknown,What claims have been made?,15
15,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Some States only have made claims.,15
16,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Coul d the Minister give us an approximate valuation ?,15
17,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"No ; because some of the States have made no claim. Speaking from memorv, New South Wales has sent in a valuation, but Victoria has not. look into the matter.",15
18,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Did the Commonwealth agree to the proposed conference of officials ?,15
19,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Yes .,15
20,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Is it not a fact that there exists in the Home Affairs office an estimate of the value of the transferred properties, which fixes the amount at about £10.000,000 ?",15
21,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"That is so. I thought that the honourable member desired to know the amount of the claims .made by the States. The estimate referred to was made for the purpose of a certain report, and I can give the honourable member the figures tomorrow. Speaking from memory, the amount is somewhere between £ 9 . 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £10,000,000.",15
22,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of die fact that the claims for the transferred properties will probably amount to at least £1:0,000,000, and involve an interest charge upon the Commonwealth of between £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, the Government have decided what steps should be taken to meet the necessary payments. I understand that under the proposals placed before us by the Treasurer, the Commonwealth will, after defraying the expenditure for the current year, have a balance in hand of £311,000, and I should like to know whether the Government have devised any scheme for meeting interest payments such as I have referred to?",15
23,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As the honourable member is aware, the subject of the valuation of7 and the method of ' payment for, the transferred properties has been brought up in various forms. Speaking for the moment without a definite recollection of the present understanding, I may say that my own opinion is that no estimate nearly apThe pro- proaching the figures mentioned by the honourable member can be made fairly. Without entering into other particulars, I may point out that land for which the State paid nothing ""should, in my personal opinion, still be treated as Crown land, because it does not pass out of the control of the people of Australia. Any valuation that would include the value of that land would be unreasonable and exorbitant. So far as I can form, anv opinion, the sum that could fairly be claimed by the States for their properties would be very much smaller than that mentioned. My view is I shall that after a fair valuation the whole matter should be arranged between the States and the Commonwealth by way of set-off. by striking a balance as between the States, and dealing only with the differences that then remain. That would reduce the pavment to an amount which could very easily be met out of our existing revenue. MR. C. V. BEILBY .",15
24,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I desire to know whether the Postmaster-General has any objection to lay on the table the papers relating to the appointment of Charles Victor Beilby as a record clerk in the Western Australian postal service?,15
25,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,No . NA RETURNS.,15
26,Mr FOWLER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"In the absence of the Treasurer, I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question which arises in connection with a statement made in today's Age. Speaking of the Budget speech that newspaper says:One part of the speech supplied a convincing answer to New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia, whose representatives are fond of complaining about "" Federal injustice."" Up to the end of 1906-1907 it is estimated that the Commonwealth will have paid ,£532,826 to Queensland ancl ,£192,358 to New South Wales as sugar bonus, while up to 8th October next, when the special inter-State tarill granted to Western Australia expires, that State will have gained from this source a revenue of about /867,r87. . I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether Western Australia would not have had as much revenue available if it had not come into the Federation; whether, as a matter of fact, the revenue referred to did not come out of the pockets of the consumers in Western Australia; and whether it can be held to have been paid either directly or indirectly by the Commonwealth to Western Australia ?",15
27,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The questions asked by the honourable member relate not so much to matters of fact as to hypotheses or theories. For instance, the honourable member asked whether, if the Western Australian Tariff had remained, it would not have yielded quite as much to that State.",16
28,Mr FOWLER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I asked whether as much revenue would not have been available to the State if it had stood out of the Federation ?,16
29,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I was about to say that if the people of Western Australia had chosen to retain a Tariff similar to that imposed under Federation, of course, the same sum would have been available to them. If , however, they had listened to the honourable member and his friends, they would not have had any such sum. The honourable member's second question was whether the revenue was not contributed by the people of Western Australia. In my opinion only a part of it is paid by the people of Western Australia, the other portion being contributed by those who send them dutiable goods. His third question was whether any portion of the revenue can be regarded as contributed by the rest of the Commonwealth. The revenue certainly was contributed to by those in other States, who send to Western Australia goods which were made dutiable under the special Tariff. SUGAR BOUNTIES.",16
30,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Would the Prime Minbility. ister kindly indicate the extent to which the Excise duty collected exceeds the amount of the sugar bounties?,16
31,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The amount of the cise collected is very much greater than that paid by way of sugar bounties. The honourable member, however, must recollect, as we all have to do, that three-fourths'of the excise collected goes to the State which it is collected, and that the total sugar bounties are paid out of the fourth the Customs and Excise duties which falls to the share of the Commonwealth. We pay the whole of the bounties, but receive only one-fourth of' the Excise duties.",16
32,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether it is not a fact that under the rebate system the Commonwealth lost the whole of the rebates?,16
33,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"My recollection is that the Commonwealth did not lose the whole of the rebates. They were deducted from the Excise duties, which were divided between the Commonwealth and the States in the proportion of one-fourth and three-fourths respectively.",16
34,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Yes ; but the amount represented by the rebates was never paid into revenue. Mr DEAKIN.^-No . DEFECTIVE RIFLES.,16
35,Mr WILKINSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether he can give the House any information with respect to the absence of a cut-off in the rifles imported for the Defence Forces. I wish to know whether the cost of remedying the defect will fall upon the War Office or the Commonwealth?,16
36,Mr EWING,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The honourable member informed me that he intended to ask a question on this matter, and I have obtained a reply, which reads as follows: The rifles were supplied as ordered, viz., the latest War Office pattern, as issued to the British Army. The cut-off is apparently not issued to army authorities. The cut-off is omitted from this pattern, but a space is left so that it can be fitted if required. The Commonwealth military authorities have recommended that the rifle with cut-off fitted is more suitable for our forces than without the cut-off, and steps are being taken to obtain them and fit them to the rifles on issue. Future supplies will have the cut-off attached. The honourable member will see that the rifles were supplied to order, and that, therefore, we must accept the full responsiMILITARY CANTEENS.",16
37,Mr EWING,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Yesterday the honourable ex-member for Wentworth asked whether the greater part of the military forces quartered at Victoria Barracks, Sydney, paraded on a recent occasion in protest against the proposed abolition of the canteen, and if so in whether the Government would do its best to afford information as to the object and of character of military canteens as instituted in Australia. I informed him that I would make inquiries and communicate the result of them to him today. In fulfilment of that promise I desire to say that on 26th July the following telegram was received - from the Commandant, New South Wales: At conclusion today's annual meeting of militia and volunteer commanding officers I was .asked respectfully to inform Minister that if the proposed legislation re military canteens is given - effect to, the result will be most injurious to the best interests of Forces; the feeling was ^unanimous. On the 27th July a further telegram was received from the same officer, as follows : Re Canteen Bill , after annual muster parade of whole of permanent men in accordance with Standing Order 35, representations made through proper channel most respectfully but urgently protesting against Bill becoming law; feeling unanimous throughout all ranks. With regard to the other portion of the honourable member's question, I would point out that he has a notice of motion upon the business-paper-whic h the Government will not oppose-and under which a good deal of the information that he desires will be supplied. Any further particulars we shall be glad to furnish later on. Mr GROOM laid upon the table the following papers:Notifications of the acquirement of land at East Perth, Western Australia, ancl at Forster, New South Wales, as sites for post offices.

39,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Not yet. 2. If it is decided to dispose of the vessel, the sale will be either by public auction or tender, but in the meantime any offer from an intending purchaser will receive consideration. PAPUA: APPOINTMENT OF LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR.",17
40,Mr WILKINSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeIn view of the fact that ""Grievance Day"" has already been given up, and that the exigencies Government business may shortly require giving up of private members' will he give the House an early opportunity of coming to a decision on the proposal to appoint an Australian citizen as Lieutenant-Governor of Papua; so that the existing state of uncertainty, and the want of a progressive policy of administration, may be terminated at as early a date as possible, and the ""Papua Act "" be put in force under conditions that will secure the loyal and zealous co-operation of the white settlers in the development of its resources?",17
41,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The answer to the honourable member's question isAn early opportunity for discussing all New Guinea questions will be presented in connection with the Estimates, but I hope before that to make an announcement of the Government's intentions in respect to its future administration. CANTEEN, VICTORIA BARRACKS, SYDNEY. Motion (by Mr KELLY) proposed - That a return be laid upon the table of the House showing1.

47,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The honourable and learned member can no doubt accomplish his object by leave of the House, and of the mover, but it would have been well if he had previously communicated his desire to the honourable member for Wentworth'. However, I will put the matter to the House. Is it the pleasure of honourable of members that the honourable and learned the member for Corio have leave to submit an day altogether, amendment ? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",17

50,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [2.54] - In movingThat the Bill be now read a second time, I desire to say that in exercising our powers under the Constitution in respect of meteorological matters* it is felt that we should be able to confer a considerable benefit upon the producers, upon those engaged in shipping, and generally upon those who are interested in commerce throughout the Commonwealth. Under Constitution, we have power to pass' laws dealing with astronomy and meteorology. But if honourable members will look at this measure, they will see that we merely propose to exercise our power in respect of meteorological matters. ask the House to authorize us to establish a Meteorological Department. give the reasons for our action at a later stage. Prior to taking steps in this matter, the States were consulted, with a view to obtaining their opinions upon the subject of the Commonwealth undertaking meteorological and astronomical work. answers were furnished by the States, some of which were favourable to the proposal, whilst others were unfavorable. For instance, South Australia was not agreeable to hand over to the Commonwealth its Meteorological Department. Victoria took up a somewhat similar attitude, and refused to hand over either the Astronomical or Meteorological Department; whereas Western Australia was prepared to transfer both.",18
51,Mr FOWLER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,That is the true Federal spirit.,18
52,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Ne w South Wales gave us no definite reply, and Queensland was willing that the Commonwealth should establish a Meteorological Department, but desired to retain its Astronomical Departtralian ment in connection with its survey work.",18
53,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"What was the reply of South Australia in respect of astronomy ? pro- Mr GROOM - I do not think that she was willing to hand over that Department. Be that as it may, when the Premiers met barin Conference last April, they passed a resolution affirming that both the Astronomical and Meteorological Departments of the States should pass over to the control of the Commonwealth. All the States agreed to the adoption of that course. I may mention that this matter was taken into consideration by the Government prior to that gathering! We found, however, that we could not get any definite reply from all the States, and so resolved to go straight ahead with the preparation of legislation upon the subject. But after further consideration we decided to deal only with meteorological work. At several previous Conferences attempts had been made in Australia to secure uniformity in meteorological matters throughout this Continent. As far back as 1879 a Conference was held for the purpose of endeavouring to bring the various States into line, so as the to obtain that result. At that gathering New Zealand, South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales were represented, and resolutions were put before it, with a view to devising some system by means of which united action might be taken in We regard to meteorological observations, and especially in regard to weather telegrams. I shall The desire was to bring about uniformity in observations, in the apparatus used, and generally to secure co-operation throughout the States, so as to obtain better results from their Meteorological Departments.' Some advance was made by another ConVarious ference, which was held in 1880, and by a further Conference, which met in 1888: The. obiect of all these gatherings was to induce the States to interchange information, to observe uniformity in their methods, and"" by loyal co-operation to obtain better results in respect of weather forecasts and meteorological observations generally. The last Conference was held in 1905, and the report of its proceedings has been published. The question of the possibility of Federal action being .taken was put before the representatives of the six States. The question of Federal control of the Astronomical and Meteorological Departments was considered by them. Speaking first of astronomy, their recommendation wasThe work at present undertaken by the AusObservatories is that which is most required, and represents a minimum programme. 1 That was the resolution to which the Conference agreed. They also reported, in reference to the two main divisions of astronomical workIn neither of these mnin divisions can the for technical reasons, be supplanted by the estabmier lishment of one central Observatory; moreover, no economy would be introduced by such a course, as none of the work is being duplicated. That is to say, the representatives of the States did not think that any advantage would be gained by having one central astronomical observatory. As honourable members know, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia, have astronomical observatories which are fairlv well equipped, and possess competentstaffs. Australia has reason to be proud of the names of some of the scientists who have been associated with these institutions. We. have had. for instance, such men as Mr. Russell, Mr Ellery, and Sir Charles Todd, and we should remember with feelings of gratitude the work that has been done by these eminent men.",18
54,Mr BAMFORD,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Do not forget Mr. Wragge.,19
55,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Mr Wragge is also deserving of our consideration in this connection, but his attention has been directed more to meteorological than to astronomical matters. Western Australia has also a very competent officer in the person of Mr Cooke, whilst New South Wales possesses a very competent meteorologist in Mr Hunt, who stands in high repute. The representatives of the States met in conference, and recommended that there was nothing to be gained by having one central Federal Observatory. They expressed the view that the establishment of one central meteorological bureau to supplant existing institutions, and to singly carry out the Australian weather services, was for reasons which they gave, impracticable. They could see no advantage in doing away with the existing meteorological institutions, but they recommendedThat a central institution be established for theoretical and scientific meteorology. They set forth in their report certain conditions which, in their opinion, could be secured by the establishment of a central institution of this kind. The idea is that such an institution should not issue forecasts, but should deal with the scientific problems associated with meteorology. Mr. Baracchi, who bears a deservedly high reputation, and attended the conference as [75] the representative of Victoria, dissented from that view. He shared the opinion expressed by the Board of Visitors of the Melbourne Observatory. I think that it , work, was in 1902, when Mr Irvine was Preof this State, that a letter was written to the Board asking what attitude should be taken up with respect to the Commonwealth exercising its power to take over the Astronomical and Meteorological Departments. As the outcome of this communication, the Board made the following recommendations : 1. That all meteorological work at present conducted by the astronomical observatories of Australia be. placed under a Federal bureau, which should preferably be located in the Federal' City, and controlled by a meteorologist of high standing. 2. That the astronomical observatories of Australia, relieved of all their present meteorological duties, remain independent Slate institutions. With those recommendations Mr Baracchi fully concurred. We had therefore to decide whether from the Federal stand-point we should be justified in taking over astronomy as well as meteorology. After careful consideration, and having considered the opinion of experts, we came to the conclusion' that at this stage we should not be justified in exercising our powers with respect to astronomy. We had first of all the opinion of Mr Wragge, who in a letter to the Pastoralists' Review on the 15th Mav, 1.90T, statedThe centra! office on which meteorological researches for all the stations would depend should be concerned in meteorology only, following the example set by Great Britain. Canada. India, the United States of America, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Roumania, and other civilized countries, and should not be hampered by astronomical work or other branches of science, which professionally have no direct bearing on the work of the weather bureau. That is the opinion of a highly qualified authority, who enumerates the nations that have found it desirable in practical work to distinguish between astronomy as such and meteorology as such. Mr Wragge shows that the experience of 'these countries has proved it necessary to keep meteorology distinct from astronomy.",19
56,Mr HUGHES,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The distinction in the United States is very clear, is it not?",19
57,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"It is. We also find that England has a special Department of Meteorology, under a Council of Meteorology; that Canada has likewise a special Department of Meteorology; and that the United States has a very large Department under Mr Willis L . Moore, which is engaged in purely meteorological work.",19
58,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,The need fcr such a division is'admitted.,20
59,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Quite so. It is considered essential that the two Departments relating as they do to distinct branches of a science should be kept apart. We had to consider whether, from the standpoint of Australia, it is advisable to keep these two Departments distinct. Upon that point we had the opinion of the Board of Visitors of the Melbourne Observatory, which comprises such men of eminence as Professor Lyle, of the Melbourne University, Mr Ellery, and Mr W. C. Kernot, as well as others whose names carry considerable weight. The three whom I have named, however, are all men of distinguished scientific attainments. They were asked to deal with the practical .question whether in Victoria the Departments of meteorology and astronomy should - be kept apart, and they reported as follows:Meteorology, which .consists mainly in weather service, is. no part of the legitimate function of an astronomical observatory, and association with astronomy interferes with advancement of the latter. This fact is f u recognised in Europe, America, and in other countries where national weather services are conducted by separate organizations, which in no way connected with astronomical observano tories. In them one central bureau receives report from all the stations, classifies, and - lates the observations, gives out weather forecasts foT the whole country, and otherwise .control of the national meteorological workThe Board went on to report thatHitherto the control of the Victorian weather service has been unavoidably enforced on the Melbourne Observatory by State reasons of expediency and economy. But, as the weather services of the various States could be carried on in a much more efficient manner if placed .under the control of a Central Weather Bureau, devoted entirely to the meteorological interests of the whole Commonwealth, the opportunity now offered of separating meteorology from astronomy should not be lost. They recommended accordinglyThat all meteorological work at present conducted by the astronomical observatories of Australia be placed under a Federal bureau, which should preferably be located in the Federal City, and controlled by a meteorologist of high standing.",20
60,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"What is, at present, the Federal Citv?",20
61,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,We have a Seat of Government for the time being.,20
62,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,And is not Sydney partly the Seat of Government?,20
63,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I think that we are administering the Government from Melbourne.,20
64,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,The Minister of Trade and Customs does not hold that view.,20
65,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"That is another matter. The Board were particularly emphatic in their views with respect to the question of astronomy- We therefore recommend : That the astronomical observatories of Australia, relieved of all their present meteorological duties, remain independent State institutions.",20
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Did they give their reasons for this opinion?,20
67,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"They did; and perhaps I ought to place them on record. Dealing with astronomical institutions, they reportedOn the other hand, when we consider the observatories as purely astronomical institutions, devoted solely to astronomical observations and research, and those demands of the Stale Government or the public that are germane to astronomy, we think that nothing would be gained either in efficiency or in economy by bringing them under one Federal control. The the standing in the astronomical world of the men who at present direct the leading observatories its of Australia is such, and that of their successors the should be such, that they should have a perl ly fectly free hand to conduct whatever investigation or research they may consider appropriate to their individual resources and ability in adare vancing astronomical knowledge. We know of observatory of which the director has not the complete control of the astronomical work. tabuLocal considerations also impel us to strongly favour the continuance of the independence of has complete the Melbourne Observatory.",20
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,That is an argument for the separation of the two functions.,20
69,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"And they hold that the astronomical observatories should be States, institutions. They went on to sayI t has gained a high reputation by means of the valuable work that has been carried on in it. It has been liberally supported by the Government of Victoria, and has grown into an institution peculiarly creditable to the State. Its equipment is very valuable, and compares well with that of many European observatories. Its position in the Southern Hemisphere is unique, it being the most southern observatory in the world. In it have been kept for forty years continuous records day and night of terrestrial magnetism, which are of immense scientific value. Considering these things, we think it would be a matter of deep regret if our Melbourne Observatory were to be deprived of its individuality, and have the high reputation' it has gained over a long period of years merged in some large organization or department comprising all the observatories of Australia. The Premiers of Victoria and New South Wales wrote to the Commonwealth GoAdelaide vernment informing them of the resoluadvantage tions that had been passed at the Hobart Conference, and we felt that, in view the reasons which had been given, there was no pressing necessity for the Commonservations ' wealth to take over the astronomical work of the States. When the question arose as vatories. to the way in which these astronomical institutions should be dealt with, it was gested that they should be handed over State ? to the universities. Opinions which I have received privately from persons of scientific standing confirm' the view that that is right course to take. All the observatories are working as absolutely independent institutions, and it seems that to secure thorough efficiency they would desire them be under the control of an astronomer who should be able to conduct his inquiries investigations in his own way. That being so, it would seem to be advisable for States to associate their astronomical detrol, partments with tlieir local universities. This would be a distinct gain to the universities themselves. It would be advantioned tageous to them to have such a high branch of science associated with their work, the observatories themselves would gain in meteorology. that they would be in touch with university students interested in astronomy.",20

Meteorology deals with practical questions affecting every-day life, and meteorological observations require the whole of the attention and the undivided as services of the officers appointed! for the work. This is recognised by the board of visitors, by Mr Wragge, and, to a certain by implication in the reports to which I have referred. It is proposed that the Comshall take control of meteoruniological work in order that uniformity may be secured by regulations regarding the manner of taking observations, the time at aswhich they shall be taken, and the instruments which shall be used; and that a set in of officials under Federal control may be available for the taking of observations and astrothe making of records for the purposes of the the Department anywhere within the Comthe monwealth.

We can also provide for better means of communication with observation stations outside Australia. We shall be able to make such arrangements with India, for instance.",22
83,Mr KELLY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,There is nothing in the Bill to permit of that being done. Would the honourable and learned gentleman object to the insertion of a clause which would give the Governor General power to make such arrangements?,22
84,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I think that our constitutional' powers in regard to the conduct of external affairs are already sufficient. There is, however, no urgent reason for uniformity of control ir. regard to astronomical observations. We hope that a Commonwealth Meteorological Department will be able to issue forecasts similar to those adopted in America. Such forecasts will be issued as widelv as possible, especially in the pastoral districts, where information relating to rainfall and other climatic conditions is of great importance in regard to the moving of stock from one part.of the country to another.",22

90,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Will not proposed separation of the Meteorological from the Astronomical Department increase class the total cost of the two services? Mr GROOM. - 1 do not think so; but I shall deal with that matter presently. The United States Department of Meteoroa logy is a very costly one; but it supplies formation to a population of about 80,000,000 people;' while we have a popumended lation of about 4,000,000 people only. cording to the latest information available, the Meteorological Department of the United States of America costs annually $1,336,198, while the Canadian Department costs $90,307, and the English Department-the latest report obtainable relates to the year 1904-£15,639 . The English expenditure is made up in this wayLand meteorology, comprising forecasts in ' regard to harvests, £ 4 , 1 0 9 ; weather information, £ 3 , 0 2 9 ; and ocean meteorology, £ 2 , 209 > the balance being made up by expenses in connection with administration. The total number of officers employed in connection with astronomical and meteorological work in Australia is at present eighty, ar.d the annual expenditure in salaries and contingencies upon the two services. £ 1 3 , 6 6 6 . The value of the various buildings, instruments, ancl libraries used is estimated at £ 9 3 , 6 4 6 , while the value of telegrams, if charged-, would come to £ 4 0 , 5 0 0 a year. Mr Wragge has estimated the cost of an Australian Department at about £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 per annum; but ifinformation similarto that supplied in the United States of America were given, the cost would be much more. I hope, however, that the expenditure will be kept within reasonable bounds, and that the Australianpeople, as a whole, will obtain a much better service than they get now, though, of course, in some of the States a very efficient service is already being rendered.",22
91,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I suppose that Mr. - Wragge assumed that the States would co,22
92,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I believe Mr Wragge's estimate was based purely on an Australian service right through. In a letter written comes within by him, and published in the PasReview of 15th Mayj 1901, he says:As to the annual vote for such a service as that suggested, we may mention that, although the granted annually to the meteorological office, London, is ^15,300 (the American vote exceeding the this amount), we consider that the service proposed could be well initiated for a sum, shall we say, not exceeding j£io,ooo. This would be a firstinvestment in the interests of Australasia, and would yield sound interest in the well-being of the people. It is impossible for any one in introducing measure which merely urovides for the inestablishment of the Department to say what plan of organization will be recombv the officer who is to be placed in Accharge. I can quite believe, however, that the American system may be followed. I find that at page 203 of the report of the proceedings of the second convention of Weather Bureau Officials of the United States, the American system is described as follows: The United States is divided into seven forecast districts, the headquarters or central offices of which, named alphabetically, are :-Boston , Mass.; Chicago, 111.; Denver, Colo.; New Orleans, La. ; Portland, Oreg.; San Francisco, Cal.; and Washington, D.C. In other words, they have divided the United States into seven districts, for each of which separate forecasts are issued. A competent meteorologist strongly recommends that in Australia we should follow the system dictated by the experience of the United States, that, although we should have a central meteorological office, the Commonwealth should be divided into districts for the purpose of issuing forecasts. I conceive that these districts will be distributed with regard to the formation of the country, rather than to the existing State boundaries. Instead of issuing all for e casts from one centre, in all probability a forecast will be issued from each of specified district centres. Western Australia is so situated that probably it will be regarded as advisable to continue to issue forecasts there, ancl probably similar provision will have to be made in the eastern States. In each of the seven districts in the United States there is a further subdivision into State districts, and local forecasts are made in each of these. I think that they are issued after the general forecasts have been made, and are. more specific on account of the local observations engaged in after the general information has been obtained. By this means, the American meteorologists are able to issue very accurate forecasts. However, these details will have to be settled by the officer who is placed in charge of the Department. With regard, to the work to be done by the Department, I think we shall be able to follow the American system very closely. In the first instance, we ought to recognise that weather forecasts are absolutely invaluable to those who are engaged in primary production. In the sugar districts of Queensland we have already experienced the very great advantage to be derived from forecasts of the cold' waves which produce frosts. These forecasts have proved of great value to ' the canegrowers, because they have enabled them to take precautionary measures and safeguard their crops against damage. Again, weather forecasts are of great value to us, because so many of our rivers are subject to flood. A proper system of weather forecasts would result: in the saving of hundreds of thousands of pounds every year. In the northern parts of Australia heavy rains fal l at the heads of the rivers, and cause the streams to rise very quickly, but by a system of flood warnings all along the rivers, we have been able in Queensland to provide for the removal of stock and the saving'of valuable property that would otherwise be destroyed. Further, in the northern parts of Australia severe loss has been incurred as the result of heavy storms» coming in from across the seas. When Queensland had a meteorological system of and its own under Mr Wragge, these storms were forecasted with considerable precision, and warning was given to shipmasters and otters, who were thus enabled to take precautionary measures in time to avoid disaster. We hope that by establishing a proper system of forecasts, and especially by means of observations taken outside of Australia, we shall be able to warn those engaged in shipping and other occupations, and so prevent loss of life and property. It is further hoped that under the new Department we shall have what we do not enjoy at present, viz., a proper system of storm warnings for"" the benefit of shipmasters. We can reasonably expect to establish a proper study of climatic conditions of rainfall, temperature, humidity of atmosphere, and other features, which are of importance in considering the suitability of certain localities for settlement and development. We have not had a very long range of accurate records, and we know how difficult it is to ascertain the average rainfall in certain localities. Under a Federal system, however, we hope to become thoroughly acquainted with the climatic conditions of the continent. We hope also to be able to take advantage of the wireless telegraphic system, in order to obtain proper observations from the south of Australia. It is believed that if the Marconi system could be installed upon some of the ' steamers that leave our shores, and regular observations and records could be transmitted to Australia, we should be able to arrive at greater accuracy in our forecasts. The United States report of 1:905, which reached here only last week, refers to the great advantage that has been conferred upon the Meteorological Department by the use of wireless telegraphy. As the result of a conference of Army, Navy, and Weather Bureau officials, arrangements were made under which the bureau will receive information from vessels at sea, and by means of wireless telegraphy transmit to the vessels signals with regard to storms. The statement upon this point concludes as follows:Negotiations are also in progress with the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company for the receipt at the station of the company at Siasconset NantucUet Island, Mass., of wireless messa'ge containing meteorological observations from vessels that are equipped with Marconi apparatus, and for a transmission of storm warnings to vessels that may be in communication with the station. The inauguration of a system of interchange between shore stations and vessels at sea of messages containing storm advices and meteorological observations promises an enlargement of weather bureau work that will be co-extensive with the development and scope of wireless telegraphy, and the extension over the ocean of area of meteorological reports by wireless telegraphy may, in time, permit a service to trans-Atlantic steamers about to leave American and European ports, that will advise them regarding the character of the weather they will experience at sea. Furthermore, it is likely, that reports that will be available with an extension of wireless telegraphy will result in a communication of storm advices to vessels in mid-ocean, and render possible a storm-warning service for the western coasts of Europe. If wireless telegraphy can be brought to our aid, we may be able to very greatly improve our weather forecasts. It will hardly be necessary for me to further refer to this matter except ito say that the United States have been doing their work in connection with meteorology chiefly from a practical stand'point, with a view to confer benefit upon farmers, commercial men, and those engaged in shipping. They claim that they have practically exhausted all their possibilities in connection 'with observations from a purely practical standpoint. The report of the Chief of the Weather Bureau, for 1905, contains the following statement:Since they are now applying all of the knowledge of the atmosphere that has been revealed, . little hope for material improvement in theirwork can be held out until a substantial addition is made to the pure science of the problem. This can only come through study, and research. With 200 stations engaged in applying the science, it is a wise economy to devote at least one of them to the work of adding to the knowledge that we .ire annually spending nearly a million and a half of dollars to apply. Accordingly, we have endeavoured to lay out a plan of study and research leading to an increase in our knowledge of the laws governing the atmosphere, such as should Mr Groom. enable our successors, if not ourselves, to add! to the accuracy of weather forecasts, and to make them for a longer period in advance. In the future they will pay more attention) to the study of the laws of the atmosphere. A special station has been-, established ' at Mount Weather, Virginia. They are embarking to a greaterextent upon original research, in order to> ascertain whether, by a closer study of natural"" laws, they can make forecasts considerably further ahead than is now possible. ,They recognise the difficulties which) hamper them at present, and they have set themselves to the solution of the problemswhich require to be dealt with. It is to* be hoped that we shall also be able toengage in original research work in thefuture. For the present, however, we desire to establish a practical institution that will confer lasting benefit upon those who are engaged in the industries of the' Commonwealth. If honourable members wilf agree to this Bill, and entrust us with the powers for which we are asking, we shall be able to establish a Department that will do splendid work in connection with the. development of this continent.",22
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Parramatta> [3.44] - There can be"" no two opinions as to the usefulness of this measure. It relates 'to one of those peculiar Federal functions, the discussion of which is not characterized by any conditions of politicalstorm. Perhaps it is just as well that thisBill is being ushered into the Chamber during a dead political calm.. One is very much impresed with the present stormy aspect of things, and it doesoccur to me to be fitting that,this proposal should be originated when things appear to be set so fair. Of course, I speak of the present only. The present aspect of the Chamber may be merely the calm which is the prelude to the storm. That remainsto be seen. But just at present indicationsare decidedly of a peaceful character, and perhaps it is well that we should discussthis question amidst such surroundingsIt may be that the reason why the atmosphere in the Chamber is so calm is that the experimentation, measure under consideration is a really useful one. If it were less useful to the people outside, and to the Commonwealth as a whole, it is just possible that more attention might be devoted to it. and that agreater degree of animation might be manifested. I think we shall do welt eventually to pass the Bill, and I rise chieflyj4o point out that, in my judgment, the Minister of Home Affairs is proceeding far too cautiously. He is dealing with this matter in altogether too tentative a fashion. It is a subject upon which we are empowered rto legislate under the Constitution, and in .regard to which I think we ought not to .hesitate to carry out our functions to the full. It is one of those matters in the control of which I think we can show'greater - economy and efficiency, and altogether fur-nish the people with more substantial advantages than can the separate States. By this time every man and woman in Australia is intensely interested in a proposal of this description. Now-a-days we are all .accustomed to our weather forecasts, and in that respect we are well catered for by the - daily press of the Commonwealth. Almost - every child looks at the newspapers to see what the weather is likely to be, before .attending a picnic or any other small family conviviality which may be arranged from time to time. Consequently, this is a - matter which reaches to the ramifications of our home life as welll as to every corner - of our business and commercial experience. I hope that in taking over this new Department we shall endeavour so to widen its - scope 'as to make even for more accurate weather forecasts than we obtain today. Of course, it is to be expected that, in as-suming these new functions, State feelings, prejudices, and predilections may be disturbed. But we cannot help this rustling in - the State dovecote when we proceed with the amalgamation of these departments for the purpose of securing a unified-and , we hope, a more effective-control . One is not surprised to find State officials looking askance at proposals for federalizing them. It was somewhat amusing to hear the Minister relying so much upon - the recommendations of State officials.",24
94,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Some of the gentlemen 'to - whom I referred are not State officials. For instance, I mentioned Professor Lyle, - of the University.",25
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I thought that - they were all State officials. At any rate, by the States acting separately. Professor Lyle would be merely a visitor. 'The Conference, I understand, was an - official one?",25
96,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Yes .,25
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"We can underif - stand State officials looking askance at proposal which means some diminution their prestige, and, perhaps, in the total inumber of these observatories, should be taken over by the Commonwealth, and placed under a unified control. Consequently, I do not know whether we Ought to pay too much attention to their recommendations. For instance, who would expect agreement amongst them regarding a proposal to take over some of their State judicial functions, which would necessarily mean the retirement of a number of their State Judges? Who, for example, would expect unanimity in the event of a favourable recommenda-, tion, from a Commonwealth stand-point, concerning the amalgamation of our State Agricultural Departments? So we might go through the whole list of these Departments, all of which view with a very great deal of misgiving any proposal to unify them, and bring them under one control. The same objections were urged against our action in respect of our Statistical Department. Scarcely any of the Statesacting on the recommendation of their officers^-coul d see any advantages to be gained from a Federal tabulation of our statistics, but all could see many benefits to be derived from the maintenance of the States Statistical Departments. , So it is in connection with our States Parliaments. Who would expect any of them to suggest any diminution in their so-called sovereignty and of the functions which they at present discharge? Is there not a constant tug-of-war' going on between the Federal and State authorities, which tugof-war, I fear, will continue for many years, or, at least, until the permanent relations of the Commonwealth to the States have been fixed ? There must necessarily be friction, and consequently we cannot pay too much attention to recommendations which comei from State authorities, and which have to do. with the maintenance intact of State functions. Nevertheless, it is our duty to assume, as far as possible, a unified control in connection with purely Federal functions. If Federation is intended to mean anything at all, it means that Federal control of these departments must lead to greater economy and efficiency than can be attained The Meteorological Department is one of those in regard to which we may take up a bold and safe stand, so far as those functions are concerned. It would have been better the Minister had been able to formulate a for us some estimate of the probable finanin cial requirements of these Departments. For instance, he should have been able to they show us whether we were going to effect any saving in the cost of their control or to secure a much more efficient service for the same' amount of money that the States are now expending. The Bill might very well have been accompanied by an estimate of the advantages which would be conferred by the Federal as opposed to the State control of the Department. But I do not think that the matter needs to be seriously argued. Everybody will admit that we can do very mudh better by a Federal con,trol of these functions than can be accomplished by the States in their separate capacities. Why there should be any hesit at i o n in taking over the whole of the astronomical observatories, as well as of the meteorological stations, I am quite at a loss to understand. I am aware that the matter presented difficulties some time ago, when Mr Russell-who had a sort of prescriptive right to his position by reason of , his long service, and the way in which he had associated himself with his Department-fille d the position of Government Astronomer . in New South Wales. similar difficulty was presented in South Australia in respect of Sir Charles Todd. But both of these officers have now retired in the evening of their lives, after having rendered very effective service to their respective States, and, consequently, there need be no longer any delicacy in assuming control of that Department.",25
98,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,We do not need a clearing; house for astronomical observations.,26
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,It occurs to me that we do not want half-a-dozen such observatories.,26
100,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"We must have local observatories,",26
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Perhaps the honourable and learned member will tell us why ?,26
102,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,The greater the number; the greater is the efficiency that is secured.,26
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I admit that several observatories are, perhaps, needed in Australia, but I do not think that we require six or seven separate astronomers in the six different States. Owing to our separation, and the way in which we have been apt to regard these matters, these observatories have grown up, but I have yet to hear any valid reason for continuing them in all their trappings and expensiveness.",26
104,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"We want certain observations to be made in each State, but we do not require observatories there.",26
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Exactly. It seems to me that if 'we had a central astronomical observatory as well as a central meteorological station. Ave might very well reduce some of our State institutions, and thus save the funds necessary to maintain and equip our central observatories, at the same time making the system a more effective one than it is at the present time.",26
106,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"In the United Kingdom, they have several astronomical observatories established within a much smaller area.",26
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"We have a number of these observatories in Australia outside of the Government domain. For instance, in New South Wales, one of the very best astronomical observatories is a privately-owned one. It has been established in my own electorate, at Windsor. I think that everybody in Australia has heard of Mr Tebbutt and his observations. He is one of the best men in the Commonwealth, and all that he does is done at his A own expense, and in pursuance of his own private studies. _ Nevertheless, he renders very important service to the Commonwealth as a whole, and there are many others in Australia who betake themselves to that study quite apart from its bread-and-butter aspect. They make it a private hobby. It 'will thus be seen that in Australia there are probably many more than six astronomers. Indeed!, we might multiply that number many times over before we ascertained the total of those who are earnestly engaged in studying the heavens and in conducting astronomical observations. But when we speak of this matter in its official sense, we have a right to see that we spend no more than is necessary for the purpose of providing a complete and fully-equipped institution. Therefore we should do well to unify our astronomical as well as our meteorological observatories. I entirely concur in the remarks of the Minister as to the advantages which the Bill will confer, upon the commercial community. I think that we might make much more use of meteorological knowledge than we do at the present time. Indeed, one of the results of Federation up to date has been a disf tinct curtailment of this information in the various States. I know that it has been so in New South Wales, and I venture to say that that remark applies more or less to other States of the Union. I do not think that we have yet seen-a side of the development of our Federal functions which we shall see, if we extend our powers as we should, and make our equipment as complete as possible. stance, it is a fact that in many European countries they so easily and accurately forecast the development of as to be able to warn the public not only as to the approach of floods, but as to dangers associated with mining, and so forth. I remember that it was a common thing thirty years ago for one to find in the English morning, newspapers a warning to mining districts that certain depressions were approaching, and that miners should beware of outbursts of gas and falls of earth, which might be caused by the disturbance. So far as I am aware, nothing in that direction has been attempted in Australia. That may be owing to the extent of the area to be covered, but it occurs to me that if we had full control of the geographical limitations of Australia we might so arrange our observations as to make our forecasts valuable to those engaged in mining as well as in pastoral, agricultural, and other pursuits. That is one side of meteorological development about which we know very little in Australia. There may be g'eographical difficulties in the way, but I should not think so, since, in some countries, it is found possible to forecast storms two days before their actual approach.",26
108,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Where is that?,27
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I was referring to European countries. The development of the work of the bureau in the direction I have just indicated might very well be kept in mind. The Bill itself is drawn on'a very moderate scale, and I think that the Minister would have acted wisely had he taiken the cherry whole instead of making two bites at it. It is hardly worth biting at it in this piecemeal fashion. The honourable and learned gentleman spoke of the position in the United States of America, and told us that there were several stations",27
110,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Seve n forecasting districts. Mr. JOSEPH COOK, - Americ a is a very large place, and these stations are, no doubt, designed to disseminate rather than to collect information.",27
111,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"There are seven large forecasting districts, and there are smaller districts employed in the distribution of forecasts.",27
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"That may be so; but I do not know that, in this regard, America and Australia are parallel. For in- America has a settled population of 80.000,000 people, whilst we ha%'e a population of only 4,000,000. In other words, storms we have six observatories for a population of 4,000,000, whilst the United States of America, with a population of 80,000,000, has only seven observatories.",27
113,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,There are four astronomical observatories in Australia.,27
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I am speaking now more particularly with regard to weather bureaux. The Bill is a very small one, and I notice that it contemplates the taking and recording of meteorological observations by State officers. What is meant by "" State officers "" ? Is the term intended to apply to officers in the Meteorological Department?",27
115,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,It covers any State officer. Some of the observations may be taken by police officers and others.,27
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I dare say that there are many hundreds engaged in connection with the weather reports.,27
117,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"There are 4,000 persons voluntarily engaged in taking observations for the Astronomical Department of the United States of America, and many persons interested in shipping do the same in Eingland..",27
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I do not think we should have any difficulty in this regard if we gave a little more encouragement to voluntary effort.,27
119,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,We have in some cases voluntary effort.,27
120,Mr TOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"We should save much trouble, and be able to distribute much more accurate information, if we encouraged voluntary effort. At present our operations in this regard are often confined to one official in a district, whereas manv people would be glad to take up the work as a labour of love, if we supplied the necessary instruments.",27
121,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,In one provincial town in Queensland there is a society which voluntarily carries out this service.,27
122,Mr TOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I notice that the Minister also contemplates an interchange of meteorological information between the Commonwealth and States authorities. Why should there be provision for such an exchange?,27
123,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Because this is concurrent legislation, and the States may desire to continue the Department under their owrt control. We may not be able to compel them to transfer the Department to us.",27
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,But it is not likely that the States would continue their bureaux upon the establishment of a Federal institution.,28
125,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"This provision is only for greater caution. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK-If that be so, nothing more need be said about the clause, I repeat that the only mistake made by the Minister is in failing to provide in this Bill for the transfer of the Astronomical as well as the Meteorological Departments. He should not have paid too much attention to the States authorities, who are very much interested in the maintenance Qf States institutions in all their dignity. He might very well have brought down an estimate showing that a saving would be effected, and that more efficient scientific results would flow from the taking over of both branches. Had he done that, we should have had no difficultv in convincing the States of the superiority of Federal over State control. That, after all, is what we have to do. It is because of our failure to do so that the States are so shy of the surrender of functions which have been given to us under the Constitution. The moment we can show them that the Commonwealth can carry out work of this kind to greater advantage than they can, the people as a whole mav safely be left to determine in favour of Federal, as against the continuance of State, control.",28
126,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"North Sydney) [4.10] - Like the honourable member for Parramatta, I am not going to find fault with the principle or"" the measure, but I join with him in expressing regret that the Minister has not seen fit to provide in this Bill for the taking over of the Astronomical as well as the Meteorological Department. If there is a reason for taking over the one, there is an equally good reason for the transfer of the other. The Minister seems to have been Influenced more by the views of the Board of Visitors of the Melbourne Observatory, and by those of Mr Baracchi, the Government Astronomer of Victoria, than by the opinion of the majority of astronomers and observatory officials who took part in the Adelaide Conference. That Conference accepted, even if it did not actually approve, the proposal that the' observatories should be transferred to the Commonwealth. That, at all events, was the opinion of the members of the Conference, with the exception of Mr Baracchi.",28
127,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The Conference did not. make a specific recommendation. They, said, in effect, that if the Meteorological Departments were taken over the existing, institutions should remain.",28
128,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Wit h theexception of Mr Baracchi, they agreed;, that certain recommendations should be made, and they took no exception by resolution to the taking over of the Departmentsby the Commonwealth - Further than that,, the opinion was expressed that the system proposed by the Minister in regard, to meteorology should not"" be adopted.. The Conference decided that there should , 1 be a central institution, and that themeteorological observations should be carried ,out as at present, under that institution. Whether that view be right or wrong,, the Minister has not seen fit to be guided by it ; he has preferred to adopt the view of the Victorian Government Astronomer. Thequestion of the desirableness of separating; the two branches of meteorology and astronomy is one that we need not consider at present, although I agree that if the twobranches could be carried on distinctly with-, reasonable economy they ought to be kept separate. Even if both Departments weretransferred to! the Commonwealth, therecould be a separation of the two- a separation possibly more effective and certainlymore economical than that which will follow the transfer of only one Department. Weknow that at present the meteorological work of the States is largely done by observatory officials, and if we transfer one portion of that work to the Commonwealth, and leave the other to be carried out by the States, we shall cause a division of duties now carried out by the one set of officials. That being so, we are bound to cause additional expense either to the Commonwealth or the States. So that the immediate result will bean increased expenditure, not necessarily by either State or Commonwealth separately, but certainly by both combined. Honourable members should be given an opportunity to decide whether both or only one Department shall be taken over. I fear that, as the measure stands, any amendment providing for the taking over of the Astronomical' Department would be ruled out of order, and therefore I should like the Minister tocreate an opportunity for the taking of atest vote upon the subject.",28
129,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,How does the honourable member propose to raise the question ?,28
130,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,A way ticularly - could be found to do that; but I do not .think that the Bill can be amended to procostly. vide for the taking over of the observatories. I suggest that the Minister should - consider how best an opportunity can be .given for testing the opinion of honourable members in regard to the matter. I the .strongly favour the transfer of both Dethat partments.,29
131,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Eve n if we took over the .Astronomical Departments, we could not (prevent any university from establishing - observatory of its own.",29
132,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"No ; and there is no reason why that should be prevented, if the institution can bear - expense. 'Eut there are now observatories - under Government control in four of States, and, if their revenue becomes buoyprevent ant, the remaining. States may also be tempted to establish observatories.",29
133,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Queenslan d desires to tain the astronomical branch for survey poses.,29
134,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"There is a .great deal of astronomical work which can - be done at small cost by States officers connected with the observatories. For in the stance, such matters as time distribution, the standardization of weights and meapartments ? sures, the rectification of chronometers, calculations relating to tides, and other similar work, can be done outside the observatories .at small expense, because the instruments required are not costly, and the labour cessary is not large. But the observation of the heavens, the photographing of stars, the taking part in the astronomical work of the world, and other operations for which our existing observatories are equipped, are very costly, and, by providing for the transfer of the Astronomical partments to the control of the Commonbarred wealth, we should remove from the two 'States which have not yet established servatories the temptation to do so. having the observatories under one control, we should bring about economy by preventThe ing the duplication of work. every astronomer is anxious that his observations and calculations shall be of portance which will place him in the lead, - or, at least, on a level with his fellows, with the result that each observatory obtains expensive and valuable instruments, and a large staff, to thoroughly equip work which might very well be done by of the others, the local work coming parsented within its province being comparatively small in volume, and therefore not",29
135,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,The officials declare that there is no duplication in astronomical work.,29
136,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"If the honourable and learned gentleman looks into matter, I think he will find, as I did, there is duplication. I admit that, as regards .the photographing of the heavens under an international arrangement, duplication has been avoided by allotting to the an observatories of Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney, and Perth different portions of the sky; but there is duplication in regard to other work, which could be done by one university, and, under Commonwealth conthe trol, would be prevented. We should make all the use we can of our observatories, but the we should introduce a system which will the duplication of instruments and staffs for the doing of work by several observatories concurrently which could be reequally well done by any of them alone. purThe Astronomical Departments are only small ones at the present time, but, if they were under Commonwealth control, effective economies could be enforced. The time is now opportune for dealing with the matter. unDoes the Minister intend never to exercise power given in the Constitution to take over the control of the Astronomical De",29
137,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I know of no justification for taking them over at this stage.,29
138,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"If there neis no justification for taking them over now, when will there be such justification? If the various observatories of the States are allowed to grow, there will be greater difficulties in the way of transfer later on than there are now, because the number' of those interested in preventing it will increase, Dewhile, in the meantime, we shall be defrom practising economies which are possible under a central administration obalone. At the present time there are two By important vacancies in connection with the staffs of the observatories of the States. Government Astronomer of New South Naturally, Wales is retiring.",29
139,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Does the honourable meman imber think that the Commonwealth should take over the Astronomical Departments and appoint officers to the vacant positions ?,29
140,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"T sayit for that the very opportunity that the Comany monwealth should desire would be prefor effecting economies. If vacancies existed in the Departments at the time of transfer, the Commonwealth would be free to effect economies without interfering with highly-paid officers. Vacancies now exist in the South Australian and New South Wales Observatories-at least, the officers who are now performing the duties of Government Astronomer are only acting in that position. The question as to whether these vacancies would require to be filled permanently could be decided after the transfer had taken place. It seems to me that certain important work could be confined) to certain observatories, and that it should not be necessary to employ astronomers of high qualifications in every State. Some astronomical work is done at Hobart, where they have no observatory, and no highly-paid official.",29
141,Mr CROUCH,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"There is a small observatory at Ballarat, which is supported by public subscription.",30
142,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Doubtles s private observatories and others of a purely local character would exist, even if the Commonwealth took over the Astronomical Department. I contend that'we should exercise our functions in these matters to the full extent. We should not take over half of the work performed by the existing States Departments, and leave the other half to be carried on by the States. No sufficient reason has been advanced why the two branches of work-meteoro logical and astronomical-shoul d be treated differently in the manner now proposed. There is no doubt that the meteorological work could be carried on without our taking over the Departments, but the States are very glad to hand it over to the Commonwealth, because they do not care to incur the expense that would he involved in extending the present system, and making it more complete. regard to the astronomical work, however, in connection with which they now gain some kudos, they are either unfavorable or careless as to the transfer to the Commonwealth. I do not think we ought to hesitate to exercise to the full the power conferred upon us under the Constitution, to take over these two at present closely sociated branches of work. If we took over the whole of the work we could make better use of the services of the officials than if a portion of the work were still left to be carried out by the States. The arrangement proposed must lead to disruption and extra expense. If we took over the whole of the work, some scientific men, fullyqualified to act, should be requested to> ascertain what could best be done at each of the observatories. Where the work was of a purely local character it would necessarily have to be done in a particular locality ; but if it were of such a description tnat it could be as well carried out in one State as in another, much of it could be centralized. This would all tend to economy and efficiency. At present, under decentralized control, this cannot be 1 done. If we now decide not to exercise the full power given to us by the Constitution,, we shall settle the matter for all time,, because I cannot conceive of any stronger reasons existing in the future than those which now present themselves in favour of making the complete transfer I have indicated. On the other hand, greater obstacles may be presented. If we had! the observatories under our control, we could centralize a great deal of the work,, and perform it much more effectively tharu at present. While I commend the Minister for having taken up this matter, I am sorry that he did not go further. I have no desire to harass him in any way, but I trust that he will test the feeling of honourable members on the question of taking over the two branches of work.",30
143,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,What would be the difference in the cost?,30
144,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The Minister has not given us an estimate. At present, it is difficult to ascertain the cost of carrying on the meteorological work now performed by the States, because the officials engaged in it devote part of their time to astronomical observations.",30
145,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"If both branches of work were 'taken over by us, what annual outlaywould be involved?",30
146,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I gave particulars upon With, that point, but I could not separate the cost of the meteorological and astronomicaF work.",30
147,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"If the work of the new department is to be as thorough as the Minister dtesires, I am afraid that it will prove rather costlv. We shall have at the outset to decide how far as- our circumstances will iustifv us in going. I agree' with the Minister that we should establish the best possible system, but fear that we shall be hampered by considerations of expense. We have a large territory, which is only sparsely peopled, and observations will riecessarilv have to extend over a very large area. Our action in separating the meteorological from the astronomical work will not tend to.reduce the total expenditure upon work which hitherto has ""been interknitted under the States administration, and I trust that honourable members will endorse my view that the Commonwealth should exercise to the full the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution.",30
148,Mr LONSDALE,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"New England) [4.43]. - I agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that it would tend to economical administration if the Commonwealth took over the astronomical, as well as the meteorological, work now being performed by the States. The two brandies of observation are very similar in character, and should be made to harmonize as much as possible. Under present conditions, there is a great deal of duplication of work in the States Observatories, which, if they were placed under separate control, could be avoided. Of course, we understand that if the operations of the Meteorological Department are extended, the expenditure will be increased, but our object should be to obtain the maximum result at a minimum of cost. And if meteorological matters are dealt with by the Commonwealth and astronomical matters are left to the States, the total expenditure upon. these Departments will be largely increased. I have not yet been able to read the report of the conference of astronomers which met in Adelaide in 1905, and consequently I am not familiar with the reasons which prompted Mr Baracchi to oppose the transfer to the Commonwealth of. the control of the Astronomical Departments of the States. Before we vote upon this Bill I think that those reasons should be clearlyplaced before honourable members. fact that the office of Government Astronomer in two of the States is vacant today shows that if we assumed control of that Department we should be afforded an opportunity of making some reduction in the expenditure upon our existing observatories. That could be done easily enough, unless it is absolutely necessary that in all the observatories throughout the States high-class officers should be appointed. I have an idea that that is not necessary, and consequently I think that a material saving might be effected.",31
149,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,The States may effect saving now.,31
150,Mr LONSDALE,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I admit that. But the States are separate entities, and they are not likely to relv upon the Victorian Astronomer. If we allow the astronomical work to remain with the States there is no doubt that they will continue the maintenance of their present establishments. Seeing that we have power to control that Department, I think that we ought to exercise it. A good.deal of the work that is done in each of the States is, I presume, supervised by the Government Astronomer. There would lie no necessity for that state of affairs to continue if we assumed control of both of these Departments. I hope that the Minister will afford, honourable members an opportunity of voting upon the question of whether we should not take over both the Astronomical and Meteorological Departments of the States. My own view is that, by so doing, we should effect a substantial saving, and at the same time secure a more effective system than we obtain at present..",31
151,Mr MCCOLL,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Echuca) [4.49] - I regret that I was unable to be present when the Minister moved the second reading of this Bill , because it deals with a matter in which I have taken a little interest. I sincerely welcome this action on the part of the Government. To me the subject of meteorology is one of the most important that they could take up. I think it is a reflection upon this Parliament that hitherto no action of the kind has been taken, although we have had power to deal with the matter ever since the establishment of the Federation. In our present complex civilization, when interests are so interinvolved and world-wide, the discovery and formulation of laws governing the weather are of first importance. To obtain an accurate meteorological system throughout The Australia, the Government would be justified in incurring almost any expenditure. To all sections of the community the matter is one of great importance-to those interested in commerce, transportation, navigation, agriculture, and trade of all descriptions. In short, it concerns everybody whose living and comfort depend upon the seasons and upon the weather. It is so far-reaching that it should be dealt with upon comprehensive lines. If the service is to be a useful one it should stretch out over all this Continent, and be conducted in the most thorough manner. a The Bill falls short of what I should have liked to see attempted. Its provisions are halting and hesitating, and throughout it provides that the Commonwealth "" may "" do this, that, and the other. To my mind, the word "" shall"" should be substituted for ""may,"" because, unless we intend to undertake meteorological work in a most thorough manner, we had better leave it alone altogether. A divided State 0 and Federal control would be absolutely fatal to the success of a meteorological department. The States might certainly render help to us in their own way, but the actual control of the Department should be Federal from top to bottom. Probably more than any other institution that we can establish, it is the one which needs a centralized control if it is to be effective. Control must be centred in one man-in one efficient head-jus t as it is in other countries, He must guide the whole ramifications of the Department, he must be in direct touch with all its stations, and he must exercise control over every officer's work. There is no occasion for me to criticise the systems which we have hitherto enjoyed. have been very poor ones. The only State which has rendered good service is that of Queensland, and the gentleman who controlled the Department there is no longer in the employ of the State Government, From the remarks which I have heard since I entered the Chamber, I gather that there is a desire on the part of honourable members to amalgamate the astronomical and meteorological services. I think that that would be a fundamental mistake.",31
152,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"In many coasts, States they are amalgamated now.",32
153,Mr MCCOLL,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Then the sooner they are separated the better. The Astronominecessary cal and Meteorological Departments work upon absolutely different lines. MeteoroIn logv is a science which treats of the atmostwo phere, its phenomena, and the variations heat, moisture, wind and storms. These are matters which affect our daily lives, Upon the'other hand, astronomy is a science which treats of the celestial bodies, their motions, distances, revolutions, order various related phenomena. These considethere rations do not affect us as does the science meteorology, and, therefore, I am very glad that the Government have seen fit to'sepatime rate the two Departments. Astronomy is strictly a science, whereas meteorology deals with practical work, and the mind's which have the control' of one should be occupied with the other. If they are, they must be diverted from that keen oband its operations were extended. servation of the various changes; which occurring, into abstract speculations which are of no practical value. Above everying thing, the question should' be dealt with in a thoroughly practical way .for the benefit of the community. The conference which met in Adelaide in 1905 contained 'four astronomers, one surveyor, and one meteorologist, and certainly their findings are not entitled to very much respect. To me they appear to have fallen very short of what was required of them, and seem to have been dominated by the astronomers, I believe that the objections of Mr Baracchi to the amalgamation of these institutions are sound and well founded, and I trust that the Government will accord them due respect. In this connection, I think that 'we may fairly copy what has been done in other countries where the science of meteorology has been a very great success. In the United States, where this science has been brought to perfection to the benefit of the whole community, They matters relating to meteorology were first placed under the War Signal Department in 1870. Until 1896 they were dealt w i h by that Department, but the work grew t to such an extent, and became so intimately connected with the great producing interests Q f the country, that it was deemed advisable to transfer it to the Department of Agriculture. It was only after consider a r , i agitation, however, that that was ace complished. The work of the Departm e n t was spread out to the great lakes, sea and subsequently to the districts of the interior and to the central valleys. To make it more effective, and in order to obtain data in a reasonably quick time, it was found! necessary to go further afield, a Meteorological Department, there are essentials to success-the one is a wide of range of stations spread over a. large area, and the other, a prompt collection and swift conveyance of the information which has to be transmitted to head-quarters. When I was in Washington, in August last year, and I visited its Weather Bureau. The work is being done under Professor Willis of L . Moore. It had been for twenty years under the military system, and during that the whole of the officers employed in the Department had been trained to military discipline and exactness. That was of very great advantage to them. When the not "" Department was transferred to the Department of Agriculture, it was re-organized, Its are duties now consist, of forecasting the weather, issuing storm warnings, dispjayweather and flood signals for the benefit of those engaged in agriculture, commerce, and navigation, gauging and reporting on rivers, maintaining and operating sea coast telegraph lines, collecting and transmitting marine intelligence, reporting temperature and rainfall for the great cotton interests, displaying frost, cold wave, and other signals, distributing meteorological information in the interests of agriculture and commerce, and taking such observations as are necessary to establish and record the climatic conditions of .the United States, and' which are essential for the execution of the foregoing duties. Since 1.896, that Department has grown very much indeed-so much so that in an area which is about equal to that of Australia, thirty observatories have been es-tablished at a cost of £ 8 0 , 0 0 0. bureau at Washington occupies a fine position, is well equipped, and cost £35,000. As evidencing the importance attached to this great question in the United States, I may mention that their annual appropriation in connection with meteorological work is £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 . The chief of the Department receives a salary of £ 1 , 0 0 0 per annum. Each year that Department has been in existence it has recouped its cost over and over again, in the saving of both life and of property which has been effected through its agency. In addition to these thirty observatories, there are 200 observing stations and 700 subsidiary stations. The operators are paid by the Government, but, in addition to these, there are 3,600 co-operators, who discharge their duties voluntarily, and are supplied at Government expense with the instruments necessary to enable them to take observations. Every one of these officials throughout the States is in direct touch with the chief of the Bureau, and can communicate with him whenever he desires, either by telegraph or telephone. to obtain an effective system the Bureau has a very wide range of operations. co-operates with Canada, thus securing observations from the extreme north of the Dominion, and also with Mexico, in the south, so that it is in touch with kindred institutions from the north to the south of the continent, which supply it with information, and from whom it obtains daily observations. The authorities of the Bureau are in touch with and receive observations from Honolulu, on the west, and with Britain, Germany, France, Portugal, and the Azores, on the east. The system is so complete that every meteorological change which takes place over a fourth of the globe, together with its bearing ancl possible results, is recorded and charted at Washington. The reports which come in are scanned by keen, experienced men, and the results are at once conveyed to every part of the continent which the changes may be expected to affect. At 200 stations simultaneous observations are made at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. by 75 meridian time. The stations are equipped with the most delicate instruments necessary for the recording, of changes, and there is an almost continuous record of local weather conditions and changes. Twice daily these records are sent to Washington, where they are charted and studied by trained experts, who announce the weather conditions which may be expected. So acThe curately is the work done that they can send over the whole continent a warning as to the approach of a storm from thirty-six to forty-eight hours before it takes place. The paths of storms are traced, and their subsequent courses are known. Information as to precipitation is at once sent to the Bureau, and the officials are thus able to foretell floods and warn the people concerned in time to permit of their providing against them. They have also a regular transmission of observations. In less than two hours after the morning observations have been made these warnings are telegraphed from the central station to 2,000 principal distributing points. They are then sent by post, telephone, and telegraph to 200,000 addresses. This takes place daily, most of the addresses are reached before noon, and every one of them is reached before 6 p.m. ' The whole of this work is done at the expense of the Government, and it is entirely distinct from the great work which the press also performs in this direction. The United States have also a free rural delivery and a free In order rural telephone service, which carry information to the farmers all over the contiIt nent. One hundred thousand farmers, in return for a small charge, receive daily weather reports from the observatory. There are also telephone subscribers and card forecast subscribers, and no less than 17,000,000 card forecasts are sent out every year. Another point is that there is also a climate and a crop service in connection with the Weather Bureau of the United States. There is a section in each State which collects information in regard to the temperature and rainfall, and makes, observations for monthly reports. During the crop-growing season - from April to September - weekly mail reports concerning the effect of the on crops, and also farming observations, are sent in from 14,000 correspondents. These are published in weekly and distributed throughout the country. Apart from this practical work, comes in direct touch with the people, and in which they take great interest, men of scientific ability are engaged in investigating and elaborating the fundamental principles which regulate meteorology and the kindred sciences. Snow and ice bulletins are issued from December to March, showing the depth of snow on the ground and the thickness of the ice on the various rivers and other waters, while special warnings are sent along the coast. Tropical hurricanes or storms or cold waves of unusual severity are forecasted, and reports are sent to postmasters at 6,152 points. postmasters, in turn, post ancl telephone the notices to the various subscribers and other persons interested. In addition, the forecasting notices are sent to 5,000 railway stations in all parts of the States, and are there posted in the waiting-rooms, so that travellers can at once ascertain the weather conditions in their own districts and advise their .friends at home of the necessary preparations to be made to secure their crops or other property. This work is highly beneficial to the people. There is no institution in the United States which has a greater hold on the people, or is deemed to be of greater benefit to them, than the Weather Bureau. Whilst we may not be so ambitious at the outset, I trust that we shall proceed in no halting way, but that we shall establish a central bureau, where meteorology work alone will be conducted, and that we shall work on until we obtain such a system as that which I have described. It is impossible to underrate the value of this weather data to business interests. The warnings of the approach of severe and injurious weather conditions which are issued in the United States of America are valuable beyond computation. Storm warnings are sent to 300 different points along the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Gulf coasts, and also along the shores of the great lakes, and so effective is the service that for vears not one storm has occurred respecting which warnings have not been issued from 12 to 24 hours before its approach. Vessels have thus been detained in port, and it is estimated that the saving in this way secured represents a value of Mr MCColl. $30,000,000. Cold wave warnings are weather issued from 2*4 to 36 hours in advance, and persons having crops or other properties liable to be injured by these occurrences are bulletins, able to cover them up or to take other steps to protect their interests. I read a year which or two ago that in one county alone the value of the strawberry crops, which had been saved as the result of these notices, was estimated to be equal to the whole cost of the Meteorological Department during the year in question. With an accurate knowledge of the precipitation, the authorities, knowing the number of inches of rain that have fallen, are able to forecast floods, and so to warn the people in time to protect their property. By means of this great Department, thousands of lives and property of immense value have been saved from destruction. Since the Bureau was These properly organized under the system I have just described, the percentage of wrecks around the coast and on the great lakes has decreased to a remarkable extent. In this Continent we have not the same wide range of climate, nor have we the extreme vicissitudes of cold and heat-of snow and ice-that are experienced in America. Still all this work would be useful here. Mere State work must necessarily be defective. What we need is to have the work centralized, placed under the control of one man, and carried out by a staff subject to proper discipline. This must be done in order that the Federal Department maybe what it ought to be. No other country offers a finer field for meteorology than does Australia. This Continent is peculiarly adapted to ""such work, and, given a proper system, conducted at reasonable expense, the Department should be able to forecast weather changes all over the Continent, and so would be productive of great good. This work should be carried out for the whole Continent, and not for any one part of it. The staff of the Department should be absolutely independent of the Public Service. If the Department is to be effective, absolute discipline, prompt obedience, care, and attention are required. The Weather Bureau of the United States has a very well-disciplined staff, and this perhaps may be partlv due to the fact that it was for manv vears carried on under the military system. The chief can suspend an. officer at a moment's notice, and may conduct inquiries as to carelessness or breaches of discipline. Meteorology is so important to the people of Australia that I think it might well be taught in our State schools. That, of course, is a matter with which the States themselves must deal, but I hold that many subjects now being taken up by the public schools are not nearly so important to the people of Australia a knowledge of weather conditions. Here we have State-owned railways, telephones, and telegraphs, so that we should be in a venmuch better position than is the United States to carry out effective work. All these systems, which are under State control, could co-operate, and 00 bring about good results. We should also be able to secure the co-operation of the press, which would be a material factor in our the northern monsoons blow. success. I desire to congratulate the vernment on having introduced this B i l and I trust they will not agree to the gamation of the Departments! of Astronomy and Meteorology. The divided attention to duty which would follow would not will, be productive of such good work as would its blessings. be obtained if the two branches were kept entirely distinct.",32
154,Mr KELLY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Wentworth) [4.55] - After the very able address to which we have just listened. I do not propose to detain House for more than a few moments. The remarks to which we have just listened brought home to me very fully the neceswas sity to study local conditions in dealing with questions of this character. The honfelt orable member was able to bring to bear a great amount of research in dealing with being considered in its broad aspect. the experience of the United States of America, and to show the immense saving of life and property which had resulted from the wide powers and the extensive fields of operations covered by the Weather Bureau there. I take it that if meteorological observations are to be of f u l value to our people, we must have the mittee; not now. sources of our information, not only in, but beyond, Australia. The forecasts to which the honourable member for Echuca referred were more or less parallel with the forecasts that we have had in Auswith tralia-forecast s for two or three days advance of sforms and local disturbances. But what I wish, to suggest now is that time is approaching when, by widening the sources of our information, we may be able to extend the duration of our foreto casts, and so enable the people on the to obtain information in regard, not only to local disturbances, but of a genethat ral character in respect to. seasonal rains. Australia derives most of its moisture countries lying to the north of it . As honourable members know, warm air carries moisture, which is precipitated upon a meeting with cold air. i ' think the greater part of the rain which falls in Australia is as is brought to this Continent by monsoons blowing from a northerly direction, which deposit some of their nioisture upon our northern areas, and gradually precipitate the rest as they come south, and meet with cold southerly and westerly winds. Therefore, it is necessary to insure that the Commonwealth Meteorological Department shall obtain information, not only from all parts of Australia, but also from the countries whence If it is Goknown that the monsoon blowing across l , India from the north is charged with more amalthan the ordinary quantity of moisture, and is travelling at the usual rate, it can be forecasted w.ith accuracy that Australia within a certain time, participate in Therefore, a provision should be inserted in the measure to enable the Commonwealth Meteorological Department to correspond with the Indian Department of Meteorology, and such other external Departments as it may be necessary the to obtain information from. I had intended to defer my remarks until the Bill was being considered in Committee; but I so struck with the able speech of the honourable member who preceded me. that I that it would not be out of place to say a few words now that the subject is I intend to move in Committee the addition of a clause which will give the power to which I have referred. It may be objected that the Government alreadv has this power.",35

156,Mr KELLY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I am discussing the general question whether it is necessary to provide in the Bill for the giving of this power; but, as it may be better to deal the subject in Committee. I shall conin tent myself with remarking that, as the Government has provided in the Bill for the the making of reciprocal arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States in this very direction, .it would not be amiss also give power to make reciprocal arland rangements with other countries.",35
157,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Angas) [5.19] - I wish we had a little more light upon the question whether the astronomical as well from as the meteorological branch should be taken over by the Commonwealth. I do not see anything especially Federal about the work of the astronomical branch', though it may be that slight savings in the direction suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney could be effected under Commonwealth control. Having regard to greserit conditions, the astronomical and meteorological branches forming one Department in each of the States, it might be more economical for the Commonwealth to take over both branches^ re-apportioning the work of the observatories, than to merely take over the meteorological work, leaving the astronomical work to be performed, as now, under the control of the Governments of the States. The astronomers who met in .conference in Adelaide in 1905 appear to be opposed to the transfer of the astronomical branch to the Commonwealth. At the present time, it is, perhaps, natural that men should object to being brought under the protecting aegis of the Commonwealth Government ; but their pbjections are supported by reasons which, if not conclusive, deserve a good deal of attention. They do not think that any of the work done by the observatories can be dispensed with, and recommend that it be continued on the present lines. They say, too, that not much saving will be effected in connection with the transfer of the meteorological branch, although they recognise that a central bureau like that of the United States of America would render more effective the work of comparing and recording meteorological phenomena, and the publication of forecasts. Under the circumstances, it does not seem likely that a large saving would be effected by taking over both the astronomical and meteorological branches.",35
158,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"None , so far as We can see.",36
159,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,There may be some saving in the direction pointed out by the honourable member for North Sydney.,36
160,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,The astronomers say that neither the observatories nor their work can be reduoed.,36
161,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"No doubt; and they give reasons for that statement. Most, if not all, the leading universities in the old country and in Europe are affiliated"" with observatories, or have observatories of their own.",36
162,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,That is so in the United States of America also.,36
163,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Not only is theorefica! astronomy studied;, but attention is also given to physical astronomy, and to the taking of observations. I know that, in connection with the 'Dublin University, Sir Robert Ball's services were at times availed of, though his official position was that of Astronomer Royal for Ireland^ and he was not directly connected with the University as a professor. Seeing how widely availed of are the opportunities for study afforded by our universities, it would be a pity if the observatories were not kept in their present state of efficiency, merely as aids and auxiliaries to education, though, according, to the report, there is room for improvement in their equipment. If the Commonwealth takes them over, their sphere of usefulness must not be narrowed, and I , therefore, cannot see where any great saving cantake place, unless, by the re-apportioning of work, duplication, which is now alleged to exist, can be dispensed with.",36
164,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,We must have efficient men. at the head of our observatories.,36
165,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"There is an astronomer at the head of each .observatory, who hasunder him a chief assistant'and a staff, not only of men employed in the clerical work of making records, but also of men of comparatively high scientific attainments. Mr Cooke, though a subordinate officer ire the Adelaide Observatory, was a man of fairlv high standing in his profession when removed to his present position in the Perth' Observatory; and there must be others possessing great professional knowledge, who would always be entitled to fairly good salaries. If the result of transferring theobservatories to the Commonwealth werethat men of high attainments were not appointed to the vacancies created by theleaving of men of good professional reputation, the service might be impaired. It is probably considerations of this sort that have induced the Government to say that at this stage it is not necessary for the Commonwealth to take over both the astronomical and the meteorological branch, and, going on the statements in the report to which I have referred, it does not seem to me to be necessary. One of the weaknesses of the Bill is that the States mav refuse to co-operate in the manner provided"" for by clause 5, in which case there would be a duplication of staffs. The measurehas been framed on the assumption that the States will co-operate, though we have nopower to compel them to do so.",36
166,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Hitherto , they have been found willing to co-operate.",37
167,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,They were in the beginning; but there has been a good deal of friction since.,37
168,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,There is a considerable interchange of services.,37
169,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I understand that the interchange is not so large as it was. The Minister of Trade and Customs would create a separate Department in every instance where that is possible, and I believe that the auditing work of the Commonwealth is now being done more largely by the Commonwealth officers than was the case at first, when the services of States officers were largely used, though not paid for at very extravagant rates. over both Departments may lead to a certain uniformity; but is not likely to create any great saving. If my memory serves me aright, astronomy is mentioned in the Constitution because, when the Convention was dealing with meteorology, it was considered that there might be a necessary association between the two.",37
170,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,That was a misapprehension.,37
171,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"It may or may not have t been a misapprehension. All that I can say is that the information before the House is not of such a character that I could, with perfect confidence, vote in one wav or another. Perhaps in Committee a little more light will be available for the guidance of honourable members. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears"" Observatory"" means an observatory for purpose of meteorological observations.",37
172,Mr GLY NN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Angas) [5.28] - "" Obsertions vatory "" is a term applied to an institution for the purpose of astronomical, as well as meteorological, observations; but the finition limits the meaning of the word an observatory for the purpose of meteorothe Commonwealth. logical observations only. I am not pared to offer an alternative definition.",37
173,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Darling Downs-Ministe of Home Affairs) [5-'29] - The definition sufficient for the purposes of the Bill is not intended to have any wider scope. Clause agreed to. Clause 3 agreed to. Clause 4 (Duties of Meteorologist).,37
174,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Wide Bay) [5.30] I think that, before this clause is passed, the Minister should say, as nearly as it can be estimated, what expenditure the Government will be put to in administering the Bill . I think that we should know what we are likely to be called upon to pay for the meteorological service. I quite approve of the policy embodied in the Bill , because it is impossible for the States to carry on the work with the same efficiency and satisfactory results to the community that can be ensured under the administration of the Commonwealth.",37
175,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Darling Downs-Min ister of Home Affairs) [5.31] - I pointed out in my second-reading speech that it Taking was impossible to say exactly what the meteorological service throughout Australia would cost. I might, however, inform the honourable member of the cost of the astronomical and meteorological work carried on by the States.",37
176,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Hav e not the Government made an estimate of the cost for themselves ?,37
177,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Onl y a rough estimate. So' far as we can judge, the new service will cost us at least £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. The Meteorological Department .of the United Kingdom involves an annual outlay of £ 1 5 , 6 3 9 . The cost of the Department will depend upon what it is required to do. It is recognised that, so far as our producers are concerned, the Meteorological Department should provide accurate forecasts in all the States. In this connection, we realise, that our settlements cover an enormous area, and that we have in outlying parts pastoral centres whose very existence depends upon climatic conditions. The movements of the stock are to a very large extent affected by the reports as to the weather condiin various places, and I hope that when the new Department is established weather forecasts will not only be made deavailable in Melbourne and Sydney, but to published at every leading post-office in Honourable members prewill see by a glance at the subjects enumerated in clause 4 what our ideas r are with regard to the scope of the work is of the Department. The cost of carrying . It out this work will depend very greatly on the system of organization adopted throughout the Commonwealth.",37
178,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"It is provided in clause .<; that the Commonwealth may enter into an arrangement with the States for the performance of certain services, for which I presume we shall have to pav.",37
179,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"At the Premiers'' Conference at Hobart it was agreed that the States and the Commonwealth should charge each other for services rendered by them respectively. If the States render us any services in connection with the Meteorological Department they will no doubt charge us for them, but such items of expenditure will merely involve a cross entry, so far as the whole of Australia is concerned.",38
180,Mr MCCOLL,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Echuca) [5.35] - It is almost impossible to estimate what the Department will cost. The question of the expenditure upon such work should really be only a secondary consideration. should pay regard, ira the first instance, to the necessity of making the Department of practical use. The work is one which must be extended, probably at an increased cost, but we shall be fully recompensed for any outlay by the greater value of the information furnished to those deeply concerned in our weather conditions. We must leave it to the Minister to see that the Department is organized with due re-, gard to economy, consistent with the highest degree of efficiency.",38
181,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Wide Bay) [5.37] - I quite agree with the honourable member for Echuca that efficiency should be the first consideration, but I do not think we should pass measures of this kind without having some idea of the expense involved. I have already stated that the Commonwealth is the proper authority to control such a Department, and I hope that its administration will prove of the utmost benefit to the people. The Minister tells us that, under the arrangement made at the Hobart Conference, the States will debit the Commonwealth with the cost of any services rendered by them in connection with the new Department. Mr 'GROOM - That applies to all Departments.",38
182,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Althoug h the Minister indicates that the payment for such service will in certain cases be made by a mere book entry, it will be a somewhat serious matter as between the Commonwealth and the States, because it will involve a further drain upon our fourth of the Customs revenue, instead of the cost being charged to the three-fourths share that falls to the States. I am confident that the present Minister will exercise economy, but, as is often said, we do not know what future Ministers might do. The principle of the Bill is perfectly sound, and I do not wish it to be thought for a moment that I am taking the slightest exception to it. I trust that the services rendered by the new Department will more than compensate the public for any expense that it may"" entail.",38
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Parramatta) [5.40] - I agree with'the honourable member for Echuca that our first object should be to make the Department useful. I am afraid that if we leave the States to still carrv' on the astronomical work now performed by them, their Departments will be maintained upon the same footing as at present, and we shall merely be adding We another Department to those already in existence, and thereby increase the tota[ expenditure. The very first thing to be aimed at in. connection with a new Department is efficiency, but economy also must be studied. I do not see what is to hinder us from paving regard to both these matters. I think that, if .we had an efficient central bureau, all that we should need besides would be a few small observing stations in various localities, from which results might be transmitted to> headquarters. I judge from the figures supplied by the Minister, that the equipment of the States Departments varies very considerably. In New South Wales, the Astronomical and Meteorological Department emplovs nineteen officers, whose combined salaries amount to £ 4 , 0 0 0. In Victoria twenty-five officers are employed at a similar outlay. The astronomical and meteorological equipment in Victoria is valued at y?/io,ooo. No details are given.",38
184,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,That is the form in which the information was supplied to us.,38
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"We are told by the Minister that Mr Wragge estimates that the meteorological service will involve an outlay of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 . I should like to know if that amount would include anything beyond salaries.",38
186,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"That would be the annual charge for the central administration, and for the printing and publishing of the various reports.",38
187,Mr TOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Then what about the weather telegrams, which I see have hitherto cost £ 4 0 , 5 0 0 per annum?",38
188,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"They will be transmitted over the Commonwealth lines, and even if the Post and Telegraph Department charge for them, the cost will merely be transferred from one department to another, and no additional expense will be incurred. The States now pay us for the weather telegrams, but they will be relieved of that necessity if we take over the Meteorological Department.",38
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"But the point is that we shall have to pay for them out of our one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue, instead of their being paid for by the States out of their three-fourths share. It seems to me that we must add the cost of the weather telegrams to the estimate of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 furnished by the Minister. I think that such an estimate ought to have been submitted to the House upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill. It ought to"" have been possible for honourable members to see whether any saving in the cost of administering this Department is contemplated, and, if so, in what direction. Surely it would not be a difficult matter to get either Mr Baracchi, or some other officer, to submit an estimate of the probable efficiency and expense of the Department, regarded as a whole. I think that the matter rightly comes up for consideration now that we are allocating the functions of the proposed bureau. The estimate to which reference has already been made was, I understand, formulated by Mir. Wragge, some five or six years ago. However much we may admire that gentleman in certain directions, I have yet to learn that we can regard him as a financier. My experience of him is that his attributes lie in an entirely different direction from that of financial management. Unless we can increase the usefulness of this Department by assuming control of it , we had better leave it alone entirely. I fear that an increase in its usefulness will prove expensive, if we are to deal with it in this piecemeal way. If we are to leave to the States their observatories, their buildings, their instruments, and their many highsalaried officials, and if we are to establish a central bureau with another set of highly paid officials, we shall certainly increase the total cost of administering the Department, without being able to insure a more efficient service. I do think that all the money which may be spent upon the central Federal bureau ought to be derived from the shearing down of some of the States bureaux. I may be wrong in entertaining that idea, but, if so. it should at least be possible for the Minister to prove that I am mistaken, according to the views of the best authorities. Mr WILSOiV (Corangamite) [5.50] - I am rather interested in the opinions which have been expressed by two honourable members who hail from the "" land o' cakes."" I refer to the honourable member for Echuca, who represented one side of the case, and to the honourable member for Wide Bay, who put the other side. Upon this occasion, it seems to me that the honourable member for Echuca has adopted the role which is so frequently adopted by the Treasurer, when he exclaims ' ' Oh ! what is a million?"" Upon the other hand, the honourable member for Wide Bay asks the Committee to proceed with caution, and to obtain from the Minister an estimate of the probable cost of the working of a Federal Meteorological Department. I agree that, before the Bill is finally disposed of, honourable members should be given some guarantee that due regard will be paid to the economical administration of this new Department. The deputy-leader of the Opposition stated, at the outset of his remarks, that the agreed with the honourable member for Echuca, but in his closing observations he conclusively showed that he was entirely in agreement with the honourable member for Wide Bay.",39
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,What I.said was that I agreed with the honourable member for Echuca that we ought to make this new Department an efficient and useful one.,39
191,Mr WILSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"We are all agreed upon! that point. In dealing with this question we have a right to know how we are going "" to raise the wind."" That is a matter of grave importance. Before we give a blank cheque for the creation of a new Department we should have some idea of what its cost will be, and how that cost is to be borne. The Minister of Home Affairs has stated that the cost of weather telegrams will no longer be borne by the States when this Bill has become law. Then the £ 4 0 . 0 0 0 which has been hitherto paid by the States will represent a loss to the Commonwealth. Of course, we are all aware that the same taxpayers will have to provide the monev. The cost of this Department-irrespectiv e of whether it is administered by the State or the Commonwealth - musfcom e from the pockets of the same people.",39
192,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I said that the value of the weather telegrams transmitted is £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, but that, in accordance with a regulation which was framed Meteorgolbgy Bill. [REPRESENTATIVES.] under the Postal Rates Act, they are not charged for. Perhaps the honourable member will permit me to make a short explanation ?",39
193,Mr WILSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Certainly .,40
194,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Earling Downs-Minister for Home Affairs) [5-541-- I merely desire to say that when the Postal Rates Act was under consideration I moved an amendment which enabled the regulation to which I have already referred to be framed. At that time a question was raised as to whether the Queensland Weather Bureau should be charged for services rendered to it by the Postal Department, which step would have deprived us of the benefit of Mr Wragge's forecasts. I moved an amendment, which was carried, and in ' accordance with that amendment the following regulation was framed:Subject to the following regulations, meteorological telegrams may be transmitted free of, charge:[a) From the principal meteorological officer of a State to the principal meteorological officer of another State; or f i ) From the principal meteorological officer of a State to an authorized observer at a reporting station; or (c) FTOITI an authorized observer at a reporting station to the principal meteorological officer of a State. Where cable rates have to be paid on meteorological telegrams, they must be paid by the sender. A meteorological telegram shall be sent as a message, and shall contain current meteorological information only, and must be in code and be concisely expressed, and, if a weather report, must contain not more than 12 words; and, if not a weather report, must contain not more than 20 words. Meteorological telegrams shall only be sent when necessary, and shall not take precedence of ordinary telegrams.",40
195,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Is that provision contained in the Postal Rates Act?,40
196,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,No . It is embodied in a regulation framed under that Act.,40
197,Mr WILKINSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Then what would be an expense to the Meteorological Department would constitute a revenue to the Post and Telegraph Department?,40
198,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I took it that the question put to me by the honourable member for Wide Bay related to the annual value of weather telegrams. I replied that it was £40,000, and the honourable member for Corangamite was"" adding that amount to the expenditure that will be involved in constituting a Federal Meteorological Department.

199,Mr MCCOLL,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Echuca) [5.55] - I should like to move that the following words be added to paragraph c, "" and the authorities of other countries.""",40
200,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Notic e of an amendment to that effect has already been given, and I have agreed to accept it.",40
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Parramatta) [S-57]--In this clause provision is made for the transfer to the Commonwealth ""on such terms as are agreed upon,"" of any observatory",40
202,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,That means meteorological observatories.,40
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Are there such institutions ?,40
204,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,There are outlying stations. A temporary meteorological observatory was established at Mount Kosciusko.,40
205,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,The provision to which the Minister refers does not relate to the central observatories ?,40
206,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,No .,40
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,They will still be retained by the States?,40
208,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Yes .,40
209,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Barker) L5-5°1-- I should like to know whether, under this arrangement, it is intended that independent forecasts shall be issued for the different States?",40
210,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Darling Downs) [5.57] What I mentioned was that the organization of Australia into meteorological districts, for the purpose of issuing forecasts, will depend upon the opinion entertained by the head of the Department who is appointed. I have already pointed out that in the United States it was considered necessary to have seven independent forecasting districts, each of which was subdivided into smaller areas, which distributed forecasts. When an officer is appointed by the Government under this Bill he will probably find it necessary to adopt the plan of dividing Australia into forecasting districts which may not be based upon mere State lines, but upon geographical features. For instance, there may be one in Adelaide, another in Western Australia, and two or three upon the eastern coast. I have here a map showing the way in which that practice works in the United States. The opinion which I have expressed is that which is held by eminent meteorologists in Australia. They believe that it will be necessary to carry out the system to which I have alluded.",40
211,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Barker) [5.58] - I regard the explanation of the Minister as satisfactory. Reference has been made to the forecasts formerly issued by Mr Wragge. Honourable members_have spoken of their general accuracy, but it should be remembered that they were based on information furnished by officials in the different States. These officers are in a better position to issue reliable forecasts than any central bureau. As regards South Australia, Mr Wragge's forecasts were framed on local data, but the locallv-issued forecasts gave a much higher percentage of correctness. If we are to have reliable forecasts, and to establish a general average of accuracy throughout the Commonwealth, those forecasts will have to be made in different centres, in the way that has been suggested by the Minister. I am glad that he intends to give effect to a proposal of that kind. Clause agreed to. Clause 6 (Regulations).",41
212,Mr MCCOLL,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Echuca) [6.0] - I think it should be provided that the regulations shall be laid before F'arliament, for the matters with which they deal will be of very great importance.",41

The Governor General may enter into an arrangement with the Governments of other countries, or any of them, for the interchange of meteorological information between such Governments and the Commonwealth.""",41
215,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Is such an amendment, necessary ?",41
216,Mr KELLY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I think that it is essential to the public interests that such a power should toe given. Honourable members willobserve that unless some such amendment be made, paragraph c of clause 5 may be read! as an implied direction to the Department, not to obtain meteorological information, from beyond the Commonwealth.",41
217,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [6.4] - I see.no objection to the amendment. It is merely a declaration of what other powers we possess.,41
218,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Wide Bay) C6.5] - I shall not oppose the amendment, since the Minister holds the view that it can do no harm. At the, same time, I would point out that it may be taken to mean that arrangementsmade with other Governments will involvea monetary consideration.",41
219,Mr KELLY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Arrangement s need not necessarily be of a monetary character.,41
220,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"If that be so, I fail to see why the amendment is necessary. I presume that the Minister would have power to secure an interchange of ideas and information without a specific direction in the Bill. Does the honourable member intend' that the Governor General shall be empowered to enter into an agreement with, other countries to supply information that we cannot supply for ourselves ?",41
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,If he thinks it necessary; but in all probability it will not benecessary.,41
222,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"If we are going to insertin the Bill a provision which will enable the. Minister to secure an exchange of information-for a consideration-between : the Commonwealth Department and that of any other country, the proposal is a big one.",41
223,Mr KELLY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Wentworth) [6.7] - I believe that it is generally agreed amongmeteorologists, and also among honourable: members, that the wider our sources of information the longer the period for whichforecasts of weather changes can be given.",41
224,Mr MCCOLL,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,And the more correct theforecasts.,41
225,Mr KELLY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Quite so With a wider source of information, our organization should not be so liable to make an error :- because of an entirely local disturbance. The Indian Government have already recognised that fact, and are anxious to enter into a system of reciprocity with the Australian States.",41
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Did Wragge arrange for a station at Mount Kosciusko ?,42
227,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"He would have one at the North Pole, and also at the South Pole, he could.",42
228,Mr KELLY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I recommend to the orable member a statement that appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, May last, to the effect that the Government Meteorologistwho has frequently urged the desirability ceiving telegraphic data from as wide an as possible for weather forecast purposes, received a communication from the Director General of Indian Observatories, requesting of other countries, or any of them."" cablegrams showing periodic changes in the tribution of atmospheric pressure over tralia, in order to assist in the construction their monsoon or seasonal forecasts; .further, that the cost of such cablegrams is to be by the Government of India. The arrangements entered into in a case of that kind would be for reciprocal adtralia vantages.",42
229,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I do not object to proposal, but I wish to know whether is not mere redundancy.",42
230,Mr KELLY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"No ; the point is that if of them. it is, then paragraph c of clause 5 is also a redundancy. If that paragraph be allowed to stand without some such ment as I propose, it may possibly be read as curtailing the Government agencies this very direction. Every one will admit the necessity to secure information wide a source as possible. The immense value of the information to be obtained from India will present itself to every who remembers how intimately our seasonal rains are associated: with the monsoons cost whatever. which come from the equator. The theory is that a lot of our moisture is deposited in the monsoonal period, and that the monupon soons seriously affect the humidity of. air in the southern part of Australia, though they do not reach here. Then the cool winds from the west and the south precipitate the moisture for which these monsoons have been responsible. That, as I have said, is a theory, but my other stateMinister ments are facts which ought to be sufficient to secure the passing of the"" amendment.",42
231,Mr FISHER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Wide Bay) [6.11] - Th honourable member for Wentworth is very ingenious, and is entitled to take whatever course he deems fit. I would point out, however, that, whilst his proposal is that the Governor General shall have power arrange with the Governments of other that no such limitation is imposed upon the countries for an interchange of mereoroMinister. not Mr logic information, the most valuable information would be. obtained from oversea vessels trading to places where such particulars could not otherwise be secured, and if that the Minister ought, therefore, to be empowered to enter into agreements with honshipping companies in this direction.",42
232,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The amendment would not of 18th prevent that being done. Mr FISHER . The point is that the more definitely we prescribe the duties of of rethe Minister the more we limit his area powers. In the amendment we have the has words specifically used, "" the Governments We disought not to limit the power to obtain inAusformation in that way, because big shipof ping companies, whose vessels are fitted with borne wireless telegraphy instruments, would, doubtless, be able to supply us with very valuable information. Information obtained from a certain distance beyond Ausis of value only for universal data, and it seems to me that in prescribing the the powers of the Minister in the way proposed it by the honourable member for Wentworth we should certainly bring about a limitation",42

The should have power to make arrangements with shipping companies to supply meteorological information. Most of our e storms come from the west, and the most valuable information we secure with regard to disturbances comes from the meridian west of the Leeuwin. , The question is whether the amendment will limit the Minto ister's powers.

245,Mr WATSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Clause 5 deals with functions which have hitherto been performed by the States, and it seems to me necessary to lay down the specific conditions under which the meteorological branch is to be transferred to the Commonwealth. I have risen to suggest that, when a Commonwealth Meteorological Department is formed, consideration should be given to the statements made by Professor Gregory in a lecture delivered in Melbourne on the subject of Australian meteorological conditions and the forecasting of weather. He is of opinion that the temperature of the waters on our coasts, influenced as it is by ocean currents, may have a material effect upon our weather conditions, and suggested that a small sum should be expended annually in recording the temperature of the seai at various places. He admitted that it would be some time before sufficient data would be available to substantiate any reasonable theory, but he thought that an expenditure of £ 5 0 0 per annum might produce results of value in meteorological research. I think it would be well for the Commonwealth Department of Meteorology, when created, to give attention to that suggestion.",43
246,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Angas} [6.22] - I regard the amendment as unnecessary. Clause 5 specially refers to the utilization of the services of the officers of the States. Our Public Service Act contains a provision enabling the Government to avail itself of the services of officers of t'he States, and allowing our officials to do work for the States authorities, and in this clause we are declaring that we intend to make use of that provision, and take advantage, for a time, of the services of States officers. The clause amounts to a declaration that we are going to exercise the powers whose exercise is provided for by the Public Service Act, it may be with unnecessary amplification of detail. On the other hand, the power proposed to be conferred by the amendment seems to be inherent in the Government. If we say that the Government is to undertake the control of meteorological observations, it will have power to do so. .",43

251,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Angas) [7.3°]-- I looked - through the Bill very carefully this morning, and I think it is to be more com-mended for its purpose than for what it achieves. I had thought that a Bill which aims at uniformity would have been more in line with English legislation. We have welcomed the tendency recently shown to promote uniformity throughout the Empire in matters regarding which there is no necessity to have local diversity; especially when that uniformity is only part of the .greater scheme of uniformity which is aimed at under international reciprocity treaties. The growth of international re-ciprocity in these matters makes us more hopeful that the comity of nations will become a little more marked than in the past. Imperial statesmen, as well as commercial representatives of the Empire, desire that there shall be' uniformity as far as possible in regard to patents, copyrights, and designs. Copyright is a general term, covering copyright in books and designs. From the syllabus of the Sixth Congress of the Chambers of Commerce of the Empire, published in the Weekly Times of 20th June, 1906, I find that one of the notices of motion given wasThat it is desirable that the law of copyright should be uniform throughout the Empire, and that the existing laws relating to copyright be amended when necessary by Imperial and Colonial legislation, so as to give to all citizens the Empire, subject to local conditions and formalities, identical rights and protection throughout the Empire for all their productions, whether 'literary, artistic, musical, or dramatic. The same principle, of course, applies to designs. I think that the expediency of Imperial uniformity in these matters was referred to at some of the Imperial Conferences of the last few years. mentioned at the Conference of 1902, if - not at that of 1887. Under these circumstances, it is to be deplored that Ministers, - whilst professing to follow the spirit, depart from the letter and structure, of the Imperial Acts. .1 do not intend, in connection with such a technical subject, td quote more than one or two instances of the departure referred to. In England, designs and patents are dealt with in the one Act, and the articles to which designs have to be affixed and with respect to which designs may be registered are scheduled, not in the Act, but in the rules laid down by the Board of Trade. These rules have a publicity- a far wider publicity-tha n regulations such as those prescribed by the' Bill, which will be found only in the somewhat cloistral seclusion of that interesting periodical, which no one reads, called the Commonwealth Government Gazette. In a matter of this kind, which is to some extent Imperial, if not international, it is desirable that our laws should be made as public as possible, so that people of other nations, as well as the citizens of the Commonwealth, may have an opportunity of ascertaining by reference to the statute-book the full meaning and scope of our legislation. . If, however, they have to wade through the, sometimes not properly indexed, files of our Government Gazette and Blue Books to find out which of the articles will come within the categorv of designs, they may quite innocently commit an offence against the law. The Board of Trade have made rules in England, under which fourteen articles are specified as coming within the designs part of the Patents Act. I cannot understand why patents and designs should have been dealt with in two separate measures, except that it may have been desired to introduce the Bills in different sessions. The effect is to duplicate the machinery, because in the English Act' a great many of the sections are quite as applicable to copyright in designs as to patents. Under this Bill we have adopted a good many of the sections of the Patents Act, whereas if the of two matters had been dealt with in the one measure we should have saved ourselves the trouble of repeating the provisions. Why should we not follow the sufficiently concise terminology of the English Act ? They have a good drafting staff in England, and it is desirable that, as far as possible, our laws should run upon all fours with the Imperial. Statutes, so that the decisions of the Courts It was upon Imperial Statutes may be applicable to the interpretation of our local laws. The Privy Council still reconciles most of the decisions of our Courts, and that tribunal is nothing more than another edition of the House of Lords. The same Judges sit upon both Benches, and act as interpreters of Imperial as well as Australian legislation. Therefore it is eminently desirable that there should be no difference in the wording or structure of the Imperial and Australian Statutes. At all events, where no apparent object is served, I do not see why the Commonwealth draftsman should alter the structure of the Imperial provisions, split up the sections, and very often vary the terminology. Clause 4 of the Bill contains a definition of ""design."" It is very small, and embraces only a small portion of the Imperial definition. It may simplify matters if I read section 60 of the Patents Designs and Trade Marks Act of 1883, which contains a definition of "" design."" It reads"" Design "" means any design applicable to any article of manufacture, or to any substance, artificial or natural, OT partly artificial and partly natural, whether the design is applicable for the pattern or for the shape or configuration, or for the ornament thereof, or for any two or more such purposes, and by whatever means it is applicable, whether by printing, painting, embroidering, weaving, sewing, modelling, casting, embossing, engraving, staining, or any other means ""whatever, manual, mechanical, or chemical, separate or combined. In drafting the Bill, which from the marginal notes professes to be in conformity with the Imperial Act, the method 'has been adopted of knocking out a part of the specification in the Imperial definition and then dividing the remainder into two sections, one of which is included, as it ought to be, in the interpretation clause, whilst the other is not. The definition of "" design "" is to toe article found partly in the interpretation clause, - and partly in clause 5, which may be regarded as one of the enacting provisions of the measure. The structure of the expression in clause 5 has been varied from that adopted in the English Act. Some words have been added, and others have been left out. In clause 4 it is provided"" Design"" means an industrial design applicwe able, in any way or by any means, to the pose of the ornamentation, or pattern, or shape, or configuration, of an article, or to any more of those purposes; The word "" industrial,"" which has been cate added, and appears also in the title of the Bill, does not occur in the English Act, ficial and I fail to see the object of its insertion stances. here. It may mean a limitation. The Immeaning that perial Act of 1883 was a consolidation of to the word ""I industrial."" the Act of 01842 and some amending Acts. The Act of 1842 dealt only with I fail to see why it has beenofemployed. ornamental designs, but the Act of 1883 lates to ornamental and useful designsthe word "" useful "" not being employed in finition the definition, but being the result of the definition. Therefore, designs under the apply Imperial law, as well as under the Bill, or may be ornamental or useful. If the word "" industrial "" is not qualified by the use of other words, the meaning of the tenn "" design "" will be somewhat limited. Owing to the distinction previously drawn and still drawn in the Act of 1883 between ""ornamental "" and "" useful,"" the word "" industrial "" may limit the application of the definition. It is certainly inconsistent with the subsequent wording of the clause, which includes the word "" ornamentation."" It is incongruous with the context. I regret that the Minister has not shown us why this departure has been made from the wording of the English Act, and why a word has been inserted which may lead tb diversity of interpretation. In the English Act the means of attachment are specified, whether they be by printing, painting, embroidering, weaving, &c. That, I believe, is done with a twofold object. The first is a desire toindicate to some extent how the attachment is to be made, because in both the Imperial Act and in this Bill there is a provision that the registered mark must be attached to the goods. It is not left to each person to decide with what publicity the mark shall be so attached. In the English legislation, I repeat, the method of attachment is specified. But in this Bill the definition is contained in two provisions. Clause 5declaresA design shall be deemed to be applied to an. when(4) the design is applied, in any way, or by any means to the purpose of the ornamentation, or pattern, or shape, or configuration of the article, or to any two or more of those purposes. Thus it does not afford any indication of what is meant by the Legislature as does the Imperial Act. Again, from that clause have omitted the words "" artificial, or purnatural, or partly artificial and partly natwo or tural."" That fact enhances the difficulty which I have been endeavouring to indiin connection) with the use of the word ""industrial,"" which, is more related to artisubstances than it is to natural subwhich I By the excision of the words to have referred the limitation of have indicated may be given As the method adopted is not in the interests lucidity,. reAgain, in the Imperial Act there is a'definition of copyright in designs. That dereads"" Copyright"" - means the exclusive right tba design to any article of manufacture, to any substance as aforesaid in the class or classes in which the design is registered. Designs Bill. The draftsman of this Bill has not followed the Imperial Act in that connection. The word "" copyright "" is not defined in our interpretation clause, where one would naturally look for it , but is inserted in clause 12, where its meaning is expressed .in different word's. That clause provides that° Copyright in a design means the right to apply the designand then these words are addedor authorize another person to apply the design to the articles in respect of which it is registered. Why are these words inserted? They cannot be required in connection with assignments, because the latter are specially provided for. They are not intended designate persons who take designs for value or consideration. The object of that definition is attained by clause 30, which is supposed to be similar in purport to section 58 of the Imperial Act. clause readsA person shallbe deemed to infringe copyright in a registered design, if , whilst the copyright continues he, without the licence authority of the owner of the copyright . does certain things. These words being used subsequently, I hold that there is necessity to include them in clause 12. If Imperial Acts. honourable members will look at clause 32 they will find that it readsA person shall not knowingly infringe copyright in a registered design. The penalty provided for any such offence is £ 5 0 , and sub-clause 2 declares thatAny penalty under this section may be sued Act. for and recovered for his own use by the regisour tered owner of the design. But why is not the person authorized under perial legislation in this connection. clause 12-if the definition contained that provision means anything-as o enadopted titled to sue for and recover for his own use the penalty provided under this clause It seems to me that a departure has been made from the English terminology withfurther out regard to its effect.",44
252,Mr HIGGINS,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Is not this better draftssaid manship ?,46
253,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I do not think so. In the Imperial Statute the particular Act relation to which knowledge is implied is clause providesspecified in connection with the word "" knowing! v.""",46
254,Mr HIGGINS,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Clause 32 uses the words "" Iknowin'glv infringe.''",46
255,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"But the word ""infringe"" means several things which relate to different breaches of the Act, whereas the Imperial law the particular breach [REPRESENTATIVES.] Designs Bill. specified, and then the word ""knowingly "" is used in connection with it, so that there can be no misapprehension as to what was the intention of the Legislature. Then, again the words in which an offence is declared in this Bill are different from those employed in the 'Imperial Act. For instance, section 58 of the Imperial statute proexclusive videsIt shall not be lawful for any person to publish or expose for sale any article of manufacture or any substance to which such design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof shall have been so applied, &c. In this Bill, however, a person is deemed to infringe the copyright in a registered design if , whilst the copyright continues, to lie, without licence or authority of the owner of the copyright, "" sells or offers for sale "" any article to which the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation of it has been applied. I point out these diffiThe culties to indicate that a departure has been made from Imperial legislation. I do not the say that the Imperial Acts are always or right, but I do say ""that they are generally excellently drafted.",46
256,Mr HIGGINS,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Some of our Statutes are no better drafted than are the corresponding,46
257,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"No doubt. Our Customs Act is better drafted than are most I m the perial Statutes, and I know that some of the Imperial authorities highly complimented the right honourable member for Adelaide upon his draftsmanship of that But, having uniformity in view, it is duty to see whether we are justified in departing from the draftsmanship of ImIn in some of our State Acts we have literally the phraseology of legislation in the old country. This is notably the case ? in connection with the Sale of Goods Act. I do not think that I need detain the House in discussing this Bill, which is purelv one for Committee. Something was last night about the right of appeal from a decision of the Registrar in connection with an application to register an in industrial design under clause 39. That Subject to this Act, the Supreme .Court, on the application of any person aggrieved, may order the rectification of the register by(a) the making of any entry wrongly omitted to be made in the. register. That, I take it, refers to an omission in in connection with an entry which has been is actually made. That is what is meant by the provision in the Imperial Act, in which different words are employed. seem to me that the power of rectification conferred by clause 39 is the power to rectify a certain entry which has been actually made. . But the earlier part of the Bill seems to make the decision of the Registrar in connection with applications for the registration of industrial designs, final. [ repeat that the Bill is essentiallyone to be threshed out in Committee, ancl, therefore. I do not propose at this stage to offer any further criticism of its provisions. Ouestion resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to. Clause 4- In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears . . . ""The Supreme Court"" means the Supreme Court of a State or any Judge thereof. . . . . Mr Glynn (Angas) [8.0] - Perhaps the Minister will tell us why this method of drafting has been adopted. Will he tell us why, for instance, the definition of "" design "" in the English Act has been cut down, then divided, and added to? For instance, the word ""industrial "" is used in this clause, although I cannot find it in any Act. It is true, 'however, that it appears in the report of the Convention of 1883. Will the Minister tell us why there is such a variation from the English Act?",46
258,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [8.2] - This form of drafting has been adopted with a view to make the definitions as short and as simple as possible, so that they may be readily understood. Any departure that has been made from the English Act is not one of principle: the substance of the English legislation has been preserved. If the honourable member turns to the definition of the word "" design "" he will find that it contains everything in the English section that is essential. In that Act the word "" design "" is defined as meaningany design applicable to any article of manufacture . . . and by whatever means it is applicable, whether by printing, painting, embroidering, weaving, sewing, modelling, casting, embossing, engraving, staining, or any other means whatever . . In the Bill we define "" design"" as meaningan industrial design applicable in any way or by any means to the purpose of the ornamentation, or pattern, or shape, or configuration, article, or to any two or more of those purposes. The English definition, after setting out It does various means by which it is applicable, contains the words, "" or any other means whatever.""",47
259,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,They are ejusdem generis.,47
260,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"We have made the ""design "" applicable in the widest way. I think that the definition is a decided improvement upon that contained in the E'njglish Act. I would point out that the word "" a r t i c l e "" has been defined in the Bill shortly as meaning "" any article or substance."" Designs are usually applied only to industrial purposes. In the International Convention the word "" industrial "" is expressly used. We have there the words "" industrial designs or models,"" which constitute the subject-matter of the Convention.",47
261,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I think that applies to patents and everything else.,47
262,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Exactly. The word "" in d u s t r i a l "" is used, I am informed, in the Tasmania^ Act, and also, I believe, in the South Australian Statute. It certainly makes clear the purpose for which a design may be used. A comparison of this clause with the definition clause in the English. Act will show that it contains substantially what is found in the latter, but that it is framed in a clearer ancl more explicit form, so that anv business man may know exactly what he can register as a design.",47
263,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Angas) [8.6] - I can understand the object in view in framing the clause in this way; but the point is whether that object will be attained. I have endeavoured to point out to the Committee the possible danger of this definition. The same method is adopted in the Copyright Act, the Patents Act, and also, I believe, the Trade Marks Act, and we have found that the perfecting of the English expression in connection with definitions is faulty. The Committee will remember that that was our experience in connection with the definition of ""trade mark."" The definition in the Trade Marks Bill was an emendation, it was said, from the latest English Statute, but on close examination it was found to be nothing of the sort. I am merely pointing out that in many cases we may not attain our object in making these departures. Unless the draftsman is particularly careful to see that he has condensed the essence of various English definitions, there mav be a clanger which, at of an the moment, he did not anticipate-of the object being, to some extent, varied.",47
264,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs.) [8.9] - I move That the words, "" or any judge thereof,"" line 4, be left out.",48
265,Mr MCCAY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Why should they be omitted ?,48
266,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Because we are investing the Court only, and not an individual Judge, with jurisdiction. We have power to invest the Court of a State with jurisdiction, and clause 39 deals with applications which may be made to the Supreme Court of a State. Amendment agreed to.

268,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"No ; I explained, in moving the second reading of the Bill , that it was not intended to create a separate Department. Clause agreed to. Clause 9 (Designs Office).",48
269,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Angas) [8. n ] - This clause provides for the establishment of sub-offices in every State, other than that in which the Designs Office is established. Such a provision is satisfactory, if it be properly administered. I would remind the Committee, however, that there is a similar provision in the Patents Act, and also, I believe, in the Trade Marks Act, and that it was not until pressure had been brought to bear that sub-offices were established under the last-named Statute. The head office was at the Seat of Government, and, I think, it was proposed to have a sub-office in Sydney. In all the other States, however, there were to be mere agencies, the records kept at those agencies being far more meagre than was necessary for the information of those concerned. I do not know that even yet the necessary information is obtainable in the sub-offices relating to patents, although, at the request of certain commercial bodies in South Australia, I forwarded their remonstrances to the Minister, and he consented to adhere to the provisions of the Act by creating sub-offices. What appears to be still wanting at the sub-offices is a complete registration showing the applications and the entries, that are made from week to week, so that by examination a person, say, in Adelaide, can find out what is being done just as if he had made the examinat tion at the principal office. I am informed that the necessary work of registration and indexing can be done in. the sub-offices without involving much extra expense. If that be so, I hope the Minister will see that it is carried out, not only under the Patents Act, but also in connection with this measure. The information required at the sub-offices, under the Patents Act, is not complete, or, at all events, it was not a fortnight ago. I made inquiries, and was informed that it was possible from week to week to make the necessary entries in the register kept at each sub-office. If that can be done, I hope the Minister will see that it is.",48

288,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Angas) [8.17] - I doubt - that the clause is intended to give the right - of appeal from the refusal of the Registrar to register an application. No such right of appeal is given in the Imperial legislation, and, as we profess to be desirous of securing uniformity in our laws - on subjects such as this, we should not - depart from the terms of that legislation. Of course, if uniformity is not desirable, - we may make what alterations we please. Section 90 of the Imperial Act of 1883 is as follows: The Court may, on the application of any son aggrieved by the omission, without sufficient - cause, of the name of any person from any register kept under this Act, or by any entry made without sufficient cause in any such register, make such order for making, expunging, or varying the entry, as the Court thinks fit; or the Court may refuse the application. To my mind, those words apply to the rectification of an error in connection with - an entry. As I understand the English Act, the decision of the Board of Trade in regard to applications is final; but if an - error has been made in an entry, as by the omission of the name of a partner, an appeal for its rectification can be made under the provision which I have read. In any - case, the intention of the measure should be - clearly expressed. It would be easy to say, if that is the intention, that an appeal shall lie from any decision of the registrar under clause 25. Clause agreed to. Clauses 26 and 27 agreed to. Clause 28The owner of a registered design shall, within two years after registration, substantially use the design or cause it to be substantially used in Australia in the manufacture of articles, and if he fails to do so the copyright in the design shall cease.

291,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Is it intended that, if a design is being used in manufacture abroad, the period within which it must be registered and used in Australia shall be six months?",49
292,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [8.25] - The clause was modified in the Senate. It provides that the owner of a registered design shall substantially use it, or cause it to be used, in manufacture in Australia within two years of the date of the registration; but that if a man having registered a design in Ausper- tralia uses it in manufacture, say, in France the period within which he must use it in manufacture in Australia, in order to preserve his copyright in it, shall be reduced to six months from the date of registration. The clause follows the principle of the English Act. If under that Act a man registers a design in England and manufactures abroad, he must, to preserve his copyright, use it in England within a certain time.",49
293,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,A manufacturer abroad may wish to protect a design in Australia.,49
294,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Then he must manufacture in Australia within six months from the date of its registration here.,49
295,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Cannot a manufacturer abroad protect a design in Australia without manufacturing here?,49
296,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"That question raises another point. The clause deals with the case of a man who, having registered in Australia, uses the design in manufacture abroad.",49
297,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,That clear.,50
298,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I think that it is. Clause 17 provides what designs may be registered. Under it only new and original designs, which have not teen published in Australia before the lodging of an application here, can be registered. The clause with which we are now dealing provides for what must be done after registration has been effected. Mr DUGALD THOMSON Svdney) [8.28] - If a British manufacturer be pirated. of tweeds wishes to register a design Australia to protect himself from the imitatected tion of his goods by local manufacturers, can he do so without manufacturing here ?",50
299,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,No .,50
300,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,The Bill does not protect manufacturers abroad from the piracy of their designs in Australia less they manufacture here.,50
301,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Excep t under the special agreements dealt with in clauses 48 and,50
302,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"It appears to me that the effect of this clause is nullify the provision in clause 48. Are to understand that the Bill protects only designs used in manufacture in Australia, Britain. or will it protect, either under the international arrangement dealt with in clause 48, or, generally, designs registered here an owner who is not manufacturing in tralia ? For instance, a copyright may be obtained in Australia under the Copyright Act, although the subject of copyright not produced in Australia. Why should we adopt a different principle here, andl refuse ownership of copyright, unless the goods are manufactured in Australia ?",50
303,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"If the honourable member will look at section 54 of the English he will see that we have followed the wordtralia, ing of the Imperial provision.",50
304,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The wording of the Imperial provision is difdesign ferent from that contained in the Bill . reference is made to the "" use in manufacHe ture."" Suppose an English manufacturer registered a design applied to tweeds and sent them out here. The provision in Bill requires that the design shall be in manufacture in Australia within six months.",50
305,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Surely the honourable member does not object to the provision that the owner of a registered design shall, is not within two years after registration, substantially use the design?",50
306,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"No ; I am not objecting to that, but to the enactment in the proviso that if a design is not used in manufacture in the Commonwealth it shall be cancelled. A manufacturer might register here a design for goods manufactured in Great Britain, but unless he used the design in manufacture in the Commonwealth within six months, his copy(North right would expire, and his design might I am perfectly sure that in foreign designs are registered and proin Great Britain, although the goods upon which they are used are not manufactured there. That may be done under an international arrangement. Under the Bill it would not be possible, even under an international arrangement with Gre'at Britain, or any other country, to protect a undesign registered in Australia, unless the goods were manufactured here. I had no idea that it was intended to make such a 49. \wade departure from the principle embodied in the Copyright Act. I think that we ought to extend to British manufacto turers the right to maintain their copyright we of designs here, and that Australian designers should enjoy similar rights in Great",50
307,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Darling Downs) [8.40] by The proviso to which objection is taken is Ausmerely a re-enactment of the English law. The first part of the clause deals with registered designs. If a person in Australia is registers a design, and does not manufacture in Australia, or elsewhere, within two years, he will forfeit his copyright. That is only right, because the registration of the design may prevent other persons from using it. That provision seems to me to be reasonable and just. Let me put another Act case. A man may register a design in Ausand after registration may not use the design in Australia, but may manufacture abroad. He may neither use the in Australia nor import into AusNo tralia the manufactured article bearing it . may simply keep the design on the register, in order to block others from using it in Australia. The clause provides that, the if that course be adopted, the period of used protection shall extend over only six months. The provision to which the honourable member for North Svdnev takes exception is contained in the English Act, which reads as follows:If the registered design is used in manufacis ture in any foreign country, and is not used this country within six months of its registration in this country, the copyright in the design cease.",50
308,Mr KELLY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The words "" in manufacwealth. ture "" are not used in connection with word "" used "" upon its recurrence in the provision.",51
309,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"No ; but ""used in manufacture "" is meant.",51
310,Mr MCCAY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The words "" in manufacture "" are deliberately omitted after the word "" used "" in the second line.",51
311,Mr KELLY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Will the Minister adopt be affected? the English provision?,51
312,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I prefer to stand by the the clause as adopted by the Senate, as understand, on the motion of Senator Symon. I think the clause is quite reation sonable. If a man takes advantage of the law and registers a design here, I think sign has lapsed. that it is only fair to require that he should manufacture here.",51
313,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,That principle is not applied to copyright.,51
314,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"A copyright is different altogether, because a play, a poem, or remedy, then? book is in itself protected. On the other hand, a design is merely applied to artiBill cles which are manufactured, such as clothes or carpets. If the registration a design were permitted to stand irrespecto tive of any condition as to manufacture within the Commonwealth, the course of trade might be seriously interfered with, because persons who might desire to make which providesuse of a design would be prevented from doing so. In effect, we propose to say, "" If you ask for a monopoly you shall return for the concession be called upon to use the design in manufacture in this country.""",51
315,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,The limitation would be all right if it were similar to that imposed by the English Statute.,51
316,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The English provision in designs. is intended to apply to the use in manufacmanufacture ture in the same way that our provision A manufacturer might have a factory in the United States,, and, by registering design in Australia, absolutely prevent any other person from using it.",51
317,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Why did not the Government make a similar provision in regard to patents? All the Minister's arguments apply equallv to patents. [76],51
318,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Patent s are different altogether. A patent is a contrivance which used in some particular industry. For in instance, it may apply to gold-mining, and there are strong reasons why a person who shall obtains patent rights should be compelled to use his patent within the CommonI f we give a special monopoly to the a man, he should certainly be compelled to use the design which is the subject of a monopoly.",51

321,Mr MCCAY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Unde r this clause, how would the passing off of imitation goods",51
322,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"There is a provision in Bill which declares that if a design is I registered and any person infringes it by knowingly passing off a colourable imitaof it, he shall be liable to a penalty.",51

326,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I do not think so. The provides that under such circumstances the copyright shall cease, and thereafter of there is nothing-so far as I am awareprevent the design from being used.",51
327,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Angas) [8.46] - I should like to direct the Minister's atention to section 13 of the Copyright Act of 1905, The copyright in a book means the exclusive right to do, or authorize another person to do, in all or any of the following thingswhich it then proceeds to enumerate. I do not think that that provision is contained in the Imperial Copyright Act, and if I recollect rightly, we had a big fight upon it . In this clause, the same principle seems to be adopted in regard to copyright It declares that a man must in Australia or he will not be is. entitled to the use of his design.",51
328,Mr HUGHES,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"West Sydney) [8.48] a This provision may operate fairly enough in respect of some designs, but in respect of others it will operate very unfairly. Let us take the case of a man in England who register a design for a carpet or a wall paper, and who wishes to introduce it into this country - If he does not manufacture it in Australia within six months of its registration, he will be afforded no protection whatever. Now, it is obvious that he could not manufacture in the Commonwealth a wall paper or a carpet 'for. which he had registered a design within six months from the date of such registration. TQ obtain the necessary machinery to enable him to do so would involve the expenditure of many thousands of pounds. Consequently, he would enjoy no protection whatever. I can readily conceive that there might be many instances of that kind.",51
329,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,We might impose a limitation as to the use of any design in Australia.,52
330,Mr HUGHES,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,It is very obvious that to use an article is a very different matter from manufacturing it.,52
331,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,It is the registered owner who has to use it.,52
332,Mr HUGHES,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Not at all. The use of a thing, I take it, means its consumption.",52
333,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,The provision means use by the registered proprietor of the design or under his authority.,52
334,Mr HUGHES,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"In that case, "" use "" and "" manufacture "" are - synonymous terms. Clause 28 providesThe owner of a registered design shall, two years after registration, substantially use the design, or cause it to be substantially used in Australia in the manufacture of articles, and if he fails to do so, the copyright in the design shall cease. Provided that if such design is used in any manufacture abroad, the period aforesaid shall be limited to six months. I am bound to say that the provision is not very clear, and in my opinion the Minister's explanation does not cover some of the cases suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney. Certainly it does not cover cases in which the article could, under no circumstances, be manufactured in Australia within the prescribed period.",52
335,Mr MCCAY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Corinella) [8.53] - I am not prepared off-hand to agree with the Minister's claim that this provision substantially follows the lines of the Imperial Act. Certainly, the section in the Imperial statute is rather peculiar in its phraseology. It readsI f a registered design is used in manufacture in a foreign country, and is not used in this country the words ""used in manufacture"" not being repeated. It seems difficult to speak of "" using a design"" except in connection with manufacture, but when we find that the words "" in manufacture"" are used in the first part of the section, and omitted from the second, we are justified in believing that a Court would probably hold that the Legislature intended to make some difference between those two parts.",52
336,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I do not think so.,52
337,Mr MCCAY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I think that the Court would seek to ascertain if there was a difference in meaning between the two terms. Consequently, the Minister's claim that he is following English legislationhas scarcely been established. But the main question at issue is as to whether this clause is reasonable. I must confess that a person who is manufacturing abroad, and sending his articles to Australia has not any very strong claim to our protection in the matter of his design. If he wishes a quid pro quo he had better give the quo before he' accepts the quid, or, at any rate, within a reasonable time after he has received it. Of course, the Patents Act provides similar-thoug h not by any means identical-protectio n to the patent.ee of articles which are manufactured abroad. Certainly, if there be a choice between the clause as it stands, and no such provision, I shall support the clause. At the same time, I think that the Minister might reawithin sonably consider whether in the cases which have been raised, the clause would not operate unfairly - to those who arte 1 sending into Australia goods which are manufactured abroad. I have no overwhelming love for foreign manufacturers as against local manufacturers, but, at the same time, I have no desire to see injustice done. In conferring benefits upon Australians we ought to see that we do not inflict injustice upon others.",52
338,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"North Sydney) [8.57] - If we are determined to grant protection to our manufacturers, we should not give effect to our intention in Bills of this character. We have ample power to protect our own people by means of the Tariff, and by other means without endeavouring to accomplish that end in an indirect way in a measure for the registration of industrial designs. I would ask the Minister how he can justify the granting of patents for articles which are not manufactured in Australia in the light of his statement that we should not register designs relating to goods not manufactured in Australia? All principles of honest trade support the desirability of designs being registered for the purpose of protecting them fiom piracy. Anybody who is prepared ret register his design should, in the interests of honesty, be protected from the pirating of a competitor. Then, as the honourable and learned member for West Sydney asked, "" What protection will be conferred by this clause upon the person who cannot manufacture here?"" If it be impossible for him. to do so",52
339,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Impossible from what point of view?,53
340,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Eithe r because so small a quantity of the goods is used here, or because the climatic conditions are not suitable, or because the material from which a particular article can be manufactured, is not obtainable in Australia. What protection is such an individual to be afforded against his competitors ?",53
341,Mr STORRER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,He will not require to be protected in that case.,53
342,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"May not his designs in this market be imitated by competitors elsewhere? If the Minister provided that there should be no monopoly of a design unless it were used within Australia, I could understand his position.",53
343,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"What does the honourable member mean by ""use""?",53
344,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I mean ""circulated."" The Minister knows perfectly well what interpretation is attached to the word "" user"" in other cases. The clause will tend to encourage dishonesty, and, moreover, it does not permit us to deal reciprocally with Great Britain.",53
345,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,When Senator Symon drafted this clause in the Senate he said I suggest that we should embody in the form of a proviso the substance of the Imperial,53
346,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Will the Minister deny that an Australian can register a design in Great Britain, manufacture his goods in Australia according to that design, and send them to Great Britain, and that that registration will protect him there from the imitations of local manufacturers ?",53

348,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Yes , as long as he is shipping the goods there.",53
349,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I am not prepared to express an opinion until I have looked into the question more closely. The term "" foreign country "" is used, and a great deal would depend on the meaning of those words. [ 6 ] -2 7",53
350,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I am of opinion that such a registration would protect the Australian manufacturer. I do not speak from an absolute knowledge of the law, but my commercial experience leads me to believe that one could protect oneself in that way. If that be so, there should be some reciprocity. If under an international arrangement such an advantage be given to Australia by another country, that country should secure from us a like, privilege. According to my reading of the Bill, however, that will not be possible.",53
351,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Any reciprocal arrangement made in Great Britain will give only a right to register, and the consequent rights which the Act confers.",53
352,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,And this measure will deliberately deny the right in question.,53
353,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"No ; it will provide for exactly all reciprocal arrangements made. Mr DUGALD THOMSON. If the Minister can assure me that neither in Great ""Britain nor any foreign country can an Australian register a design and be protected in that market in respect of goods made by him according to that design in Australia Mr MCCAY.^Senator Symon took the view of the English Act, that goods made according to a design registered there must be manufactured in Great Britain within a limited time.",53
354,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,The definition of the English Act does not bear out that view.,53
355,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I shall leave the honourable and learned member for Angas, with his legal knowledge, to deal Act. with that phase of the question. When a person invents a design-especiall y if he be a British subject-and registers it here, he should not be prevented, even when there are no manufacturers of goods of that design in Australia, from taking action against competitors elsewhere who may be pirating it and using it to his detriment here. There should be an opportunity to protect a design in such circumstances, and I feel convinced that such a right is granted in Great Britain.

It has been stated by the Minister and other lawyers in the House, that perhaps the wording of the clause at present covers such an appeal ; but how .the use of the word ""rectification"" applies to such appeals, I am at a loss to understand - I find on referring to a dictionary, that rectification means, "" the act of rectifying or setting right that which is wrong.""",54
364,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,And the register is wrong when something is omitted.,54

375,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I have.,54
376,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I think that one of the sub-sections of that Act clearly shows what' the Court has to do as to rectification. The Encyclopcedia of the Laws of England, Volume 4, refers to this question. It states, at page 235I f the comptroller grants the registration, he gives a certificate which is prima facie evidence of what it states (Act of 18S3, ss. 40, 96); but after hearing the applicant, he may refuse registration, a i d from his decision-there is an appeal to the Board of Trade. Opponents are not heard; if any party is aggrieved by registration, his remedy is to apply to rectify the register. All this is done under section 90 of the English Act of 1883. It relates, not to a registration that has been refused, but to one that has been made. The Court steps in and rectifies the register where an entry has been wrongly omitted. It is undesirable, however, to be cocksure on these matters, and perhaps the postponement of the clause may enable the question to cleared up.",54

392,Mr MCCAY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Corinella) [9.30] - The position is no doubt complicated by the desire to pass legislation in this particular form in order to fall into line with international conventions, but I think that the point raised by the honourable member for North Sydney is well worthy of consideration. If some design occurs to the mind of a person in England and to the mind of a person in Australia at about the same time, and the latter applies for registration, the former may subsequently apply for registration, and secure priority for his application. It is true that there is a similar provision in the Patents Act, but I am doubtful as to its wisdom. It is conceivable that information with'regard to an Australian invention might be cabled to England, and, although application for registration might be made in England subsequent to the date of the Australian application, priority might be obtained by the English applicant. I suggest that the clause should be postponed.",56
393,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I propose to ask honourable 1 members to pass the clause now. We can recommit it if necessary.,56
394,Mr MCCAY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The Minister has alreadyagreed to postpone clause 39, and, as the clause now under discussion would be open to abuses on both sides of the water, it should receive very serious attention.",56
395,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I promise to look into the matter.,56
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Parramatta) [9-35]-- I cannot conceive of any reason that could be urged in justification of this proposal. To enact that a foreigner shall, as a right, have priority, in respect of a sequent application, over an Australian applicant for a copyright of a design would be to the last degree unreasonable. Notwithstanding that a similar provision may be in the Fatents Act and in the Imperial statute, I do not think we should allow the clause to pass in its present form, unless it can be shown that some grave irregularity would arise. I think the clause should be amended by the insertion of the words "" of a subsequent date"" after the word "" applicants."" That would have the effect of giving priority to foreign designs only on condition that they were registered prior to the registration in Australia.",56

It has been suggested by the Parliamentary Draftsman that a new sub-clause in the following terms should be added to clause 25 :The applicant may within the time ancl in the manner prescribed apply to the Supreme Court against any decision of the law officer refusing any application for the registration of a design.,56
399,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"North Sydney) [9-39] - I should like to know whether the Minister will again consider clause 28, and ascertain whether there are not provisions under the English law which permit of the registration in Great Britain of copyright of designs used in goods manufactured elsewhere than in Great Britain? I am not prepared to comply with the Minister's present request, unless an opportunity is given for the recommittal of clause 28.",56
400,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I should not refuse a request to recommit the clause. I shall look into the matter ""as the honourable member desires. MR GLYNN (Angas) [9.40] - Now that the Minister acknowledges that there may be some doubt as to whether clause 39 gives the right of appeal",56
401,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I do not admit that, but I think it is better to make the provision suggested.",56
402,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The Minister is now proposing to give the. right of appeal, although we have never considered the policy of sub- adopting that course. My opinion is that it was never intended to give the right of appeal, and we have never, entered upon the question whether it ought to be 'given.

403,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"North Sydney) [9-44] - I am obliged to the Minister for having afforded' me this opportunity to test the feeiing of honourable members as to whether we should take over with the Meteorological Departments of the States the Astronomical Departments which are now being carried on in connection with them. I do not intend to repeat the arguments I used during the second-reading debate. I desire merely to test the feeling of the House upon the question of whether we should not take over both the Astronomical and the Meteorological Departments of the States. I think that we should do so. If we neglect to do so, it will be an intimation to the States that we are very unlikely to assume control of their Astronomical Departments in the future. Therefore I move That this Bill be now recommitted to a mittee of the whole House. I wish honourable members distinctly to understand that it has been arranged beI tween the Minister and myself that this kept entirely separate. motion shall be regarded as a test one. If it be carried, it will imply that the opinion of honourable members is that the astronomy.

I can see no reason why, at this stage, the Commonwealth should take over the State Astronomical Departweather ments, either upon the ground of economy or of efficiency. The astronomers of States themselves declare that, even if Departments were taken over, one ceninteresting, tral institution would not be sufficient. value. It would still be necessary to have highly-paid officials to continue the scientific work which they are performing. What the people of Australia ask is that we shall pass some practical legislation which will prove of advantage to the producers and others who are concerned in weather forecasts. I have already pointed out that in nearly every country in the world the two services are kept absolutely distinct. There will be quite sufficient to occupy the attention of the officers who will be engaged in our Meteorological Department. If any State officers can the spared we shall be very glad to utilize their services with a view to effecting economy. But the proposal to take over the Astronomical Departments of the States is opposed by Professor Lyle, Mr Baracchi, and Mr.' Kernot. They declare that these institutions are essentially State institutions, and that they are engaged in scientific research of an advanced kind. I believe that it would be a splendid thing for the study of astronomy in Australia if the States, would only conComsent to hand over these institutions to our universities. I feel that the step which the Government are taking is the right one. n other countries the two Departments are In the United States, it is recognised that the science of meteorology is quite distinct from that of That being so, I ask the House to support the Government in their",57

But a knowledge of affects the whole of the States. The association of the two Departments will mean that that close study of phenomena which is imperative will inevitably be thrust upon one side for the the sake of permitting investigation into the astronomical studies which, although most are absolutely of no practical I trust that the House will endorse the view expressed by the Minister.",57
406,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Parramatta) [9.52] - Every argument employed by the honourable member for Echuca was an argument against the inclusion of matters relating to astronomy in the thirty-nine jects upon which we are empowered to legislate under the Constitution. The fact that it has been included is the best answer to the honourable member.,57
407,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,That is the difficulty.,58
408,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"In spite of all the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Echuca, and' which doubtless were urged at the Federal Convention, a decision adverse to them was arrived at. It is not the intention of the supporters of this proposal that this related group of jects should be taken over by the Commonwealth-becaus e they, are very intimately related, not only in the public mind, but in themselves-for the purpose of mixing them up and thus creating confusion. But they maintain that the two Departments may be kept as distinct under Federal as they can be under State control. After all, we must recognise one outstanding fact, namely, that very frequently in Australia a single officer has combined a knowledge of these two services so far as their supreme control was concerned.",58
409,Mr MCCOLL,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,It is a great mistake.,58
410,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I doubt that. I have never heard that the services in New South Wales suffered anything from being under the control of one head, and I have yet to learn that the two services in South Australia were injured from being under the capable control of Sir Charles Todd. That gentleman had the ability to prosecute the study of both of these sciences with marked success.",58
411,Mr BAMFORD,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,There ! was nobody to criticise him.,58
412,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I venture to saythat! there are not many individuals in Australia who are capable of successfully criticising Sir Charles Todd in either of these two branches of knowledge. He had made himself a. master of both of them with great advantage to his own State and to the rest of Australia. If we can combine these related forms of wisdom in one man, is it not better that we should do so? What the people require is to obtain - as great a degree of efficiency from these services as is possible, together with economic management. I know that in this Bill provision is made to take advantage of the services of certain States officers, but I venture to say that the Federal officer who will be appointed will not be able to exercise the same control over them as he would exercise if they were Federal officials. I shall be sub- very much surprised if the work is done as efficiently under, this separate-and it may sometimes be conflicting-contro l as it would be if the control were unified. However, we are required by the Constitution to take over these services for good reasons which were offered to the Convention delegates, and there seems to be no valid reason why, at the present stage, we should separate this group of functions. If we had an efficient central staff, all we should need would be observers in the varisubous States, with a mod'est Department, and a modest position. These observers would be subsidiary to the central bureau. That plan has been found to be a very excellent one in every other Department of business enterprise, from the stand-point of the saving of labour and money, and of contributing to greater efficiency of control. What works advantageously in every department of commercial life ought to work equally well even in scientific circles. I cordially support the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney, in the belief that its adoption would ultimately lead to greater economy and efficiency.",58
413,Mr KELLY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Wentworth) [9.58] - I wish .it to be distinctly understood that I do not support the motion mainly upon the ground of economy. I am entirely in accord with all that the honourable member for Echuca has said concerning the fundamental difference which exists between these two Departments. The services should be kept absolutely separate. They deal with different subjects, and consequently should be kept apart. At the same time, I'fail to see why the Commonwealth should not take over both Departments and keep them separate from each other.",58
414,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Are we ripe for that ?,58
415,Mr KELLY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I think so. The Commonwealth could keep these two great Departments separate just as well as can the States. There is ini the Constitution an implied direction that we should simultaneously take over both services. Sub-section v in . of section 51 empowers us to make laws with regard to .astronomical and meteorological observations-in other words, to take over these two Departments. The implied direction there is that if we take over one Department we must assume control of both. The Constitution links them together as kindred subjects. I do not regard them as kindred subjects, but. nevertheless, I think that the Commonwealth should take over both of them. We can keep them apart under our own jurisdiction. In Australia sufficient importance has not hitherto been attached to the science of meteorology. We could have had forecasts, and in the course of time reliable forecasts for seasons, as well as in regard to local disturbances. When the Commonwealth takes over this great Department, I trust that it will see that it is completely reorganized, and made of substantial advantage to the great producing interests of the 'Commonwealth.",58
416,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Angas) [10.1] - I should like to mention that in the report of the Conference which the Minister circulated amonigst a few honourable members ithis afternoon, it is mentioned that even if the Astronomical Department be not taken over by the Commonwealth, the two branches of astronomy and meteorology will be carried on together by the States. That is a matter which affects my judgment in voting for the recommittal, because, if the two branches are still to be worked as they have hitherto been",59
417,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,The report does not contain that statement. Mr GLY'NN - There is a recommendation to that effect.,59
418,Mr GROOM,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,A recommendation may have been made.,59
419,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I am dealing with the recommendations of the Conference. They say that if the Commonwealth does take over services ? the meteorological branch, it will still be. conducted in Adelaide, and some of other capitals of the States, in conjunction with the Astronomical Department, so that, even if both were taken over, there would no difference so far as administration concerned. It is a misnomer to talk of taking over the Departments. I do know that there is power to take them over. this respect We can practically compel the State to hand over the Meteorological Department by charging for telegrams in connection it, and so imposing upon them an expenditure of ^40,000 a, year which they will not be prepared to face. I do not know a plagiarism. that we could deal with their messages to Mars, or with their communications with the celestial luminaries throughout the verse in the same way. So far as their tronomical Departments are concerned, administration would not be much affected by any boycott that we could place upon them, but we can effectively force their hands as regards the other Departments saying, that as soon as they are taken over by the Commonwealth the free telegrams now sent over our wires in connection with them shall cease. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON (Barker) [10.5] - I was very pleased to hear the tribute paid by the honourable member for Parramatta to Sir Charles Todd. It was most richly deserved, and as Sir Charles has retired from the Commonwealth service. I thin|k one may say very fairly that there never was in Australia a more efficient public officer. His scientific attainments are recognised throughout the world. I intend to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for North Sydney, because the two Departments in South Australia are at present practically conducted as one, and whilst I am sure that their division would have the effect of increasing the expenditure, I am by no means satisfied that it /would in any way add to efficiency.",59
420,Mr SALMON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Laanecoorie) [10.7] I agree with the honourable member for Barker that it is inadvisable for the House to take any action calculated to increase our expenditure. At the same time, I think he will recognise that if we are going to supply the whole Commonwealth with a service which is at present carried on by only some of the States, we must necessarily increase the expenditure in that regard.",59

431,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Are we going to exercise our powers ?,60
432,Mr SALMON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"The Bill provides that the (Commonwealth shall undertake a work which will be invaluable, not only to the people of'Australia, but to those who are trading along our shores. Vast interests will be served by this Department, and think we shall best secure efficiency by moving from the duties of theofficers of the Department of Meteorology another study that from its disturbing effects be found inimical to the interests we desire to promote.",60
433,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Astronomical and meteorological observatories are grouped together in section 51 of the Constitution, which defines the powers of the Parliament.",60
434,Mr SALMON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"But surely the honourable member will not say that because two dissimilar-and they are dissimilar-ser- vices are grouped' together in the Constitution, we are boumd to carry them out as one. The honourable member will agree that we have the option of taking over either or both of them, and' I think that in the absence of a better reason than that advanced by the honourable member for North Sydney, we should not take over the astronomical branch.",60
435,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,Then the hontake orable member thinks that we should never the astronomical departments. take it over ?,60
436,Mr SALMON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I do not think we Legislature, should take it over until it can be shown that practical benefit will result from our no need has been shown. doing so. If the States think that any benefit flows from the astronomical branch, vations to those engaged upon the soil oreither to the Commonwealth or to the rest of the world, they will probably feel disindustry, posed to incur the expense necessary to carry it on.",60
437,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"On this side of the House we are Socialists, and wish to observatories socialize Mr Baracchi.",60
438,Mr SALMON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I believe that this is deep-laid scheme on. the part of the repreto sentatives of New South Wales to secure for that State the services of Mr Baracchi. The States may desire to obtain more formation concerning the heavenly bodies and their movements-no t having at my command the poetic language of the honment. orable and learned member for Angas, I use more prosaicterms-and I am not going to say at this stage that those movements, have no effect upon meteorology. It is. quite possible that they have; but it should be demonstrated to us that they have beforenot we are asked to enter upon the expenditureinvolved in taking over the astronomical branch. We have a duty to performto the Commonwealth in the direction of securing the greatest possible services at the least: possible expenditure. If we take over theconduct of a branch, of science which, soI far as we can see, will be of no real pracretical benefit to the Commonwealth, then, we shall undertake a work which we should ' not enter upon. I am not one of thosemay who believe that the Commonwealth shouldimmediately take over all the services for which provision is made in the Constitution. The fact that these two Departmentsare linked together in. section. 51 of the Constitution is not in itself an argument that we should take both of them over. No service should be transferred unless it can be better administered by the central authority than by the States. The astronomical observatories should be conducted' by the universities-the great centres of 1 learning here. If that course were followed, it would enhance the value of our universities as seats of learning,, and theemployment would be more congenial tothose associated with our universities than it is, perhaps, at present to a number of States officials, who carry on the work of these institutions - But it would be a misfor the Commonwealth, to take over The Bill has already passed another branch of the and it would be a. mistake torus to engraft upon it a provision for which It cannot be gainsaid that the value of correct obser1 the sea-in fact, to those engaged in every and yet to be employed in others-that we hope to see established here-can not be over-estimated.

On the other hand, if we take it over, Tasmania, in common with the other States, will have .to pay her share of the cost, and it will .be beyond the reach of the State Government. I recognise that, if we could afford it, it would be advisable to take over the complete Department, but, having regard ,to the position of Tasmania, I am not prepared to support anything that would in crease its financial embarrassment, which, judging by the Budget statement delivered last night, will be very severely felt.",60
440,Mr LONSDALE,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,New England) £10.15] - It has been argued that the taking over of the astronomical branch would conduce to economy.,61
441,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,That has to be shown.,61
442,Mr LONSDALE,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"I am not referring to the statement of the honourable member for Franklin, who points out that if the astronomical branch be allowed to remain under the control of the States it can at any time be abolished. I am dealing with the question on broad lines, and it appears - to me that we shall increase the expenditure of the States as a whole by allowing the astronomical branch to remain, under their control whilst we take over the Department of Meteorology. If the astronomical branch is taken over by the Commonwealth it will be possible to have a chief astronomer, with his administrative staff, at the Seat of Government, and merely observers elsewhere, who will send the records of their observations to the head office for classification. This will save expense in administration. In any case, the meteorological work may be, and should be, kept apart from the astronomical work. It is much the more practical, and therefore the more immediately useful of the two. With regard to the objection of the honourable member for Franklin, Tasmania will have more to pay, even if we take over the meteorological branch only, because, instead of getting her meteorological information practically free of cost, as at present, she will have to pay her share of the cost of the Commonwealth Department.",61
443,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,But the cost to Tasmania would be still heavier if the astronomical branch were transferred to the Commonwealth.,61

447,Mr HUTCHISON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Hindmarsh) [10.19]. - I shall vote with the Government against the recommittal of the Bill , because I do not think it would conduce to economy of administration for the Commonwealth to take over the astronomical as well as the meteorological branch. At the present time some of the States are not carrying on astronomical 'work, but if the astronomical branch were taken over by the Commonwealth it would not be long before each State asked for the establishment of an observatory within its borders, which would increase expense. In my opiniom, it isi best for the Commonwealth to first reorganize the meteorological branch, and if later on it is found likely to be economical to take over the astronomical branch as well, that can. be done.

If this fied. multiplicity of small accounts was necessary, I do not know why the late Treasurer did not bring them into operation. I must confess that his precedent as regards the Treasury finances seems to be good enough it to follow. If the Treasurer is familiar with the details in regard to each of the matters mentioned in the schedule, I trust that he will explain why a separate account a is required in each case; why, for instance, there should be a "" Small Arms account,"" as distinct from a "" Small Arms Ammunition account,"" why there should be that a "" Money Order account "" and an "" International Postal and Money Order account,"" why the ' ' Defalcation account"" the "" Guarantee Fund account,"" which are very closely related, should be kept apart. I should think it would be sufficient to have one account for each Department. I have a shadow of a suspicion that the Treasurer has accepted the word of his officials, and that we shall find that he has been too much occupied in considering the large questions dealt with in the Budget speech, to give that close attention to the schedule that it would otherwise have received at his hands. Sir JOHN FORRES T (Swan-Trea surer) [10.34] - I am assured by the Secretary to the Treasury that it is very desirable to keep separate the accounts enumerated.

465,Mr KELLY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Wentworth) [10.38] - It penditure will be necessary to make it clear that the provision in the proposed new section 62a, year."" embodied in clause 13, relates only to the trust accounts enumerated in the schedule.

475,Mr HUTCHISON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Hindmarsh) [10.46] - I am sorry I was not present when this clause was discussed last night, - because it seems to me that such an extraordinary power is here given to the Treasurer that some explanation is due from the Government. I should like to know definitely what power is conferred by this clause. I can conceive of circumstances that would delay an audit .for a short period, but, according to the clause, the Treasurer appears to have power to postpone an audit indefinitely. There ought to be an audit once at least in.every year, except under very special circumstances.",64
476,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,There should be no exception.,64
477,Mr HUTCHISON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"An audit might be delayed because of a tangle in the Audit Department, and if that were so, the longer the Treasurer chose to make the delay the greater the tangle might become.

485,Sir JOHN FORREST,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Mr Whitton This provision, section 10., is made on my recommendation. A similar provision was made in the last New South Wales Act. It is impossible to f u l f il the duty at present imposed. There are many accounts of a relatively unimportant nature, kept by officers who will be included under the wide interpretation of "" Accounting Officer,"" and to visit some of these, even once a year, would cost more than the whole of the money at stake.",64
486,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"North Sydney) [10.50] - I should like the Treasurer to read the provision in the New South Wales Act. I see in the side-note to the next clause a reference to the New South Wales Act, although the clause itself does not contain a safeguard that is in the Act referred to. I intend later on to move the insertion of"" that safeguard. While there may be some reason in what the Treasurer states as to postponing audits in some cases, on account of distance or inaccessibility, it is quite another matter to give the Auditor-General and the Treasurer power to dispense with an audit whenever they like. Sir JOHN FORREST. These things must be considered reasonably.",64
487,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I can remember cases in which Treasurers would have been very glad to dispense with an audit.,64

490,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"It does not necessarily mean upon the application of the Auditor-General. Parliament ought poputo know what is being done in this respect. Audits should not be dispensed with behind the back of. Parliament. We are asked to pass a clause of this kind on the strength of the assertion that it contained in another Act with which may not agree. Even on the application of the Auditor-General, we should not low him, in conjunction with the Treapower surer, to say that an audit shall not be made of what might be important accounts.",64

If he had asked for a reasonable power the case would be quite different.",65
493,Mr HUTCHISON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Hindmarsh) [10.56]. - The Treasurer has not given a satishas factory reply to miy criticisms. may be reasons for postponing an audit in up this matter. special circumstances, but the reply of the Treasurer is that there may be accounts which the Auditor-General does not wish to audit for some time. If the clause were only to apply in special cases, such as those mentioned in the memorandum that has been read, I should not object, but it gives the same power in regard to every account that has to be audited. That is my objection. The Treasurer points out that there is a similar provision in the New South Wales Act. Even if that be so, I am not aware that the finances of New South Wales have been conducted in a manner much superior to that jn which the finances of the other States have been managed. I do not care if there is such a provision in the statute-book of any State. It ought not to be placed upon the ComExternal Affairs) [ n . 5 ] monwealth statute-book. It is a dangerous power, and one liable to abuse. the Treasurer can give stronger reasons than he has done, the clause ought to be amended. Mr KELLY , (Wentworth) [10.58] I - cordially support everything that has been suggested by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. The Treasurer should be prepared either to accept the safeguards of the New South Wales Act, or to agree to postpone the clause. If , on further investigation, he finds that in its present is dhape it is so lax as to be tantamount to we a danger in the auditing of public accounts, it ought to be radically amended. al-If the clause gives the Auditor-General to ignore an audit of important accounts, it ought to be radically amended. Parliament will know nothing about it . Why should we, in dealing with a Bill of this character, concerning the most imporintant functions which this Parliament has to exercise, be subject to the good sense of in any particular officer? Why not put down in black and white what we expect to be ? Of course, we can trust the present put Treasurer. We know that he would not do anything of a dangerous character in with accounts. We all recognise his extreme care whe:e millions are conin cerned. What is the audit of "" a million "" pounds to the right honourable member? of But other Treasurers may not be so extremely prudent. We certainly ought not to entrust so - dangerous a .power to any officers I heartily endorse every word that fallen from the honourable member for There Hindmarsh, and I am glad that he brought",65
494,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"North Sydney) [11.3] - I point out that the words appearing in the New South Wales Act do not carry out the suggestion of this clause. In that Act it is provided that the Auditor-General shall, "" if possible, once at least in every year, make or cause to be made."" That means that it is not there a question of cost, a consideration which the Treasurer desires to introduce, but a question of practicability. For instance, owing to the effects of floods or droughts it might not be possible for the Auditor-General's officers to get to a particular district, and the audit of accounts kept in that district could not take place.",65
495,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Ballarat-Minister of - I wish to submit to honourable members the following Unless amendments, which, I think, will give effect to their desires.

496,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,"Parramatta) [11.7] - The amaidments which the Prime Minister has suggested meet only one part of the difficulty. I pointed out last night that clauses 10 and n , taken together, place the Treasurer practically in charge of the Auditor-General. We have very properly set up the Auditor-General over the Treasurer, and as a check upon him, but in these clauses it is proposed to compel the Auditor-General, if he desires to make a proposal of the kind suggested, to first get the permission of the Treasurer. I can conceive of nothing that would more thoroughly undermine his authority and independence. Unless there is some proposal to bring these matters before Parliament, or to make the Auditor-General responsible to the Governor General, I d'o not think that the amendments suggested will meet the case.",66
497,Mr DEAKIN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS,I suggest that the proviso should readProvided lhat a list of all such cases shall be published in the Auditor-General's report in each year. The Auditor-General would then have the responsibility of seeing that this list was brought before Parliament once in every year.,66
