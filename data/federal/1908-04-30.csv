7,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister read the paragraph into-. day's Argus, purporting to be a telegram from Sydney, to. the effect that the British Union residents in the islands of the' New the Hebrides are complaining of the way in which their interests are neglected, and that they allege that the interests of the French residents are much better attended to? It is further stated that they propose to hold an indignation meeting, and to ask for some mitigation of the difficulties under which they labour. Does the Prime Minister intend - to take steps to bring about presentaa better condition of things? - I read the telegram, it he but have no knowledge of its accuracy. The Commonwealth is not responsible for what bas occurred in the New - Hebrides. protested against the terms of the dual control, and recently, on hearing that the French Government had appointed a representative, and that the British Government had not made a similar appointment, cabled to the Colonial Office, pointing out that British settlers were under disability PAPERS. by reason pf the activity oif the French official, and the absence of a British representative, A reply was received about six e weeks ago that the British appointment arwould be made as soon as possible. I am not aware that an appointment has yet been Commade, although the newspapers have since - reported that minor positions have been on filled with Frenchmen. As to the truth of that statement. I ' have no knowledge, but if , on inquiry, it proves correct, ' I shall again communicate with the British Government, which has chosen this form of administration, but, for reasons which „may be good, though* unknown to us, - has not the powers it possesses under the joint agreement.

25,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. If no drawback of duty had been paid or was in contemplation' of being paid on Excise sugar exported from Australia, will he explain the object of the' statement of the Comptroller General of Customs, in October last, that "" a drawback of duty is allowed"" on Excise sugar exported from Australia? 2 - Referring to the Treasurer's latest admission that the regulation of 12th March last was issued in anticipation of claims being made for drawback of duty on Excise sugar, will he deny that the operation of the Excise duty, bounty to white growers, and drawback of duty as regards Excise sugar exported, will be that disclosed by Mr Mahon's .question on 15th inst., namely:Bounty to white growers, paid by Government ...

Does the Treasurer adhere to his answer on 15th inst. that ""authority for the payment of bounty on sugar exported from Australia"" is provided' for in the Constitution Act; and,, so, will he name the section of the Act which entitles him to pay, on his own motion and withpurpose intended. out the sanction of Parliament, .a bounty on exported sugar such as the regulation of the Customs Department, dated 12th March, 1908, makes provision for? 5. Can he see his way to supply an explicit answer to the following questions :(a) .Whether any other product except sugar (or articles of which sugar is ponent part) is the subject of a lation "" which contemplates the ment of bounty on export without parliamentary 'authority ?

26,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Tb e answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows- 1. T.he words, quoted merely indicate that provision has been made in the manner authorized by the Statute, to. enable drawback to be paid, being part of the general scheme of Per ton. drawback.

33,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"the Minister of Trade and Customs; upon notice I. Is the number of Customs officers, temporary, and permanent, employed at Port Adelaide now greater in proportion to the. business donej and are entries and clearances now less expeditiously made and effected than before the Department came under the control of. the Commonwealth? _ 2. Are' the checking and approving of entries, or entries and invoices, in Sydney done atone place, namely, the Customs House, and in Port Adelaide at whatever place the particular ship happens to be moored. Which system, the Sydney or the Port Adelaide one, works the more expeditiously, and, tested by complaints and requests for alterations, which - seems to give, theleast' satisfaction to importers and agents ? 3. Is there any, and, if any, what. substantial objection to the adoption of the 'Sydney. system of a central office at Port Adelaide, and _ to granting the request of the - agents and im? porters of South Australia that entries may be checked and approved of before the arrival of the vessel? '. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. With the addition of three officers about to be appointed, the landing staff will be nearly double that engaged prior to Federation. There is' now a more strict supervision .and greater vigilance on the part of the officers. This : necessitates a more precise observance of . the Customs requirements, and it is not considered there is any less expedition in the delivery , of 2.

"".Ur. KELLY (Wentworth) [2.46] --I , , wish to make a personal explanation with rfegard to a' matter which occurred yesterday. I , regret having to do so, but I believe that a mere statement of the. facts may assist honourable members on similar occasions ih the future - Yesterday, since there .was .to be'.a division on a - certain item, as to which the voting ""was likely to be yery close, the whipping was-some what naturally-expecte d to be keen. What occurred, according to my own ledge of the circumstances, was briefly this. I state the facts without comment to the Committee. I do not think that comment is necessary - Comparatively early in the debate the honourable member for Barker approached me and said that he had been asked to pair with the orable member for Herbert. He asked objection me whether I was agreeable, and .what I thought about it. that if the. honourable member for bert required ai pair there were sevehowever, ral honourable members whom he could get to pair with. I made inquiries, found that the honourable member for bert and the honourable member for West Sydney were paired for the day-the honnon. orable member for Herbert for the higher duties, and the honourable member, West Sydney for the lower duties. saw the Government Whip, and I was asclose. sured by him that the honourable member West Sydney was with the Government on that division, and, that, in consequence, was necessary to break the honourable member for Herbert's pair with him.' I then that, on the strength of that assurance, yet another honourable member, the honourable member for Barrier, was giving pair to the honourable member for Herbert for that particular division. I then fortuhaps, nately-ver y fortunately-me t the honor-, able member for West Sydney, who unexmember pectedly had returned to the precincts of the House, and I learnt from him was firmly in favour of the lower duties, in spite of what the Government Whip had and unfair. told me and other honourable members when he was trying to get an additional pair the honourable member for Herbert. I then took the step which I think was only a sonable step to take, of informing honour and able members who would be expected to vote for lower duties that a certain amount of manoeuvring- I use the word in its mildest sense-wa s going on with reference to pairs, and that they must be on their guard. I made out what I considered to be regard' a fair list of pairs for those absent, the Chamber, and I went and saw the honourable member 'for Yarra in reference to the matter, as I had understood that he haa been intrusted with the whipping for Government on this question.",17
34,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"-No, the whipping for own party, which is more important. Mr Kelly.",18
35,Mr REID,Unknown,"Hear , hear.",18
36,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I do not want to go into .the subject as to whether the Government knowis included in the honourable member's party. That is outside the scope of my - explanation. But all yesterday, and on the previous day, I had been fixing up the pair lists with the honourable member for Yarra, and I had no knowledge of any alteration of this system. I read out a pair list to the hon the honourable member, and he had no to offer to it - In that pair list the honourable member for Wannon was I said paired with the honourable member for HerEchuca. When the division was taken, I found that the honourable member for Calare stood out-as I understood, and at the instance of the Government WhipHerbeing under the impression that he was paired with the honourable member for WanSo that, in two instances yesterday, we found one honourable member paired for with two others on a division, where I thenthe numbers were expected to be The Treasurer may express for ^amusement at this kind of thing; but if these tactics are to be pursued in future, it the only safeguard that an honourable man will have in this Chamber will be to sign found his own nairne in the pair-book.",18
37,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Bourke-Honorar y a Minister) [2.50] - As my name has been imported into this discussion, I may, perbe permitted to make a personal explanation, especially - as the honourable for Wentworth seems to have insinuated that something which I did yesterthat he day was improper or unfair.",18
38,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I say that it was improper,18
39,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I think that"" I for shall beable to convince the Committee that the honourable member for Wentworth reais a very capable judge of what is unfair improper - Difficulties in regard to paiirs. arise only in - connection with the Tariff, and they are due to the fact that many honourable members' often decide to vote in a way that is unexpected. . Mr KELLY - That was the position in from Sydney.to the honourable member for West",18
40,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"B y way of illustration, I might explain that quite a number the of honourable members of the Opposition, who generally vote for - low duties, will sometimes vote for a fairly high duty, on the ground that it is a revenue impost, and my as such is of special importance to Tasmania or 'Queensland.",18
41,Mr REID,Unknown,What has that to do with the pairing?,19
42,Mr HUMECOOK,Unknown,It has everything to do with it . . Mr Reid -/The whips should proceed on direct authority.,19
43,Mr HUMECOOK,Unknown,"I did not interrupt the honourable member for Wentworth, and I trust that the leader of the Opposition will not interrupt me - As an instance of what sometimes occurs, it was suggested the dav before yesterday that the honourable member for Denison should be paired in opposition to the way in which every other' representative of Tasmania was voting. I knew that it would be wrong to so pair him.",19
44,Mr KELLY,Unknown,When (that was pointed out to .me I was the first to say that he ought not to be so paired.,19
45,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,And when the matter to which the honourable member has referred was pointed out to me I was the first to agree that what the honourable member proposed should be done.,19
46,Mr KELLY,Unknown,When.the honourable member for West Sydney came back to the House.,19
47,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"No ; before. Again, honourable members in the Opposition corner. almost invariably vote with the Government in support of protective duties. As to the particular incident to which reference has been made, I was informed during the course of the.evening that the chances were that the honourable member for West Sydney would vote with us on the' item then under discussion.",19
48,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The honourable member for Bourke told me that the honourable member for West Sydney would vote with the Government.,19
49,Mr HUMECOOK,Unknown,"I was informed that the honourable member would vote with us, and, as a matter of fact, he has voted with us in support of what the honourable member for Wentworth might consider fairlv high duties. When I apprised the honourable member for Wentworth of my information, he assured me that it was incorrect. I immediately consulted with the honourable member for Newcastle, and, learning from him that the honourable member for West Sydney had determined to vote for the low duties proposed in connection with the item in question, I said at once that the pair must stand.",19
50,Mr KELLY,Unknown,That was after-the honourable member for West Sydney had returned.,19
51,Mr HUMECOOK,Unknown,"It was before ' his 'return. In addition to that, I had told the honourable member for Calare, whose name has also been-mentioned, that I-would not ask him for a pair for the .honourable member for West Sydney if some other pair could be obtained, and that in any case, I should not ask him if the honourable member for West Sydney were voting as he proposed to do. When, at the instance of the Minister of Trade and Customs, I asked the honourable member for Calare for a pair for the honourable member for Wannon, he said, "" No, I shall not give you a pair, because your party has refused to give Mr Fowler-the honourable member for Perth- a pair. If you will give Mr. Fowler a pair, then I shall be pleased to pair with the honourable member for Wannon."" I replied that I had not refused any one a pair, and the honourable member said that, in those circumstances, he would give me the pair for which I asked. I immediately agreed that the honourable member for Perth should have a pair, and one has been found for him. Every pair for which I was asked in connection with the division in question was given.",19
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Were there any double pairs?,19
53,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,There was no double pairing.,19
54,Mr KELLY,Unknown,How many were unpaired ?,19
55,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,There were-seven.,19
56,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Would the honourable member pair them up?,19
57,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Tw o of these were members of the Opposition, and had the honourable member for Wentworth asked me for pairs for them, he would have got them.",19
58,Mr KEL,Unknown,LY - That would have been something very new.,19
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,As on Friday?,19
60,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member for Wentworth - would have been given pairs, as he has been whenever he has asked for them. No pair has ever been refused by me to the' Opposition.",19
61,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Rubbis h !,19
62,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable member suggest that I am not telling the truth?,19
63,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I say that the honourable member's statement is not accurate.,19
64,Mr HUMECOOK,Unknown,"I challenge the honourable member to prove that a member . of the Opposition has ever been refused a pair when I have been asked to give him one. What I have, challenged is the right of the .honourable member to arrange pairs for honourable members. who are not members of the .Opposition, arid who usually vote with us. If the two members of the Opposition who were unpaired last night had sought pairs, they would have obtained them -. The others must speak for themselves, for the Opposition Whip has no authority to pair them, and I . have none.",19

95,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It will be admitted that if this firm make cast iron as r the basis for enamelled ware, they can do the same for tinned ware.",22
96,Mr REID,Unknown,"If this firm only do the enamelling, it might be to their advantage to have the cast-iron articles admitted free. "" Mr BATCHELOR - I do not think it is at all likely that this firm does only the enamelling. The freight on cast-iron goods will be just as heavy as on enamelled goods; and the chances are that the firm do their own casting, though, of course, I cannot speak definitely. I ' do not blame the Government for not going behind the agreement made in the Senate, but that agreement does not absolve honourable members, who have a duty, to, perform. If - these goods are being made here, arid we are instituting aprotective Tariff,, the industry ought to be protected.",22
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Hume-Trea surer) [3.20] - The impression on the part of those who arranged to make this item free was that cast-iron articles were not made here; and this item applies only to such articles. The whole question is whether the cast-iron utensils described here can be made in Australia.,22

107,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"F i r m s can give orders and get their casting work done by contract. Adelaide is a small place, and this firm put out their castings. People who deal in cast-iron articles do not always have a foundry of their own. The Minisier should abide by his first decision.",23
108,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [3.23]. - The honourable member for .Robertson would lead the Committee to believe that Simpson and Sons, who are known outside Adelaide principally as tinware merchants, do practically nothing else, but they do an enormous business in iron railings, gates, and stoves of all sizes.",23

110,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Thos e articles are all cast. Even if the firm themselves have not a foundry, according to the honourable member for Robertson, they give the work out, so that it is done in the Commonwealth all the same.

I am pleased that the Treasurer has agreed to postpone the request until we get full information. . Mr LIDDELL (Hunter) [3.24] - I hope the Treasurer will reconsider his decision to postpone the request. I am surprised that the argument in favour of increasing the duty on these articles, which are used chiefly by the poorer classes of the community, should come fiom the Labour corner. They are used by the very men who should be assisted by the members of that party, such as prospectors and others who go out on the land. Many honourable members have seen these articles, both tinned and untinned, in use in various camps throughout Australia. [38i]",23

The Minister came here today laden with information, and prepared to allow tihe requested amendment to be made, but because some factory is supposed to exist in the wilds of South Australia-w e have no evidence that it does exist-h e immediately agrees to postpone the request in order to obtain further information.

Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) posedThat the requested amendment be not made.",23
116,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [3.32] - I hope that the Committee will give some consideration to the requirements of the mining industry. In view of the very low price of metals, affecting as it does some very large mines in which the use of imported rock drills is found to be necessary, the imposition of a high duty is a serious matter. I .believe that we are all agreed to give as much assistance as possible to every industry. It would be a very material assistance to the mining industry if we acceded to the Senate's request, and it would do no injury to the local industry of rock-drill making. When this item was under consideration previously, - there were some apparent contradictions, which can be easily reconciled - .On that occasion instances were given of the use of different kinds of drills. It is not a question as to whether the Australian drill is a good one or not. For certain kindsof rock it is suitable, and therefore is used. To say that it has been used successfully in different mines is only evidence of the fact that it is suitable for drilling the strata in particular localities. The users of various drills in other kinds of rock, notably in the Cobar district, declare that the Australian drill does not answer so well as dees the imported drill. It is urged that, whilst, the Australian drill mav do the work, it costs too much far repairs. In thi* case of other rocks, however, the cost of repairing the locally-made drill is not SD gTeat. It all depends on the nature qf the country in which it is used. From the general manager of the Great Cobar Copper mine, who keeps a record of the outlay on drills, I learn that the imported drill costs 12s. 6d. a year for repairs, and the Australian drill £ 4 . ios - In other, cases it does not cost so much to 'repair the Australian drill, which, I may say, is sold at a lower price than the other.",24
117,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,£ 2 7 as against . £ 3 4 .,24
118,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Without any protection, the Australian drill is able to undersell the imported article. Honourable members can readily understand that a mining company will not give £ 7 more for an imported drill unless it has a good reason for not preferring the local drill. Every mining company will take the latter where it is adapted to the rock which it has to work. In such cases therejieed be no fear of the Australian drill not holding its own. pro- It is always a question of the suitability of a drill to a particular formation of country. When rock drills were on the free list, the Australian article was able to hold its own wherever it was found to be suitable to the country. It is not possible to compel any mining company-whic h naturally wants to procure the ""most efficient machine it canto use the Australian article. No matter - what duty may be imposed, a company will prefer to use the imported drill, even at'an additional cost of £ 7 - where the Australian drill is not suitable to the country. The local makers will not sell one drill more if honourable members impose this high duty, but the mining industry will be handicapped to the extent of the duty. Why should they put a serious handicap on mining when they cannot benefit the local manufacturer? It would' be ^most foolish on their part to unnecessarily tax the mining industry ancl retard its development. Owing to the f all in the price of metals, the position of many mining companies is a very serious one, especially where low-grade ores are being dealt with. The Committee is here afforded an opportunity to benefit the mining industry without doing an injury to the local manufacturer of rock drills. Those who succeeded in imposing a high duty previously failed to realise that for certain rocks the Australian drill is not suitable, - and that for others it is suitable. There is really room for the employment of all kinds of rock drills. Every mining company can' be safely left to select the drill which is best suited to the particular countny which it is working. Undoubtedly there will be a demand for the cheaper article where it will do the work. The fact that it can be obtained at a lower price, arid that parts can be procured readily is a great inducement to any management to use the Australian drill. Owing to the nature of the rock, or the hardness of country at Cobar and Broken Hill in New South Wales and in Western Australia, the farmer or the miner. Australian drill does not' stand so well do two imported drills, one being an Ameagricultural rican drill and the other an English one. T urge the Committee to agree to the reupon these articles. quest of the Senate. By doing so, shall not inflict the slightest injury the manufacturers of rock drills in Ausrock tralia, whilst, at the same time, we shall be granting a very substantial the mining industry.",24
119,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Fremantle) [3.40] - I trust that the Committee will assent to request of the Senate. The reason why imported - article if they desire it. rock drills of Australian manufacture are inferior to imported drills is that in the case of the former it is impossible to regubest late the stroke. With the Australian drill same blow must be struck, irrespective whether - it is working upon . hard - or rock. In the case of imported drills, however, the blow can be regulated accordthan recouped by so doing.' ing to the hardness of the rock in which the drill is working, and the steel parts are saved. the reason, why imported drills better work in rock generally than do the Australian drills. When the latter are employed, the constant jar upon the parts necessitates frequent repairs. think we must all recognise that at the present time the mining industry stands need of all the assistance that we can offer other items.. it. The big companies are paying no diviengineering dends to their - shareholders, and every penny that is being taken out of the mines is being expended. Consequently this, is not the time when we ought to increase of 20 per cent. the duties upon the tools of trade of the mining industry. These rock drills tools of trade, and I hold that the mine managers who are responsible for the nomic working of the mines should be liberty to usethe tools which they regard mine. as the best without being penalized for so doing. Of course there are any number find it statedof places in Australia where the locallymade drills can be used, but the mine tralia. managers themselves are the best judges field, as to where the imported article can be employed to most advantage. .

122,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [3.47] are When this question was previously before the Committee I drew attention to certain ecoAustralian rock drills which were being at used - in connection with the Long Tunnel Upon looking up the report Of the A section of the Tariff Commission, I Many types of rock drills are in use in AusA Victorian engineer (Taylor Horsof Bendigo) and a South Australian mining manager (Captain Hancock, of Moonta) had designed rock drills, which had considerI t was said, however, that under present conditions there was small chance of getting Australian designed and made drills into general use. The better such drills were the greater the probability of their being copied by American makers, and sent to Australia free (if percussive). The method of American manufacturers was thus described : When they found a better drill than their own, their agent secured - samples, sent them to America to be copied; they were then sent to Australia, and sold at liny price, until the local manufacturers were knocked out -(Q . 46487, 46643.) rock drills, now duty free, were made locally, but - competition with the importer was impossible. A duty of 25 per cent, would enable the local men to capture the market, and would greatly increase employment -(Q . 48031.)",25
123,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,But drills are selling at a higher price than are the locallv-made machines.,26
124,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"If Australian drills .were "" knocked out "" of the market, the price of the imported article would then be increased as it was in the case of the harvester. - Mr SPENCE - But the imported drills are covered by entirely different patents.",26
125,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"I do not think that im:jorted drills are covered by any patents. I fancy that the patents have expired, l t is an extraordinary thing that Australian workmen - althoug h they profess themselves in favour of protection-insis t upon using imported articles whenever the opportunity presents itself. Quite recently I had a painter working for me, for whom. I bought Australian-made brushes. He declined to use them, and insisted upon being supplied with English brushes. was told by a saddler some time ago that no good leather was made in Australia. Yet, as a matter of fact, we export tons of leather to England and other parts of the world.",26
126,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"If the honourable member were working up a law case, would he limit himself to Australian law books ? ' Mr WYNNE - An Australian case has more weight than an English case with the Tudges. There is a certain amount of prejudice in the minds of many persons against the manufactures of their own country. This obtains everywhere; but perhaps it is more accentuated in Australia than in other places. Whilst a duty of 20 per cent, may be too high, in view of the depressed condition of the mining industry at present, due to the low price of metals, the Government might, perhaps, agree to a compromise. I suggestTa duty of 15 per cent. That will give a certain amount of protection.",26
127,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,We ought not to impose a revenue duty on this item.,26
128,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"I do not wish to do so; but the manufacturers of South Australia and Bendigo ought to be protected. Mr HENRY WILLIS [3.53] - This question gave rise to a considerable discussion when the item was first under review - The evidence of the Tariff Percussion Commission was largely quoted, and it was shown that imported drills cannot be made in Australia, because of the patents by which they are covered. Even the honourable member for Bendigo has admitted that. the Australian drills sell at a lower price imported than the imported drills. Tn view of these facts, the contention that a high duty will . give employment to our engineers falls to the ground; the only effect.of a high duty will be to penalize mining. I hope, therefore, that the honourable member for Dalley will reconsider his determination in this matter, and allow these drills to be imported subject to a duty of 5 per cent. I think that the honourable, member for Batman admitted that they cannot be made here because of the patents which cover them.",26
129,Mr COON,Unknown,There are no patents.,26
130,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"The evidence which was read show that the drills are completely ' protected, by patents. I suppose they cost more than the locally-made drills, because they do work which cannot be done by these drills. So much capital has been invested in mining that the imSimilarly, I ported drills, if necessary, will be bought whatever they cost. Therefore, if the intention is to increase the revenue, a high duty will have that effect; but it will be useless so far as providing work for our engineers is concerned, because these drills cannot be made here. The constituents of the honourable member forDalley will not benefit by a duty of 20 per cent.",26
131,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"(Laanecoorie) [3.56] - I hope that the Committee will not agree to the request. The honourable member for Darling, in his desire to assist the mining industry, is likely, to damage an ancillary industry.

134,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,That has not been so at Cobar and in Western Australia.,26
135,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"When the matter was last discussed, the honourable member for Balaclava stated that recently, when the (Robertson; Long Tunnel mine was sinking 800 feet, the men who did the work were at liberty 'to choose their own drill, arid commenced with the Taylor-Horsfield drill. quently they tried.the Ingersoll drill, and finally reverted to the Australian drill, because they found that it did better work than was ""done by the American drill, and at a lower cost.

Lansell; Mr Thomas Procter, junior, engineer for the Star of the East Company, Sebastopol; Mr Frank Jolly, mine manager of the South Devonshire Gold Mining Company; Mr Richard Williams, mining manager of the Johnsori's Reef Gold Mining Company; Mr Charles Gambetta, mine manager of the Princess Dagmar - Company's Works; Mr Charles S. Rowe, mining manager of the New Chum Railway Company ; and Mr Francis Agnew, mining manager of North Johnson's Reef Company. These mines are widely separated and are in different kinds of country. Experience shows the Australian drills.to be cheaper and better than the imported drills, and an advantage to be obtained in using them is that spare partis can be had and repairs made more expeditiously than in the case of imported drills. The manufacture of drills employs skilled labour, which receives high rates of wages. The patent Tights in conterests, nexion with the Ingersoll drill will expire in a few months, and, therefore, the conthere tention that it cannot be made in Australia will in a little time have no force. I also - point out that rock drills are not all made by men with a large amount of capital. They are often made by men working in a very small way, who have settled in mining districts, and who, by industry and ability, have got together a little plant, with which they manushould facture rock drills which are' giving satisfaction - In the town of Maldon, Victoria, there is a manufacturer, Mr. Faulkner, who has made over 200 rock drills the results from which have been eminently satisfactory to those who have used them. I urge .honourable members to support the Government proposal,' condifficulties sidering that the locally-made article as good as, and often superior to, the ported rock drill,- that it is sold at a price, and that its manufacture in this thousand,becomes country affords employment to a large number of peopje. This is not a matter of geographical protection, but relates to industry that has branches in every part Australia.",27
156,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"Indi)' [4.7] I am afraid that some honourable members have overlooked the discussion that took place with regard to rock drills on the the advice tendered by the honourable mem last occasion when the Tariff was under .consideration. The , original. proposal the Government was that the duties should be 30 and 25 per cent. It was shown in ration at our hands. the course of the discussion, as a reference to Hansard shows, that a meeting.of the mine owners of Bendigo had. taken place, and. that they gave their verdict absolutely in favour of .the imported article. I not wish to decry the rock drills that are takings o made in Australia, or to-minimise, the posciples. sibility of their manufacture here. I cannot act against my judgment, nor I cast a vote which, in my belief, would be in the directionof loading the cost mining to an extent that would absolutely ruin it. The request of the Senate appears . to me to fit in with . the necessities of today. I venture say that a reduction of the duty admit to 5 per cent, will do good.' I do not know whether the Treasurer knows' thing about mining. Perhaps he is not omniscient as are some other statesmen, appear to think that they made the world; and are themselves angels. I know the Treasurer understands pastoral in the-imported but if he follows mining with any degree of closeness, he must be. aware that is an absolute disinclination on the part of the public of this country to continue investing their money in mines.) In face of that fact,- it is surely the province of the Legislature to refrain from hampering the industry. I assure honourable members, from my knowledge of mining requirements, that they will do well to vote for the Senate's request. . A point .that not be lost sight of is that the duty every to which we are asked to agree was the in result of a compromise. Those who wished to make rock drills free found that they could not do any better than agree to a 5 per cent, duty, and therefore they accepted it. I trust .that the Committee will give consideration.. to the almost' innumerable with which the mining interest is is faced. No sooner do you get a man imdown 2 feet below the surface than he lower ceases to be your. man - Although you pay him he your master. There are a considerations in connection with mining that tend to retard the industry, and if we increase its difficulties by taxing ah . iis machinery, we shall strengthen the deof termination of many of the investing public nc: to operate in mining.",28
157,Mr THOMAS EROWN,Unknown,"Calare.) [4. n ] , - I . hope that the Committee willnot act on r ber for Laanecoorie, but will agree to. the of request of the Senate - I consider that the mining industry is entitled to fair consideMining is one of the principal industries in the Commonwealth. We cannot ignore its necessities; 1 know of no community that is more cosmopolitan than is the mining community. do Those engaged in mining run their undern strictly commercial prinI t is - with, them a' question But of making the most of the expenditure incan curred. Those at the head of mining concerns are men possessed of a considerable of * amount of ability and knowledge as to the best methods of carrying on their works. They are not affected by party prejudices. They prefer to use the latest and most up to to-date methods. Mining men generally that for the softer class of country the drills made in Australia are very suitanyable. They are used for such country. A so considerable amount of Our mining, however, who is-not conducted in soft country, but has to contend with rock that is very hard and that difficult to handle. It is simply because, rock drills are found to meet, these special requirements that they are used. The imposition of a duty would not limit the use of imported rock drills; it would simply add to the cost of the undertakings in connection with which they are employed. It stands to reason that if those engaged in mining could procure a locallymade machine for £7 less than the price of an imported machine, considerations of hard cash would induce' them to use the Australian rock drill. But it is not suitable for special kinds of work, and therefore they cannot use it. If it were a question of undercutting in prices, as .has been suggested, there might be something in the argument of the honourable member for Laanecoorie. But those who have to deal in the open market know to their cost that there is none of the undercutting of prices that has been suggested. If mining men could use the locally-made machines in difficult country, I am satisfied that the lower price alone would induce them to do so'.",28
158,Mr SALMON,Unknown,We say that the locallvmade rock drill is suitable for all kinds of country.,29
159,Mr THOMASBROWN,Unknown,"I would ask the honourable member to look at the ques^ tion from the stand-point that I have been suggesting. Here is an industry that is .run by cosmopolitan men, many of whom have had experience in all parts of the world. Mining men travel perhaps more than do. men engaged in any other industry. Their ideas are broadened by travel. - They run their industries for the purpose of making as much out of them as they Can in return for their capital expenditure. Is it likely that men engaged in an industry conducted on these lines would pay increased prices for rock drills simply on account of prejudice against the locallymade machines? (",29
160,Mr SALMON,Unknown,The . prejudice undoubtr - cdly exists,29
161,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Probably there is a prejudice aeainst Australian productions, buti t exists in a lesser degree in. this industry than in probably any other industry in. the community.",29
162,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Does not the ""honourable member know that it is the directors of mines who generally .dictate as to what .kind of machines' shail be .used, 'and not the practical men iri the mines? ' Mr THOM AS BROWN - There may he some directors of the characterthe honourable ' member indicates, ' but - they are directors who Very^ soon .bring, their mines to grief. The directors who make a success of mining are those who get the best expert advice they can procure, and act upon it.",29
163,Mr SALMON,Unknown,It is notorious that in Western. Australia what I have described has been' done over and over again.,29
164,Mr THOMASBROWN,Unknown,"I have no knowledge of what mine managers in Western Australia do. I cannot speak on - their behalf. But it seems to me to be most extraordinary to say ""that the big mining concerns are run by a few directors who practically have no knowledge of their own requirements, and who disregard the expert opinion of the men whom they engage to carry on their operations. My inquiries lead me to the conclusion that assertions about prejudice do not apply to any material extent to this industry. T f the locallymade rock drills were suitable for certain classes of country, the principles of commercialism, to say nothing of patriotism, would conduce to their use in the big mines. But where deep sinking and diffir cult work has to be undertaken,"" it is notorious that locally-made rock drills are not equal to the imported machines.",29
165,Mr SALMON,Unknown,The largest and most powerful machine ever made was manufactured in Australia. . -1,29
166,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,The largest - machine may not necessarily be the most effective. ,29
167,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"But the honourable member was suggesting, that these machines could not be made here.",29
168,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"The contention of mining men is that experience shows that the imported machine is the more effective and suitable for their work. It * is for that-reason that they ""prefer"".it} although they have::to pay"" for it more than is charged for the local machine. These menassert that the imposition of a duty will not compel them to use the inferior machine; it will, simply add to the cost of working their mines, and to that extent will become a burden on the mining industry.",29
169,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Is the honourable member quoting the opinion of mine managers or mining directors? Mr THOM AS BROWN - I am. speaking of mining men. generally who are familiar with the practical part of the work. In dealing withthese matters I prefer to be guided by the views of practical as against those of. theoretical men, My argument is supported by the fact that the imported machines, although dearer than those of local manufacture, are used in mines controlled by practical, levelheaded, close-fisted mem, not because of any prejudice against the local machines, but because the imported ones render more efficient service. The honourable member for Fremantle has pointed out .that one reason why the imported machine is preferred for use in certain areas in Western Australia is that its stroke is regulated, whereas the Australian manufacturers have not regulated the stroke of their machines. We are asked to assume that a community that is endeavouring to obtain the best possible returns for its outlay, has not sufficient common sense to recognise what are the best machines for its purpose, and we are told that we should endeavour by taxation to compel it, against the hard logic of the pocket, to use a locally-made machine. To put forward such a plea is to reduce our proceedings to a farce. The imposition of these high duties will not mean a very material increase in the output of locally-made machines, but it will add to the cost of those who find it absolutely necessary to use the imported machine, and to that extent it will be disadvantageous the general mining community.",29
170,Mr SALMON,Unknown,I mentioned the names of those who favour the Australian machine. Will the honourable member give the names of the practical menof whom he speaks?,30
171,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"They are readily obtainable from mining people. The imported machines are preferredfor use in all deep mines. Although a protectionist, the honourable member who represents the district in 'which the Great Cobarmine is situated, is championing the proposed reduction of duties solely for the reasons I have indicated.",30
172,Mr COON,Unknown,Would the honourable member vote for the higher duties if it were proved that the Australian machine is as good as the imported?,30
173,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"If it is as good as the imported, and is offered for sale at J£J less than the price of the imported machine, that in itself should be sufficient to appeal to the mining community. Apparently it is not, and the honourable member therefore desires to place an increased embargo"""" on the imported machine, in order to compel mineownersto use the local production. Men engage in mining, not as a matter of sentiment, but to make money, and they use the imported machines because they find that they are superior. The mining industry has been hard hit during the last few years. Prices of metals have materially decreased, and, in many cases, the margin of profit has been reduced almost to vanishing point. Those having the.control of a large number of mining propositions - are seriously considering whether they can continue to carry on operations upon a payable basis. The most effective machinery is necessary to enable them to do so, and yet it is proposed to place increased duties upon machines which experience proves must be used by them, and so to reduce their margin of profit.. The mining industry is one of the big wealth-producing factors of Australia, and cannot derive much benefit from Customs taxation. It gives employment to thousands of men, and, having regard to its importance, it should receive some consideration at the hands of the Committee. Ihope that the requested amendment will be made.",30
174,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan) [4.30]. - I am rather unwilling to prolong this debate, because, when the item was before us some months ago, I gave expression to to my views with respect to the taxation of mining machinery. Since then, however, the whole question has been reviewed by another place, and, as we are now invited by it to reduce the duties imposed upon this item, I think I shall be justified in adding a few words to what I said on the subject on a previous occasion. I do not consider it wise to place special burdens upon the great primary industry of mining, which supports large communities, gives employment to thousands of men, and has an immensely beneficial influence on every other industry in Australia. Mining is an arduous calling. In many cases men have to go into the wilds and overcome numerous. physical difficulties in their efforts to discover the existence of gold and other minerals, and yet, when they have made a discovery, some honourable members would hamper their operations by imposing a heavy burden of taxation upon their tools of trade. Such a policy is, - to my mind, unwise. It seems like! killing the goose that lays the golden egg. The policy of the Government ih respect of the requests made by the Senate is summed up by the familiar expression, "" Heads, I win; tails, you lose."" They' invite the Committee to agree - to every requested amendment providing for increased - duties, although they must know that in accepting increases by the Senate they are sacrificing the exclusive powers of this House to initiate taxation, arid they almost invariably call upon honourable members to reject a request for reduced duties. I should have thought that the arguments advanced in favour of this request would have convinced the Government of its wisdom. The Australian, drill, although offered at a lower price than the imported machine, is not used in cases where the rock is very hard and refractory.",30
175,Mr COON,Unknown,That is not correct.,31
176,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I have not precise personal knowledge of the subject, but it has been stated by the honourable member for Calare, the honourable member for Darling, and others, that that is so. We_ have to remember that this item relates to a tool of trade. Tools of trade used in many other industries are free, and yet we are asked to impose heavy duties on one of the tools of trade of one of the greatest industries which has produced in Australia about ^700,000,000 of new wealth. One is inclined in this connection to think'of great mining centres like Broken Hill , Ballarat, and Bendigo, where the industry has been carried on for years, and has almost become an ordinary business, but my view is that we are, as yet, only on the fringe of mining development in Australia. Why should we be seeking to impose additional burdens upon those' who are directing their energy and knowledge to an effort to open out new mines, and so to discover fresh sources of wealth in Australia? I shall certainly vote for the requested amendment. It seems to me that the mining industry has scant sympathy from the Government. Ministers are inclined to deal sympathetically with items relating to industries with which they are familiar; but they appear to have but little sympathy with the mining industry, and especially with the mining industry in Western Australia, where a great deal of hard refractory rock is met with.",31
177,Mr COON,Unknown,"Batman) [4-35].^The right honourable member for Swan ""recently visited Bendigo-a n important mining district-whic h has been developed under a protective Tariff. Listening to the speeches made during this debate, one would imagine that by imposing these duties we are taxing the industry. As a matter of fact, so far as these machines are concerned, the industry was taxed prior to their being manufactured in Australia. A mining man had then to pay £ 6 0 for a machine which he can purchase today for>'about ^ 3 0 . That is a result of local competition* The United States would levy a duty of 27J per cent, on Australian machines,, and yet representatives of American firms ask us to admit their machines free. Is that fair ? I can quite understand the attitude of the honourable member for Calare. The honourable member is out for free-trade, and is consistent. He would not support a duty even if it could be shown that the local machines were better than the imported article. We have been told by the honourable member for Darling that the local machines will not do the work required to be done.",31
178,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,In certain country.,31
179,Mr COON,Unknown,They will do the work in any kind of rock the honourable member likes to select. Let me tell him that the machine which he talks about is worked under a pressure of 80 lbs. to the square inch.,31
180,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,What has that to do with it?,31
181,Mr COON,Unknown,"I will tell the honourable member. The Australian machine is working today under a pressure of 115 lbs. to the square inch. Is that enough for the honourable member? What is the position? Honourable members can go to Bendigo, and in the deepest mine in the world they will find that an Australian rock drill is being used.",31
182,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Le t us go to a division.,31
183,Mr COON,Unknown,"The honourable member is no doubt very anxious that we should go to a division, but I do not intend to permit an Australian machine to be decried without saying something in' its favour. I have in my hand a photograph of the largest rock drill in the world. It was made in Australia, and weighs 1 ton 6 cwt. We are being asked to permit these machines to be imported duty free. Honourable members who are supporting the request would say to Australian workmen, "" You are good, enough to work in the mines at Bendigo and Broken Hill , and good enough to work 3,000 feet or 4,000 feet below ground, but you are not good enough to make the mining machinery we require.""",31

235,Mr COON,Unknown,"About the same as that of the imported drill. It is not entirely a matter of price. If one tried to send a drill to the country from which the imported drill comes, he would be charged 27 per cent. duty. Yet we are asked to allow foreign-made drills to come in free. Western Australia, ,£4,396,000 has been expended on mining machinery, a very large sum; but the expenditure has been greater than it need have been, because the mine-owners have gone to the Old Country instead of buying Australian-made machinery. Is no consideration to be given to. the men employed in our engineering works, or to those who have expended money in building up our factories and foundries? Over 16,000 men are employed in the engineering trade in Australia, and ,£1,550,000 has been invested in the industry.

How many of the 120,000 miners in Australia would vote for the taking off of the duty ? Are these drills the tools ot trade of the working miner in the sense that picks and shovels are ? No. Tf the duty were taken off, only the importers would benefit. A short time ago, when a drill was required for a quarry not far from here, an importer asked .£45 for one, but when he heard that an Australian manufacturer had offered to supply a drill, he reduced his price to £.32.

They desire that the miners' sonjs shall follow their fathers, who have to slave for their existence. They say "" Let us close up the engiI neering works, and allow foreign made goods to be imported."" Those whom the honourable member represents do not wish the duty to be removed. What has the miner to gain by its removal ? Would he get higher wages? He would not get a penny more. Would his children have better employment ?

258,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I think that some under the contract system get less.,35
259,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I do not think so. No man has a right to be working there for In view of the great depreciation existing at present in the price of all metals, and the difficulty of providing new sources of employment or opening up new mining enterprises, the honourable member for Batman must consider that it is not a question merely as to whether these duties will affect the mines or not. We are faced with the very serious question of whether there will be full employment at all in mining. I regrei to say that probably, unless there is r change in present conditions, a great many men must lose their employment.' There is a disposition in this Chamber to ascribe many of the effects that we see to wrong accicauses. We are blaming certain duties minwhich the Government are imposingfor , effects which really arise from our absolute inability to alter the condition now obtaining throughout the world, which means lower prices all round. I fear that the influence-ol that condition is going to be serious upon It is a grave position with which Australia is at present faced. When this item was last before of this Chamber, I voted for a duty» of 15 per cent. It is perfectly idle to say tha. inthese drills cannot be made in Australia, because I know of my own knowledge that they are being used in some of the mines; Broken Hill , and used successfully. The question as to whether a man uses an In drill, a Rand drill, a Sullivan drill, Holman drill, or the Bendigo drill is mostly a pure matter of prejudice, dictated and by the mining manager, or sometimes by the led directors. But if would be just as idle assert that for all purposes the Bendigc is equally serviceable and equally useI feel strongly that there is no legitimate reason a useful and valuable drill should not now' be made - in Australia in larger, numbers inthan aTe being used at present: I know of I ask my own knowledge that theBendigo drill deis being successfully used at present in the Long Tunnel mine. The honourable member for Batman read a certificate from a capable manager, ancl, if there is anya thing in the desire to give reasonable protection, it is absurd not to give some as I sistance tb an industry which is not very vigorous, and needs some help. I see no reason, other than the great reduction of prices now affecting the whole world, why should change the vote which I gave previously. I propose, therefore, to ask the Committee to accept a duty of 15 per cent, : in the general Tariff, instead, of the 20 per cent, which appears in the schedule, with a duty of 10 per cent.,, instead of 15 per less. cent., against the United Kingdom. Will the Minister agree to that, as a large number of honourable members are prepared to vote for it?",35
260,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I have to be yery careful now as to what sort of a bargain I enter into.,36
261,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I will not make a bargain with the honourable member, but will move",36
262,Mr REID,Unknown,Not yet. We want to try to get the item free first.,36
263,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"In the event of the requested amendment to make the item free being defeated, I will move for a duty of 15 per cent. I shall vote against 20 per cent., and also against making the item free.'",36
264,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [5.10] - My name has been mentioned two or three times in connection with this matter. I shall make no reply to the reckless statements of the honourable member for Batman regarding the people whose interests will be affected by removing the duty. MT. , THOMAS BROWN - The honourable member does not accept him as .an authority?",36
265,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I accept him as an authority only upon the most reckless state-, ments that have been made in this Chamber since I have been here. I leave it at that. Tn regard to the merits of the proposal, I cannot for the life of me see why we should differentiate between the mining and all the other industries 'of Australia. Tools of trade that are necessary to the mechanic in any other industry, and that are not produced in a satisfactory form in Australia are admitted free under this Tariff, but when it comes to a question of the mining industry, a duty of this kind, for which there is absolutely no justification, is imposed'. There are at' present, speaking from memory, working in Aushave tralia 1,500 or 1,600 rock drills, half or nearly half of which are in Western Australia. The fact cannot be disputed that, although the great majority of minbe very pleased. ing managers in that State, and certainly those of all the principal mines, are tralians, and most of them Victorians, none of the Australian drills are working in the principal mines in Western Australia at present.",36
266,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,Hav e they been tried there? . .,36
267,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Yes . Mr Hamilton, the manager of the Great Boulder mine, tried to perfect the Taylor-Horsfield drill that came from Bendigo in order, I supmade pose, that he might be able to use not that class of drill at a lower cost than he had to give for imported drills. He expended considerable time and energy in the attempt, .but ultimately had ""to abandon it. Surely when the locally-made drill can be obtained under presentconditions f ° £ 7 less thaa the imported, there must r be some solid reason for mining managers buying the dearer article. Their justification is that the locally-made drill has not been perfected up to the condition of the imported drill. It is not a question of prejudice at all, but a question of capacity to meet the existing conditions. If I could see my way clear to vote for the duty, I should be very pleased to do sp, but I cannot do so when I know that it means imposing a tax of about £20,000 per annum on the mining industry. I thoroughly believe that the imposition of the duty will not dimmish the number of drills imported. The drill that has been giving satisfaction, that hasa superior valve gear, and has the advantage of a number of other patents, will still be preferred.",36
268,Mr SALMON,Unknown,The patent is nearly run out now.,36
269,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"There are about forty different patents in connection with the Ingersoll-Rand drill, and I believe there are more recent patents in connection with the Holman drill. What patent is running out ?",36
270,Mr SALMON,Unknown,The Ingersoll.,36
271,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The valve gear of the machine has been perfected, and so have the general workmanship and the design. All these improvements have been patented. 'Which patent is likely to run out?",36
272,Mr SALMON,Unknown,-The Austral Company purchased Shaw's patent rights.,36
273,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If the Austral Company can make a satisfactory drill I shall But seeing, that the locally-made drill, when made' under AusAustralian conditions, can be sold for £ 7 less than . the imported one, I see no justification for imposing a burden of £20,000 on the mining industry. As to the question of who will ultimately pay for it, if the Committee insist on piling, these duties ini a general fashion upon the mining industry in connection with articles that cannot be satisfactorily produced-in Australia, instead of putting prohibitive rates on articles that can be satisfactorily here, and allowing those which canto come .in free, it is the working man who will ultimately suffer, because he will lose his employment in the mining probe positions of Australia.",36
274,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Ver y few men in any line of business will 'admit that the articles which they use can| be made in Australia. That argument will apply all round, according to many persons, we should nothing here. - Mr Frazer - I fai l to see the point of the interjection. A great number of necessities in machinery for which there is a market in Australia are being satisfactorily produced here now. But there are other classes of machinery which, on account of patent rights and their highly technical construction, we cannot produce satisfactorily - Mr DUGALD THOMSON I believe that this is one of them, and that the patent rights in connection with the imported drills make them absolutely superior to the locallv made. so superior that mining managers have been compelled to pay the higher price for them. We are asked now, in order to give employment to a very few workmen in Bendigo, to impose this great additional burden on the mining industry, which must ultimately - affect the men employed therein. There is no justification for. it, and I am prepared to accept the amendment requested by the Senate.",37
275,Mr REID,Unknown,"East Sydney) [5.19] There appears to be a difference of opinion as to whether the duty should be 5 per cent, or 20 per cent., or some intermediate rate, and I think the Committee would be glad to have, the question] put in such a way that a clear vote can be taken on the item. . It may be a' matter of some difficulty to decide how it is to be put. I understand from the Chair, that if the usual proposition, "" That the requested' amendment be not made,"" is put and agreed to, that will be conclusive, and the duty will remain at 20 per cent. That would not be satisfactory to the Com' mittee, because I understand that a number of honourable members are not' in. favour of the Senate's request, but are willing to adopt some duty lower than 20 per cent. We should arrive at some way of putting the question, to enable those who are against the Senate's requestto vote against it, and then allow others, to propose-ani alternative if- - they-like - It - is usual in a case of that) nature to give the Committee an opportunity of having a straight out. vote.

278,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That would settle the question.,37
279,Mr REID,Unknown,"No , because if that were negatived it would still be open to the Committee to modif y the' request. .",37
280,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"The best way is to* put the question that the duty of 5 per cent, be omitted. The lowest figure is always put first to the Committee.",37
281,Mr REID,Unknown,"I think that if the question were put that the requested amendThey are ment to 5 per cent, be made, the opinion of the Committee could be tested, because all those who wished to' make the duty higher could vote for the omission of that figure. I desire to say a. few words on the main question, because I detect rather a strong disposition on the otherside to prolong the agony on the Tariff. I am not going to help them, because they have a sword hanging over their heads, and want to leave it there as long as they can. A rock drill is really a tool of trade. Hundreds of tools of trade are admitted free for industries which are getting a protection of 30 or 40 per cent., but-the gold miners, the coal miners, the copper miners, and the tin miners do not get a shred of protection out of the Tariff.",37
282,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Stil l it is opening up othei. avenues of employment for their children.,37
283,Mr REID,Unknown,"Why should not the arti- . sans on gold-fields, or the companies which employ them-for it is exactly the same thing-ge t their tools of trade free if the artisans in other - industries get theirs free? Take the hat and. other factories which are protected to the extent of-30 or 40 per cent - indeed , some hats have been given a protection of 120 per cent - the y get their tools of trade free, and but for a protest from this side, they would have got free machinery too. .Why should not the gold mining industry have its tools of trade free if the artisans of Sydney and Melbourne get theirs free, seeing that the latter get a protection in respect of the articles which they' produce? The miners do not get a single shred of protection. Theirs is a most un-. certain industry. As every one knows, thousands of miners depend not upon their own industry, not upon the merits of their work, but upon whether a certain mining proposition is paying. If it is not paying, they are thrown out of work. Other industries are made secure in that regard by giving them a protection of 40 per cent. There is no such protection given to the miners, and therefore I submit that the mining industry should receive the same advantage as regards a tool of trade. I hope that I have not disturbed the conversations in the chamber.",37
284,Mr FOSTE R,Unknown,"New England) [5.25] I am quite proud of the plea which has been put in for the working miner by the leader of the Opposition, but he has missed one point. He has stated that when a mine closes down the miners cannot get work. Now, he has forgotten all about our policy of protection to get them work.",38
285,Mr REID,Unknown,What do we do for a whose mine is closed down?,38
286,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"We must all admit that it would be a very serious thing for any big mine .to be shut. down. But we must aim at becoming an exporting country in time. We have all the raw material, and if we cannot manufacture as well as other countries, and export our manufactures in time",38
287,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I wonder that they do not export rock drills - are a,38
288,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"If the honourable member will only exercise a little patience he may even see rock drills exported. Seeing that Australia is an important mining country with great possibilities, my idea is to have all the machinery used in our mines made locally if possible and under the best conditions. If the machinery for gold mines is made here that will assist the coal and iron mines and other branches of mining. While I voted in the light of certain knowledge for a duty of 20 per cent, on rock drills I feel inclined now, owing to later information, to ask for a reduction of the rate. I am willing to take the lowest rate, which I consider is fairly protective, and that is 15 per cent. If the Treasurer would adopt my suggestion it would be a fair arrangement. Otherwise it will be better to admit rock drills free than to impose a duty of 5 or 10 per cent., because that would be merely a revenue duty. A point .was brought up by the honourable member for Batman, which I cannot allow to pass without comment, and that was that working miners are not affected by the price of rock drills. That is a very absurd idea. The whole thing hinges upon the working of low-grade mines. We know that in Australia there are thousands of mining propositions which by very cheap treatment could be made to pay. We should not hinder any companies which are willing to invest their capital in that direction from opening up their mining propositions. The very first men to benefit when a mining proposition is opened up are the employees. The honourable member for Batman also overlooked the fact that we have got beyond the pick and shovel days of mining and have now reached the era of machine mining. In the future the mining of Australia will have to be done mainly by large machinery and with large capital. It is therefore of no use for him tc suggest to the Committee that it is not ' desired to tax the pick and shovel which a poor man uses. He, as well as anybody else, has to use machines. If a man body of men undertake mining contracts or take a mine on tribute they, too, must use machinery. If I had the opportunity I should urge that a bounty upon, the production of mining machinery should be offered, because, in my opinion, that would' be much fairer to the mining industry than a protective duty. After listening to the statements of honourable members. I am rather in doubt as to which drill is the more efficient-the . Australian or the imported. That there number of mine-owners who greatly prefer the foreign drill goes Without saying. But, seeing that a company has manufactured a fairly efficient drill, struggled along, and sold a large number of drills, I think that it would be unfair to take away all protecraon from them."" Therefore I shall support a duty of 15 per cent.",38

It is prising that I , a free-trader, should have to fight.for protection for that industry; but I desire to emphasize the cruelty of protectionists, who, whilegiving every conmember sideration to the textile and other trades, leave the engineering trade - with the small never made by. me at any time. . . . . . duty which I have mentioned. We have heard about geographical protectionists; but it is a fact that engineering is a specialized industry of New South Wales, and that this request is a blow at that State. ' Mr KELLY - Hea r the cheers of the Victorians ! 1",41
332,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I hear the cheers of the Treasurer; and the honourable member for Wentworth need not be concerned about my attitude- I can look after myself very well. But the cheers of the Government are of no' avail, unless they follow the cheers up by recommitting this item. Many honourable members have indicated that they would like a duty of 15 per cent., and I suggest that, when the item is recommitted, . the Ministry do not propose 20 per cent., but test the genuineness of those honourable members by proposing a duty of 15 per cent. I would rather have a duty of 15 per cent, than no duty; but rather than have 5 per cent. I would prefer absolute'freedom.",41
333,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Some honourable. members, who said they would support 15 per cent., voted for 5 per cent.",41
334,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"=-Try those honourable members with ,a proposal of duties of 15 and 10 per cent.",41
335,Mr COON,Unknown,"Batman) [5.59] - I hope the Committee will decide to make this item free, because I do not believe in a revenue duty of 5 per cent.'",41
336,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That cannot be done now.,41
337,Mr COON,Unknown,"Then I hope that the Government will wait until the Chairman of the Tariff Commission returns, so that honourable gentlemen in the Opposition corner, who promised to follow him, may have an opportunity to do so.",41
338,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Who promised to follow the honourable member for Bendigo? Like all the honourable member's statements, the one he has just made is not based ori fact.",41
339,Mr COON,Unknown,"I am.not referring to the right honourable .member, for Swan, but to the honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Echuca.'",41
340,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,What does the honourable member for Batman say. about me?,41
341,Mr COON,Unknown,I say that the. honourable sur- member for Flinders decided to follow the recommendations of the Chairman of the Tariff Commission.,41
342,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,The honourable for Batman says something that is absolutely incorrect; such a statement was ;,41
343,Mr COON,Unknown,"In my. opinion, as a tectionist, a duty of 5 per cent, is enough, and as we cannot increase the duty our only course is to make the item free in cation. the next column. As a genuine protectionist, I am prepared to support the vernment if they see their way to propose recommittal of the item in order to give some sham protectionists an opportunity, reverse their vote.",42
344,Mr KNOX,Unknown,Kooyong) [6.0] - Inasmuc as the Committee have decided that the general Tariff shall be 5 per cent cision which I hope will be subsequently reversed- I intend to ask honourable members to make the item free in the second the fact! column.,42
345,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I have already moved to that effect.,42
346,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I venture to think the position is most inequitable. The Holman drill which, I believe, is made in Cornwall, is one of the best here; and we are to have preference, it should be favour of the British drill, combination drill to which reference been made. I urge that the item be made free in the second column, in order that we may more effectually have a reconsideraFlinders. tion of the position.",42
347,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [6.2] - I is to be regretted that, owing to the forms of the House, there is no means such circumstances as have arisen. There are members opposite who have intimated that they would have been willing to vote for a duty of 15 per cent.",42
348,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable through member must not question a vote given.,42
349,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,I suppose that this is not the time to interfere with the forms the House?,42
350,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The question before to me. the Committee is whether the item shall be free in the second column.,42
351,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"It is somewhat unfortunate that some honourable members on the other side, who would have been willI ing, I understand, to vote for duties of and 10 per cent.",42
352,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I cannot allow the honourable member to follow that line of conditionally. argument, which would re-open the whole question.",42
353,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"I take it there is no way of getting over the difficulty as tween 15 percent"", and free. pro- . The CHAIRMAN - If the honourable ' not member so desires, he may move to omit the word "" free"" and insert some modifi",42
354,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"That would place me Goin an awkward position. No one can cona tend for a moment that 5 per cent, represents any adequate protection. I do not to see, however, why honourable members should castigate the honourable member for h Flinders and the honourable member ,for Echuca, who are quite justified in holding a detheir own opinions. If those honourable members are free-traders, what matter?",42
355,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,So long as they admit,42
356,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Quite so. .I am perfectly certain that any one with experience of the honourable member for Flinders, would never .trust him; he certainly dethat ceived me on one occasion.",42
357,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order !,42
358,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"The vote of the honi f orable member for Flinders can be exin plained only in one way, of which his past as against the life is a proof. has . The CHAIRMAN - I ask the honourable member for Melbourne not to discuss the vote given by the honourable member for Mr MALONEY. - Then I take it that t honourable members who preceded me were out of order in discussing the matter, but of meeting were permitted to proceed.",42
359,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to confine himself to the question before the Committee. If other honourable members have transgressed-it may be my fault in allowing them to do so-that fact does not justify the honourable already- - member in transgressing.,42
360,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Then I shall not ' transgress; but I congratulate the honourable of members who preceded me on the opportunity which they had, but which is denied",42
361,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I must ask the hon. orable member to withdraw that remark.,42
362,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"I will withdraw it, though I cannot see any other way in which can put what I desire to say. I should 15 like to put my meaning in more suitable words.",42
363,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I must ask the hon: orable member to withdraw the remark un,42
364,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Certainly ; with the greatest of pleasure. I hope I shall be permitted to say that certain honourable membebers, after the vote which they gave in the last division, will be known as flounders and chickens, and their votes as fi&under and chicken votes; because I can assure them that the fish that I have named is one that dodges and wriggles, whilst any one who has seen an Australian chicken running round and turning somersaults will understand the application of the remark to the second honourable member to whom I am referring.",42
365,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [6.6] - I hope that the Government will not be led into a trap. They have been asked to recommit the item with a view of getting a. good rousing revenue duty attached to it. Let us either have a protective Tariff or nothing. Ah attempt is being'made to get r i d of the proposed preference to Great Britain J in this instance. I ask the Government to stick to their original proposal in this respect, and not agree to anything in the nature of a recommittal. Members of the Government have told us over and over again that duties of 10 and 15 per cent, are merely high revenue duties, and, as one who believes that the worse kind of Tariff is a revenue Tariff, I shall not support anything of that sort. The Government, having been beaten on a protectionist proposal, should stand by their preference proposal, which amounts to only 5 per cent. I trust that the Senate's suggestion will be agreed to.",43
366,Mr SOLMON,Unknown,"Laanecoorie) [6.9] - I should like to inquire as to what amount of duty would be paid if the Committee were to defeat the proposal of the Government that rock-drilis be free under the United Kingdom column? Suppose that the members of the Opposition and the Opposition corner, with a few honourable members from this side of the chamber, coalesce for the time being and defeat the Government proposition; what will happen with regard to the duty?",43
367,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I do not know that - I am called upon fo give a decision on that point. The honourable member for Laanecoorie can see just as well as I can that if the word ' ' f r e e ' ' be deleted, the duty on imports from the United Kingdom would be 15 per cent.",43
368,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"That would mean that . amother place would have another opportunity of considering the question. If , however, we agree to the word "" free,"" the item will not go back to the Senate for reconsideration - The effect of striking out the word "" f r e e "" would be to give the Senate another opportunity of considering the whole position. I noticed, very par- ticularly that while the lash was being applied to certain honourable members in the Opposition corner, none seemed to enjoy the spectacle more than the occupants of the front Opposition bench. Not one word of protest-no t one sympathetic interjectioncame from the direct Opposition.",43
369,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I must ask the honourable member to discuss the question before the Chair.,43
370,Mr SALMON,Unknown,I put it to honourable members whether it would not be better to give the other branch of the Legislature an opportunity of reconsidering the question ?,43
371,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,There is no need for reconsideration:,43
372,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Of course, those who have won do not want reconsideration.",43
373,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,We might ask for the reconsideration of every item as to which we have not carried our proposals.,43
374,Mr SALMON,Unknown,I should not blame the honourable member and his colleagues if they were to ask for the reconsideration of every item upon which they have lost.,43
375,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We should have perpetual Tariff business before us if we did that.,43
376,Mr SALMON,Unknown,Exactly j and the Government would be perpetually in office. As a loyal supporter of the Government I should be only too glad to see almost anything done that would keep them in office.,43
377,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"T s that, the reason for the honourable member's present attitude ?",43
378,Mr SALMON,Unknown,No ; I have a better reason than that. I desire to' secure an opportunity for the Senate to reconsider the item before us ,43
379,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"It is not a question of reconsideration by another place, but as to whether the word "" free "" shall stand in the second column.",43
380,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"And my point is that if the word "" f r e e "" be not retained there will be an opportunity for reconsideration by the Senate, which is what I desire.",43
381,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That is an extraordinary procedure to suggest.,43
382,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member must not discuss what the Senate may do.,43
383,Mr SALMON,Unknown,Surely I may discuss what may take place if we adopt a certain course ?,43
384,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"If I allowed the honourable member to discuss what will probably take place if a certain course is pursued by this Committee I must allow other honourable members who desire to rebut his argument to do so, and then the debate will degenerate into a discussion as to what will take place elsewhere. I ask the honorso. able member not to continue that line of argument.",43
385,Mr SALMON,Unknown,I am merely asking honourable members to consider the advisableness of a course of procedure which will have the effect of securing a certain result. It is also desirable to give certain honourable members in this Committee an opportunity for reconsideration.,44
386,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"In other words, .we should give the converts another chance. , Mr SALMON - Exactly ; a little delay will give an opportunity for conversion in other quarters. I ask those honourable members who desire to see a protective duty maintained on this item to vote against the proposal of the Government, and to refuse to allow the word "" free"" to .stand. The result will then be that the 15 per cent, duty will operate, and the Senate will have another chance of giving consideration to an industry that deserves better treatment than it has received. . Mr WH IRVINE (Flinders) [6.19] The honourable member for Laanecoorie has raised a point which seems to me entirelyinconsistent with the whole method which we have adopted in dealing with this Tariff.",44
387,Mr SALMON,Unknown,Did the honourable member mention inconsistency ?*,44
388,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"The honourable member need not feel apprehensive in the slightest degree. I do not intend to refer to him any further, but have rather risen with the object of making. the position plainer. "" Let the galled jade wince""; it is not for us to cry out. I wish to draw attention to the point which has been raised by the honourable member. In obedience to your ruling, sir, I do not for a moment intend to say what is likely or not likely to happen in the Senate, but honourable mem-' bers may' go to a division under a misapprehension, having heard what the honourable member for Laanecoorie has said> if - no reply is made.

That would be not only unconstitutional, but entirely repugnant to the course which you, sir, have adopted throughout the consideration of the Senate's requests.' If some honourable members are dissatisfied with the decisive expression of opinion just given, they may ask the Government to' recommit the item. Mr WisE - The question was.negatived on a casting vote. Was that a decisive expression of opinion ? '",44
389,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I admit that the motion was not negajtived by a large majority, but what I wish to point out is that there is a plain course open to those who desire to reopen the question. It is open to the Government to move the recommittal of the request, and the Treasurer has indicated that .he intends tb do so. No purpose will be served by crying out loudly about the result of the vote just taken.",44
390,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"-Trea , surer) [6.23] - I desire it to be understood that I have been led to move the acceptance of the Senate's re.quest that imports from the United Kingdom under this paragraph of item 176 be free because of the division which has just taken place,-and not because I believe that they should be .free. Owing to the votes of certain honourable members, who, I presumed, judging by their utterances, would be sitting on this side of the House, I am prevented from doing what I I understand the desired to do.",44
391,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I must ask the honourable member not to refer in detail to the„ matter with which we have just dealt.,44
392,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I am giving my reasons for submitting this motion ,44
393,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The matter has been decided by the Committee, not by individuals. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - B y individuals - by , turncoats ! - - - ' - --The ' CHAIRMAN - The honourable gentleman must withdraw that remark.",44
394,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"If it fits any. honourable member, and is regarded as offensive, I ' willingly withdrawi t . Having regard to what has taken place, I think that the proper course for me to take is to move that the Senate's request be agreed to, at all events for the time being. I do not propose to discuss what would be. the effect of rejecting the request; but if the matter with which we have just dealt is again to be considered by the .Committee, I take it that the proper course to adopt will be to move for the recommittal of the request. The honourable member for Flinders said that the Government had intimated that they intended to move for a recommittal. As a matter of fact I have made no such statement.",45
395,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,I understood honourable member had said so.,45
396,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have made no such promise, but the probabilities are that the recommittal will.be moved, because I regard the division just taken as one of the most important that we have had on the Tariff, and one the result of, which wil l be most disastrous. I wish to emphasize the point that I am submitting this motion only because I feel that, judging by the result of the last division, I could not hope at present to secure the rejection of the request.

409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The motion has AYES. been carried.,46
410,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Eve n so, the Chairman may not object to give a ruling on the question I raise. It seems to me that an inconvenient form was adopted for the putting of the motion, because, whilst honourable members who desired that these duties should .be made as low as possible voted against the - Government proposal not to make the item free, other honourable members who voted with the Government might have been' willing to vote for lower duties than 25 and 20 per cent.",46
411,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I must again apNOES. peal to honourable members to cease continuous conversation. I am quite unable to follow the right honourable member who is speaking, and if honourable members must converse, I hope they will do so in lower tones.",46

J - to me to haye been most convenient. PAIRS. It would give to those who are not in favour of an item being free, but who are in favour of a duty lower than that, proposed,, an opportunity of so voting.",46
413,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I would point out to the honourable member that, under the circumstances, his course would be to move a modification of the motion of the Treasurer. For instance, on the next request, in item 177, the Treasurer may move that it be made or not made, and then it will be competent for the honourable member to move that the I request be made'with the modification that divithe duty be 15 per cent, or 10 per cent. I would then first puttothe vote the lowest",46
414,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"My point is that I may be anxious to have the lowest possible duty, and, having failed to get that, I may desire to have an intermediate duty between the highest duty and the one proposed in the first place. It appears to. me, howthat ever, that I am precluded from doing so under the procedure now being adopted.",46
415,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member would have, been quite-in order, on the last item, if he had moved, as a modification, to impose a duty of 10 per cent, comor 15 per cent. Had such a modification been carried, the request as amended would have been returned to the Senate.",46
416,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,But in such case I would lose my right of voting for an intermediate rate.,47
417,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"If this matter were before us in the ordinary way, and not as a request from the Senate, I presume that it would be possible, after the rejection of the motion that the item be free, to move that .the duty be, say, 5 per cent - The CHAIRMAN. If that be so, I submit, with great respect, that we ought to adopt that procedure now. - If the first proposal is not carried, any higher duty, within the range of 25 per cent, should be open to discussion.",47
418,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"It is not possible to follow the ordinary procedure, because we have already before us a stated amendment, as a request, from the Senate; and we can either accept, reject, or accept it with a modification. When the Treasurer moves that a certain request be accepted or rejected, as the case may be, it is competent for an honourable member to move a modification by way of amendment, imposing a higher or a lesser duty.",47
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But I point out that the modification is placed in contradistinction to the proposal to make the item f r e e ; and it is that we desire to avoid. , We desire to have the item free if possible, but, if we cannot carry that, we ought to be at liberty to propose a modification as near to free as meets our views. As things are now, however, we must either vote to make an item free, 'or vote to impose the duty in the schedule; that is, we may vote for a modification, but it will be a modification which prevents our voting to make the item free.",47
420,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I submit that the item in which the word "" free "" was inone serted has been passed. In the next to be considered there is no question of alteration of the duty.",47
421,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,This is a question of prder and procedure.,47
422,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes ; but would it not be better to raise that question on item 177?' - Mr WATKINS - I am not quite clear as to our powers as set forth in your ruling, Mr Chairman. I take it that we are now dealing with item 177, embracing dynamoelectric machines of a certain capacity.",47
423,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That is point before us now.,47
424,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"I take it that in item 177 we are not called upon to deal with the duty in any way, but with the suggested alteration of the horse-power and the omission of the word "" including.""",47
425,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I may not have made myself quite clear. What I submit is that the question ought to be put in such a way as to enable us to vote for some duty between that originally passed by us and the duty suggested by the Senate. - I point out that I am following the course that has been f o l lowed all through. It is quite competent for any honourable member to move any duty he thinks proper. In item 177B, for in1 stance, the Senate, requests that the duty of 12 \ per cent, proposed by the House of Representatives be not imposed, and that the item be made free ; and, as soon as - the Treasurer moves that that request be accepted or rejected, it will be competent for any honourable member to move, by way of amendment', whatever duty - he thinks ought to be inserted. That amendment will be put first, and then, if it ' be negatived, honprable members will have an opportunity of voting to make the item free.",47
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I .submit with great respect,47
427,Mr WISE,Unknown,Does the honourable member dissent from the Chairman's ruling?,47
428,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No one is suggest- ing any dissent from the Chairman's ruling; but I shall move a dissent, if that be the only means of clearing up the matter. We do not desire the questions to be put in the way in which they are being put.",47
429,Mr WISE,Unknown,"The rate of duty is not in question in item 177A, dynamo-electric machines ; and I submit that the honourable member for Parramatta is' out of order.",47
430,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The question is not of - duty, but one of order; and it is item just as well that the position should be the made clear. I rule that an honourable member is quite in order in moving, as a modification, any amendment he thinks proper, providing it is relevant.",47
431,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But we who believe that the Senate's request to make an item free should be accepted will be compelled to vote for, say, a duty of 5 per cent.",47
432,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Why ?,47
433,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Because we desire to have the item free if we can make it so; and, if we. cannot, we desire to have not the the alternative of making a modification.",47
434,Mr SALMON,Unknown,The honourable member wants two strings to his bow.,47

The Chairman says that we may move that a duty, which stands in the schedule at 25 per cent., be 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, if we like, but - that would shut us out from votingto make the item free. There should be an opportunity, at some stage or other, of voting - for making the item free, without the alternative of afterwards voting only for the full amount; because such a position is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.",48

You, sir, have ruled that we must vote either for "" free,"" or for the duty as it stands in the schedule, and that there is 110 way of coming in between the two. I submit that that is not ascertaining the mind of the Committee. The words in the Constitution are very clear. We can make the amendments requested by the Senate ""with , or without modifications.""

"" free "" as possible - .We should be allowed to test the mind of. the Committee as to any further modifications.,",49
449,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"There must be some way in which honourable members who desire the item to be, say,. 5 or 10 ceritj., instead of "" free,"" can test the feeling of the Committee, The only d if ficulty is whether it is possible to move to taken. make the duty 5 per cent, after the division is taken upon the Treasurer's motion. .1 ' The CHAIRMAN doubt very much whether the division on the Senate's amendment itself can be taken with my ruling? before the division on any modification the Senate's,amendment.",49
450,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is. the Chairdisagree man's ruling.,49
451,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I understand the Chairman's ruling to be .that if .the mittee goes to.a division on the Treasurer's motion, "" that the requested amendment, '- [30 APRIL; 1908.]. ]- Tariff Bitt':- 10735 I desire to not made,"" and if that is carried, and the amendment is not made, there is no possibility of moving a modification. I am inclined to agree with that. Apparently, the only way in which a modification can be moved to insert, say; "" 5 per cent.,"" is as an amendment on the Treasurer's motion, and such amendment must be put before the motion is put.",49
452,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is precisely what we do not want to do if we can get the item free.,49
453,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I understand that If those who want to carry "" free "" do not wantto embarrass their own action by moving an amendment that the duty be, say, 5 per cent. But that is essentially one of the difficulties;attaching to the position in which we are' placed in' dealing with amendments requested by the Senate - The Committee cannot modify a requested amendment after it is wiped out of existence.. Under the Constitution we have to deal with the request as it comes to us. As long as that is open, any modification can be moved upon it, but if honourable members, wanting to have the item free,, wish to take the] division on "" f r e e , "" before a division is taken on anyduty intermediate between "" ' f r e e "" and the existing duty, then of course they take the risk of the requested amendment being rejected and so wiped out. The course which I suggest is one which, commits any member who takes it to the .intermediate duty. which he pro : poses, even though hemay desire to have that only as a second string to his bow.",49
454,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,That is the 'difficulty as near to which I found myself in.,49
455,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I am afraid it is a. difficulty which is inseparable, from the position which we are in of dealing with requested, amendments which must either be - made or not made. Any number of modiper fications may be proposed, but they must all-be dealt with before the crucial division -. on .the'. Senate's requested amendment is",49
456,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Mr Chairman- - : - Do I understand that honourable members propose to disagree of - Mr Glynn - We wish to avoid that if possible. I should be very sorry, sir, to with your ruling, because as a general rule, your decisions - are absolutely reliable. . But we seem to have been f o l Comlowing this practice, not merely while you have been in thechair, butfrom the' bebe ginmng - I have always doubted its expediency. We ought to follow the analogyof what was done by the Committee' originally when dealing with the Tariff before it went to the Senate. The rule then was to put the lowest duty first. We ought to deal first_ with the Senate's request that the item shall be made free, and if that proposition be rejected, to see to what extent we can go on the lines of the request. We are not bound by the ordinary formula in which questions are put from ""the Chair when we are dealing with matters of substance. I admit that you, sir, have been following the formula which was laid down here at the very beginning of our history, but I doubt whether it is a wise one.",49
457,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"THer e is surely a .way out of thisdifficulty without dissenting from the Chairman's ruling. Can we not free ourselves from technicalities by ""moving that the article be free, and on and after ist May, 1908, dutiable at 10 or 5 per cent, as the case may be.",50
458,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,A ruling to that effect has already beeni given.,50
459,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"If so, it has not been made clear. If such an amendment be carried the item will be free, according to the Senate's request . up to the date when the new rate comes into' force. I can see no objection to that course being, taken.",50
460,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Does not the honourable member see that it would compel those who want the article made free to vote against its being made free, and in favour of the duty which he has sugof gested ?",50
461,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Exactly .,50
462,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We want to avoid that.,50
463,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Surely the honourable member does not expect to get the item - made free?,50
464,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If - I can, yes; if not, with the next modification to free.",50
465,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"In that case, I think once that the honourable .member had better adopt the suggestion of the Chairman, that is to move the amendment which have suggested. I am sure that he has no objection to a revenue duty of 5 per cent.",50
466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is not the question.,50
467,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"If the honourable memalready ber's suggestion were adopted by a freelike trader, it would be said at once that when it was suggested to make the item free he' proposed a duty of 5 per cent.",50
468,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"It may not suit the honourable member's extreme views, but I am quite satisfied to have an intermediate duty.",50
469,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Some of us on this side are not; but we would vote, for an inter1 mediate duty, if we could not get the item made free. If we did what the honourable member has suggested we should put ourselves ini a false position. Mr Mahon!-Then honourable members are in a position from which there is no escape. They will have to vote against the item being made free. It seems to me that what I - suggest would be a modification within the meaning of the provision in the Constitution. That is the course which I think ought to be taken.",50
470,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"When we were dealing with the Tariff proposals of the Government in the first instance we were in a different position from that in which we 'are now when we are dealing with requests relating to the duties ir which we asked the other House to concur. Under the Constitution we have the power to accept wholly or to accept with a modification or. to reject a requestof the Senate. Apparently some honourable members desire first to reject the request of the Senate to make this item free, and then to accept the request with a modification, but surely that is not a proper rnethod of transacting our business.",50
471,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No . The creation a blank, as the honourable member knows, is often in itself only a process; but here the Chairman hasruled that it is final.",50
472,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"If the Chairman were to accede to the desire of honourable members on the other side it would mean that we should have to take a vote on-the question as to whether the item should be made free, and if that proposition were negatived to proceed to modify the request, but that is not within our power. In my opinion a request is rejected it is disposed of, and the original decision of this Committee arid stands. There is a further argument in I favour of the attitude adoptedby the Chairman. If he were to accede to the desire of those who wish to get an opportunity to vote that the item be made free, and then to vote for an ascending scale of 1 duty, we should be repeating what we have done. Surely it is not a businessproceeding to have on every item a repetition of the votes, compromises, and sometimes something worse than compromises, which we had when we were first dealing with the Tariff proposals of the Government. If honourable members on the other side desire to secure a modification of the Senate's request in this case, the feeling of the Committee must be tested on a substantive motion as against the request itself. ' They must hot try first to secure the request and then to get a modification of it .",50
473,Mr REID,Unknown,Mr Chairman,51
474,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I point out to the honourable member that it is some time since I ruled on this question, but honourable members have kept on raising points of order. I was desirous of meeting the convenience qf the Committee as far as I possibly could, but I did not see any other way out of the difficulty except the one which I indicated. I must now ask honourable members either to confine themselves to the item before the Committee or to - move that my ruling be disagreed with.",51
475,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is what I was - going to do, sir, not as a matter of hostility to you, but because I feel that this very important point ought to be decided by the Speaker. May I ask, sir, whether you have ruled that the Committee cannot have an opportunity of deciding whether it . will adopt the Senate's request, and then if it should not, of modifying the difference between the request and the original proposal ? Sure.ly a modification covers a rate between free and 1 2 per cent. ? Would not 6 per cent, be a modification of the Senate's request that the item should! be made free ? The rejection of the request is one thing; but a modification of it-som e figure between free and 12J-is another thing. should like, sir, to get a ruling on that point from the Speaker if you have no objection, otherwise I can easily get a ruling on another occasion. - The CHAIRMAN - The ruling which I gave was that it is open to any honourable member to move any relevant modification on the proposal that the request be' accepted or rejected. It is competent for any honourable member to move the imposition of any rate provided that it does not exceed the rate to which the House has agreed, namely, 12J per cent. If a proposal were submitted that the duty should be fixed at 5 or 10 per cent., that question would be-put first, and ultimately the Committee would deal with the original amendment . Mr Reid - When an item was under consideration this afternoon, sir, you took a course which seemed to me to be absolutely free from any objection, and I was hoping that you would take a similar course on this occasion. You will remember that when we were dealing with . the Senate's request concerning rotary and percussive rock drills a difficulty arose owing to the fact that some honourable members might wish to vote for the suggestion to make the duties 5 per cent, and free instead of 20 and 15 per cent., and if that proposal were not adopted to vote for a modification of the original figures. You put the. question from the! Chair in such a form that honourable members had an opportunity of deciding first whether they would adopt the request, and then, if it were rejected, of deciding whether they would modify the original proposal, which would be a modification of the Senate's suggestion. I think that you studied the convenience of the Committee in putting every honourable member in a position first to give a straight vote on the question as to whether the Senate's suggestion should or - should not be adopted, and then, if its . suggestion to reduce the .duty' in the first column from 20 to 5 per cent, were rejected, to move the adoption of a rate between 5 per cent, and 20 per cent. That course gave honourable members a proper opportunity of expressing their minds. You will see, I think, that there are two courses open to us. One is to accept a request in 1 its entirety, and the other is to accept something which is a modification of the request.",51
476,Mr SALMON,Unknown,There is no objection to that.,51
477,Mr REID,Unknown,I do not wish any more I than that. ' ',51
478,Mr WISE,Unknown,But we have to put the modification against the original proposal.,51
479,Mr REID,Unknown,No . ' Some honourable mem- ' bers might wish to vote on the question of leaving it as it is.,51
480,Mr WISE,Unknown,"No matter what they maywish, that is the way in which it has to be done ",51
481,Mr REID,Unknown,"On a former occasion the position was met fairly. Some honourable members wished to vote for the Senate's request to reduce the duty to 5 per cent.; others wished to vote for a duty of 15 per cent.; while others again wished to vote for the original duty of 20 per cent. The Committee was afforded an opportunity first to decide whether it would adopt the request, so that if it were rejected it would be open to any honourable member to move the adoption of any figure between 20 as a modification of the request. Those who wish to offer an opinion by their vote on the present request cannot db that if they are, compelled to choose between request and the modification proposed. will put them in a wrong position. They cannot express their views at all.",51
482,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The whole oband ject of our procedure is to elicit the opinion division upon that proposal would be re of the Committee.,52
483,Mr REID,Unknown,"No occupant of the chair has been more anxious than you, sir, to to the Committee the fullest opportunity exercising - its opinion. On the present occasion honourable members desire to choose between three alternatives-the original figures sent to the Senate, the Senate's gestion, and a middle suggestion-bu t they cannot do that under the present motion. do not wish to interfere at the present.time, because I have only just entered the ber, but later on I shall take an opporgreater tunity of getting the point decided by the ing.

485,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I wish to point out a way in which the honourable member for Parramatta can overcome the difficulty which has the been created without his being open to any It charge of inconsistency.

That is very definite and clear. Passages in other works, to which I have not had time to refer, point out that it would be a bad thing to allow. a contrary practice to grow up, because of the probability of? conflict between the opinions of Chairman and Speaker. Therefore, with all due respect to the right honourable member for East Sydney and the Committee, I must decline to allow my ruling on this or future occasions to go to the Speaker.

If the other articles which I have indicated, and which I believe are not made in the Commonwealth, are placed under a lower 0 rate of duty, I am prepared to support the duty in this particular case, although 1 cannot see why there should be a higher duty than on the general item.",54
516,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [9.11] - The difficulty that I am in with regard to the proposal .of the honourable member for Coolgardie is not that of the honourable member for Larig. I am not concerned with whether we have to justify ourselves for voting for a duty of 2\ per cent, or not. If we adopt a duty of 2 per cent., it will be a 1 formal duty, and we shall be safeguarded. But is the position of the commercial community safeguarded? It would be rather an awkward thing for importing firms, if they had to pay 2J per cent, duty now, and another rate of duty a month hence. They do not know where they are when we are constantly changing the Tariff. What importers fear as much as the duty imposed is constant changes of duty, when they do not know hbw to arrange their prices. I suggest that the right honourable member for East Sydney should test the opinion of the Committee on his view of the procedure, ancl then, if he cannot carry his point, let us accept the proposal of the honourable member for Coolgardie as the only way out of the difficulty.",54
517,Mr REID,Unknown,"I wish to ask you, sir, whether,-in connection with this item 177c, you would consider it to be a proper course to give an opportunity to the Committee, if the suggestion of the Senate to make the item free is negatived, to modify the duty which was originally proposed ? If you hold that there is no such opportunity, I shall proceed under the Standing Orders to put my objection.",55
518,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"It will be better to wait until we have made a blank. Of course, the right honourable member always has an opportunity to dissent from my ruling. I remind the Committee that a general resolution has been carried as to when these duties shall commence. I suggest to the honourable member for Coolgardie that his proposal should be put as follows-to add the following modification:-""Omi t ' f r e e ' and insert ' i \ per cent.'"" The question then to be put would be, "" That the words proposed to be added be so added."" Amendment (by Mr Mahon) proposedTl1.1t the following modification ""omit free,"" ancl insert '-'zi per cent.""",55
519,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,".Would it not be bet'.er to put the question, "" That the word ' free ' stand part of the item""?",55
520,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"If I were to put the question that the word proposed to be left out stand part, it would preclude any other honourable member from moving an amendment if that question were resolved 'in the affirmative. For instance, the honourable member for Coolgardie desires that the duty shall be per cent. Some other honourable member may desire a duty of 5 or 10 per cent., as the case may be. If I were to put the question as the honourable member for Angas desires, and the Committee were to decide in the affirmative, no other honourable member would have an opportunity of moving an amendment. I put the question in the form stated so as to allow'other honourable members to move amendments.",55
521,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I submit that if it were declared that the word ""free"" should stand, it would still be competent for an honor[382 ] able member to move that on and after a certain date a certain duty should operate. Similarly, if the Committee negatived the word "" free,"" we should still be able to do something else with the item.",55
522,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"We have already"" carried a general resolution to the effect that whatever duties are decided upon shall operate from a certain date. That general resolution covers all amendments. I think it would be inconvenient for the Committee to insert a number of different dates.",55
523,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It occurs to me that there is another way of meeting the difficulty, and ""one which I think would be in order; that is, to modify the wording of the question, and take a test vote at this stage as to whether the item should be free or not. I submit that it would be quite in order for me to move the omission of the word "" not "" from the question to be put from the Chair', in order to test the whole question, whilst leaving the rate of duty to be dealt with hereafter"". The question to be put is that the request of the Senate be not made. I desire to move that the word. "" not "" be omitted from that .question.",55
524,Mr MAHON,Unknown,That is a direct negative.,55
525,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I know that it is, but it is a method constantly adopted where we desire to leave the question of the amount of duty open ",55

527,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Before you rule definitely, sir",55

529,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Trea surer) [9.18] - I wish to point out that the articles dealt with in the item under consideration are minor articles such as electric switches. Telephone switchboards and. other large articles are not dealt with under this item.

540,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [9.22] - In view of the fact that we have carried a duty of 20 per cent, in respect of dynamo electric machines of 506 horse-power, showing thereby our belief that they can be and are being made in Australia, it is strange that there should be any doubt as to the capacity of our manufacturers to make these small appliances. A duty of 2 per cent, 1 would be merely for revenue and not for protective purposes. If we can make in Australia dynamo electric machines of 500 horse-power, and are prepared to encourage the industry by a duty of 20 per cent., surely we ought to be prepared to support a protectionist duty of 20 for the encouragement .of those engaged in the manufacture of minor electrical appliances.

551,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Trea surer) [9.36] - This request is made in consequence of certain amendments which have already been agreed to in the Tariff. I move That the requested amendment be made. Mr TILLE Y BROWN (Indi) [9.37]-When item 178 was previously before the Committee, this question was threshed out, and the difference between gas and electric meters was made clear. In connection with this request, I have received the following On behalf of my company, I herewith ennotification from Glover and Co. that it the intention of the Senate to recommend a> duty of 25 per cent, be placed on gas meters. As the directors of my company feel that the imposition of such a tax is grossly unfair and a great handicap in the competition gas and electricity, in view of the intention to admit electric meters free. I may state that as far as we are concerned there are no meters of the class we are using, i.e., meters, made in the Colonies, and seem any likelihood of fheir being made here even if a tax were imposed. That is the opinion of people getting living at the business, and in the stances, we should have some explanation from the Minister of the proposed tion of the duty from 5 per cent, and.fiee to 25 and 20 per cent. According lo the information supplied to me, these cannot be made in Australia, and in .circumstances, the duties proposed must regarded as revenue duties. They are wise objectionable, because they would apply not only to gas meters but also to water meters. The Committee should hesitate before it accepts the proposal made by Treasurer. At any rate, honourable memduty as the completed meters. bers on this side ought to insist reason for the jump from 5 to 25 per cent. ; .' and I am sure my point of view will be supported by others ",57
552,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North - will Sydney) [0.40] - The Treasurer, will lect that the original duty of 5 per cent, was agreed to without a division, and the representative of the Government in of one make. .another place recognised the arrangement that had been made here. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - Not an arrangement. When I have an opportunity explain why the duty, has been increased.",58
553,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The r - presentative of the Government in the Senate voted in support of' the arrangeI ment made here, but the request was ried against him by one vote. Treasurer looks at the report of discussion in another place he will find reference made to the arrangeferently ment arrived at in the House of Represenlight, tatives; but I merely allude to this in passing. Electric and gas metersare each of people? ulsed by large companies, municipalities, and small companies in country districts; and I contend that the same duty apply to both classes of meters. If urged that gas meters can be while electric meters cannot, I point out that all that is done in the case of meters is to assemble the partshere, the same could, be done with electric meters: No matter whether there be a duty or not, the fitting of the gas meters will be carried, on in Australia, owing to the extra cost of sending them here in their made-up form. This fitting was carried on in New South Wales under a free-trade. policy, and under a duty of 12^- per cent., which plied to both meters and parts, because, I have said, of the extra cost of carrying the completed meters, and the less of injury. In England, where the gas meters are patented and manufactured, their parts are manufacturedin some centre like circumLondon, and ' are fitted together in ' the towns where they are to be used. alteraThis is found to be the more economical plan, although the distances are short, because in London there is the elaborate and melers expensive machinery for making the the parts. From the stand-point of equality, I be contend that the same duty should apply otherto both classes of meters. The industry here, so far as it is an industry, has been in existence for years in Victoria and New South Wales; and although, as I remind the honourable.members, the parts bear the same This ason some sembling of the. parts is carried on by the Melbourne and other metropolitan gas companies, and by the Australian agents of the manufacturers; arid it continue whether or not there be a recolduty. A comparatively small number of made-up meters for some of the smaller gas that companies are imported; and they are all",58
554,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,My - information is that two-thirds of the imported meters are I shall brought here made up.,58
555,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I - think that information must have been supplied by : some firm who desire a higher duty, because know that the figure quoted is absolutely carwrong. To Sydney, for instance, no gas If the meters are sent made up, and the fitting the employs some sixty or seventy men. Why .should those who use gas be treated! diffrom those who use the electric seeing that both systems of lighting are carried out by practically the same class",58
556,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"On the honourable memshould ber's own statement, the duty will be it is largely inoperative, seeing that so few made here, meters are imported made up.",58
557,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The hongas orable member forgets that the parts are and dutiable at the same rate as the meters. . »,58
558,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I am prepared to lower the duty on the parts to 5 per cent.,58
559,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The honourable member is not putting electric and gas lighting on the same level. His interalso jection would be a very good answer to apmy remarks if electric meters or part's had as also to pay 25 per cent., but they are admitted at 5 per cent, and free. When the risk question was raised here previously, the Minister at once agreed to make the duties the on the two kinds of appliances the same.",58
560,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Would it not be unfair to charge only 5 per cent, on the made-up article, while charging 25 per cent, and 20 per cent, on the parts?",59
561,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The "" 5 per cent, and free "" would apply in the case of gas meters, as it does in the case of electric meters, to both the constructed article and the parts. I think I know where the advocacy of this duty came from. It is .one that would affect Melbourne possibly more than Sydney. I think the movement to secure the duty came from one direction, because a different class of meter is used to a considerable extent in Sydney from that used in Melbourne. The dry meter is mostly used in Melbourne, and the wet meter in Sydney. What suits one manufacturer may not suit another. When there are two illuminants provided by practically the same class of people, in some cases big companies, in some cases small companies, ancl in some cases municipalities-ther e is far more gas than electricity provided by municipalities and small companies-ther e ought to be equal treatment. I am sure the Government do not wish to give preference to one illuminant over another. Electric meters are dutiable at 5 per cent, and free, and gas meters were so when the schedule left this Chamber. Either of them can be put together here if the parts are imported, but no exception has been made in the case of electric meters, and now it is proposed to levy a tax of 25 per cent, as against the one illuminant only.",59
562,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"The Treasurer accepted 5 per cent, and free.",59
563,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Yes ; and it was admitted in the Senate that an ariangement had been made. That was admitted even by the opponents of it. They quite rightly did not consider themselves bound by it, but the Minister did, and voted for the item as it left here. The request was carried by one vote only in that Chamber, although the original duty was carried unanimously here. The Minister should reconsider his proposal to accept the request. It is an unnecessary tax, which for all purposes is merely a revenue tax against one particular form of illuminant. We should certainly do equal justice as far as we can as between people who are engaged in practically the same occupationthat of providing lighting in the community. The Treasurer should adhere to the decision that he arrived at before, that his own Minister ht, the Senate supported, that was carried in this.Chamber unanimously, and defeated elsewhere by one vote only. ' Mr MATHEWS (Melbourne Ports) [9-55]-- It r u s t that the Treasurer will adhere to his determination to accept the request. I , in common with many honourable members, feel .a certain amount of timidity in opposing anything which_ the honourable member for North Sydney advocates. But whilst he is a free-trader, I am a protectionist, and I am influenced by the fact' that these articles can be manufactured here to a much greater extent than they are at present, while the Brassworkers' Association assure me that if gas meters continue to be manufactured here the brasswork con. nected with them can also be made here. Consequently, even the importation of the parts will be done away with. The outside portions of the meters"" are made in Melbourne to a great extent. The machinery for cutting them is not as intricate as that used here for cutting and making tins. One company in Melbourne employs fifty-seven hands, and two other firms employ ten and five hands respectively in making gas meters. In New South Wales one firm employ seventy hands in making them.",59
564,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Do they make them or put them together?,59
565,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"They make them in the same sense as the honourable member for North Sydney says they are made in England. As is the case with other pieces of mechanism, certain firms apply themselves exclusively to the manufacture of certain portions.",59
566,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"They have been and are manufacturing them under a duty, which is the same on the completed ' article as on the parts.",59
567,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Althoug h we cannot number those engaged in the industry by thousands, even the honourable member will - admit that a fair number of men are employed. The increased duty should be agreed to, seeing that the question of the raising .of the price hardly comes into consideration, and that the continuance of the' work here will give rise to other employment in the manufacture of parts that are not made here now. The mechanism of meters is precisely the same as that of penny-in-the-slot machines and other devices that are now imported. Those could all be made here, so that the industry is capable of very wide expansion. The industry of meter making in Australia has been growing, but, .in common with other industries, it has to meet competition which may be regarded from a commercial standpoint as fair, but which is nevertheless most injurious.",59
568,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Does not that apply equally to' electric meters? ,60
569,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I should like to see electric meters' manufactured here also, but unfortunately we have lost the opportunity to deal with that question. At this stage we. cari introduce no new item, but can only - deal' with Senate's requests. I hope that the honourable member for Dalley will piit up his umbrella on behalf of this' particular request. I believe it is in his electorate that gas meters are made for New South Wales. This is an industry which could be extended in many directions. Besides the companies I have named there are many other companies which are making gas meters, either wholly or partiallyI recognise that the gas companies in small provincial towns may be opposed to this request, but I believe that in time they will see their way to put together jjas meters instead of importing them. In view of the possibility that this industry may grow in many directions, I trust that the Treasurer will adhere to his determination to accede to the request.",60
570,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [10.2] - Mr. Chairman,' I do not know whether you noticed that during the last two or three days I have been faking a few draughts' of protection; but I intend to sober up on this item. The honourable member for North Sydney has put the position in a way which is practically unanswerable. He has appealed, to the Committee for equality of treatment. The protectionists have put a duty of 5 per cent, on electrical meters.",60
571,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Evidentl y gas meters are not made in Dalley.,60
572,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"They can be made in Dalley, because it has very competent artisans. The honourable member for North Sydney has made it very clear that the parts of these meters are assembled in Australia. If this request be acceded to the Committee will impose a tax upon the users of gas meters, l t should be remembered that while the electric light supplying companies charge for the use of their meters, the gas-lighting companies supply free meters to their consumers, though, of course, they may make a bit afterwards by means of a big racing machine. 1 believe that I have a big racingmachine in m'y establishment. As a matter of. justice and equity we ought not to - impose a serious tax upon the makers of gas, whether they be large companies or small companies. Why should we put"" the makers of electric lighten a better position all than the makers of gas?",60
573,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The honourable member does not think that the. gas companies pass on the duty ?,60
574,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Not unless they instal a good racing machine in a man's house. No doubt if we imposed a very high duty they the would pass it on to the consumer, or charge rent for the use of their meters. Originally the Treasurer proposed to admit gas meters at 5 per cent.. from foreign countries and free when imported from the United Kingdom. .His own protectionist inclination did not lead him to go farther than that. I think that he, as a protectionist, must see that the claim made by the honourable member for North Sydney is irresistible. I ask him not to be a glutton in the case of this item, as he has been in the case of other items. He should accord equal .treatment to the importers of both kinds of meters. I shall vote against the Senate's request.",60
575,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Hunter) [10.5] - On behalf of the residents of country towns, I appeal to the Treasurer not to press his motion. He knows that in his electorate there are many country towns which would benefit from the establishment of gas com r panies. A high duty on gas meters would press most heavily, not on the wealthy gas companies in the cities, but on the small gas companies in country towns, and indirectly upon the consumers. . Whatever contributes to the happiness of the people of a town should be encouraged. If anything improves the appearance of a town and promotes the comfort of its inhabitants, it is the establishment of gas works and gas lighting. I also appeal to the Treasurer on behalf of the coal miners. He will realise that the more gas companies are established the more work will be given to coal miners. I also appeal to the honourable gentleman on behalf of the carters, the iron workers, and the clerks. Seeing that originally he agreed that the duties on gas meters should be S per cent, and free, I see no reason why we should accede to the Senate's request, and thereby impose an unnecessary hardship upon the people. Let us endeavour as far as possible to encourage a system of t h r if t, and no one can deny that a penny-iri'-the-slot gas meter is a savings bank on a small scale. Mr THOMAS BROWN [10.7] - I cannot support the Senate's request. This item deals with electrical and - gas appliances, particularly with gas meters. Whilst it affects the large companies in the cities very closely, still it is the small country towns which will be affected very seriously if we agree to dudes of 25 and 20 per cent, on gas meters. When this item was first proposed by the Treasurer, I received from the municipal council of Molong a communication, upon which I regret 1 cannot lay my hand at the present moment. They pointed out to me how adversely it would affect their interests and limit the consumption of their gas. They claimed that it would not only limit the consumption, as it would prevent a number of persons from using gas as they are now doing, but also increase the cost of the article to the consumers. The communication pointed out how the council would be very seriously affected by the duty inasmuch as the gas works carried a very heavy debt. not remember how the loan for their construction was raised, but the council is responsible for its repayment, and is paying interest out of a particular fund.",60
576,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,That thousands of towns.,61
577,Mr THOMASBROWN,Unknown,"I agree with my honourable friend that pretty well every country town which supplies gas to its citizens would be affected by the high duties requested by the Senate. 1 remind honourable members that not only Molong, but many other country towns are already heavily handicapped; inasmuch as their coal has to be carried for a considerable distance by railway. The nearest point from which the Molong council can procure its coal is Lithgow. To towns such as Forbes, which also has a municipal gasworks, the coal has to be carried for & very much greater distance. All this adds to the cost to the consumer, and yet we are now asked in the interests of a prospective industry which can attain only very small dimensions to place duties of 20 and 25 per ce'nit. upon gas meters. I trust that the Committee will see the wisdom of disagreeing with the request of the Senate in this connection. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [10.12] - It was my intention at first to move that the request of the Senate be not made. I had intended to submit a motion under which gas meters imported in parts would have been made dutiable (Calare) at 5 per cent., and the completed meters at the higher rate. I find, however, that I should not be in order inadopting that course, because the wording of the paragraph has not been altered by the Senate. I therefore ask leave to withdraw my motion with a view to submitting another. Motion, by leave, withdrawn. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That the requested amendment be not made.",61
578,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Corio) [10.14] - I desire to know whether I should be in order in moving to insert the words "" and parts "" after the word ""meters.""",61
579,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The honourable, member would not be in order in adopting that course.",61
580,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) [10.15] - There is considerable force in the contention of the Treasurer, who, however, is prevented by parliamentary practice from I do moving in the direction that he desires. But the motion which he has now submitted will at least place him in the position of being able to negotiate with the Senate in respect of this item at a later stage. applies to Sir WILLIAM LYNE-Trea surer) [10.17] - At the present time gas meters and the parts thereof, are admitted at the same' rate of duty. What I desired to do was to make the parts dutiable at 5 per cent., and to levy the duty requested by the Senate upon the completed meters. I cannot do that, however, because the wording of the paragraph has not been amended. My hands are therefore tied. If , however, I did not move to disagree with the request of the Senate, the same duty would continue to be levied upon the meter parts that is charged upon the completed meters. That would be a disadvantage, because it would prevent the assembling of the parts from being undertaken locally.",61
581,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [10.18] - I think we have to admit that a duty of 25 per cent, upon meter parts would represent nothing like 25 per cent, upon the value of the completed meter. The Senate has requested a duty of 25 per cent, upon gas meters under (he general Tariff and of 20 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. I think that we might modify that request by admitting gas meter parts at 5 per cent, under the general Tariff and by making them free under the Tariff for the United Kingdom.",61
582,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The member would not be in order in adopting that course.,62
583,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I am sorry, because I feel that the effect of the Treasurer's proposal will be to displace a large number of workmen.",62
584,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Oh , no.",62
585,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, the only work which will be done in Commonwealth will be that of repairing the meters which are at present in use. As a protectionist I must enter my protest against allowing this question to go by the board. Sir. JOH N FORREST - Le t it go.",62
586,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"If the right honorlittle able gentleman thought .that fifty or men in his constituency would be thrown out of work by the making of the item free, would view the matter in a different I am of opinion that the making of meters will lead to the manufacture of other mathat chines of a similar character, and I am sorry that the Committee will not give prochildren, tection to the industry.",62

It is hardly intelligent to vote something which we do not understand.",62
590,Mr REID,Unknown,"The honourable member is using a pump on a well which has honourable in it. The Minister cannot give an explanation, so what is the use of asking for one - I",62
591,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It would appear--with out an explanation to the contrary-tha i the Senate has made the request .out of pure captiousness. A rate of 17 J per cent, will be particularly hard to apply. I could understand the Minister asking the Committee to agree to increases of 40, 50, or the even 100 per cent.; but why should he bother about an increase of z\ per cent. ?",62
592,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I take all I can get.,62
593,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The Committee is much in the' position of the prize-fighter, who takes all he gets. The Senate makes this punch of 2J per cent., and we take it, sixty just as we have taken harder punches.",62
594,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The alteration is in he accordance with my desires, and with those light. of. protectionists generally.",62
595,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If the Minister assures us the alteration will give employment to so many more thousands of men, women, or I shall be willing to let it go. Surely he will not be so unreasonable as to Employment give no explanation.",62
596,Mr REID,Unknown,He does not know why the and allowSenate made the request.,62
597,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Certainl y no member of the Committee can interpret the Senate's I ask the honourable member for Darwin, who, as a representative of a conper stituency named after the author of the a Origin of Species, may know what is in the Minister's mind, why the requested amendment is to be made - I am drawing attention to this matter, not because the request is in itself of any moment, but to show how ridiculously the Committee is., behaving. Anything that the Senate chooses to ask for is granted with or without reason. No reason is given in this case by the Minister, simply because he knows that honourable 15 per members wish to get into recess and get away from their work, and that they are willing to knuckle down to the Senate everv day in the week. I do not blame the very much for not giving reasons in this instance, because no explanation can be given. Very often he is unable to give explanations with regard to these matters. I say so advisedly.",62
598,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Hunter) [10.31] - I inalso should like to know why this extra Honourable for members opposite are clamouring for a protectionist Tariff. Do they mean to say that they are satisfied with ah increase of 2 i no water per .cent, in the duty ?",62
599,Sir WILLIAM LYJJE,Unknown,"We have no power to increase it further Mr LIDDELL,-Why should another place be satisfied with so small an increase? Is it because a manufacturer of incandescent lamps wanted a duty of 50 per cent. ? I am entirely in the dark in this matter. What is the value of the imports under this heading, and what are the articles included under it? I do not think that the Committee is aware of what they are. In order to afford honourable members information I may point out that another place was informed that the item includes such articles asprimary batteries, cable clips and - hangers, iightning conductors, electrolytic apparatus, connecters, binding screws, terminals, electric fire alarms, drop shutters (call indicators, annunciators), igniters and spark plugs, electro, static machines, electro - medical medical batteries and thermostats. Surely an increase of 2$- per cent, cannot be satisfactory to protectionists. The Committee is not being treated fairly, in being denied information by the Minister.",63
600,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [10.33] - I again invitc the attention of honourable members to the item.. The duty suggested by the Senate is 17 per cent, general Tariff. The1 duty which this House adopted was 15 per cent., with a duty of 10 per cent, on goods from the United Kingdom. The 10 per cent, duty stands. So that the Minister is really giving Great Britain an extra preference of 2j per cent. On. account of the glorious Imperialism of .the honourable gentleman, I think we can afford to let the item pass 1 Motion agreed to. Requested amendment made. Item 180. Rails, Fish-plates, Fish-bolts, Tie Plates and Rods, Switches, Points, Crossings and Intersections for Railways and Tramways, ad val. (General Tariff), 12^ per cent.; and on and after 30th November, 1907, 15 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 12$ per cent.; and on and after 30th November, 1907, 10 per cent. Request - Inser t after the word "" Intersections"" the words ""also Steel Sleepers."" Sir WILLIAM LYNE. (Hume-Trea surer) [10.36] - I move That the requested amendment be not made. I have been making inquiries, and I find that preparations have been made to manufacture steel sleepers at Lithgow. I had an interview with the owner t>f the worlcs the other day, and he informed me that he is putting up plant for the purpose. was inclined to agree with the Senate's request, but if steel sleeper's can be made liere [383] surely we should give an opportunity for their manufacture.",63
601,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Fremantle) [10.37] -^! remind the Committee that in the northern part of Australia it is impossible to build railways without steel sleepers. We have no hope of opening up that part of the country without them. The Pine Creek Railway is made with steel sleepers. Many honourable memberswho have been in the Northern Territory know how bad the white ants are there. Steel sleepers must be used, because white ants eat the wooden ones. The duty covering steel rails is quite high enough for steel sleepers alsoIt is only reasonable that the sleepers should be included in this item at a lower rate of duty. I shall vote against the Minister's motion.",63
602,Mr REID,Unknown,"East Sydney) [10.39] - I apparatus, think that the proposal bf the Treasurer is an inconsistent one. Why should steel sleepers be at a different rate of duty from steel rails? If steel sleepers are to be at 30 per cent., steel rails ought to be at the same rate. I think that the amendment requested by the Senate is a proper one, because rails and sleepers are both goods of the same description. To draw a line between rails and sleepers seems to me to be ridiculous, and to make a difference of 100 per cent, between the duties on them is notjustifiable.
