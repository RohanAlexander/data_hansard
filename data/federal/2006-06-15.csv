1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. David Hawker) took the chair at 9 am and read prayers. AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND NA AMENDMENT (EXPORT CONTROL AND QUARANTINE) BILL 2006 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Ley. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
2,Ms LEY,FORESTRY LEGISLATION,"Farrer-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (9.01 am)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Export Control Act 1982 and the Quarantine Act 1908 to: - extend the definition of ‘preparation' to the catching of fish, the definition of ‘premises' to places in and on water and insert a definition for ‘fish' in the Control Act; - create four new offences in the Export Control Act to enable the Commonwealth to prosecute those people who fail to properly prepare goods that are exported; - extend the services for which fees may be charged under the Export Control Act to services provided by the secretary or the secretary's delegate; - clarify the use of certain terms in the Export Control Act; and - provide a legal basis for the recovery of fees for quarantine services provided under the Quarantine Act to other Commonwealth bodies. The amendments to the Export Control Act concerning the extension of the definition of ‘preparation' and ‘premises' and the inclusion of a definition for ‘fish' will remove any doubt that the Commonwealth has appropriate legal authority to regulate the sourcing of fish intended for export. The authority to regulate the sourcing of fish is necessary to ensure ongoing access for exported product into overseas markets and to protect consumers by ensuring that fish, including shellfish, are harvested from areas that do not contain pathogenic organisms, biotoxins and chemical contaminants at levels that may represent a threat to consumer health. The creation of four new offence provisions is in response to a serious gap in the Export Control Act. Currently, the offence provisions in the act focus on persons involved with goods in the post-preparation phase with the result that persons who are the occupiers of establishments where the preparation of the goods occurs are immune from the serious penalties that apply to other offenders under the act. The new offences Export focus on the person responsible for the preparation of the goods for export. To preserve the integrity of the export chain it is very important that key players in the chain, such as occupiers of establishments where food is prepared for export, are made responsible for activities at their establishment. The export of prescribed goods that have not been properly prepared can have serious implications for Australia's trade in food. Two of the four offences apply strict liability to some of the physical elements of the offences. The application of strict liability in these circumstances is important as otherwise persons in control of food preparation establishments can avoid the consequences of non-compliance with the law by simply saying that they were not aware of what was occurring at their establishment. The application of strict liability to these offences is likely to significantly enhance effectiveness of the enforcement regime by requiring such people to have systems in place to ensure that the law is complied with. The maximum penalty for these offences is 60 penalty units. This level of penalty is sistent with the Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Civil Penalties and Enforcement Powers issued by the authority of the Minister for Justice and Customs. The other two offence provisions each impose a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years. This level of penalty is consistent with the penalties in sections 7A and 8 of the act. The bill also amends the regulation making power of the Export Control Act to enable fees to be charged for services provided by the secretary or a delegate of the secretary. Currently, fees can be charged for (amongst other things) the services of authorised officers appointed under the Export Control Act but not for services provided by the secretary or a delegate of the secretary. This amendment will overcome this anomaly and ensure that AQIS can charge for the full range of services it provides. The bill also makes a number of amendments to remove inconsistent usage of the expressions ‘registered premises' and ‘registered establishment' in the Export Control Act. As a result of these amendments, the expression ‘registered establishment' will replace all references to ‘registered premises'. These changes are minor and technical and are not intended to change the effect of any of the provisions that are amended. The bill amends the Quarantine Act to facilitate cost recovery between the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) and the rest of the Commonwealth. In particular, the new section, section 86EA, imposes a notional liability on the Commonwealth to pay the fees for quarantine services the specified in a determination made under subsection 86E(1B) of the Quarantine Act. The effect of this amendment is to give AQIS the authority to require payment from agencies and other Commonwealth bodies for quarancontine services and to give these agencies and other Commonwealth bodies the legal authority to make payments to AQIS for quarantine services. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. NA",19
3,Mr HUNT,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSAL,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (9.07 am)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2006 The Customs Tariff Proposal I have just tabled contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995, effective from 1 July 2006. First, the proposal alters item 31 of schedule 4 to the customs tariff. This item currently allows the duty-free entry of certain aircraft parts, materials and test equipment for use in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of aircraft. Item 31 is proposed to be altered by extending duty-free entry to certain goods used in the modification of aircraft. The extension of item 31 to include goods for use in the modification of aircraft will reduce costs to business and will provide a clear incentive to continue heavy maintenance work in Australia. This will strengthen the international competitiveness of Australia's aviation and maintenance industries and is consistent with the government's policy to improve the international competitiveness of Australia's aerospace and aviation industries. The main beneficiaries of this measure will be domestic airline and defence contractors, as well as Australia's vibrant general aviation aircraft manufacturing and modification industry. Many of the firms in this sector are located in regional Australia and this alteration to the customs tariff will provide a new certainty to underpin their competitiveness in the world market. This alteration to item 31 applies to goods entered for home consumption on or after 1 July 2006. Secondly, the proposal will alter item 71 of schedule 4 to the customs tariff by expanding the Enhanced Project By-law Scheme to include the duty-free entry of qualifying goods for the power supply and water supply industries. Currently, item 71 underpins the Enhanced Project By-law Scheme offering tariff concessions to major projects in the mining, resource-processing, agriculture, foodprocessing, food-packaging, manufacturing and gas supply industries for imported capital equipment that is not able to be sourced in Australia. The inclusion of the power supply and water supply industries in the terms of item 71 will encourage investment, increase opportunities for Australian industry to participate in major projects, and lower business input costs. The above alteration applies to goods imported and entered for home consumption on or after 1 July 2006. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned.

10,The SPEAKER,AYES,"I remind honourable members that when they come into the chamber they are expected to uphold proper dress standards. NA AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 June, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Ms Gillard moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the NOES House is of the view that the minister stands condemned for failing to: (1) address the concerns of members of Medibank Private and proceeding with the sale of Medibank Private even though the majority of Australians are opposed to the sale; and (2) address critical structural weaknesses in the health sector such as workforce shortages and the rising costs of health”.",24
11,The SPEAKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Gavan O'Connor-I second the amendment.,25
12,Mr LAMING,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Bowman) (9.36 am)There is nothing controversial about the content of the majority of the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance) Bill 2006, but what stands a chasm apart is the position of both sides of this chamber on private health insurance. It has been extraordinary to listen to the complaints around the edges from those on the other side of the chamber on private health insurancecomplaints about the cost of private health insurance without acknowledging the extraordinary increases in costs for all health care right across the board. It has been extraordinary listening to complaints about gaps when those opposite will not support a safety net. It has been extraordinary to sit here and listen to complaints about exclusions when these are elements of every insurance policy, even beyond the health sector. And it has been extraordinary to listen to the compassion from those opposite about consumers and the complaints that consumers were not consulted on the role of a Private Health Insurance Ombudsman when they would like to have the entire private health insurance sector eliminated completely. Yet those opposite came here yesterday and complained about rights for the consumers, the very consumers they would like to have eliminated altogether in order to have everyone accessing public hospital care and nothing else. Finally thrown into the criticism of this bill by those opposite this morning was that Medibank Private potentially would be sold and result in an increase in rebates-for which they have no evidence. It is quite clear that the sale of Medibank Private could well increase competition, particularly if it is purchased by a new provider of private health care services in this country. But this feigned compassion for Medibank Private could well be due to many on the other side of the chamber actually enjoying having their own private health insurance, not wanting to see any of that sector lost and yet, at the same time, having the effrontery to come into this chamber and rail against it. Mr Deputy Speaker, you do not have to go back very far for memories of Medicare Gold. I have no doubt that the member for Lalor has an extraordinarily strong conviction that her policies are good for a country; my problem is that they are not good for this country. Her policies may well be great for a country where one can walk along the Malacon and then sit listening to music in the Casa de la Trova. Medicare Gold may work in Havana; it will not work here. Medicare Gold proposed-I do not want to go into great detail-shifting people over the age of 70 into a combined promise of private health care, which would be fully paid for by the public health system, with the hope of wiping out private health insurance on the side. Costings were vague and amorphous. Even today the idea of Medicare Gold percolates up from the deep, because there is no agreement on the other side of the chamber whether to put it to death or not. We do not have a clear answer on that at all. Medicare Gold promised, for somewhere between $2 billion and $6 billion-we never got more precision than that-to allow anyone over the age of 70, without discussion of clinical need and with a triage system based purely on age, their own room and choice of doctor. This potentially would all be at the expense of our private health insurance system. One does not have to go back very far to remember the days of 30 per cent-and falling fast-private health insurance coverage in this country; it was falling by two per cent a year. I would call that a death spiral, as had been doing so for some time. One relies on a base to maintain a critical mass and efficiencies within private health insurance. How does one support a private health sector when levels of coverage fall, as we have seen in other OECD economies, to 10 or 15 per cent? That is when private health insurance becomes a service for the rich. But that is what happens in Australia. Australia, through a policy trident of Lifetime Health Cover, community rating and a rebate that makes services affordable to Australians, has pulled across 44 per cent of the population. The average earning Australian can now be indifferent. Half choose to purchase private health insurance; others choose some other service, such as affordable independent schooling. These options are now available to Australians, when they could only dream of them 10 years ago. We do not need a long memory to remember what it was like to have long queues in public hospitals in states across Australia. matter how many people have taken up the option of private health cover, states' commitments to their own hospitals have been ratcheting back and the queues remain. We have gained no commitment from states to shorten their waiting lists. I highlight Queenthose sland as an example. They will not fire visiting medical officers; they just ratchet back their hours, providing fewer and fewer services. At the same time we see longer waiting lists and secret waiting lists-and not thousands, not tens of thousands but over 100,000 Queenslanders ‘waiting for Godot' for the chance to actually get onto a list for an operation. Those on the other side of the chamber have the effrontery to talk about exclusions in policies, when we have in our state health systems the ultimate exclusionyou cannot even get in the door of a public hospital to get your operation. Waiting lists have ceased to be waiting lists; they are simit ply rotating lists, with people who are absolutely at death's door being popped on the top of the list and everyone else just floating in a waiting list that never moves. In the last 10 years, the notion that was once commonplace amongst socialist thinkers-that there was an inexhaustible appetite for health care services and one could never not provide enough health services without completely breaking the bank-has been utterly exposed as a hoax. Average, ordinary earning Australians in the middle quintiles right down to 20 per cent of Australians in the poorest quintile walk out the door, pick up the phone and elect to have private health cover. It means so much to them that they are prepared to pay for it out of their own pocket. We have seen that these very Australians contribute back into Australia's health system-not $5 billion and not $6 billion but $9 billion every year. To those simplistic socialist thinkers, who even to this day talk about eliminating priNo vate health cover and redirecting the 30 per cent rebate back into our needy public hospitals, I put this simple piece of maths that has never been tested on the other side. If I were to redirect $2.6 billion or $2.8 billion currently spent on the 30 per cent rebate into needy public hospitals and spread it thinly across the country, do you think those waiting lists would change materially? I tell you what: things would not move faster but, by moving 40 per cent of Australia back onto the public hospital queues, those queues will become longer-and I will tell you how much longer. They will become $8 billion to $10 billion per year longer. We are spending $20 billion a year on hospitals at the moment and I put to you that we would have to spend $30 billion. Congratulations to the other who would find $2.6 billion by eliminating a private health insurance rebate. Where would the other $6 billion come from? It could only come from tax. It could only come from wiping out tax cuts that were offered in the last budget. It could only come by restricting services, at which the other side of the chamber appears to be expert at state level. So where would the money come from? I think we need to see two things from those on the other side of the chamber: first, that they relinquish their hostile ideological conviction to wiping out private health care; and, second, that they work out whether there could be a better system. At the moment all they have offered is Medicare Gold, the solution that is no solution-the solution they were so ashamed of that they had to release it just a few weeks before the election and hope it slipped through without proper scrutiny. We have had plenty of time to think about Medicare Gold now, and we know that there is far from agreement on the other side of the chamber on that policy. It is also worth noting just how quiet the other side has been on private health insurance completely-in fact, on health more broadly. What do we hear from the other side of the chamber about health? Where are the questions about health care? Where are the questions about quality of care? They have all just dissipated with the shame in the hangover of Medicare Gold. Medicare Gold may work well in some countries; it certainly will not work well in Australia. This bill does not have many controversial elements. This was a widely consulted change regarding the power of the ombudsman. It increases the ombudsman's effectiveness to be able to conduct investigations at their own initiative or at a minister's quest, but they can now place scrutiny not just upon funds but upon all service providside, ers, although obviously not upon clinical complaints. That is and will remain an issue for medical boards. It is about making the decision to take up private health care more satisfying, more fulfilling, and it eliminates some of the great questions and concerns that people who take out these insurance policies have. I had a personal experience in this area two weeks ago. I was renegotiating my private health cover, for the first time on the telephone, and I was taken through the list of exclusions exhaustively. I tried to get through the phone call quickly, but the fund was methodical in explaining to me the exclusions. That is the same as when I take out car, boat or house insurance. This patronising notion that there are so many tricky exclusions out there that we cannot rely on ordinary Australians to take out an insurance policy is part of the problem on the other side. I am not for one minute saying that there are not issues of communication. I am not for one moment saying that we should not be developing resources that allow a more complete explanation of products and services. And I am not for a moment saying that we should not be improving the powers of the ombudsman. That is what the bill is doing. I know those elements are not controversial on the other side. No, my attack today is on the notion that persists on the side-though it is rarely articulated because it is so poorly received in the community-that taking up private health insurance is a poor customer decision, the result of knowledge asymmetry, of being fundamentally foolish with your own money. Let us look at this claim in a little more detail. Let us take the figures of equivalised re- household income by quintile and of how much Australians actually spend on their health care. Of course, the notion that will be put by the other side of the chamber is that money spent on private health insurance is simply a redirection of resources to the rich. This myth has not died. There are four big myths around private health cover that continue to be peddled by the other side of the chamber and by sycophantic, left-wing health economists and academics who continue to print this nonsense, which is completely ignored by Australians, who continue to take out policies because it is the right thing for them and their families. The first myth is that there is an insatiable appetite for health care services and that the only way to prevent an overwhelming drive and demand for health care services is to ration them, to do what state hospitals dopretend you have an open door but not have it open at all. The second myth is that of the worried well-that private health insurance simply treats people with tiny and insignificant conditions, that the wealthy can simply access a private hospital immediately and have world-class care for non-emergent, nonsignificant pathology. The third myth is the myth of two tiers-that private health insurance creates one level here and one level over there, with the rich operating in their own stratospheric level of health outcomes. The fourth myth is the misspent dollar, the myth to which I have already alluded-the myth that one dollar spent on a rebate for private health cover is a dollar that would be far better spent in a state public hospital. I would like to devote a little attention to those four myths today, because they are being broken down, not by some concerted campaign of letter writing or by sympathetic academics who write articles about how wonderful private health insurance is. To the contrary: these myths are being undermined by Australians who are making their own decisions, who, when clearly offered choices, are demonstrating their ability to do so. The first issue here about what private health has shown us-and 44 per cent of Australians now have cover-is that, far from there being a tsunami of health demand at private hospitals, Australians do not wake up in the morning and say: ‘I've got nothing better to do. I'd like to go and sit in a queue to get my eyes looked at or to have my elbow looked at.' No, Australians go there for genuine cases. Seventy per cent of operations for cataracts and 60 per cent of operations for hips and knees-all of these serious operations that affect the quality of life of Australians-are being done in private hospitals with few in their queues. If anything, the private hospital sector is showing us how it should be done. It is showing that there is not some overwhelming, insatiable appetite that, allowed to be unleashed, would completely consume Australia's GDP. What a preposterous public health socialist notion that still hangs around today. No, people who have private health cover are making responsible choices and getting the services they need, and I think those on the other side could actually learn a lesson from the efficiency that private health has delivered to the market. The second myth, that of the worried well, is that there are not significant cardiovascular cases being done in private health, that they cherry-pick the high-return cases and do not do anything else. Nothing could be further from the truth. These private hospitals are doing a range of procedures-the expensive and the technical right down to the rather simple. I challenge anyone on the other side to come into a private hospital on any non-sitting day and point out the private hospital case that should not be done. Come and look at the waiting lists, come and look at the operating lists and come and tell me there is a patient there who really should not be getting that operation, who really should be back on the public hospital waiting list, waiting forever-waiting until they fall off the perch, give up in disgust, go and take out private health insurance or perhaps fly overseas to have the operation. For goodness sake, what a ridiculous notion. I put that challenge to the other side: phone me, let us visit a private hospital and look at an operating list. I ask those on the other side to make the call on who should not be getting that procedure. Privately or publicly covered, they should be getting that procedure; they should not be denied it. Private health has simply shown us a way of doing it efficiently, and I support it completely. The third myth is this myth of two tiersthat, by having private health insurance, suddenly the wealthy Australians float away with wonderful health outcomes and everyone else does not. Of course there is a challenge here that we need to be funding public hospitals, and the federal government has increased hospital spending by 25 per cent to 27 per cent-and, in the previous hospital agreement, by 36 per cent-over and above inflation, over and above the CPI. That is a reflection of increasing costs, which are seven to eight per cent a year. So when private health insurance rebates go up by eight per cent a year, don't say, ‘What a profit grab.' Have a look at the efficiency of the private hospital sector that operates on margins as thin as ice. What is happening is that this is merely reflecting the cost of health delivery. The finest health care this country and, yes, the cost goes up by eight per cent every year. But 44 per cent of Australians bear it out of their own pocket because a rebate makes it affordable. Public hospital care is also going up at actly the same rate-by six, seven or eight per cent a year. So all health care costs go up at this rate. Let us stop having this private health exceptionalism line being run from the other side-that it is all profit-grab, that all of this 30 per cent rebate is simply captured by shareholders of private health insurance funds. We need to break through that notion and start looking at health outcomes. The private sector is showing us that it can be done far better than we are doing it in many of our public hospitals today. Let us not forget that 50 per cent of those aged between 40 and 70 now have private health care cover. This is not some choice of the rich. This is not whether to get a Ferrari or a Porsche. Twenty per cent of the poorest Australians pay for these premiums and elect to have private health cover. So make no mistake that this is some choice for the wealthy, that this is some transfer to those who least deserve it, because in the end what has been developed with this policy trident in the late nineties is that ordinary Australian families can now contemplate having private health cover and taking responsibility for their own cover. Sure, they will use public services at times, but for the great majority of their clinical care, particularly at the hospital level, they are electing to cover themselves. They are electing to add $9 billion a year to the Australian health care pot which, were there not private health insurance rebates, would not be there at all. We would have a completely different private hospital system. We would have an elitist private hospital system with just a small percentage of Australians accessing private health cover. This side of the chamber would never want is available into see that occur. The last myth is probably the most frustrating all. I have alluded to it already: the myth of the misspent dollar-the myth on the other side that, if it were not for the pubex- lic opinion and public sentiment that is so pro-private health insurance, we could eliminate it quietly and capture back that $2.6 billion and funnel it across into our needy public hospitals, which simply have not had the state commitment to fund them as they should. Where would we be with private health cover falling from 43 per cent to perhaps 10 or 15 per cent? That would be 30 per cent-yes, 6 million Australians-joining the queues in public hospitals. Do you seriously think that $2.6 billion would cut it? Do you seriously think that $2.6 billion could actually cover that many Australians seeking operations and procedures, VMO visits and outpatient visits through our public hospitals? You have to be dreaming if you think that it could be done for $2.6 billion. It could be done for $9 billion and, as I have put to you before, that $6 billion would be found out of taxpayers' pockets. We would be back to where we started 10 years ago: with falling PHI and increasing taxes. We would be back in that mess that we were in 10 years ago. I do not think Australians want to go back there at all. What is clear now is that, in any economic sense, making something affordable increases the appetite for it. Government is not paying for the premium completely. We know that, by putting $1 billion into private health insurance rebates, private health cover goes up by approximately 10 per cent and into the health system goes $3.3 billion of client contribution. It is an extraordinarily sensitive lever. Once private health insurance becomes unaffordable then middle Australia starts to lose out. It is the policy interventions of this government that have made private health care affordable. It is a fine model worldwide. There are very few countries in the world that can now boast 40 to 45 per cent private hospital cover and 40 to 45 per cent independent and nonstate school educated children. What we have is two sectors with the balance-two sectors offering choices, two sectors competing against each other for quality. As I finish, I would like to point out we can be completely comfortable with students moving into the independent school sector and taking with them funding to their schools, but there is still an ideological resistance to a cent going into the private hospital sector. That is the great inconsistency of the other side, and for that reason I support this bill. (Time expired)",25
13,Mr HAYES,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I rise today in general support of the provisions of the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance) Bill 2006, but in particular I support the amendments foreshadowed by the shadow minister for health. I welcome a number of the provisions contained in this bill but stop short of praising it entirely, just as this bill stops short of really providing the safeguards needed for consumers of private health insurance. The provisions of this bill change the power of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman and make some adjustments to the administration of the private health insurance rebate by Medicare and the Australian Taxation Office. The bill expands the powers of the ombudsman so that in addition to its role of dealing with disputes between customers and funds it can now deal with issues related to arrangements between insurers, the brokers and providers of services. On a voluntary basis the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman can also mediate in disputes. Amendments are also made so that the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman will be able to direct the participation of those subject to a complaint in compulsory conciliation. At the request of the minister or of the ombudsman's own volition, the ombudsman will be able to mediate between a health fund and a health care provider. No doubt all members would agree that this is an important power for the ombudsman. Importantly, the ombudsman will have powers to require records to be produced not only from the funds but also from the health care providers. This bill also takes action to address the protection of those involved with the ombudsman from civil and personal liabilities that may arise from its increased powers. The bill also contains a provision that puts consumer protection front and centre when it comes to the focus of the powers and actions of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. This is an important provision that dovetails with the extension of the ombudsman's powers. In her speech yesterday the member for Lalor indicated that the last thing Labor wanted to see was the ombudsman concentrating its efforts on contractual disputes tween funds and health care providers, and also that Labor would not want the ombudsman to act as a referee simply on pricing and servicing disputes between funds and providers. I would go a step further and say that I do not believe that private health insurance customers would want to see that the focus of attention of the ombudsman would be on anything but the private health insurance customer. Health insurance disputes often involve complex issues. It is about time customers were represented in the private health insurance market. People dealing with health insurance and health care providers often feel intimidated by having to deal with these giants in the industry. They know that the insurers, should they want to, can effectively starve the customer by delaying their entitlements and dragging things out as long as possible. Additionally, most customers simply do not have the financial resources to pursue matters through the courts, should it come to that. I support increased consumer protection, particularly in complex markets such as the private health insurance market. I support the provisions in this bill that extend and enhance the power of the ombudsman when it comes to providing consumer protection. I cannot participate in this debate on private health insurance without talking about what is on the minds of most people in my electorate when we raise this issue. Private health insurance is an important issue for the constituents of my electorate-which is why I draw it to the attention of the House-and I daresay it is the same for members opposite. Private health insurance offers a greater degree of health care protection to the many families who take it out and it is an important factor in the budgets of those families. When beI mention private health insurance to constituents in my electorate I hear some strongly worded phrases, and usually one or two references to the fact that they feel they are being ripped off. People in my electorate take out private health care insurance for the additional level of service it provides for them and their families should they fall ill or need hospitalisation. They understand and accept that insurance means that you can often pay premiums for a long period of time and not call on the insurance company to make any payments, as nothing has happened, and in such circumstances they consider themselves fortunate. What they do not understand, and what they are not willing to accept, is that they are paying, on average, premiums up to 40 per cent higher than they were in 2001. The member for Bowman recently took us through a lengthy dissertation justifying the price increases that have occurred. I invite him to front up to the people in his electorate and explain why premiums have increased since 2001 by an average of 40 per cent. What people do not accept is that, despite the multi-billion dollar subsidy of the private health insurance industry that this government has locked the Australian taxpayer into, these premiums go up every time the industry applies to the minister for a price increase. There have been eight successive increases in health insurance premiums, every one of them having been ticked off by the minister. People accept that prices are generally going to rise over time. They see the cost of food and other consumer items rising. They know that other insurance premiums are also going to rise due to the costs being experienced by industry. What they cannot accept is that private health insurance premiums have increased by 40 per cent since 2001. Constituents in my electorate were under the impression that there would be downward pressure on health insurance premiums. Why would they think that? It is simplethey believed the minister when he made the completely empty promise in 2001 that there would be downward pressure on premiums. It is unacceptable that, whenever the health insurance industry companies make an application to the minister for a price rise, he out his rubber stamp, turns to the last page in the relevant document and stamps the page-giving the price rise a big tick of approval. Worse still is that, when the minister makes the announcement that premiums have risen, he always refers to ‘average premium rises'. This is interesting. Constituents who contact my electorate office often report to me that the yearly premium rises they are experiencing are more in the order of 20 per cent, as opposed to the minister's announcement, for example, of a seven per cent ‘average' premium rise. How can this be the case? I undertook some investigation to find out. People are insistent when they talk about anything that affects the family budget. They come in and try to explain to their local member just what is impacting on the budget. They have taken me through these numbers. We find that there is some trickery involved in the calculation of ‘average' premium rises. Health insurers manage to increase some premiums well above this figure of seven per cent by simply lowering the price of other products that they have on offer. When you look into this, you see that most of these products that fall in price generally correlate with those which are either defunct or, alternatively, closed to new members. That certainly does have a direct impact. That does not seem to matter to the minister though. He is happy to get out the rubber stamp and the big black pen, tick it off and stamp the page-and off we go again with another one of those successive premium rises, all of which have occurred on his watch. With premiums rising on the one hand, the government then wonders why, on the other hand, people who do not make claims on their insurance product start to consider leaving the system. I will let the minister in on a little secret, one that he ought to have regard gets for because I am sure that the people who visit my electorate office are no different from the people who visit the electorate offices of all members in this House: they believe they are being ripped off by this system. They deserve better. They deserve affordable and accessible private health insurance. Not only do people deserve affordable and accessible private health insurance; they also deserve affordable and accessible access to medical services in general. The electorate of Werriwa suffers from a shortage of GPs, something that I have been campaigning on for some time. I have taken up many petitions and spoken at many venues within the community on this. Why this has come about and why it is a central point of concern for many young families in my area is that the current ratio of GPs to the population in Werriwa stands at one GP to 1,700 head of population. This is a huge difference from the federal Department of Health and Ageing's recommendation of one GP to 1,000 people. Our ratio is significantly above that. Our area in the outer western metropolitan area of Sydney has a high density of families. The people in our area have a high need to call upon a GP's services, yet we find ours is one of the worse affected areas in having one GP to 1,700 head of population. In Sydney's new growing suburbs, health care is extremely important. Not only is it extremely important to the people in those new suburbs; it is also at the front of the minds of all residents when they are looking at the provision of services within their region or suburb. It often gets back to the issue of the number of GPs that we have available to administer health care-and we in my region are particularly suffering as we try to attract GPs. Our residents, particularly young families and the older residents in many of the more established areas, are suffering because of this lack of GP support. One of the central reasons why people in my electorate are suffering from the lack of GPs is the government's cut in the number of GP training positions back in 1996. They are paying the price of the government's obsession with cost over service because they do not have reasonable access to a GP. The residents of Kemps Creek, Hoxton Park, Horningsea Park, Carnes Hill, Edmondson Park, Prestons and Austral are in areas where we have a critical health care workforce shortage. It is front and centre in the minds of local families. While I am on the record in this place as welcoming the investment that the government has made in the development of the new medical school on the Campbelltown campus of the University of Western Sydney, I say this will not solve the problems that the residents are experiencing now. I am sure that the school will produce doctors of a very high quality. I am confident that we will induce a number of these graduating medical practitioners, once they have seen and experienced the advantages that we have to offer them in Western Sydney, to stay and service the south-west of Sydney. But we will not see an improvement in our GPpopulation ratio for at least another seven to eight years if we are simply going to rely upon doctors coming out of the University of Western Sydney's medical school to simply go out and, as is expected, resolve the issues as to our doctor shortage. I would like to raise another health issue of concern that faces many residents in my electorate and, no doubt, other electorates. It is also the result of the government's decision to prioritise cost over health care. As with its cuts to GP training places in 1996, on coming to office this government made a decision which abolished the Commonwealth dental health scheme. This government decided to cut $100 million out of public dentistry-there was $100 million cut from a program that the government is on record as saying worked. Despite the provisions of the Constitution, this government decided that the Commonwealth no longer had a responsibility for dental health care. It left the state governments to pick up the tab and it continues to deny that it has any role or responsibility in providing dental services to our communities. The Constitution says differently, of course, and it is about time that the government accepted its responsibility and restored a public dental health program. It is about time that it acted to cut the lists of people waiting for dental treatment in the public health system. It is about time that the government stopped the situation that only those who have private health insurance can afford dental services. People should not be forced to think about pulling their own teeth out simply because they cannot afford to see a dentist to have their teeth fixed. There are many elderly people who come and visit my office. People should not have to consider using superglue to fix their own dentures because the government wants to deny the responsibility that was given to it under the Australian Constitution. This government and the current minister need to stop the obsession with cost and dedicate the same time, the same energy and the same commitment to worrying about the health care of the people of this country. Care should be first and foremost in the minds of those deciding the future of health policy, because health policy should always be about people, not just about cost. This government needs to act and act now. (Time expired)",30
14,Mr HARTSUYKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"The Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance) Bill 2006 deals with a subject that strikes a chord with all Australians: health. As the nation's population ages the importance of health services only grows. All Australians have a stake in the country's health services. This government recognises the right of all Australians, young and old, to access quality health services, no matter where they live or whatever their financial situation. Furthermore, the government has taken steps to see that Australians have every opportunity to choose private health cover. In fact, this government has encouraged it with several measures, which I will outline in a moment. Today I wish to highlight two reasons why the government is making private health insurance available to all Australians. Firstly, it is about choice. Australians should be able to decide for themselves whether they have private health insurance cover or whether they do not. Secondly, it is about working cooperatively with the public health system. The Howard government has eased the pressure on the public system without hurting the private system, encouraging more people to take out private health insurance, thus making for a stronger total health system-a strong public system as well as a strong private system. It is the government's view that the private health sector makes a vital contribution to the national level of health services. I wish the same could be said for Labor, but the figures show otherwise. When the Howard government took office a decade ago, the number of Australians with private health insurance cover was less than 34 per cent of the population. Today, that figure has jumped to over 43 per cent. That is in the order of nine million Australians making their own decision to access private health insurance. When Labor came to power in 1983, 65 per cent of Australians had private health cover. Over their 13 years of government that figure almost halved to less than 34 per cent. In a moment, I will return to Labor's poor record on health and why it opposes improvements to the system. In my electorate of Cowper, however, there is one private hospital and one private day care surgery-the Baringa Private Hospital and the Coffs Harbour Day Surgery Centre. Despite Cowper being a low-income electorate, those two facilities are very strongly patronised. It is indicative of the decisions being made by Australians around the country to use the services of the private health sector. We have a strong public health sector but, balancing that, and to take the pressure off that, we also have a strong private health sector. One key indicator of the effectiveness of the private health insurance system is the usage of private hospitals in Australia: 56 per cent of surgery in Australia is performed by private hospitals. They admit a quarter of a million patients a year. The private system has 24,642 beds in 291 hospitals. Private hospitals account for 40 per cent of all hospital admitted patients with just 32 per cent of all hospital beds. Today, private health insurance membership, as I said, is over 43 per cent. That is a substantial proportion of the Australian population, taking a substantial load off the public sector. The government has taken several recent measures to make private health insurance more attractive. Firstly, the private health insurance rebate was introduced in 1999. The 30 per cent rebate reduces the cost of private health insurance cover to the consumer. Since 1 April 2005 those with private health insurance who are aged between 65 and 69 have been able to claim a rebate of 35 per cent, and those who are aged 70 and over have been able to claim a rebate of 40 per cent. And what was Labor's response to these increased rebates? Predictably, Labor's response was to oppose this move. They labelled the move ‘a bad thing' for our economy. They labelled it ‘unfair'. They labelled the increase in the private health insurance rebate to older Australians ‘shameful'. Had Labor remained in power, we would not be using the word ‘shameful' to describe the private health insurance system and the private health system; I think we would probably be using the word ‘terminal'. Labor ignores the figures when it claims that private health cover is out of the reach average Australians. Over a million of these average Australians, on incomes of $20,000 a year or less, have private health insurance cover. And the private health insurance rebate is a major element in making that insurance cover affordable. The private health insurance rebate saves a typical family in the order of $800 a year-a benefit they would say they greatly appreciate, I am sure, were you to ask any family. Secondly, in July 2000 the government revolutionised private health insurance by introducing Lifetime Health Cover. It provides incentives for all Australians to take out private health insurance cover and stick with it over the long term. It helps to slow premium increases and it helps to stop the ‘hit and run' syndrome where people join a private health insurance scheme only to leave after a particular ailment has been dealt with. I think Lifetime Health Cover is great news for the private health insurance system and great news for the wider health sector. What would Labor have offered in its place? One proposal Labor put forward was the well-known Medicare Gold. I do not know whether the members opposite still remember Medicare Gold. I am sure they would prefer to forget Medicare Gold. It was going to bridge the divide between the private and the public hospital systems. It was going to put an end to hospital waiting lists, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, espoused at the time. An opposition that was opposed to expanding the health insurance rebate for older Australians actually proposed this scheme of Medicare Gold, which would have provided free hospital care for all Australians over the age of 75. There seemed to be an incredible conflict there. On the one hand, they opposed the increase in the private health insurance rebate for older Australians but, on the other hand, they said they were going to have free of health care for all Australians over 75 and no waiting lists. They said they were going to miraculously eliminate waiting lists. If you were over 75, you would just rock up at the door of the hospital and in you would go, straight through the door, and be treated immediately. It was clearly unsustainable; it was clearly underfunded; it was clearly a Labor pipedream. It was an absolute pipedream. The system of Medicare Gold was quickly discredited. It was discredited by those on this side of the House, it was discredited by the overwhelming weight of health professionals and it was even discredited by those on the other side of politics. It was described by Michael Costello, the former Chief of Staff to the Leader of the Opposition, as a ‘strategic disaster'. It was described by former President of the Australian Labor Party and former minister in the Hawke government Barry Jones as a ‘turkey'. But it was apparently the biggest idea Labor had had on health in a decade, and it was quite clearly one of the worse. Incredibly, Labor will not put the final nail in the coffin of Medicare Gold. That uncosted, underfunded, unsustainable and undeliverable policy is still floating out there in Labor rhetoric land. The 2004 election carrot was rejected by the people of Australia. They realised that the story that Labor was putting in relation to Medicare Gold was not going to be delivered. They could see that there was no proof of how access could be guaranteed to health services or how immediate service could be guaranteed for the over 75s, particularly where procedures required were complicated or difficult. It created the rather incredible situation where a person with a particular condition and of a particular age would be placed in a queue behind someone of an older age, just because that person had achieved the age of 75. We had a situation where Labor was espousing a policy that access to services was defined not by clinical need but by age. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, has called on Labor to renounce Medicare Gold for the farce that it is-to kill it stone dead-so that the people of Australia can get some clear direction on where Labor is coming from on health. We want to kill off that turkey. We want to chop off its head and make sure it does not appear again. Labor does not seem to speak much of Medicare Gold. I would like the opposition once and for all, in no uncertain terms, to state its tion in this House that Medicare Gold is dead-that it is off the agenda. While we wait for Labor to construct a cohesive health strategy, the government will continue delivering affordable, workable health outcomes for every Australian-that is, not a pipedream but affordable and workable outcomes. The government introduced the nogap and known-gap scheme, which provides health insurance members with a number of benefits. It provides cover for the difference between doctors' fees and the combined health insurance and Medicare benefits payable for in-hospital medical services or upfront disclosure of any amount that would not be recovered from the policy. The Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance) Bill 2006 proposes changes to two current health acts. It puts forward an amendment to the National Health Act 1953 to increase the powers of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. Its proposes a change to the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998 to give Medicare Australia more time to provide the Australian Taxation Office with information regarding private health insurance rebates. The government considers this bill an important step because it will enable the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman to more effectively represent consumers in disputes. Schedule 1 of the bill before the House gives the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman greater powers to deal with complaints and to conduct investigations, whether they be of the ombudsman's own initiative or by ministerial request. Schedule 2 responds to an Australian National Audit Office review on the administration of the rebate process and will lead to a simplified system of data exchange between the Australian Taxation Office and Medicare. Australians with private health insurance use the services of the Private Health Insurposiance Ombudsman in times of dispute with their fund because of the ombudsman's independence. The same is true of the private health insurance industry, private hospitals or medical practitioners when they have a complaint. Under the current system, the office of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman is somewhat limited in the way they can deal with some disputes. It is important to ensure consumers are not exposed to risk during negotiations or disputes with health funds or health service providers, and the government feels that the involvement of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman in these negotiations is in the best interests of all parties and creates a more transparent system. The position of Private Health Insurance Ombudsman was first created in 1995. Over the ensuing decade the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman has been the referee in disputes between parties in the private health insurance industry. It is the government's view that the powers of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman do not allow for effective mediation of complaints and contract disputes between private health care providers and private health funds. The bill is designed to empower the ombudsman to settle these disputes quickly and effectively. It also broadens the scope the ombudsman has for securing the necessary documentation needed to settle disputes, specifically on fund and health care provider contracts. The bill before the House today is important because it will enhance the operation of our health care system. Philosophically, Labor have an absolute opposition to private health insurance cover. I would like to see them reverse that stance. I would like to see them come up with policies that enhance and support the government's position on private health insurance as an important part of our health system, as a major buttress to a quality health system comprising both the private and the public sector. It is hard enough to get any services out of our states. When you look at the way the states administer their health systems, there is some concern amongst the public. This government has a view of supporting the public system through a strong private sector. This government has the view that policies such as Medicare Gold-the undeliverable, underfunded pipedream-should be abandoned by Labor. We would be looking for a clear statement to that effect.",34
15,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Order! It being 10.30 am, in accordance with a resolution agreed to earlier today, I call the Minister for Health and Ageing. Mr Abbott- Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest it might assist the House if we indulge the member for Blaxland for 30 seconds or so. He has some important points he wishes to make.",37
16,Mr HATTON,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Blaxland) (10.30 am)On the 10th anniversary of my election to this House, nothing much has changed except that the government believes in externalising its responsibilities, in moving from the public to the private, in simply auditing and benchmarking and in taking no significant responsibility for the operation of the government or its agencies. Although we support the extension of the powers to the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman, the fundamental problem here is that this externalises Commonwealth government business and control. I thank the House for this one gagged opportunity, and the minister's consideration to do this on the 10th anniversary of my election.",37
17,Mr ABBOTT,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I appreciate that I do not often do good things, but I am pleased to have been able to accommodate the member for Blaxland, particularly as it is the 10th anniversary of his election to this House. I think he is doing a much better job than his predecessor did as the member for Blaxland. I wish to thank everyone who has contributed to the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance) Bill 2006. This bill should have the united support of the House because, while all of us have various issues with government policies and while all of us have various issues with aspects of the health system, the fact is that it is about enhancing protection for consumers, it is about trying to ensure that private health insurance policyholders get a better deal and it is about extending the powers of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman to the whole sector. I think this is very good news for ryone, and I am pleased that speakers on all sides of the House have indicated that they support the bill, whatever other issues they might have. The member for Lalor made some general criticisms of the state of private health insurance. In effect, she said that it was unattrac- dro? tive, expensive and complex. I would simply say to the honourable member that it is a lot more attractive, it is a lot less expensive and it will be a lot less complex thanks to the policies of this government. The percentage of the population with private health insurance has increased dramatically thanks to the government's policies, particularly Lifetime Health Cover and the rebate, which Labor have never been comfortable with. While from time to time in muted tones they suggest that they do not really want to abolish it, we have many on-the-record statements by members opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition, that they regard the private health insurance rebate as very poor public policy. The fact is the rebate makes private health insurance much less expensive than would otherwise be the case. I point out for the benefit of members opposite that, while no-one likes premium increases and while premium increases have certainly been significant under this government, averaging about 5½ per cent a year, that is just half of the average premium increase that took place between 1983 and 1995. The member for Lalor remains highly critical of the government's decision to sell Medibank Private. For her benefit, let me point out that the best guarantee of good services is competition, not government ownership. Certainly, existing players in the sector believe that the privatisation of Medibank Private will increase competition, not decrease competition. I think that we will find that a privatised Medibank Private will be a much fiercer competitor for the other organieve- sations in private health insurance. In response to the second reading amendment of the member for Lalor, the general public is always sceptical about privatisation, but the task of government is not to slavishly follow opinion polls. Ms Gillard-What about the Snowy Hy",37
18,Mr ABBOTT,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"The task of government is to pursue good policy, and I would remind the member for Lalor that at all times the majority of Australians were against the privatisation of Qantas, which was done by the former government, and they were against the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank, which was begun by the former government. Ms Gillard-And the Snowy Hydro.",38
19,Mr ABBOTT,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Privatisation makes a great deal of sense, particularly in areas where there is fierce competition. There is a world of difference between Medibank Private, which is just one-admittedly the largest, but it is just one-private health insurer in a large and competitive market, and the Snowy Hydro, which was a virtual monopoly. It certainly is a public utility. Sure, we can always improve structural weaknesses in the health sector, but workforce shortages have already been very substantially addressed by this government. Again, no-one likes the rising costs of health, but this government, through measures such as the Medibank safety net, is doing a lot to handle that.",38
20,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Order! The original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

21,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"In accordance with the resolution agreed to earlier today, the question is that the remaining stages of the bill be agreed to. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. DO NOT CALL REGISTER BILL 2006 Cognate bill: NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 May, on motion by Mr MCGauran: That the bill be now read a second time.",40
22,Mr RIPOLL,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"I rise today, on behalf of the Labor Party, to speak on the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 and the Do Not Call Register (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006. It is my great pleasure speak on such important legislation because this has been an issue in the Australian community for many years, one that members on this side of the HouseLabor-have been calling, pardon the pun, for action on for a considerable period of time. The introduction of this legislation is a significant win for Labor. This legislation has been pursued by Labor and we have put pressure on the government. While it is a win for Labor in parliamentary terms, it is a huge win for the community. Labor have been calling for the establishment of a national do not call list since before the last federal tion and have been campaigning on the issue for the past two years. Personally, I have very actively campaigned on this issue in the local community. It gives me great pleasure to be here today to speak on this bill, because the people of Oxley-indeed, all the people of Australia-will be very pleased when these measures have been introduced. This is a long overdue win for Australians and a change that will give them back some peace of mind and a bit of phone freedom. The government's backflip on this issue is very welcome. The bills essentially provide for the creation of the national Do Not Call Register that allows individuals to opt not to receive unsolicited calls from telemarketers. The register would be overseen by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, the ACMA. The new regime that will be established by these bills will give a greater sense of freedom to all Australians-freedom from being pestered by telemarketers during dinner, while bathing the kids or while relaxing and enjoying a bit of quiet time at home by themselves or with their friends and family. This is very real-I do not say these things lightly. I will speak from my own experience of telemarketers. After getting home from a long day at work and spending some time in the kitchen undertaking some household chores-enjoying a bit of quiet time and feeling pretty tired-it is annoying enough that the phone rings at all, even though it could be a friend, but you can be very annoyed, even angry, when you realise it is an unsolicited call from a telemarketer trying to sell you something over the phone. I think everybody could relay their own personal experience. When it happens to you once in a night it is annoying, and when it happens to you twice in a night it is frustrating, but when it happens to you three times in a night elecyou get very angry. Sometimes the only option is to take the phone off the hook. People do not mind being interrupted by a phone call at home when there is a good likelihood of it being somebody who is close to them-a friend or someone who is calling them personally-but, for a lot of people, answering the call late at night is approached with trepidation. For many older people, it can be an intimidating experience to have somebody on the other end of the phone asking them specific questions, giving them information and, from my own experience, giving them a bit of a hard time. For many people this is quite intimidating. It can be a horrible experience. With the introduction of the measures, that will no longer be the case. People will be able to opt out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls. When this bill is introduced people will rush to this list. They will do so in their tens of thousands. People will take this opportunity to opt out, because they see it as their right to use their phone for private purposes and not for receiving unsolicited calls. As the explanatorily memorandum states, the framework contained in the bill is designed to regulate and minimise: ... unsolicited telemarketing calls made to Australian telephone numbers that originate from overseas numbers or Australian numbers. It also acknowledges that, while telemarketing is a legitimate method by which businesses can market their services or seek donations, the new system will empower Australians to express a preference not to be called by telemarketers. As much as I believe telemarketers have a right to call people, people have a right to refuse those calls and to therefore opt out completely from the system. I think that is legitimate for consumers in this country. There are some exceptions in the bill: for example, some public interest organisations are permitted to make telemarketing calls. I think the real issue is that those so permitted should make calls within reasonable hours and within the reasonable bounds of what people would expect. The principal mechanism of this new regime is the establishment of a Do Not Call Register, which would be kept by the Australian Communications and Media Authority or a delegated authority. People will be able to register not only their home number but also their mobile phone number. For many people, their mobile phone number is also their home number as many people have adopted the practice of having a mobile phone as their means of communication. It is important that mobile phones are included because for many people it is a work related tool or a communication device that is very personal to them, and they do not want to be annoyed by telemarketing calls on that private number. Telemarketers who wish to promote their services will be required to check their calling lists against the numbers registered in the do not call list to ensure that they do tact numbers of individuals who have opted out of receiving telemarketing calls. My very strong message to telemarketers is to respect the wishes of those who opt out and list their numbers as not to be called. I think that is very important. Complaints relating to the Do Not Call Register and breaches of the bill can be made to the ACMA. A range of penalties are enforceable. I believe that those penalties should be followed through completely and that they should be fully enforced. A strong message needs to go out that these laws will be acted upon. People have tried to opt outa company has rung them and they have asked to be removed from the company's list-only to find that they have received a call from the same company 15 minutes later, or the following day or the following week. It seems that for many people the frustration of continually trying to ring and get their name removed has been pointless. This bill should alleviate that problem. The introduction of these new measures has long been overdue. Unwanted telemarketing is a serious problem and one that is getting worse in this country. I just want to bring to the attention of the House, and of people listening, a few salient facts as they relate to the telemarketing industry. The volume of telemarketing calls in Australia has been skyrocketing, to the point where, for many telemarketers, it is now almost a useless exercise. I see some acknowledgment of that in the gallery. As I said earlier, I think people understand this whole point about telemarketers very directly. For a lot of telemarketers as well it must be frustrating to ring people who are sick and tired of getting these calls, to the point where it is absolutely useless. People get frustrated and angry and are hesitant to answer the phone later in the night because of all these calls. Research conducted last year estimated not conthat telemarketing companies made more than 1 billion-that is right: 1 billiontelemarketing calls. That is a staggering thought. That is 53 calls per person or 2.7 calls per household per week-way too many; a figure which is out of control. These numbers represent an increase in telemarketing calls of six per cent on the previous year. In addition, the behaviour of some telemarketing companies is deplorable. While many telemarketing companies act in a responsible manner, there are many others who act irresponsibly. In fact, some, I would say, use disturbing tactics to pressure vulnerable people on the end of a phone-people who do not have the capacity to articulate their wishes or the power to really refuse someone on the phone. That is a real issue, a real problem. Many people in the community cannot simply be rude and just say to telemarketers, ‘Go away!' This bill gives them the power to tell telemarketers to go away. And they can do it directly, by listing their numbers on the Do Not Call Register. Once people understand that these laws have been passed-and I can assure you that I will be doing everything I can to promote them in my electorate and that many others will be doing the same across the country-they will be rejoicing in their new-found freedom. Many of the call centres engaged in telemarketing employ aggressive and, in some cases, deceitful sales practices, exploiting the wrong. most vulnerable in our community. As I say, this does not apply to all of them, obviously. There are many respectable, honourable telemarketers who do their job properly, within the bounds of the law and of what we would determine to be an ethical standard. But there are some who do not. Unsolicited calls are the biggest source of complaints to the New South Wales Office of Fair Trading, and in 2005 there was a surge in the number of complaints recorded in Victoria and South Australia. I am sure that the numbers in Queensland are also staggering-the numbers of people who are completely annoyed, who have absolutely had enough. It is clear, therefore, that there is substantial community interest in stopping unwanted telemarketing. The community has demanded action. For years it has been ignored by government. Labor has been pushing this issue for well over two years. In fact, it was on the policy platform before the last election. Again, I welcome the backflip of the government on this issue. Every once in a while you have to applaud a backflip from governments. Governments that do backflips and admit that they were wrong should be congratulated. So I would congratulate the government on a spectacular backflip on this very important issue. Labor acknowledged that the rate of unsolicited telemarketing calls had grown significantly in recent years. In fact, in 2004, Labor proposed the introduction of the national Do Not Call Register, but the then communications minister Daryl Williams dismissed Labor's policy as just plain populist. Well, I am afraid he was wrong. It may be a populist issue but it is still a real issue-a real issue that concerns many people in the community and one that needs to be dealt with. Now that the government has backflipped on this and adopted Labor's policy, I say that perhaps the then communications minister was more than I want to make special mention here of my colleague the member for Chisholm, Anna Burke, who introduced a private member's bill in late 2005 to establish a national do not call list, to be managed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Under that bill, telemarketers who contacted numbers on the list would be subject to fines of up to $10,000. The provisions of this private member's bill are largely reflected in the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006. One area of difference between the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 and Labor's policy is that the government has prevented small businesses from registering on the list. Whether amendments to this bill reflecting this position should be moved will be discussed between the shadow minister for communications and the shadow minister for small business. Labor welcomes today the change of heart from the Howard government to adopt Labor's do not call list banning unwanted telemarketing phone calls. This is a win, as I said earlier, for Labor but it is also a huge win for ordinary families. Labor has long understood that Australians have become sick and tired of being hassled by annoying telemarketing phone calls. Unfortunately for Australian families, John Howard played politics on nuisance calls. When the member for Chisholm, Anna Burke, gave notice that she would be introducing a private member's bill into the House of Representatives last year creating such a national Do Not Call Register, the government refused to even allow a vote on the bill. The government then cynically released a discussion paper on the issue, on the day before the bill was scheduled for debate. Now, after almost six months of delay, the Howard government has fully adopted Labor's policy position. Senator Coonan should explain why she has made Australian families endure a further six months of annoying telemarketing calls just to allow her to take the political credit for this policy. She also explain why the nuisance calls will go on until 2007. Petty politics like this demonstrates the rogance of a government that has been in power for far too long. The Howard government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming all along on this issue. It is clearly out of touch with community interest and does not understand how frustrated and annoyed ordinary Australian families are when they get home from a hard day at work and receive these nuisance calls. Labor listened and pressured the Howard government. Now Australian families will see an end to this irritating practice. The next challenge for the Howard government is to adopt Labor's plan to give peace of mind to parents concerned about their kids' exposure to violent and pornographic material on the internet. We will be happy to continue to pressure this government until it understands what ordinary families need and deserve. So today I also call on John Howard to perform his second backflip and adopt Labor's plan, which requires all internet service providers to offer a filtered, ‘clean feed' internet service to all households, schools and other public internet points accessible by children. As I said, we welcome this bill. We welcome the Do Not Call Register, and Labor are very pleased that the government adopted our policy.",40
23,Mr SECKER,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"Barker) (10.52 am)Failure is an orphan but success has many fathers. It is always interesting that, when you see members of the opposition get up on what is obviously a very good government initiative, they always try to claim the credit for it. I am not saying that they did not have any influence on these decisions, but to outrageously claim all the benefits of and all the credit for the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 is genuinely over the top. I think the member for Oxley normally gives a fairly reasonable should contribution to this parliament. He even showed his warm and caring side today, telling us how he enjoyed cleaning up and cookaring at home and did not like being interrupted by the phone calls while he was doing that. He is a very warm and caring member-although I think many people, when they are washing the dishes, would not mind being interrupted by something! I agree with the member for Oxley that there is nothing more annoying when you have got home after a long day at work and you want to spend some time with your family or you have some other things to do or you have settled down to watch a movie-all those occasions when you are having your own time-and you are interrupted by someone who has no interest in you except in what he or she can perhaps sell to you. It is very annoying, and those occasions seem to have been on the increase. I can remember years ago-and I do not know whether it is an urban myth or notthat the story used to be that if somebody rang up you could leave the phone off the hook, just walk away and then that person might hang up but they could not use that line. That is what I used to do. But unfortunately, after about half an hour, you realise that somebody else might be trying to get through to you, so you hang up your phone. Other people have had the experience of getting one of these calls from a telemarketer. They have decided that they will just leave it there hanging, go off, wash the dishes and come back, and they have found the person still talking without drawing a breath. Those sorts of stories abound all over Australia. It is very annoying, and I think there is general agreement on both sides of this parliament that there will not be any opposition to this legislation because it is a very fine idea. I regularly have constituents ringing up and complaining. I tell them that there is a register, but this goes much further. Often these calls are time consuming, with a hundred different questions before you even find out what they are calling about. As a rule, if I get one of these calls myself, say, ‘Not interested,' and hang up. You soon come to recognise them. But I will be the first to admit that I mistook one caller with an Indian-sounding voice who tried to ring me three times. I was getting pretty annoyed by this stage, until I found out that this person actually worked for my local bank and had a pretty important reason to be ringing me up. That was the problem, as I think we all must recognise. I think India is the telemarketing centre of the world, and we recognise these voices, as I did. I plead guilty of making a mistake on this occasion. On top of the frustration, as I said, many of the telemarketers are not even calling from Australia, nor do they speak fluent English. A recent advertisement by the Royal Automobile Association in South Australia depicted the character George talking about the frustrations of overseas call centres, in a humorous approach. The ‘Which deli?' advertisement showed George telling cafe owner Trevor about the service provided by a call centre operator from New Delhi, India. George asks where the call centre operator is calling from, to which he replies, ‘New Delhi.' George says that he is actually at the new deli in his neighbourhood. The call centre operator replies that they should catch up for a curry and a pappadum. Whilst the advertisement has been removed from the air, as the Advertising Standards Board received the complaint that it was racist, it certainly shows the common frustrations felt by many people at having service calls answered by overseas call centre operators. This legislation is a very welcome step to saying goodbye to those nuisance calls. It is fantastic that this government-and I give credit to members of the opposition that they support it as well-has heard the cries of the public demands for such a register to be established. Last year alone, complaints to the I just Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman on telemarketing had increased by more than 600 per cent. That is a huge increase in anyone's terms. That is saying something about the inconvenience and interruptions to people's lives that these calls are creating. We should also note that the proposal of such a register is supported by the telemarketing industry peak body, the Australian Direct Marketing Association, or ADMA. I think they should also be given credit for recognising this problem. The model being proposed is a legislated national register which will give the regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, the power to enforce industry compliance. The ACMA will also establish the administrative arrangements for the operation of the register. This legislation will also enable the establishment of minimum contact standards to which all telemarketers must adhere, including all exempted organisations such as charities. There may still be some concern that charities are exempt. In my experience, charities are often the ones making these calls-and also to small business. I note that the member for Oxley raised this as well. I think that, in time, we will need to review those two areas. Small businesses often complain to me that they are busy during the day when they get these calls and the calls take up their time. We all like to think that charities are good and that they provide a great service, but they can also be annoying. I often get phone calls asking for donations, not because I am a member of parliament but because I am an average Joe Citizen like everyone else. Certainly my constituents often tell me that it is charities that are doing the ringing up, often at 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock at night when it is very inconvenient. It seems that Australians are not the first to encounter this type of register, with successful schemes having been in operation in many countries, including the United States since 2003 and the United Kingdom since 1999. The proposed model for Australia takes the best features of schemes already operating in other countries but is primarily based on the United States model. This register gives the power to the consumer to say no to these annoying calls. Consumers will have the legal right to stop telemarketing approaches at any time by placing their numbers, both fixed line and mobile phone numbers, on the national register. Once a telephone number is on the do not call list, telemarketers other than those in exempt categories will be prohibited from contacting a registered number unless they have prior consent. All this is free to consumers. Individuals can nominate to register either via the internet, post or telephone and, once they have done so, their numbers will remain on the register for a period of three years before they will have to be reregistered unless they are removed earlier. As per similar international systems, the government will fund the regulatory costs of the register and will contribute to the establishment costs for the register, including some ongoing costs. With the register proposed to cost just over $33 million over four years to establish, the government will make a contribution of $17.2 million over the four years. The industry will contribute $15.9 million over the same period, and telemarketers will then be required to pay for access to the register in the form of fees for access. I am pleased to note that ACMA would be empowered to enforce compliance of the register with the onus then being on the telemarketing industry to avoid calling anyone on the register without their consent. Should they not consult the register and dial consumers who are on it, they will face a fine. I am also pleased to note that the register would apply to calls made within Australia as well as to calls made from overseas. Often companies have call centres located overseas, and this legislation will capture calls made overseas to an Australian number, even if the telemarketer or the commissioning company does not have a presence in Australia. Whilst enforcement of such calls may be difficult, it is recognised that telemarketing is in large part an international problem. With this in mind, the government has recognised the importance of cooperating with other countries in developing bilateral or multilateral arrangements to help move more effecthe tively towards global enforcement of telemarketing. Of course, in every situation, there are exemptions to the rules. Within our country there are some organisations that would be exempt from these rules, such as certain government bodies-including the armed forces and police forces-registered political parties, religious organisations, charities and educational institutions. For government bodies, telephone calls are an important mechanism through which the government is directly able to contact the public. Exempting such bodies as government departments, agencies including armed forces and police forces and authorities or instrumentalities of the Commonwealth, states and territories requiring to contact the public from time to time would seem sensible and appropriate. For the purpose of staying in touch with constituents, political parties, independent members of parliament and nominated political candidates would be exempt. I note with some interest that, I believe, a member of the other place has suggested that politicians should not be exempt. We may laugh in this House about senators not knowing much about constituents at times, because we are the people's house. I am sure you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, would have done a very similar thing when, like me, you are driving along in a large rural electorate and you ring someone out of the blue-it is not a bad thing to pick a number-with a hands-free phone set-up so that you are not breaking the law and driving dangerously. That is a risk we take. If someone does not like us doing that, they can vote against us. That is their ultimate way of saying, ‘We didn't like that call.' My experience in this is that people have been quite surprised that a member of parliament has rung them out of the blue, and they are quite happy have a chat about anything. As long as you do it in a polite manner and listen to them, they take it very well. I think that is a very good thing for parliamentarians to do. The exemption also applies to persons nominated as a candidate under the Commonwealth Electoral Act-and I think it is only fair that we treat all candidates, whether or not they are the sitting member, the same. They can be a candidate under the Commonwealth Electoral Act or a relevant state or territory law that deals with electoral ters. Where this exemption does not apply is when a party member seeks to promote their own business through telemarketing calls for their own benefit. We are awake to that. As religious organisations provide valuable support and community services, as well as moral guidance to many people within the community, they have been exempt from these rules. Educational institutions also need to contact their students to inform them of the needs of the institutions and to solicit funds to ensure their viability, and for these reasons they are also being exempt from the rules. While it sounds as though consumers are trying to stop communicating with anyone unknown to them, we must remember that the telemarketing industry actually wants this register. The industry will benefit through decreased operational costs associated with the proposed national telemarketing standards, reduced costs of compliance with state and territory legislation and better targeting of calls as they will no longer call individuals who will hang up on them-as I do and as I am sure many members of this parliament and many members of the public do. This legislation signifies consumers and the government taking a stand for our privacy and our precious time and how we choose to use it. For a long time we have received these annoying calls and, with people working as hard as they do nowfamilies and children being busy with schooling, sports and other activities-time is precious. Why would anyone want to waste five minutes that they could have with their children, after just walking in the door from work and with the children heading off to bed, to listen to a telemarketer calling from another country and selling something that is completely useless to the family? The Do Not Call Register will put an end to this. I do not think anyone in this chamber should matoppose this bill and would be very surprised if anyone did. I commend the bill to the House.",44
24,Mr FITZGIBBON,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, House: (1) welcomes the Government's decision to implement Labor's plan to establish a Do Not Call Register; (2) declares that the carve out for small and micro business represents a substantial deficiency in the bill and represents Government complacency on small business policy; and (3) calls on the Government to adopt Labor's more comprehensive model”. I begin my contribution on the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006, as I did yesterday on a couple of occasions, by expressing my disappointment at the government's decision to gag this and a number of other important bills-and they are important for a number of reasons. From the reaction of the government's own backbench, we can see the importance of the immigration bill that is being gagged. We all understand why it is being gagged. It has been done in an attempt to minimise political damage and fallout for this government. Yesterday Labor wished to move a technical amendment to the petroleum bill and we were denied that opportunity. There could be no better example of an affront to parliamentary democracy than the successful attempt to deny minor opposition parties the right to move amendments in this place. However, it is not only an affront to Australian democracy; it is an insult to all those whom we represent in this place. We should be able to move such amendments in this place. Indeed, today I am again being denied the opportunity to move, on behalf of many Australians-in this case small business-a consideration in detail amendment to this bill. There could not possibly be any justification for that action. On that basis, I seek leave to table the amendment that I would have moved in the consideration in detail stage, if I had been given the opportunity to do so and not the gagged by the government on this issue. I have discussed the matter with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and I am sure he would be happy to grant leave. Leave granted.",48
25,Mr FITZGIBBON,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"The Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 provides for the creation of a national register that will allow individuals to opt out from receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls. The register will be overseen by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. Exemptions will be provided for certain types of telemarketing calls to allow organisations who carry out activities in the public interest to carry out their work and to continue to provide services to the community. The exempt bodies are charities, registered political parties-so the Prime Minister will be able to call people at home again during the next election, if he is still around-independent members of parliament and candidates, religious organisations, educational institutions and government bodies. The Do Not Call Register (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 enables the development of relevant industry codes and standards relating to telemarketing calls. It requires the ACMA to make national standards regulating the making of all telemarketing calls. The mandatory standards will relate to certain conduct matters, such as the time at which telemarketing calls may be made, the information that must be provided to recipients and the termination of such calls. The standard will apply to all telemarketers including those exempt from Do Not Call Register arrangements. As indicated by the member for Oxley, Labor welcomes this legislation; it is long overdue. I am sure that he pointed out to the House that Labor has been calling for this for at least 18 months-I think longer. I believe that we took this policy to the last federal election. For whatever reason, the government for a long time was very reluctant to move on the matter, but community pressure has been overwhelmingly strong and has obviously forced the government's hand. I just make mention of the member for Chisholm. Unfortunately, she cannot be here today. She is unwell and has had to go home. She will be very disappointed to have missed this debate. All members of this House will be aware that the member for Chisholm has driven this agenda. She has run a very heavy public campaign and has introduced a private member's bill into this place to give effect what the government is attempting to achieve today. It is interesting to note the number of submissions that were made on this bill. I was surprised to see them as I went through the bill's explanatory memorandum. There were some 12 submissions from small business, 28 from charitable organisations, 32 from telemarketing organisations, eight from telephone carriers, five from consumer groups, eight from government, 20 from special interest groups, one from a social and market research organisation and, interestingly, 377 from individuals. So you can see where the push is coming from. It is not coming from industry organisations, as is so often the case in this place. The push is coming from ordinary mums and dads and families out there who are sick and tired of receiving unsolicited telephone calls at dinner- instance. time or while they are watching their favourite movie or footy event. I am one of those victims. In particular, over the last Christmas period, I was inundated with unsolicited phone calls from these marketing organisations. It drove me crazy-absolutely crazy. It enraged me at times to be receiving these calls while trying to enjoy a short Christmas break and some quiet time with my family. Interestingly, my daughter came home from school one day and informed me that someone at the school had told her the best way to deal with these calls is not to hang up but to leave the phone off the hook, sitting idle, and just let the telemarketers speak for five minutes or for however long until they work out that you are no longer on the other end. So that has become the practice in my household, and I understand that many households have adopted that same practice. It is very frustrating to receive these calls, often at the worse possible times. On that basis, like the 377 people who made submisto sions and the many members of parliament, including Anna Burke, who have been pushing the case, I am delighted that the government has finally moved on this very important issue. We lag behind other nation states. These measures have been in effect in the United States and in the United Kingdom for some time, and I understand Canada is in the process of putting them in place. I know there has been some concern about the impact on the telemarketing industry, but the evidence from other nations where these things have been put into effect is that it has not been too adverse. In fact, it has forced the industry to have another look at itself and at how it can better present its case to the consumers it is targeting. I am very pleased that we are moving to a mandatory system. I think that is the only way we will give proper effect to what we are trying to achieve in this The second reading amendment I have moved gives members an opportunity to talk about a few things, particularly the tardiness of the government in bringing this legislation forward. But it also gives us an opportunity to talk about the impact of this legislation on small business. The amendment I had intended to move at the consideration in detail stage of this bill would have allowed small business to opt back into system. Unfortunately from my perspective, the government has made a decision to not allow small business people to opt into the system. In other words, private individuals at home will be able to register and request that they not be called and people with mobile phones will be able to request that they not be called, but people in small business will not be able to do the same. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, says that the government took this decision because she was concerned that business undertaking ordinary business-tobusiness activity throughout the day might inadvertently get caught up in this legislation. That makes no sense to me. I cannot see the Australian Communications and Media Authority taking action against a small business for inadvertently falling under the scope of this bill. It would be clear to the authority that that is not the intention of the parliament, and I think it is highly unlikely that the authority would take any action in that event. There is a very blurry line here between what is a business phone and what is a private phone-take tradespeople, in particular, who use their mobile phones for both purposes. You can imagine the small business builder, up on top of a roof, working away, when his phone rings. He needs to have that phone on his hip because not having it on his hip means the possible loss of business. So he keeps the phone on his hip and he keeps it turned on in case a customer is trying to call. But how frustrating is it for him-or it could be her-to struggle to put the hammer down, get the phone off the hip and risk falling off the roof only to learn that the call is coming from a telemarketer putting a proposition to him that he has absolutely no interest in. You can imagine a motor mechanic working under a vehicle in the dirt and the heat when the phone rings. He is compelled to come from under the car and run to the office to take the phone call, and you can understand how frustrating it is for him to find that the person on the other end of that telephone call is indeed a telemarketer trying to sell him something he has no interest in whatsoever. People in retail or people in hairdressing and beauty therapy doing their treatments cannot afford to ignore the phone, to have the phone off the hook or to offend people with an answering machine. They are absolutely compelled to answer that phone every time it rings because they want to deliver the best possible service they can to their customers and to their potential customers. There is nothing more frustrating for them than to be interrupted and to have to leave their client or their customer alone for a few moments to go to answer a phone call that turns out to be from a telemarketer flogging something they have no interest in. Whilst I understand there could be some concern on the government's part about people inadvertently getting caught in the net, if you balance that against the disadvantages for small firms then clearly you would have to default to the view that it is important to also include small businesses in that same net. I have moved the second reading amendment to give members the opportunity to talk more broadly about that. Again, can I say how disappointed I am that Labor will be denied the opportunity to move its amendment at the consideration in detail stage-a technical amendment that we should have been able to move. That amendment would have simply put small business back in the system. In my amendment, as the House will see, we were measuring small businesses-those with 20 employees or fewer. If the government had allowed us to debate that amendment and had decided, for good reason, that a better measure could be put in place for small business, we would have been happy to have that debate and change the amendment. It is absolutely unacceptable for the government to deny us the opportunity to even move that amendment in this place. If I remember correctly, this bill has already been dealt with in the Senate. It initiated in the Senate, through Senator Coonan. So, in effect, we have been completely denied the opportunity to move that amendment. Often in cases when we face a gag, we have the opportunity to move the amendment in the other place. But, if I am correct on that point, we will not have that opportunity. This is a ridiculous denial of parliamentary justice. I invite the minister representing Helen Coonan in this place, when delivering his summation on this bill, to better explain to the House why it was that in the end small business was carved out of this process, because it is certainly not coming from submissions from small business. I can quote for the House the head of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, Mr Tony Steven, who said: Constant calls from telemarketers are a time imposition for small business. We do want to restrict business-to-business marketing, but we should be protected from mass marketing telemarketing campaigns run by call centres in India. He reinforces the point I have made. We deal with some very technical legislation in this place on a daily basis, but the government wants to tell me they cannot produce legislation that protects small business from massmarketing telemarketers and at the same time ensures they are able to continue to do their normal business-to-business activity on any given day. That is a ridiculous proposition. I smell a rat. I do not know what it is, but I just cannot understand why the government would carve small business out. That is why Labor wanted to move an amendment to carve them back in. The minister needs to come back in this place and articulate to us very clearly why it is that small business is going to be denied the opportunity to be protected from telemarketers in the same way that we at home are to be protected. I remind the House again that there is a very blurry line between what is a private phone and what is a business phone, particularly for tradesmen. We know the statistics on the ever-increasing reliance of small business on mobile phones to undertake their business. Of course, that extends now to wireless technology on the internet et cetera. It is becoming increasingly popular. This is a time when the government should be working harder to assist small business, not making things more difficult for it. So, in the absence of an opportunity to move the amendment, I invite the government to consider my amendment between now and the closure of the debate on this bill. If they want to have a rethink and embrace my amendment as their own, they would be more than welcome to do so.",48
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Kelvin Thomson-I second the amendment.,51
27,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Hunter has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,51
28,Mr CADMAN,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"A Do Not Call Register is really a database with a list of names and numbers of people who do not want to have unsolicited calls. I think the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 and the Do Not Call Register (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 are going to be welcomed by many Australians. In my electorate office I have had many calls from people. Those who are disabled, the elderly and those who are on their own are the key callers who hate the interruptions and the inconvenience-not of having a meal disturbed but of having to answer a phone which may be an emergency call or a call from a relative seeking their support or assistance. The elderly and infirm are always conscientious in answering phones. The register will be established and it will be for private owners. The previous speaker from the Australian Labor Party, Mr Fitzgibbon, raises the problems of small business. I think it is a fairly easily deduced ferential the government is placing here in the legislation of public and private use-the publicly advertised telephone numbers of a small business compared to the private use of an individual. The government has made that separation and I think it is a perfectly reasonable separation. It is okay to speculate that not all business phones can be easily separated from private use. That may be the case, but if a phone is publicly advertised as a business number and the normal hours of contact are between nine and five or between seven and seven then access should be granted to those publicly available phone numbers. Direct marketers are really competing in what is called the attention economy. They want to grab attention. The process of direct marketing by telephone is like spam: they hope that, by making a certain number of hits at very low cost per contact, they are going to be able to pick up the attention of somebody they are calling and get a market response from them-something they can use, perhaps not in that call, but that can be stored and used at a future time. There is a feeling amongst marketers that consumers may be more receptive if they are at home and contacted by a personal call rather than by print or by television advertising. So it is a more personal type of advertising. No doubt it would not be continued if there were no gain from the process. It is just like spam: if they hit enough people, the marketers may get a response. It is often said that the inconvenience of these calls is small and that this proposal should not go ahead. In the United States currently there are approximately 10 calls per day per telephone subscriber marketing through this direct calling process. In Australia. I understand the figure is about two calls per day on average. We have got a long way to go to reach the numbers in the United difStates. The concerns being expressed by the Australian community justify the steps the government is taking. Most reputable organisations in fact keep a list of those who prefer not to be called, but then that just leaves the door open for the disreputable or the overseas contractor to be able to use a direct marketing process straight to the home of the elderly or the disabled. Therefore, the government has chosen to take a step to address this. Not everybody in this field is reputable. Not everybody is going to have their own database and set aside an in-house process where calls are not made. The Do Not Call Register will be limited to basically private telephones, and that is the way it should be. Publicly listed phones available for business should be open to direct marketing. Is this a problem elsewhere? Canada is in the process of introducing similar legislation and the UK and the USA have done so already. It is understood that there are 90 million people registered with the US Federal Trade Commission on the National Do Not Call Registry. Ninety million Americans have said, ‘We don't want direct marketing through our telephones.' I am indebted to Caslon Analytics Ltd for providing some of the statistics for this industry. The most common cause for complaint by direct marketers is that there will job losses. Enough people have had calls from outside Australia to know that the job losses will not necessarily be Australian. I understand that the turnover in this industry is about 300 per cent per annum-so the average person holds a job in this industry for approximately four months. So the industry could hardly be termed a permanent place of employment. Not only that, but it is hardly considered to be an entry point to the IT industry. Students-all sorts of people-will pick up a casual job in a call centre and they will stay for only a short time. This is not an industry that holds a big future for them, with big prospects for advancement and long-term employment. I draw the government's attention to voice over internet and the problems it will create. I predict that the use of VoIP rather than the direct telephone line will be the next avenue used by direct marketers. Voice over internet will be very difficult to manage, in my opinion-it will be very difficult to control for the group of marketers who switch to it. This legislation is something that the government has done well. I compliment the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator the Hon. Helen Coonan, on its introduction. The Australian community welcomes it. I am sure many constituents of mine will take advantage of the Do Not Call Register so that there will be a chance for them to say they do not wish to have calls. A registration process will be established, and the cost of the register will be borne, on a cost recovery basis, by the telemarketing industry. From the telemarketing industry's point of view there will be considerable advantages to the register because there will be a reduction in the number of wasted calls. The 90 be million callers who have subscribed to the National Do Not Call Registry in the United States alone must indicate the magnitude of the number of people who do not wish to be bothered by direct marketing schemes. This alone will be a significant saving to direct marketers. The penalties under this program range from $1,100 to $1.1 million, depending on the provisions breached and the seriousness of the breach. But Australians will welcome the register because it applies not only to direct call marketers within Australia but also to those confounded international calls, where it is obvious that the caller has been well schooled but is not living in Australia. These calls are a complete irritant to many of their recipients. I know that the telemarketing industry has tried to address this problem. There have been a number of attempts to have a voluntary code of conduct and solve the problem, but telemarketing is a very entrepreneurial marketing process, and people are very inventive in the way they approach the marketing techniques they have adopted. So it is necessary to legislate. There are just too many operators unwilling to lift their standards or to change the way they do things. Consumers will be able to complain if the process is not working. The Australian Communications and Media Authority, as it is now called, will be administering the program, so they will take charge of any complaints. There will be a level playing field for all telemarketers. The register will be valued by the Australian community. I have received a few calls within the last few weeks from an elderly lady living on her own in a retirement village. She was very unhappy to have received six telemarketing calls in a very short time as she depends on calls from a close relative to report that tive's state of health. She was worried about that person but got confounded calls coming in from people who just annoy and harass her. She is not in the state of mind physically or mentally to be able to cope with that sort of marketing and rang my office on a number of occasions, three days in a row, distressed by the calls she had received. Another gentleman, a Mr Bond, has been calling my office, saying, ‘However do these telemarketers get my silent number?' Telemarketing involves a casual process of dialling, often computer generated, where the marketers are going to pick up silent numbers. This gentleman will now be free of those concerns. So two people who have notified me about this problem recently will welcome this system. Telstra have been helpful. I pay tribute to Wayne Rose of Telstra for the offer of help he has given to both these people. But now they will be set free of this problem. They will register and they will not get the calls.",51
29,Ms BIRD,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 and the Do Not Call Register (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 and broadly endorse the statements made by members on both sides of the House on behalf of their constituents. As the previous speaker said, I am sure we have all received these telemarketing calls. The frail and elderly, in particular, harassed in their homes by these sorts of calls. I have had exactly the same sort of experience. I am glad to be able to speak on this bill, as I have been gagged on so many others. I have a pile of never delivered speeches in my office that I think would almost outnumber those that I have delivered. So I appreciate the opportunity today to speak on this bill. The Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 sets rela- up a scheme to enable individuals who have an Australian number to opt out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls. The bill aims to regulate and minimise calls made to Australian telephone numbers that originate from overseas or Australian numbers-something that will be welcomed by many in our communities. Labor has been calling for the establishment of a national do not call list since July 2004. Further to this, in October 2005 the member for Chisholm proposed a private member's bill to this effect. The Howard government refused to allow a vote on this bill, instead releasing a discussion paper on this issue on the day before the bill was scheduled for debate in the House of Representatives. Now, almost two years after Labor's original proposal in July 2004, the Howard government has put forward this legislation but it will mean that the national do not call list will not be up and running until 2007. So I think we will have missed an opportunity over the intervening 2½ years to provide some relief to many people. For two years Australian families have had to suffer through these annoying telemarketing calls and, unfortunately, they will be forced to endure them until the beginning of next year. I have had hundreds of complaints from my constituents in Cunningham about these irritating calls. They are a nuisance and indeed often a harassment for many people, especially the elderly, infirm and disabled. feel These people are unnecessarily disturbed by nuisance calls, often causing them pain and confusion and indeed financial loss if they get caught up in something with which they had no intention of engaging. They are often disturbed by telemarketers numerous times each day, often-as the previous speaker outlined-while they are awaiting calls from family or awaiting medical results and the like. The phone rings and they then have to get up-and for some who are disabled or frail that can be quite onerous-and find the phone, only to discover it is simply another telemarketer. Many of these people suffer from arthritis or have mobility difficulties. A telemarketing campaign was under way in Wollongong in July last year which resulted in a person's telephone account being changed to another provider without the person's permission. I think the member for Charlton also received complaints in her electorate at that time. The process is called ‘slamming'. Telemarketers phoned my constituents and said they were calling on behalf of their current telephone provider. They asked whether they were speaking to the authorised account holder. The account holder answered yes and the telemarketer then recorded this answer and used it as an ‘authorisation' to transfer their current account to another phone provider. The only way my constituents found out that they had been ‘slammed' was when they received their next telephone bill and it was from another provider. Telemarketers are also a source of frustration for many families in the Illawarra. I know, as a working mother, exactly what that is like. You have picked the kids up from school or child care-or in many cases both-you have done the shopping, you get through the door and you are trying to put the shopping away, start dinner, bathe the kids and help with the homework when the phone rings. You are put on hold and then you hear a voice from overseas telling you that you have been selected as a lucky winner of a mobile phone or accommodationbut only if you sign up to their ‘special' offer. They can be very persistent, aggressive and indeed deceitful. During the past two years of government inaction, I have heard arguments about how a do not call register will affect charities and Australian jobs. It is not the charities or the companies who use Australian call centres that my electorate office receives complaints about. The complaints that I have had are about companies who set up or contract overseas call centres. I receive the most complaints about repeated and aggressive telemarketing calls. My constituents advise me these calls are generally from India and are often from Australian companies who have gone offshore to set up call centres, to the detriment in fact of employment opportunities here in Australia. This type of aggressive telemarketing impacts significantly on the hard working Australians employed legitimately by good companies with good telemarketing practices. The companies that operate offshore use autodialing machines to automatically dial numbers in any numerical sequence. The calls are made from the call centre and then bank up until an operator is available. People are left waiting for a few seconds or up to a minute until one of their operators becomes available. The autodialing method also means that even if you have an unlisted number, as other speakers have identified, you are still susceptible to these calls. In fact, in July 2005 I advertised in my regular electorate newsletter the Australian Direct Marketing Association's voluntary Do Not Call Register. The response from my constituents in Wollongong was explosive, and it is one of the issues that my office has had the most contact on. We received hundreds of calls, all detailing individual experiences and frustration with these particular calls. I was constantly advised that these calls caused even the most normally charming people to become angry and aggressive-such is the extent of the complaints and the emotion that these calls conjure up. All this was met with a great deal of understanding on my behalf. I was certainly brought up to always be polite. I have found in the past with many telemarketers from Australian based companies that, when I had politely listened to their introduction and politely said, ‘Thanks very much for calling but I am not in the least bit interested,' they generally said, ‘Thank you,' and that was the end of the conversation. So, while getting up to answer the phone while I was in the middle of trying to feed the family was a bit noying, at least I had a polite exchange. In more recent times my experience, like many of my constituents' experiences, is that the person on the other end of the line is particuso larly rude and particularly persistent. Having politely listened to their introduction and politely told them you are not in interested, you will get a very aggressive response: ‘Well, I've got this offer. As I've been able to contact you in order to give you an opportunity, I want to tell you about it.' I say, ‘Thank you but I am not interested,' but they persist. On all the occasions that I have had these calls, without exception I have had to simply hang up in the middle of their comments. This is not something that I normally do in my day-today exchanges. As politicians, we have some fairly heated exchanges on occasion but I always manage to feel that I can continue the conversation and that there is a bit of dialogue on both sides. But these calls are not like that. They are aggressive and they are rude. Indeed, on one occasion when a company rang me for the third time that night to sell me some educational products, I again politely explained that I did not have primary school age children and was not interested. When I said, ‘In fact, you have already rung me twice tonight,' the man said, ‘No, we haven't'. I said, ‘Yes, you have,' and he said: ‘No, you're wrong. We haven't rung you before.' When I said, ‘Yes, you have rung me before,' he hung up on me. The outcome may have been pretty good in terms of shortening the call but it left me feeling fairly agitated. I thought that if I were a fairly elderly person and had that exchange it would have been very distressing. These are the sorts of calls that all our electorate offices are getting complaints about. The persistent and aggressive telemarketers make it even more difficult for those that most an- would consider to be genuine and legitimate call centre workers and charities. What happens is that we develop a hard shell and give an abrupt response when we get these calls, genuine people who try to do their job with some professionalism often end up bearing the brunt of a fairly aggressive rethe least bit sponse from the receiver. In 2006 Telstra reported that its unwelcome calls unit received 1,500 calls each day, with between 700 and 800 related to telemarketing. Most complaints reflected the failure of telemarketers to adhere to industry codes of practice and conduct, such as privacy codes and the ADMA's do not call arrangements. These calls are impacting on family time. Many families have advised me that they can be called up to five times in the same evening by the same company. We all lead very busy lives. Many of my constituents commute to Sydney for work; they have very long days and are constantly under pressure to manage their travel to work, child care, after school care and other commitments. The very last thing they want is to be constantly interrupted during the short time they spend with their families in the evening. I really do not think the Howard government understands how intrusive these calls can be. Indeed, during the 2004 election campaign the Liberal Party employed prerecorded telemarketing technology to make unsolicited calls to thousands of Australians before voting day. I must acknowledge the fact that at least the company providing this service to the Liberal Party did employ Australian workers. As I recall, one of the Australians employed by this company was indeed the Prime Minister's son. I fully support the national do not call list, but it should be set up now-in fact, it should have been set up quite a while ago. Australian families and the elderly should not have to wait until 2007 for the list to be set up. Research conducted last year estimated that more than one billion telemarketing calls were made in Australia last year. That is 53 calls per person or 2.7 calls per household per week. The United States of America has had a do not call register scheme since 2003. I was recently speaking to a renowned paediatric pathologist, Dr Edith Schmidt, who is a resident of Las Vegas, the advertising capital of the USA. Dr Schmidt advised me that, prior to the register being set up, she was inundated with unsolicited telemarketing calls to her home every evening. Since registering with the scheme she now receives very few marketing calls and most are misdialled numbers. Schemes in the UK and Canada have been in place since 2004. The main elements of the bill before us are: firstly, a prohibition on making telemarketing calls to an Australian number that is registered on the Do Not Call Register, penalties applying for calls made from an Australian number or from overseas to an Australian number; secondly, a requirement that agreements for the making of telemarketing calls must comply with the act-this is aimed at organisations that may contract with another party to provide their telemarketing services; thirdly, a requirement for a Do Not Call Register to be established, enabling individuals to register their private or domestic number-the register would be kept by the Australian Communications and Media Authority or outsourced to a third party, which would operate the register on its behalf; fourthly, civil penalty provisions, not criminal offences, for a breach of a provisionbreaches may attract significant financial penalties; and, fifthly, a tiered enforcement regime that provides for a range of enforcement measures to be initiated by the ACMA. The enforcement measures include formal warnings, acceptance of an enforceable undertaking or the issuing of an infringement notice. The ACMA may also institute proceedings in the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court for breach of a civil penalty provision. The court may order action that could include the payment of compensation to a victim who has suffered loss or damage as a result of a breach of the act. While I am supporting the bill before usit is crucial that a Do Not Call Register is established-I do feel that the government's efforts in seeking to delay its introduction and in seeking not to have the register fully operational prior to 2007 reflects a lack of understanding of the level of frustration faced by many Australian families and the elderly. In the brief time left I want to also address my disappointment with the gag having the effect of not allowing the amendment of the member for Hunter to be given proper consideration and, I would have hoped, support. I speak to many small business operators in my electorate. Many of them are as frustrated and annoyed by these calls as those of us who have private phone numbers are. If you run a small business-a corner shop, a small florist, a chemist-and you have two or three staff working, and you constantly have someone having to answer the phone because you are getting these sorts of telemarketing calls, it is as annoying and disruptive to your business as it is to many of us in our home lives. I see no reason, to be honest, why we could not have extended the Do Not Call Register to small business. If they want to take the initiative to list on it, they should have the capacity to do that. In particular, that would recognise the modern reality of many small businesses. If plumbers, builders and those sorts of people are out and about on the job all day, generally their business phone is their mobile phone-they are carrying it around with them-and they obviously have to be able to take a call in case it is a business related call. I had the plumber at my place a couple of weeks ago, out the back digging up the pipes, and his phone rang quite a number of times. He complained to me about the fact that these were often telemarketers. He had his hand, shall we say, well and truly in the muck, and it is a fairly intensive job that he needs to concentrate on. He said there is nothing more annoying than having to climb out of the trench, wipe your hands off, get the phone and then discover it is somebody trying to sell you encyclopaedias or something like that. For him, and for many small business people like him, the ability to register on this list would have been a great asset. I think it is extraordinarily disappointing that, because of the gag on this debate, the amendment that the member for Hunter indicated in his speech he would have liked to have moved as a technical amendment will not be considered. On behalf of the small businesses in my area-and I suspect that many on the other side would feel the same and support it-I will continue to urge the government to review this issue and to look at future amendments to this bill to give some relief to those small business operators. In summary, I know that we are all in a mass-marketing world. I get home from work at the end of the day and I can barely get my letterbox open for the amount of junk mail that is in there. It is annoying. But at end of the day it is my decision as to whether or not I engage in those sorts of interactions. If I want to take that whole bundle of stuff out of the letterbox and dump it straight in the recycling bin, which I frequently do, I am able to do that. It is the same with my internet access and pop-ups, emails or whatever. I am choosing to sit at the computer at that time so, while they are annoying, they are manageable. The difference with phone telemarketing is that you are not choosing to engage; they are interrupting you at a time of their convenience and often it is of great inconvenience to you. For the many people in my area who have indicated that this has become the absolute bane of their lives, particularly in the evenings, I think this bill will be very welcome. Their only disappointment in it will be these two aspects: firstly, that they have to wait until the beginning of next year and, secondly, those small businesses affected will not have the opportunity to take advantage of it.",54
30,Dr WASHER,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"The Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 sets up a scheme to enable individuals who have an Australian number to opt out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls. The use of the telephone as a sales tool dates back as far as the early 1900s. That is not bad, considering it was only invented around 1854 by Antonio Meucci-or, if you are a Canadian, in 1875 by Alexander Bell. In Australia, however, it was not until the 1980s that telemarketing techniques became more refined and incorporated into the marketing strategies of businesses of all sizes. In 1996 there were 9,400 people employed as telemarketers. By 2006 this increased to an estimated 250,000. Even though only a very small percentage of calls are successful, telemarketing is still an extremely lucrative part of the marketing mix for many companies. With around 1.065 billion telemarketing calls being made each the year from Australia's 30,000-odd call centres, this adds up to significant sales figures. In 2002 the industry was estimated to be generating around $10 billion per year. With technologies such as voice over internet protocol, the number of calls is only expected to increase. In fact, the Australian Direct Marketing Association states that the telemarketing industry is currently growing at a rate of 17 per cent per year. Such success for business is fantastic. However, there is a down side: those hundreds of millions of receivers who are not interested. These people often feel harassed and intimidated in their own homes. Telemarketers are calling too often, late at night or during meal times and they are far too pushy. Some people have even felt pressured into purchasing products they did not want. When submissions on a discussion paper on the Do Not Call Register were called for, more than 90 per cent of responses were in favour. The message was clear-people wanted their privacy back. People have come up with many ways of attempting to avoid the telemarketing calls. Methods such as caller ID, answering machines and voicemail can be used to screen calls. One novel device is the TeleZapper. Most call centres use a special piece of software known as an autodialler, which calls several numbers simultaneously. When you answer, the autodialler quickly connects you to an operator. The TeleZapper foils the autodialler by issuing a tone that causes the autodialler to think the number is out of service and it does not dial the number again. A much easier and cheaper way for people is the establishment of a Do Not Call Register, which the bill proposes. Individuals who do not wish to receive telemarketing calls can place their home and mobile phone numbers on this register. Telemarketers will be required to check their calling lists against those numbers registered to ensure that they are not contacting those individuals. If they do contact these people, they will face a substantial financial penalty. Individuals will not be required to pay for registering their phone numbers. The operational costs of the scheme will be covered predominately by the telemarketing industry itself. Telemarketers will be required to pay for access to the register in the form of fees for access. The proposed fee structure will be apportioned on the basis of usage of the register. This will result in lower costs for smaller businesses that use the register less frequently. The government will fund the regulatory costs and contribute to the establishment costs and some ongoing operational costs. The scheme will be administered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, which will have the option to either run or tender out the operation of the Do Not Call Register. It will establish the operational requirements for the register and enforce the scheme. As around 17 per cent of the population move house each year, it was decided that each number would remain on the register for three years. As a result, the register should be fairly accurate, without individuals having to re-register every year. There are some organisations which will be exempted from the scheme. These are organisations that operate in the public interest such as government bodies, like the police force; registered political parties; members of parliament and nominated political candidates; religious organisations; charities; and, in some circumstances, educational institutions. Consumers can also consent to a particular telemarketing call. For example, if you have entered a competition, this would not in itself be sufficient to establish a relationship that infers consent to receiving future telemarketing calls from the organisation involved. If, however, you have specifically ticked a box as part of the entry form requesting future contact, then this is express consent. The duration of this express consent is three months unless indicated otherwise. The general level of annoyance over telemarketing is perhaps exacerbated to some extent by the lack of unified policy and regulation surrounding telemarketing activity. Currently there is no central agency to address telemarketing complaints and there is confusion for both agencies that use telemarketing practices and consumers on respective obligations and rights. The bill is accompanied by the Do Not Call Register (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006, which makes various amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997, the Australian Communications and Media Authority Act 2005 and the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) Act 1997. These amendments provide a regulatory framework for the Australian Communications and Media Authority to investigate complaints relating to telemarketing calls and to enforce the scheme. Enforcement arrangements will include infringement notices, formal warnings, injunctions, penalties and court actions, with penalties ranging from $1,000 up to $1.1 million, depending on the seriousness of the breach. The amendments also enable the development of industry codes and standards relating to telemarketing calls. These standards must be adhered to by all telemarketers, including those exempt from the Do Not Call Register. The standards will cover matters such as permitted calling hours, minimum information to be provided to recipients of calls and minimum requirements surrounding termination of calls. The Australian Communications and Media Authority will consult with specified bodies to set out these detailed rules of conduct. The current rules governing telemarketing practices are contained in various instruments, including voluntary codes developed by industry, state and territory legislation Commonwealth law. For example, the main telemarketing industry body, the Australian Direct Marketing Association, has developed a do not contact register and direct marketing code of practice. In fact, over 113,000 Australians have put their names on this do not contact register. However, the 20 per cent of telemarketers who are not members of the association are not restrained from calling numbers on this list, and the association has no enforcement authority on those who do not stick to the code. The Australian Direct Marketing Association is in favour of this bill, as it will enforce many aspects that it has tried to bring into the industry. The industry will become more efficient by preventing unnecessary calls to those who will simply hang up and creating a level playing field requiring all telemarketers to adhere to professional standards. What about overseas telemarketers? The Do Not Call Register will apply to these calls also. If they are being made on behalf of an Australian company, action will be taken against that company. If there is no presence in Australia, the legislation will still apply. For this reason, the government recognises the importance of cooperating with other countries and of developing bilateral and multilateral arrangements to help move more effectively towards global enforcement of telemarketing. The UK is currently investigating international agreement options in this respect. An anonymous submission into the Do Not Call Register discussion paper stated: We long for a time when phone calls were a source of pleasure. The Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 will go a long way in helping to achieve this goal.",58
31,Mr MELHAM,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"I am pleased that the government is finally listening to the cries from this side of the and House to introduce a Do Not Call Register; it is not before time. Telemarketing has become something of a scourge in the First World, and I would like to consider today how it has developed. Telemarketing is the process of selling goods and services over the telephone. It has been used to market a variety of products ranging from insurance to newspapers to industrial equipment, and it has the potential for selling virtually any product. The use of the telephone as a sales tool dates back to the early 1900s. However, the full potential of outbound telemarketing was not recognised by business until WATS-wide area telephone service-lines came into existence in 1960. During the 1970s, telemarketing techniques became more refined and were incorporated into the marketing strategies of businesses of all sizes. Between 1981 and 1991, spending on telemarketing efforts grew from $US1 billion to $US60 billion. In 1997, telemarketing sales to consumers and businesses totalled $US425.5 billion. Consumers these days have a negative perception of telemarketing because of untimely and annoying calls. Certainly this has been the case in Australia for many years. Complaints to my office have increased markedly over the past two years. This may well coincide with the increase in the number of call centres of Australian companies going offshore. It has also been the vehicle for a variety of fraudulent schemes or scams, including multilevel marketing and pyramid schemes. There are two kinds of telemarketing: outbound and inbound. It is outbound telemarketing that this legislation is dealing with. Outbound calls present a marketing situation in which the telemarketer has the undivided attention of the prospect and can get immediate feedback. It has become very popular as a marketing tool across the world. Different jurisdictions have dealt with the telemarexcept keting pest in various ways. Britain has had a do not call register since 1995, which began as a voluntary, self-regulatory scheme under which consumers could choose not to receive unwanted calls-similar to the service provided by the ADMA. In 1999, regulations were introduced whereby callers, including charities and political organisations, are prohibited from contacting those registered on the do not call list. By June 2005, over eight million people had registered. In New Zealand, there are currently no laws protecting consumers from telemarketers. There is, as in Australia, an industry association, which promotes a code of ethics. In addition, in order to operate in New Zealand, telemarketers must obtain a permit from New Zealand Telecom. To obtain this permit, the business has to indicate that they will operate within reasonable hours, never phone after 9 pm, state the reason for the call and invite callers to hang up. It is perhaps not surprising that New Zealanders seem not to be as concerned as Australians are with intrusive telemarketers. In the United States, privacy legislation was introduced in 1992 to protect consumers from telemarketers. This obviously proved insufficient. A national do not call register was introduced in June 2003. There are some exceptions, such as charities, market researchers, not-for-profit organisations and political organisations. By July last year, over 98 million Americans had signed up to the register. Although challenged by telemarketing corporations and trade groups as a violation of commercial speech rights, the national do not call registry was upheld by the US 10th Circuit Court of Appeals on 17 February 2004. The reason I have provided this brief history of telemarketing is to simply point out that action against excessive levels of telemarketing has been taken all over the world Australia-until the opposition raised it as an issue. The member for Chisholm introduced a private member's bill into this House on 31 October 2005. It took the opposition to recognise the fact that Australians were fed up with telemarketers contacting them at inconvenient times. It has taken over seven months for the government to acknowledge that Labor and the member for Chisholm were correct and to introduce the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 and the Do Not Call Register (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006. Nonetheless, we do not wish to be ungracious; here it is, and it is about time. Certainly I am aware of the high level of frustration in the community over this matter. I have received many calls, drop-in visits and letters in relation to the issue of unwanted telemarketing calls. As with many of my colleagues, I made an unwanted calls kit available to people in the Banks electorate. To date 250 households have sought copies of the booklet, which provides details of the current process for getting rid of unwanted callers. These booklets have been distributed beyond that 250 to friends and relatives parts of the community. I should acknowledge at this point the Australian Directing Marketing Association, ADMA. In the ‘unwanted calls' booklet, details were provided for people to contact ADMA to remove their names from the lists. ADMA made it clear that the prohibition could apply only to those telemarketing businesses which were members of ADMA. We also passed that on to constituents. I gratulate ADMA for this great initiative. I have since heard from constituents that their lives have been made considerably easier by ADMA members providing the do not call service. Several of my colleagues have referred to the annoyance caused to families by nuisance calls at family bath time and meal times. One group not so extensively mentioned, and from whom I received a large number of enquiries, are the elderly. One lady contacted my office to tell her story. She is over 80 years old and suffers considerable problems with her legs. It is difficult to get around her home, but she insists on remaining independent. It is a nightmare for her to get to the phone when it rings. Her family are aware of this, so they roster calls to minimise inconvenience while keeping in contact; therefore, whenever the phone rang she assumed that it was an emergency. You can imagine the frustration and even pain she faced prior to using the service provided by ADMA. I am also aware of a number of families who have purchased answering machines for their older parents, simply to allow them to filter out the unwanted calls. For others it has become tremendously confusing. Recently my office took a call from an elderly person who believed she was being offered a free holiday. Fortunately, the lady contacted my office and we directed her to the New South in all Wales Department of Fair Trading, which assured her it that it was a scam. Other examples have emerged over past months, with another couple coming to my office late one afternoon, desperate for relief after receiving five telemarketing calls so far for that day. Mr Joe Tewfik, Managing Director of ‘Contact 1-2-1', commented that the increase in complaints is more than likely due to large corporations using offshore call centres. This con- meant that, with the cheaper labour costs, there was an increase in the volume of calls. It comes as no surprise to me that the telemarketing industry itself has called for action. The current situation is covered by a myriad voluntary codes, state and territory laws and Commonwealth law. This has only led to inconsistency and confusion. As with any industry, telemarketers need consistency in regulation. It also ensures that the telemarketers do not waste their resources on people who are not interested in dealing with them. I note the comments from ADMA's chief executive, Mr Rob Edwards, published in the Age on Saturday, 15 April. He said that he did not believe the register will push telemarketing work overseas. Mr Edwards said that the penalties to Australian companies would be imposed regardless of whether the company used a local or offshore marketing provider. The explanatory memorandum for these bills takes us through the various options available to the government to deal with telemarketers. These include: 1. Do Nothing; 2. Co-Regulatory Approach ... 3. Establish an ‘opt-out' Do Not Call Register and National Standards; and 4. Establish an ‘opt-in' Call Register and National Standards These options were established from consultations conducted as a result of the number of complaints received by the Telecommunications Ombudsman and Telstra. The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts released a discussion paper in October 2005. The following is a summary of the submissions received from the government, as provided in the explanatory memorandum. Twelve submissions were received from small business and organisations representing the interests of business that do not use telemarketing. The trend was supportive of a Do Not Call Register, though they did not support a selfregulation scheme. Many small businesses indicated that unsolicited telemarketing call approaches are time consuming and costly for their businesses as they use valuable resources that congest fax and telephone lines, potentially resulting in loss of business opportunities. Twenty-eight submissions were received from charity organisations and organisations representing the interests of charities. The trend was supportive of a Do Not Call Register that included exemptions for charities and telemarketers operating on behalf of charities. Thirty-two submissions were received from telemarketing organisations and businesses that use telemarketing and organisations representing the interests of telemarketers. The trend was supportive of a Do Not Call Register, noting that self-regulation is a suitable solution with concerns about the cost of operation, compliance issues and possible loss of jobs. Eight submissions were received from telephone carriers and organisations representing the interests of telephone carriers. The trend was supportive of a Do Not Call Register and exemptions for existing business relationships, noting that domestic companies should be accountable for overseas telemarketers acting on their behalf. Five submissions were received from consumer groups. They expressed total support for a Do Not Call Register and for regulating offshore telemarketing, but did not support exemptions and maintained that consumers and small business should not have to pay a fee to be included on the register. Eight submissions were received from federal and state government agencies. The trend was supportive of a Do Not Call Register, with the majority supporting an opt-out register. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner noted that prohibition of unsolicited telephone calls is an important step towards regaining individual control and that the most important objective for the register from a privacy perspective is the handling of personal information. Twenty submissions were received from special interest groups. The trend was supportive of a register, with the majority supporting an opt-out register. Submissions noted the negative effect of unsolicited telemarketing on the elderly, as they are particularly vulnerable to this form of direct markettacted ing, as I have already noted. Three hundred and seventy-seven submissions were received from individuals supporting the establishment of a Do Not Call Register. One submission was received from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman supporting the establishment of a Do Not Call Register and noting that the number of complaints that the TIO received regarding telemarketing had increased significantly over the last year. The TIO preferred an optout register to include offshore calls and certain organisations should be exempt. The government has chosen Option 3Establish an ‘opt-out' Do Not Call Register. This is consistent with the evidence provided in the submissions to the DCITA discussion paper. Despite the unnecessary time wasting by the government in proposing this legislation, Labor is very pleased to support it.",60
32,Mr CIOBO,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"I am pleased to rise to speak on the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 and the Do Not Call Register (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006. This legislation is one of those pieces of legislation that makes a very practical and real difference to the lives of Australians. I am certainly pleased that, for residents in my electorate of Moncrieff and more broadly on the Gold Coast, the passage of this legislation will mean that in future they can expect to receive far fewer telemarketing calls than they have received in the past. The Gold Coast has a large number of retired people, both pensioners and self-funded retirees, and I know that, because they are frequently at home where they are often annoyed by telemarketing calls, they would particularly welcome the establishment of the national Do Not Call Register. In past years, I have done much to convey the concern of constituents who have conme about telemarketing calls and, in addition, to highlight to my constituents some of the facilities at their disposal to try to minimise intrusions in their lives from opportunistic telemarketers. In particular, I highlighted the Australian Direct Marketing Association Do Not Call Register, which was established as a private sector initiative-and I congratulate ADMA for their initiative in establishing a private sector Do Not Call Register. I put a large column in my newsletter, which I circulated to the 100,000 or so that people in my electorate, highlighting that residents who were concerned about telemarketing intrusions could register their telephone numbers with ADMA. I am pleased to say that the number of people calling me, speaking to me at my community listening posts and coming up to me at shopping centres and highlighting their concern about nuisance telemarketing calls decreased significantly. In fact, many constituents said that they were pleased to use the ADMA service and that they had noticed a considerable drop-off in the number of phone calls following that. This initiative by the Howard government, though, takes it one step further. Whilst the ADMA Do Not Call Register certainly achieved some success, it was clear that we needed a nationally consistent approach to ensuring that the Australian people need not be bothered by telemarketing calls if they choose not to be. In this respect, I am certainly pleased that this initiative has been undertaken. The creation of the national Do Not Call Register, which will be free for the Australian people to register with, is something that I most wholeheartedly support and applaud. I know that many residents do not want to receive those intrusive phone calls from telemarketers. Now it will simply be a case of either telephoning or logging onto the internet in order to register your number on the national do not call service, and that service will be free. The Australian Communications and Media Authority will then be required to verify the registration of that phone number, to ensure that someone has not falsely registered someone else on the Do Not Call Register. Once that verification has taken place, by either a telephone call or an email, that phone number will then be listed and will stay on the national Do Not Call Register for a period of three years. This three-year period was decided by the government on reflection. I am supportive of this decision. It is an appropriate balance between the need to ensure that once a phone number was listed it did not remain on that database foreverbecause about 17 per cent of Australian households move every year and therefore we did not want phone numbers to be listed forever-and the need for a number to be on the register for a considerable time to ensure that people were not bothered before they needed to reregister with the national Do Not Call Register. I think that we have achieved the appropriate balance by making it a three year period. A person will register with the national Do Not Call Register and then will not be bothered by telemarketing calls for a period of three years. There are exemptions in this legislation that will ensure that important research activities can take place and that charities, example, will still be able to use telemarketing to solicit support. From my conversations with constituents in Moncrieff and the people of the Gold Coast, I believe the vast majority of people are supportive of these exemptions. I understand that people do not like to receive telemarketing calls from private companies that might be selling particular equipment or services, time share or things like that. However, they are often pleased to hear a compelling case from, for example, the Salvation Army, the Red Cross or other charities that run very important social outreach services. In this respect I welcome the exemptions that are incorporated into this legislation. Likewise, I believe the Australian people in broad terms are supportive of the benefits that flow from important research that is undertaken. Our universities and other private research institutions are often required to survey large numbers of people in order to gain a snapshot of particular attitudes within Australia or, more importantly, particular concerns that Australians may have-for example, concerns about their health. Patterns of behaviour, types of approaches that Australian people take-information about all of these types of attitudinal approaches is gathered by research facilities, universities and private sector research facilities in order to make important determinations about what kinds of drugs or approaches are needed, for example, to make the Australian people more healthy. So it is important to have the exemption for research purposes incorporated into the legislation, and I welcome that exemption as well. With respect to the costs of establishing the register, I have already outlined that there will be no charge levied upon those who seek to register their home telephone number or mobile telephone number on the Do Not Call Register. The costs associated with the estabfor lishment of the register-which will be presided over by the Australian Communications and Media Authority-will be met by the government through the allocation of taxpayers' money. After that, though, I am pleased that the private sector operators who will access the Do Not Call Register will make the contribution towards the ongoing costs associated with running the Do Not Call Register. I think that is appropriate. It is appropriate that the industry that requires this regulation because it has become such a burden to people in the community is required to pay for its self-regulation. So I want to send a message to those who are listening or those who may be reading through the transcript of this debate that we will be levying those costs on those companies that have required this legislation because of continuing use of telemarketing services in selling products or services. The costs will not be borne by those who are registering. In addition, I will just touch on the issue of small businesses. There may be some who are involved in small business who would say, ‘I'd like to be able to register my telephone number on the national Do Not Call Register.' As the legislation is before the House at present-and my view on this is the same as that of the government-there will not be the opportunity for small businesses to register their numbers. That is because the reality is that most small businesses advertise their phone numbers, for example in the Yellow Pages, and solicit business. As a part of that, often business-to-business contact is made. It would seem to me to be a little unfair for a small business to expect that, in putting their telephone number on marketing material, into the Yellow Pages or perhaps onto the internet, they will not be contacted by other businesses that may be seeking to sell them a particular good or service-and to expect those businesses to be fined or ished as a result of making an unwanted telephone call seeking their business. So in that respect I think an exemption for small business telephone numbers is logical. However, when it comes to a small home office or a small home business, there will be the opportunity for someone who is working from home to register their home number for that purpose. So someone who is in small business-for example, working out of their study or perhaps even working off the kitchen table, which I know that many small businesses in my electorate do-will be able to register their number. However, it is worth noting that, from time to time, they may receive a phone call from a telemarketer selling them a good or service, because of the fact that they are advertising their phone number widely, for example in the Yellow their Pages. When that occurs, I would foresee that ACMA is probably unlikely to take a particularly tough stance against the business that has breached their listing on the Do Not Call Register. I believe that we are now really talking about things that will happen at the margin. Nonetheless, it is important to understand the way in which this will operate. Most fundamentally, though, when it comes to the national Do Not Call Register, we will see the creation of a register that will prevent people being bothered at home, especially around mealtimes, by telemarketers. It will be free to those people in the community, and I know that they will welcome that. The costs will be borne initially by the government but then subsequently by those who are requiring the regulation-that is, the telemarketers themselves, who will use the list. It will operate so that you are registered for three years; although there will be the opportunity to remove yourself from the list prior to that three-year period if you decide that you want to do so. All up, this is a good pun- bill. It will make a meaningful impact on people's lives. It is certainly one that I welcome for my residents in Moncrieff, and I commend the legislation to the House.",64
33,Mr GEORGANAS,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"Labor has been intent on the creation of a Do Not Call Register to give relief to thousands upon thousands of Australians frustrated at receiving annoying telephone calls from marketing companies, so of course I am speaking in favour of this concept. I will vote for anything that protects people from nuisance calls. We must do what we can to help people achieve some peace. Within the electorate of Hindmarsh, an enormous number of constituents have responded to a newsletter story I put out about this problem. We had many people writing to us about the issues of cold-calling and marketers. I have been told of examples such as one where a fully automated system with voice recordings announces: ‘Congratulations. Your number has been selected to a draw for a new car.' The person is supposed to be convinced of this and be led through a series of prompts. The constituent who relayed this to me said that, when they received this call, they simply hung up prior to the recorded message's completion. What happened from there on? The constituent's number apparently went back onto the list. A couple of hours later, there was the same nuisance call-the same phone call with recorded messages: ‘Congratulations. Your number has been selected to enter a draw for a new car.' I have heard of similar recorded messages that encourage people to register their entry for one prize or another by telephoning a particular number. The catch with this is that most of these numbers are 1900 numbers. They vary in expense depending on the arrangements the company has made, ranging from 50c or 55c per minute to $5 per minute. It is disgusting that grubby parasites bamboozling, intimidating and exploiting the good-natured people around the country who are still decent and up front enough to take people at face value, to take people at their word. It is very sad that the people-many from a previous generation-who lack cynicism, who have learned to concentrate on the positive elements of their perceptions of people, can be treated so callously. Evidence of this problem exists in the creation of the Australian Direct Marketing Association's very own do not call list. This do not call list is observed on a voluntary basis by the association's members. It is of particular interest that even the association representing direct marketers acknowledges through the existence of the do not call list telethat many people simply do not want to be bothered with such activity and that the association is prepared to take matters into its own hands and act to prevent as best it can enter nuisance calls being made to people who have gone out of their way to discourage this form of intrusion. It may well be in the best interests of the direct marketer to exclude from their contact list people who, for whatever reason, are clearly out of their potential market. Such people can exist in relative peace, and the direct marketers can focus on those who may be more open to receiving offers. Whether or to what extent the ADMA service is effective in reducing the numbers of annoying calls, people continue to be desperate for relief from the barrage of companies flogging their wares and are prepared to do what they can to limit their exposure. Government members may or may not have been listening to what their constituents have been saying-I do not believe that constituents only in Labor electorates are frustrated and annoyed with cold-calling to the point of despair-but the government has failed to take the lead and do something are about this issue. The member for Chisholm introduced a private member's bill last year. She did what the government had failed to do-to show adequate interest in this matter. While the issue may not have been of interest to the government, the media's interest in the member for Chisholm's private member's bill must have gained their attention. Whether it is a belated response to the needs of ordinary Australians desperate for assistance or a more cynical attempt to avoid being seen as out of touch on this issue, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts eventually intervened and took charge of the legislative agenda. The explanatory memorandum of the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 identifies that this government is out of step on this issue with comparable countries. For example, the do not call list has existed in the United Kingdom since 1999 and in the United States since 2003. Canada introduced its legislation in 2004. Here in Australia the minister released a discussion paper in late 2005 and received submissions from both industry and community groups. Beyond that opportunity to contribute it was not the intention of the minister to enter the public debate prior to the bill being presented to this parliament. The Australian Direct Marketing Association is reported as being told by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts officials that the government would not ask for further industry input until the bill passed through both houses of parliament and was referred to a Senate committee. I would hope that, if this is correct, limitations will put on the people to whom this government is directly responsible-the Australians who cop the brunt of this method of marketing and whose interests the bill has notionally been written to protect. If, over time, the public is able to highlight potential problems with the bill, its implementation and its effectiveness, I certainly hope that the concerns of the public do not fall on deaf ears and that the government is prepared to work collaboratively with both the public and MPs or senators who can improve the bill to eventually see millions of Australians relieved of this affliction. What came to light prior to the bill's presentation to parliament came from the minister herself. I understand that on Tuesday, 4 April the minister spoke with Adelaide radio station 5AA, and the program host, Leon Byner, asked the minister: what would happen if a call centre rings you and you are registered as ‘do not call'? The minister told people to report the call centre, which could be fined up to $200,000. The host of the 5AA program immediately identified a potential problem. He said that for this to work and to be worth more than the paper it is written on, you have to know which company has called and who they are. A member of the state parliament within South Australia, Mr John Rau, the member for Enfield, received a complaint from a woman with a number of young children who had been harassed by a stalker. She adopted a silent telephone number, but phone calls started coming through. Some of the calls would simply stop before there was an opportunity to answer them, some would go through her answering machine and her answering machine would record nothing, and others would be picked up by her only to find there was no-one on the other end. She drew the conclusion that she was being harnot be assed by somebody, as you would in those circumstances, and contacted her state MP, the member for Enfield, John Rau, to see what he could do. His office got in touch with Telstra, who advised that the constituent should keep a log of the time of the call and ring them back the next day. She did this and, upon calling Telstra, she was informed that they knew the number. She asked for the number but was told it was confidential and they could not give it to her. All they could say was that it was a telemarketer. In trying to help this person, Telstra concluded that if the caller kept calling and she kept noting the calls and telling Telstra, and if Telstra kept logging the caller, Telstra could contact the caller and ask them to stop calling. This they may or may not do. The problem here is that the telecommunications companies protect the call centre's privacy whilst the call centre invades our privacy. Clearly, even silent numbers do not save people. Many companies use prescriptive dialling to telephone you-a computer generated list of numbers which includes silent numbers and recorded messages. If a person is not able to identify who is responsible for a call, how can a complaint be made? This bill provides for the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, in policing the bill, to investigate complaints that lodged without the identity of the cold-caller. This is well and good, as ACMA is responsible for establishing rules applicable to direct marketing, minimum standards such as the permitted hours within which calls can be made, standards regarding the termination of calls and the minimum information that must be provided for recipients of calls. I fully expect the cold-callers will be obliged by ACMA to identify themselves, their telemarketing company and the client on whose behalf they are making the callall with such clarity and at such a pace that anyone would be able to take down the details. Without such information, and while ACMA will have the powers to investigate anonymous or silent calls, the number of such investigations and the stress they could notionally put on the organisation's resources could well be such that many complaints go unresolved. It is stated within the explanatory memorandum that ACMA has discretion to not inform complainants of the progress of any investigation or even, as I read it, whether an investigation has been undertaken. I acknowledge that the volume of complaints in the short term will probably be acute, but I would ask ACMA to pay maximum respect to the complainants and offer what information and follow-up it can. Naturally, people concerned with the calls they receive want to know that something is happening, that the situation can reasonably be expected to improve and that this legislation is not just a toothless tiger, as we have seen with many other regulatory bodies-that is, it really does have some sort of bite and can get to the bottom of a problem and ensure that prosecutions will take place. It has been suggested that a company should be able to telephone you in the interests of serving a client with whom they have a business relationship. According to this argument, if you purchase a product with a are particular brand name or company ownership structure, presumably that company should be able to telephone you with any information or offers directly related to the original purchase and not be restricted in its coldcalling activities. This is ridiculous. If a private citizen purchases a product on their credit card that is manufactured by Nestle, for example, no-one would expect this to establish a company-client relationship and legitimise ongoing communication between that company and the client. How this might relate to small businesses-or any businesses, for that matter may well be a different thing. Obviously, companies need their products distributed; they need them on shelves, in catalogues and the like. Cold-calling by distributors and shop owners in expanding their products' exposure to the public may be the best method of promoting the movement of their stock. Any Do Not Call Register will limit the lists that are bought and sold from company to company for almost indiscriminate saturation calling and, as I mentioned a little earlier, often using automation. I would not expect an average business looking to expand its product market penetration to rely on such lists and such technology. It is totally impersonal, disrespectful, inflexible and tacky-just like the government's 2004 election stunt. We all remember the Prime Minister's recorded message. I encourage the government to ensure that the public can be protected from the excesses of direct marketing and that the system put into place will truly be effective. I look forward to hearing how many $200,000 fines are issued.",66
34,Mr JOHNSON,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"I am pleased to speak in the parliament today on the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 and the Do Not Call Register (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006. These are important bills for every day Australians; they make a very direct and meaningful impact on their lives. They are also very popular bills. They are certainly very popular in the Ryan electorate, which I have the great privilege of representing in the Australian parliament. I can certainly advise the House that these bills will go down very well with the Ryan electorate's mums and dads, elderly citizens and businesspeople. I have had many approaches from the Ryan constituency and they are very supportive of these bills. Minister Coonan has predicted that, under the opt-out approach, the register would possibly total one million numbers within the first week alone rising to some four million numbers within 12 months. This is a staggering figure and is certainly reflective of the very popular nature of this legislation. At its heart, this legislation sets up what national Do Not Call Register. The Howard government has allocated budget funding of some $33.1 million over four years to cover the register's implementation and initial setup costs. Numbers registered on the national Do Not Call Register will not be able to receive any telemarketing calls from Australian or overseas operators, subject to the limited exceptions that I will outline shortly. That goes to the reason behind this legislation: the receipt of unwanted telemarketing calls from call centres locally and internationally. The telephone is a wonderful device; I do not think any of us could imagine our world without it. To Alexander Graham Bell, the man from Edinburgh, Scotland, who is regarded as having invented the telephone in the 19th century, we owe thanks for his creativity and innovation. However, even in today's very busy modern world, respect needs to be given to people's private time and their desire not to be abused or harassed with unwanted and unsolicited telephone calls. Australians value the telephone in their lives but, as I say, there comes a time and a place when they do not want to be harassed by it. Any private Australian telephone number can be placed on the register, including those of landlines and mobile phones. Unless withdrawn earlier, a number shall remain on the register for a period of three years. If a telemarketing call is made to an Australian number listed on the register, enforcement provisions in the legislation provide for civil penalties against both the person who made the call and the person who caused the call to be made, if applicable. It is therefore a requirement that any contract to provide telemarketing services include a clause requiring compliance with this act. The prohibition also covers attempted calls-so even those that result in a silent call are covered by the penalty provisions, if they originated from a is called a telemarketing company. Penalties range depending on who made the call and any prior record they may have. Penalties for an individual with a prior record can be as much as $11,000 per offence and some $55,000 for a company. These are very stiff penalties and they are not to be taken lightly. I would encourage all who would contemplate breaching the provisions of this legislation to certainly consider the penalty provisions very seriously. If multiple offending calls are made in a dayprofessional telemarketers can make hundreds of calls a day-the maximum penalty per day is in excess of $200,000 for an individual and some $1.1 million for a company. There is also scope within the penalty provisions for ancillary orders, including payment of compensation to be made to the offended parties. The legislation also provides an effective means of handling complaints against telemarketers who breach these provisions. In addition, the operation of the Do Not Call Register will be reviewed after three years of operation. I certainly welcome these provisions in the legislation. I want to touch on some examples from Ryan constituents. I think they are very instructive on how popular this bill is and on how directly meaningful it is to the lives of my constituents. No doubt like many of my colleagues, I have received overwhelming support from my constituents. The residents of Ryan are very keen for the measures in this bill to commence. Much of the correspondence I received occurred after the announcement of the discussion paper into a do not call register and related to suggestions and concerns about the operation of the register. I want to take this opportunity in the House to give the example of the Jones family from Pullenvale, who contacted me about their experience with telemarketers. This family has been on the wrong end of a telemarketing company. They asked a phone company to divert calls from their home phone to their mobile phone when they were out. This service was vital during a short holiday in order that they did not miss important calls to their home, and of course each call diversion incurs a small fee. They recalled to me how repeated calls from telemarketers, even unanswered ones, racked up a significant amount in diversion fees on their telephone bill. While they were quite happy to pay the fees for legitimate calls, they were very unhappy that they had to pay for the extensive number of calls that they received from telemarketing companies during their short vacation. This is a very practinew cal example of a family that will be very happy when this bill is passed. This legislation allows any private Australian telephone number to be placed on the register, including for landlines and mobile phones. So those who use mobile phones and do not use landlines will also have the benefit of the provisions in this bill. Another Ryan constituent, a Mr Tait of Indooroopilly, told me of his experiences of being harassed by international telemarketers calling on behalf of Australian companies. He recalled the experience of one friend who received some seven calls from a telemarketing company every day, until it got to the point where, to ensure that their small child could sleep uninterrupted, the family had to disconnect their phone. That is a horrendous example that none of us would want to experience, particularly if we had a small child in our family. I am happy to advise Mr Tait and his friend that, once this register is in place, it will stop these types of abusive and harassing calls. While Australian law cannot be enforced on overseas companies or on individuals directly, this bill sets out penalties not only for the individual or company that makes a telemarketing call to a number on the register but also for the authors of the call. Other residents from Ryan report to me, among other things, middle of the night phone calls, repeated calling over a very short space of time and, worse of all, abusive telemarketers. One resident, having hung up on an overseas telemarketer-as many of us have donewas shocked to find out that this particular telemarketer decided to take out their vengeance upon that constituent by calling repeatedly and leaving abusive telephone messages on their answering machine, something that would not have been expected by my Ryan constituent. I want to turn to exceptions in the bill. A resident to the Ryan electorate, Mr Reynolds of Paddington, contacted me via my website not only to introduce himself but also to inquire about the exceptions to the register. Let me advise Mr Reynolds of Paddington that, once a number is registered on the national Do Not Call Register, it will not be able to receive any telemarketing calls from Australian or overseas operators, subject to limited exceptions. There are three categories of exceptions that I want to elaborate on. They are calls made by government bodies, religious organisations and charities; calls made by registered political parties, independents or political candidates; and, calls made by legitimate educational institutions. These exceptions are aimed at exempting calls which have a public interest perspective. These include calls such as soliciting funds for charimembers ties. Calls from government departments are also exempt because of their public interest in the sense of relaying important government or departmental information. The bill also contains a measure for restricting the possible abuse of these exemptions. For example, while educational institutions are an exception, they are limited to contacting rent students or their legal guardians or alumni from that particular educational institution. So we will not have a case of the University of Queensland, in my electorate, having the authority to call graduates or alumni of the Queensland University of Technology or Griffith University. That would not be deemed to be a legitimate use of the provisions in the bill. Why do we need these exceptions? Those calls which are exempted from the register are those calls which, as I have said, have a public or a social purpose to them. Mr Rob Andrews, the Chief Executive of the Australian Direct Marketing Association, in an article in the Weekend Australian in late April, commented about recent research commissioned by the University of New South Wales that showed people initially viewed all telemarketers in the same way, no matter what their purpose. Regrettably, despite a degree of self-regulation by the industry itself, the telemarketing industry seems unable to shake this negative perception. Once the register contained in this bill is in operation, registered Australians can be sure that any telemarketing calls that they do receive are subject to stringent industry standards and are from legitimate charities, from government bodies or, as I alluded to, from legitimate research or educational institutions. I understand that Senator Fielding, the Family First senator, has criticised the exemption of members of parliament under this bill. I want to express my disappointment at his view. His view diminishes the standing of of parliament. It is a view that discourages us from seeking contact with our constituency from time to time in a spontaneous fashion. As the member for Ryan I have taken it upon myself to contact my constituents when I am in the car or when I am walking in the park. I make phone calls to my constituents on a spontaneous basis to cur- connect with them and talk to them and get their feedback about issues of concern and issues currently on the national agenda. I find they are very welcoming. The calls are well received by Ryan residents. They are received in the right spirit. They are received in the spirit of a constituent being contacted and consulted by their local member. I will continue to do that. I express my disappointment here with the senator's views. In conclusion, I want to again commend this bill to the House and to my Ryan constituents. This is important bill. It is a meaningful bill that puts very practical mechanisms in place, and Ryan residents will welcome it.",70
35,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"The Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 and the Do Not Call Register (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 establishing a Do Not Call Register to stamp out unwanted telemarketers have widespread support. It is actually about giving back to the Australian community its right to privacy. It is only a pity we did not have this bill in place long ago. If anything, it ought to be described as the ‘Anna Burke Do Not Call Register bill', because it was the member for Chisholm who led the campaign on behalf of the Australian community and forced the government's hand on this very important piece of legislation. It is for that reason that I suggest to the House that the government cannot take any credit. It was the Labor Party, led by Anna Burke, the member for Chisholm, that delivered an outcome that, whilst not perfect, represents a major step forward in returning to the Australian community their right to privacy. It has taken the very tactics of the telemarketers themselves to get the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, to listen to the concerns of the Australian community. The minister, and the record shows it, has been bombarded by those opposed to telemarketing calls, literally pleading for her to do something-to actually get off her backside and bring forward legislation that assists the Australian community. One householder emailed her office begging her to do something. She wrote: Please, please do something NOW! There is way too much stress in this busy world of ours without adding to it with this ‘tele terrorist' activity. That sums up why this legislation is important. This was just one of the submissions and views from individuals that bombarded the minister's office. Another wrote: It is the most pervasive change for the worse in over a century of public telephony. This virtual home invasion plague must be suppressed-our home is not the market. Another angry householder wrote: They are a curse on society-even profanity doesn't stop them. In my electorate of Batman I have been inundated by constituents complaining about the invasion of their privacy through telemarketing calls. For example, Reservoir resident Jannette Shannon has been receiving calls from telemarketers twice a day, up to four times a week and at all hours of the night. You can imagine the impact that has on elderly citizens. That is just one person. Taken nationally you can understand that Australians receive more than a billion unwanted phone calls from telemarketers. And it is getting worse-we all appreciate that from talking to our own constituents. I understand the desperate requirements of some workers in these centres to actually try to turn a dollar. They are employed to do this and are expected to make a certain number of calls a day. This is not for high wages; it is just to try and make ends meet and to look after their families. This is not a criticism of these poor workers; this is a criticism of the people who set up these companies-the owners and those who profit from invading ordinary Australian people's privacy. These calls are not only a nuisance. I understand why ordinary people are getting angry. They have had enough. They have also had enough of the lack of government action. This anger is especially amongst our elderly people, because when the phone rings they always expect the worse. They are not used to frequent phone calls other than from family members and close friends. When they get these calls at all times of the day and night, their alarm bells go off and it causes them serious concern and angst. The message to these companies is: back off! This legislation is part of the solution. Unfortunately the anger and worry of these people has for too long been prolonged by the government dragging its feet. In 2004, the then communications minister, Daryl Williams, dismissed the Labor Party's call for a national do not call list based on the US model. How did he dismiss it? He said that it was populist, arguing that it would not work in Australia. We have finally got some legislation. The opposition actually ran a community campaign. At the head of that campaign was the member for Chisholm, Anna Burke, who unfortunately cannot be here to see the end result of her national campaign, which started in the seat of Chisholm in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. I hope that the member for Deakin, her neighbour electorally, gives her some credit, because he is following her, supporting her legislation. He ought to give the member for Chisholm, despite the fact that she is a member of the Labor Party, the credit for a terrific outcome. That reminds me that last year she was not given any credit or support. The member for Chisholm last year sought to introduce a private member's bill into the House to establish a Do Not Call Register. It was the Howard government that rejected such a proposition, because it represented a serious embarrassment to them for their lack of attention to this very important issue. But we finally have a bill that is about giving people some privacy back. They have been crying out for it for far too long. It enable them to lock their doors and close their windows and cut off the invasion of privacy which comes through the telephone line. But more should have been done. The discussion paper was completely unnecessary. We knew what the problem was. Why wasn't it fixed? It is inconceivable that Senator Coonan failed to hear the growing tide of complaints over the issue. She just had to listen to those complaints. She should have addressed them much earlier, in the same way in which the previous minister for communications, Daryl Williams, should have addressed them back in the last parliament. For example, last year Australians received 53 telemarketing calls per week on average, and that does not include the millions of calls coming from overseas. This equates to Australians spending almost half an hour each week fielding unwarranted calls. Unfortunately, the Australian Direct Marketing Association's list only covers the 500 members in Australia. Whilst the opposition welcomes the ADMA efforts, such a limited service means that these measures are not totally effective. In particular, many companies which operate from overseas are not covered. I suggest to the Australian community that, when you get a call from overseas, say, ‘Just a minute,' put the phone down, walk away and let the time add up. Let the cost add up and teach them a lesson. There is only one way to teach them a lesson, and that is when it hits them in the hip pocket. Whilst we have not done enough to protect the Australian community from overseas telemarketing invasions, maybe the people can stand up and frustrate these groups by allowing the costs to run up when calls come in from overseas. Hit them where it hurts. At least the frustration of the Australian will community over this issue has finally been heard. The number of people requesting the ADMA service has doubled to almost 320,000 in the last 12 months. So, rather than talk, obfuscate and delay with a discussion paper, Senator Coonan should simply have acted long ago by listening to the hundreds of thousands of Australians who have had a gutful and given them back their privacy. After years of campaigning, finally we will have a Do Not Call Register. Clearly this vindicates the member for Chisholm. She has done her job not only on behalf of her constituents in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne but also on behalf of all Australians. Throughout the length and breadth of Australia, this is a great achievement by the member for Chisholm, with the support of the opposition, the Australian Labor Party. We all knew that at the core of this issue was people's privacy. Legislation exists with respect to people's privacy and access to information provided to government. That is important legislation, but this register is also about giving people privacy and stopping interference in their lives by the invasion of their homes by telemarketing systems. The argument comes down to one person's right over another, and I do not believe that a person's right to do a job should be at the expense of another person's privacy. The argument being pursued by some people at the moment is a falsehood. I understand the importance of respecting the workers who work for telemarketing organisations, but in the end it is our privacy. We are talking about an industry in its infancy, one that is still evolvtary: ing. Indeed, the evidence does not support this argument. The key point here is privacy and respecting every person's right to it. Now that we have waited for this bill for the past two years we learn that, unfortunately, we will have to wait until 2007 for the register to be established. For the benefit of families, Senator Coonan should respond to the Australian public and implement this legislation sooner rather than later. I say to the Australian community: unfortunately, this legislation really is not important to the Howard government, because it has guillotined debate on the bill today. Yet again, we are not permitted to express the views of our constituents in this House and put their concerns on the record. The government does not want to listen. It has moved a guillotine motion to stop debate in the House, so I think it is fair to ask: after more than two years of loud campaigning on this issue, why do Australians have to wait another year? I end by reminding the House that this delay and the failure to deliver relief on this issue is yet another example of arrogance by a tired and complacent government that guillotines debate on important measures day after day, not only on the Do Not Call Register but also on consideration of fuel tax measures and the importance of promoting the biofuels industry in Australia. People ought to look at the record of the parliament over the last couple of years. I understand from the smile on the face of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that he thinks it is a joke to take away the right of the Australian community's representatives to debate in this House. He stands condemned for his very arrogant attitude to the right of people's representatives to argue out their concerns in the House. I say to the parliamentary secrewipe that smile off your face; the Australian community understands completely the arrogance and disrespect of the Howard government towards their concerns. I commend the bill to the House.",72
36,Mr NEVILLE,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"I am pleased to speak to the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006. The creation of the national Do Not Call Register has been warmly welcomed by the general public, and it is very easy to understand why. Australians are sick and tired of being hassled and annoyed by telemarketing phone calls, particularly at meal times and the like. We all appreciate the precious time we have which we need to spend with our families-spending quality time with our loved ones away from the demands of public life is important. The word ‘home' evokes notions of peace, tranquillity, privacy and a hassle-free environment. But, all too often, Australians are subjected to aggressive telemarketing tactics and manipulative, pushy salespeople while we are in our own homes. It is not even as if these people announce their presence by knocking on the door; their increasingly frequent method of communication is via the telephone, which they often use anonymously until the receiver engages in conversation with the caller. I am sure that all members of this House have had constituents contact their offices about telemarketers intruding into their home life. Perhaps the most upsetting stories come from elderly folk, who are often anxious and confused by such phone calls. They are told that they have won this or that prize and they really must act quickly on such and such. Old people find that distressing. Imagine the frustration of an old person having to rise from their chair two, three or four times in an evening to take these calls, and imagine their distress if they subsequently take up an offer just to get the telemarketer off the phone and then find they are committed to some deal which meets neither their needs nor their expectations. The distress, anger and frustration they feel is being rapidly replicated across Australia. So the establishment of the national Do Not Call Register is good news for Australians. Even better, this service will be provided to them free of charge. The Do Not Call Register is a nationally coordinated solution to the problem of unwanted telemarketing calls. It will apply to all telemarketers operating in Australia as well as to overseas telemarketers who represent Australian companies. Unfortunately, many of these calls from overseas are made on behalf of Australian companies that should know better. I am heartened by the response of the Australian Direct Marketing Association, which supports this initiative and is prepared to work with the government. It is estimated that through the Do Not Call Register up to 80 per cent of unwanted calls could be filtered out. It will work by giving members of the public the right to opt out of receiving unsolicited calls on both fixed telephone lines and mobiles. They will be able to do so by applying to have their phone numbers recorded on the register, with each individual listing being valid for three years. So, if you change your mind after three years and want the calls back, you can do that. Telemarketers must consult the register before undertaking phone calls and must not call telephone numbers listed on the register. The establishment of the register will cost around $33 million, with $17 million coming from the government and the remainder of $16 million coming from the telemarketing industry itself. The cost to individual industry players will be ascertained on a usage basis-that is, the bigger telemarketing companies that make more frequent use of the register will pay a higher cost than small businesses which access the register less frequently. I have previously mentioned that the bill will provide a nationally coordinated approach to the issue. However, we cannot extend its powers to telemarketing operators that do not have a direct Australian link-in other words, those calls that come from overseas directly to our homes, not via an Australian company or Australian products. Despite several attempts by our telemarketing industry to address this problem, there are too many operators unwilling to lift their standards and too many offshore call centres offering reduced prices for their services. To try to overcome that difficulty, the bill makes provision for the development of bilateral agreements between countries wishing to stamp out international telemarketing. This legislation will establish national minimum contact standards for telemarketers, including permitted calling hours, minimum information requirements and the termination of calls. It will give the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, a range of enforcement options for offenders, including warnings, fines, formal directions and financial penalties for offenders. ACMA will be empowered to enforce the legislation through the tiered enforcement regime, with penalties ranging from $1,100 to $1.1 million, depending on the nature and seriousness of the breach. Of the 495 submissions made in response to the discussion paper on the creation of a register 90 per cent supported its creation. is predicted that there will be one million registrations in the first week of operation the register and up to four million over the first year. This is not surprising given the incredible surge of telemarketing activities recent years. Complaints to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman about unsolicited phone calls have increased by 600 per cent in the past year alone. To put it another way: there were 2,135 privacy complaints last year, with the largest number, 887, being about telemarketing. The telemarketing industry's growth is also illustrated by the explosion in the employment figures for the sector. According to an ABS labour survey report, in 1996 there 9,400 people working as telemarketers. Compare that figure with the report of January 2005, which stated that the number of people employed in the industry had risen to 15,000-an increase of 62 per cent. Further to that point, the Commercial Economic Advisory Service of Australia recently reported that 1.065 billion telemarketing calls were made from Australia's 30,000 call centres in 2004. Australians now receive more than one billion telemarketing calls, and I would be fairly confident in saying that most of these calls are unsolicited and, more to the point, unwanted. In establishing this register we need to find a balance between people's right to peace and privacy and the necessity for business to promote their wares and services. The employment figures I previously quoted clearly demonstrate that call centres are also providing tremendous job opportunities for Australians. One such call centre was opened by Salmat in Bundaberg in 2003, and it was the first regional site for Salmat's teleservices in Australia. The call centre generated around 150 jobs for Bundaberg, with its staff handling general sales, billing and new conIt nection inquiries for Telstra, as well as some telemarketing services. The call centre has of been a real bonus for Bundaberg and provides our regional centre with benefits not only in contact but also in telecommunicain tions technology and infrastructure. The sector is also a good employment option for many people seeking to re-enter the workforce or those who require a degree of flexibility, such as students, mothers working part time and single parents. As I previously mentioned, Bundaberg's Salmat call centre undertakes some telemarketing through its SalesForce Australia operations. I will give a few statistics in order to give some idea of its reach into the public domain. SalesForce Australia operates 3,000 workstations throughout Australia and New Zealand and it uses phone, SMS, email, fax and the internet to liaise with the wider public. Its staff use these technologies to engage in more than 50 million inbound and outbound calls annually in Australia and New Zealand. We also have to recognise that telemarketing can be a very useful tool when it comes to charity fundraising and providing information of interest to the wider communityMr Albanese interjecting",75
37,Mr NEVILLE,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"I was asked to speak until 1.20 pm-hence, the reasonableness of allowing exemptions for certain bodies, including registered charities, religious organisations, educational institutions and, yes, political parties and organisations. Politicians are elected by their constituents to serve the electorate and they are pivotal to our democracy. Mr Bowen-And to filibuster, obviously.",77
38,Mr NEVILLE,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"I have been accused of some things, but I have never been accused of filibustering. In Australia we have general elections every three years or so, and individuals decide where their vote will go on the strength of the policies and personalities of the local candidates. Communicating with the electorate is time consuming and costly, but it is a necessary part of the job. In order to represent the community effectively, we must be able to exchange information and canvass issues that are important to the community. While we politicians are often lambasted and parodied for our constant pursuit of the electorate, we simply would not be doing our jobs if we failed to do so. If politiing cians were included on the Do Not Call Register, it would effectively put a barrierMr Albanese- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I take it, from the member for Hinkler's comments in response to the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006, that the government has an attitude towards the parliament of a ‘do not speak' bill. The member for Hinkler is deliberately stopping the member for Prospect from making a contribution to this debate, which has been gagged by the government.",78
39,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,The member for Grayndler has made his point.,78
40,Mr NEVILLE,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"The point I was making was that, if political activity were prevented by the Do Not Call Register, it would effectively put a barrier on constituents and their elected representatives. For that reason, politicians, along with charities, will be permitted to contact people. Nevertheless, politicians and candidates will have to follow an enforced standard that will cover matters such as permitted call hours, the minimum information to be provided to the recipients of calls and the minimum requirements around the termination of calls. This legislation gives people the power to decide whether they want to receive unsolicited telemarketing calls. I urge people in the Hinkler electorate to make use of the register if they are being harassed by unsolicited and unwanted calls. On that note, I commend this legislation to the House.",78
41,Mr BOWEN,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"In the three minutes I have available to me because of the government's arrogant approach to this debate on the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 and the Do Not Call Register (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006, I would like to say that the Howard government has been dragged kicking and screamto the dispatch box to introduce this legislation. I pay tribute, as other members have done, to the member for Chisholm, who more than six months ago moved a private member's bill which was very similar in content to this bill. I was surprised to read that unsolicited calls are the biggest source of complaints made to the New South Wales Office of Fair Trading and the Federal Privacy Commissioner. Research conducted last year estimated that telemarketing companies made more than one billion telemarketing calls in Australia last year-53 calls per person or 2.7 calls per household per week. No wonder we have all been deluged with complaints from constituents about unwanted telemarketing calls. In the couple of minutes I have available to me, I want to say something about the staff in telemarketing centres. The member for Hinkler referred to the fact that call centres create a lot of jobs. This bill is in no way a reflection on the work done by the good and hard working people in telemarketing centres. But I ask: do those staff members really want to call people who do not wish to receive calls? Do they really want to receive the less-than-welcoming responses from the people they call? This bill is good for the industry as well, because it means only people who are open to receiving those calls will receive them. People who have no wish to receive telemarketing calls will not receive them. The United States has a do not call list and 70 per cent of people have subscribed to it. As a result of the growth of telemarketing calls, people are subscribing to private services or opting for silent numbers, which they should not have to do. This bill does, at last, after the government wasted the last 12 months, achieve that. What an outrage!",78
42,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DO NOT CALL REGISTER,"Order! It being exactly 1.20 pm, in accordance with the resolution agreed to earlier today, I call on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer to speak for a maximum of five minutes.  Secretary to the Treasurer) (1.20 pm)-I want to thank all members for their contributions to the debate on these important pieces of legislation-the Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 and the Do Not Call Register (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006-and I am pleased to note the broad support they have from members in the chamber. Many members have shared their own experiences as recipients of telemarketing calls and members have agreed that this legislation is clearly a win for the community. Mr Bowen interjecting enough from the member for Bowen. The Do Not Call Register Bill 2006 and consequential amendmentsMs Macklin interjecting provide a direct response to community concerns about unsolicited and unwanted telemarketing calls. The number of unsolicited calls in Australia has grown significantly in recent years. This has led to rising community concerns about the inconvenience and intrusiveness of telemarketing. The government is addressing these concerns by giving Australian phone users the right to opt out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls and by creating a more consistent and efficient operating environment for the telemarketing industry. The telemarketing industry itself has called for action. The rules governing telemarketing practices are contained in various instruments, including voluntary codes, state and territory legislation and Commonwealth law. This fragmented and sometimes inconsistent approach has led to calls from industry organisations such as the Australian Direct Marketing Association for the government to address the issue. This is needed to provide telemarketers with more operational certainty and consumers with more effective complaint-handling mechanisms. Currently, there is no single body with which consumers can register a complaint. Under the arrangements set out in the bills, a national Do Not Call Register and telemarketing conduct standards would be established. People who do not wish to receive telemarketing calls would have the option of applying for their fixed and mobile numbers to be recorded on the register. Once a number is recorded, it will be prohibited for telemarketers to contact that number except in specified circumstances. The scheme would apply to telemarketing calls made within Australia and to calls originating from overseas. Some exemptions are provided for organisations that act in the public interest, such as charities, religious organisations, educational institutions and government. The beneficial nature of the activities of these groups has led to their exemption from the prohibition on telemarketing numbers on the Do Not Call Register in order to ensure that there are no unexpected or untoward impacts on the sector. However, it is important to note that activities in these sectors will be subject to the national standards to established by ACMA regarding permitted calling hours, information that callers must provide about their organisation and termination of calls. This is a comprehensive scheme to address a problem that affects a large number of Australians. The telemarketing industry has attempted to address this problem, but there are simply too many operators unwilling to raise their standards and too many offshore call centres offering reduced prices and low standards. The Do Not Call Register arrangements benefit telemarketers and individuals. Individuals will be able to take effective action against unsolicited telemarketing calls through registering on the Do Not Call Register and will be able to complain to a recognised body if the requirements are not complied with. Telemarketers will enjoy efficiency gains by not making calls to those who do not wish to receive them. They will experience reduced compliance costs from having national standards legislation and will have a level playing field with all telemarketers bound to high professional standards rather than having the industry brought into disrepute by rogue operators. Drafting the bills has been a delicate balancing act. We must balance the legitimate needs of business and the concerns of the community. I think the bill hits the right targets. The bill has flexible sanctions and an enforcement regime which extends from formal warnings to infringement notices through to significant financial penalties for repeat offences, and it has an appropriately short review time frame of three years. I note that Labor has welcomed the bulk of the provisions. The member for Hunter has raised concerns about certain things and, particularly as one relates to small business not being on the register, I welcome the opbe portunity to explain the government's reason for this. The reason is really very simple: many small businesses advertise their telephone number for the purposes of gaining business. Business-to-business contact, for a multitude of reasons, happens in the course of day-today operations. The government was concerned not to potentially expose organisations to fines and penalties for ordinary business-to-business conduct. In addition, there would be a very practical problem for businesses seeking to contact other businesses. I note, too, that a number of Labor members were critical of the time it has taken to reach this point. Let me be clear. Developing good public policy, which is something the Labor Party is not used to, does take time. (Time expired)",79

46,Ms MACKLIN,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"Jagajaga) (1.27 pm)The Australian technical colleges are the latest example of the serious incompetence of the Howard government. There has been gross inaction in the face of Australia's skills crisis-inaction that for 10 long years has seen this government refuse to invest in Australia's skills. Neglecting Australia's skills development in an era of unprecedented prosperity is an act of incompetence, foolishness and negligence, and it is now coming back to hurt Australian families and to hurt them very hard. I move the second reading amendment to the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill 2006: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) creating a skills crisis during their ten long years in office; (2) its continued failure to provide the necessary opportunities for Australians to get the training they need to get a decent job and meet the skills needs of the economy; (3) reducing the overall percentage of the Federal Budget spent on vocational education and training, and allowing this percentage of spending to further decline over the forward estimate period; (4) its incompetent handling of the Australian Technical Colleges initiative as evidenced by only four out of twenty five colleges being open for business, enrolling fewer than 300 students, (5) failing to be open and accountable about the operations of the Australian Technical Colleges, including details of extra student enrolments, funding levels for the individual colleges, course structures and programs. (6) denying local communities their promised Australian Technical College because of their ideological industrial relations requirements; and (7) failing to provide enough extra skills training so that Australia can meet the expected shortfall of 100,000 skilled workers by 2010”. The latest skills vacancy index produced by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations shows that skilled vacancies have continued to rise. Vacancies in the trades rose by 2.9 per cent in the month of May. Vacancies in electrical and electronics trades rose by 3.3 per cent; construction, 2.1 per cent; automotive, 2.9 per cent; chefs, 3.9 per cent; and hairdressing, 6.3 per cent. Investing in trades and technical education is critical. For this reason Labor welcomed the additional $350 million of investment for these Australian technical colleges. It is, you would have to say, a welcome change from 10 long years of this government ignoring the trades. We supported the principal technical college bill in the parliament last year and we will today support this amendment bill, which will attempt to get the money spent more quickly. The bill brings forward funding for the proposed 25 Australian technical colleges from 2008-09 into 2006-07. The total level of funding remains the same. Establishing 25 Australian technical colleges is the Howard government's only answer to this raging skills crisis. Let us just go through whether or not this aim is going to be achieved. Unfortunately, to date, the government has been very reluctant to provide much detail on progress. Of course, the public has a right to know-it is public money. I want to use this opportunity today to find out whether or not we can actually get some information out of this minister. Hopefully, when the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education comes into the chamber, he might provide some real details about where these colleges are up to. Because one thing is for sure: it is all taking too long. We have a minister in this case who seems to be extremely incompetent. He is unable to get these colleges up and running. We seem to have to wait longer and longer to see these colleges produce their first qualified tradesperson. Of course, it will not be until then that we are going to have any sort of dent in the massive skills shortages facing the Australian economy. If we go back to the last election campaign, people will remember the Prime Minister saying, ‘The technical colleges are the centrepiece of our drive to tackle skills shortages and to revolutionise vocational education and training throughout Australia.' If that is a revolution, it is a very tiny movement. It is more like a little shift of a wheel. The reality of the technical colleges comes nowhere near matching this flowery rhetoric. Let us have a look at what the government have been able to do to progress what they call their ‘centrepiece policy'. Twenty months after they were announced, there are supposed to be 25 colleges-that is how many were promised. Now, right at this moment, there are only four that are open for business. Each of the 25 colleges was supposed to have 300 students enrolled in years 11 and 12. That meant the promise was that there were going to be 7,500 students enrolled and working towards their trade in a school based new apprenticeship. How many students are there? Gladstone technical college in Queensland has one student enrolled and there are fewer than 300 students enrolled in the other colleges on the Gold Coast, in eastern Melbourne and Port Macquarie. There are 300 students in four colleges rather than 300 students in each college. Of course, there is no word on exactly how many of these students are really new to vocational education and training. Who is learning a trade for the first time in a new technical college rather than just continuing their vocational studies at a school with a new name? When these incredibly low enrolment figures were put to the government in this chamber last month, the Deputy Prime Minister cited Port Macquarie's technical college-in his own electorate no less-as an exemplar of the government's policy success. What he failed to mention was that the success in trade and vocational training at St Joseph's College in Port Macquarie has not been achieved because of the federal government. In fact, St Joseph's had been a success long before the Prime Minister announced the Australian technical colleges during the last election. It can be put no more simply than in the words of the head of that school who said to a newspaper recently: The technical college model is essentially we have been doing since 1979. So much for a revolution. Of the 220 students enrolled at the Australian technical college in Port Macquarie, located primarily at St Joseph's VOCOL, about 185 were enrolled at St Joseph's vocational college in Port Macquarie last year. It is the case that this extra funding will bring new facilities, but it seems to be true that very few additional students are preparing for a trade as a result of the technical college being established to meet the serious skills shortages we have. If more than two-thirds of the enrolments in the four Australian technical colleges are located at Port Macquarie, which is not much more than building on the success of the local school, the credit the government is claiming really should go to the hard working staff of St Joseph's. I ask the minister to tell the parliament during his summing up how many extra students are studying vocational education because of his technical colleges. By our reckoning, if you take account of the 185 vocational students at St Joseph's last year, there would actually be fewer than 100 extra students learning a trade as a result of these technical colleges. The opposition has been asking the government detailed questions on how the technical colleges are operating and we have been doing that for over a year here in the House through questions with and without notice and during Senate estimates hearings. Frankly, all we get from the government is stony silence. We cannot find out the detail. We cannot find out how much funding each college is receiving or what qualifications the students will graduate with. We cannot find out when the other 21 colleges will open their doors. Hopefully the minister will give us this information. All the answers we get from the departwhat ment have been based on expectations, targets, and hope. We need much more than this minister's blind faith, let alone his dumb luck, to train our future workforce. What we really need to see from this minister and from the government is the sleeves rolled up and these colleges opened. Of course, the Australian people and the parliament should be told the true story. Where are these colleges really up to? Even though it has been impossible for us to find out all the detail of student numbers, we have been able to find out fee levels. The government does seem to know what fees will be charged. The college fees so far range from $500 in eastern Melbourne to $2,000 on the Gold Coast. At St Joseph's in Port Macquarie, we can see that the Australian technical college concept works best when it is building on the success of local schools. Let us contrast Port Macquarie with the situation in Lismore-Ballina. This contrast is a damning indictment of how the government lets extreme ideology get in the way of positive outcomes for local students. Lismore-Ballina was promised a technical college by the Prime Minister back in September 2004. The locals, the schools, the TAFE and local businesses got together and came up with good local ideas, building on their own expertise and knowledge. In May 2005, they put proposals to Canberra. Here we are a whole year later and the people in Lismore and Ballina are still waiting for an announcement about who will run their college-if they get one at all. Minister Hardgrave has rejected two proposals from local groups and the only word from him has been a threat to take their promised college away unless there is a ‘clear indication' of local support. I would have thought that two proposals from the local community was a pretty clear indication of what they wanted. The Northern Rivers area of New South Wales is desperate for trade training. They have a massive shortage of carpenters, bricklayers, plumbers and electricians. It is also the case that teenage unemployment in the area is at 32 per cent. One of the rejected proposals was from a local consortium which included the local high school and TAFE. Ballina High School won the 2004 national VET in Schools Excellence Award and the North Coast Institute of TAFE won the 2004 national Large Training Provider of the Year Award, yet their proposal to run an Australian technical college was rejected by the Howard government. Thankfully, the New South Wales government has stepped into the breach and announced in their recent state budget that Ballina High would be funded under that state's new trade schools program. So at least we will see additional trade trainmunities ing happening in the Northern Rivers area of New South Wales because of the initiative of the New South Wales government. I had the pleasure of visiting Ballina High recently and met with the students and staff. They have outstanding students who are keen to get trade training and very dedicated staff who certainly know how to make vocational education and training work in our schools. They really are a great example of what we need-if only the federal minister would put ideology aside and consider working with them. The Deputy Principal of Ballina High told the Northern Star newspaper when I was up there, ‘We are still here, the government would reconsider.' They were rejected because they did not want to be tied to the Howard government's extreme industrial relations requirements. This government is insisting on mixing up IR conditions with the delivery of training. At the government's insistence, all staff employed at an Australian technical college must be offered an individual contract. If a local school or TAFE does not want to implement the government's extreme industrial relations agenda then it gets cut off from the technical college program. I just want to say to the government: extreme industrial relations agendas have no constructive link to training our future tradespeople. The government should drop this condition and get on with the job of opening more colleges because so far we only have four open. A whole year after tenders closed, we only have 12 funding agreements out of the 22 that were announced by the minister. Three regions have had no announcement on the preferred bidder, let alone whether or not a college might open. We do not even know whether they will open at all. Minister Hardgrave let the cat out of the bag not so long ago, threatening to take the promised colleges away from the local comof not only Lismore and Ballina but also Dubbo and Queanbeyan. In Dubbo we know that two proposals were submittedone from the New South Wales state education department and another from a private consortium-but we hear the federal government is out brokering for alternatives in the region. What is wrong with either of the proposals? Why have they been rejected? Will either of them go ahead? In Queanbeyan, again, two proposals were received and, again, we had the involvement of the New South Wales state education department as a sticking point. The process in Queanbeyan has been criticised by the ACT if Chamber of Commerce and Industry because the federal government was not willing to work constructively with industry based in Canberra who, of course, have links to the surrounding region. As local residents know, it is very easy to move between the ACT and Queanbeyan, so why can't the federal government make a technical college work in this area? What really needs to happen is for Minister Hardgrave to sit down and work constructively with his state counterparts. That is his job; he needs to get on with it. The minister should come in here and tell the parliament how many proposals in these three regions were rejected because they would not offer individual contracts to their staff. How many technical colleges have been held up because of the Howard government's extreme industrial relations agenda? The college promised in Darwin is also under threat after Minister Hardgrave threatened to withdraw funding from the consortium awarded the right to operate the college. There is example after example of these colleges unravelling. This minister has not been able to deliver more than empty rhetoric and, unfortunately, still only vague promises. The economy needs the colleges; our young people need the colleges. We need to make sure more opportunities are there for young people to start a trade. This bill brings forward funding into the current and next calendar year from 2008 and 2009. That is a reallocation of $62 million for 2006 and $26 million for 2007 on top of what they already had. Let us have a look at how much they have been able to spend; you have to worry about whether they are going to be able to deliver. As of the end of May this year, $185 million had been committed to the Australian technical colleges, but only $18 million had been spent. So there was $185 million committed but they have only managed to get $18 million out there on the ground. A total budget exists of $343 million over four years. The government are dramatically underspending on these colleges. Comparing the last two budget projections, it is $40 million less promised in the financial years 2005-06 and 2006-07. There can be no clearer indication that policy implementation is being bungled when you have so little of the money being spent. It is no wonder the government is refusing to reveal funding details for each of the colleges-it is just too embarrassed by very poor figures. This money needs to be spent to address our national skills crisis. Australian businesses need more welders, diesel mechanics and boilermakers, and we know that Australian families cannot get carpenters, plumbers or electricians when they need to get their homes built or renovated. With fewer than 300 students enrolled in these colleges, businesses and families are going to be waiting a very long time before they reap any benefit from the Prime Minister's promises. We know that training a skilled worker does not happen overnight. It requires investment over a considerable period of time. There is no quick fix for properly training our young Australians. Technical colleges will take up to four years before they produce their first qualified tradesperson. So the four colleges now up and running will, at best, produce fewer than 300 extra qualified tradespeople by 2010. The Australian Industry Group says we will need an extra 100,000 skilled workers by then. There have been so many warnings given to the government. The Reserve Bank has repeatedly identified the shortage of skilled workers as one of the significant capacity constraints in our economy, putting upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. We have the OECD highlighting again and again that skill shortages are a critical hindrance to future economic growth. Most recently, Peter Hendy from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that skill shortthan ages were the No. 1 complaint of investors. All of these business groups are coming out and complaining about the government's efforts in this regard. The Australian Industry Group's Heather Ridout said just after the budget: … it is disappointing that more progress has not been made on the big nation-building goals of skills and innovation … investments in skills, innovation and infrastructure are required to build the competitiveness of Australian business and to assist in rebalancing the economy as the current minerals boom begins to fade. We on this side of the parliament know that Australia's economic prosperity will not continue without investment in skills. We must re-invest in our skills base through strong education and training of our young people. The Howard government's record in this area is nothing short of a disgrace. Under this government, Australia is the only developed country in the world to reduce public investment in TAFEs and universities. Public investment in our universities and TAFEs has fallen eight per cent since 1995; the OECD average is a 38 per cent increase. We must have a more systematic approach to promoting trades, science and technology education than the Howard government's 25 technical colleges. Unlike the Howard government, Labor would work with the states and territories to deliver major changes to secondary schooling for the benefit of young Australians. Last September Kim Beazley put out Labor's skills blueprint. I will touch very briefly on the initiatives that a Labor government would put in place. We would: offer young people better choices by teaching trades, technology and science in first-class ties and rid our schools of dusty and Dickensian workshops. … … … Establish a Trades in Schools scheme to double the number of school based apprenticeships in areas of skill shortage and provide extra funding per place; We intend to provide specialist schools for the senior years of schooling in trades, in technology and in science. We would also: Establish a Trades Taster Program so year 9 and 10 students can experience a range of trade options, which could also lead to pre-apprenticeship programs. Labor has announced that we would overhaul the failed New Apprenticeships scheme. Labor has had all of these initiatives out there-all of these policies that would make a difference. Unfortunately, by contrast, we have a government that is incapable of implementing the one policy it has. Currently 40 per cent of people who start a new apprenticeship do not complete their training. Imagine if we could get those young people to complete their training. Labor's priority is to turn that around by offering a $2,000 trade completion bonus so that we give young people an incentive to finish their trade. We have also said we would pay the TAFE fees of traditional trade apprentices and child-care trainees to encourage them into the trades and into child-care work. Labor's priority is all about training Australians first and training them now, not, by contrast, doing what this government is doing: going for the quick-fix approach and bringing them in from overseas. The progress of these new Australian technical colleges has raised many questions, which the minister has so far left unanswered. Once again, I call on him to come faciliinto the chamber and come clean on how these colleges are really going.",81
47,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,Is the motion seconded? Mr Hatton-I second the motion.,86
48,Mr RANDALL,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I am pleased today to speak on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill 2006. In doing so, I would like to cite a number of examples and, in the time permitted to me before question time, raise some issues relating to the technical college in my area, Perth South. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Act 2005, which is the current act, to reallocate funding from 2008-09-from the out years, in other words-to 2006-07 and to insert a new provision in the current act to enable the minister to redistribute program funds between particular years by regulation instead of by legislative amendment. I emphasise this point, because that is the crux of this bill: it allows the minister to redistribute these funds by regulation rather than by legislative instrument. I will come to that a little later, because it has some implications. We know that before the last federal election, in response to the call from industry and the community in general, the Prime Minister made a commitment to the Australian people to develop 24 new Australian technical colleges. The reason for him wanting the Commonwealth to produce 24 Australian technical colleges was that the states had failed in their duty of skilling the young workforce and the workforce in general. In fact, there was a huge cry about the fact that Australia's skill needs were not being met. The opposition will tell you: ‘Shock, horror! This government hasn't addressed it.' When I was elected to this parliament as the member for Swan in 1996, apprenticeship numbers left by the previous Hawke-Keating government were approximately 105,000 apprenticeships per year. Currently it stands at close to 500,000. So that is the difference. The Australian Labor Party left the young of this country without a proper apprenticeship commitment. There were only approximately 105,000 apprenticeships being undertaken in those days and now we are looking at almost half a million. That is the difference between us and them in terms of real commitment. What was the Labor Party's alternative in the days that they were in government and being led by such people as the member for Hotham, Mr Simon Crean? It was to create this mickey mouse training initiative called Working Nation. We all remember Bill Hunter and Working Nation, don't we? There he stood on the edge of oil rigs and other such things saying, ‘Here we are: we've produced job ready people.' Those people who were job ready were doing training courses that lasted three months. There are some brick houses around Perth that I tend to suggest people would want to have a close look at because they were built by these people who did three-month courses, and I would want to be a little bit careful about the future stability of these houses. This was not proper apprenticeship training and skills training; this was a mickey mouse scheme to get people off the unemployment statistics. They were creating jobs. We know that the statistics say that when the Labor Party created their Working Nation system it cost about $60,000 to produce a job. You may as well have paid them $60,000 rather than spend $60,000 trying to concoct jobs that were not really there. It was not proper training. So the Australian government has committed itself to a proper skills training regime with these 24 Australian technical colleges. The 24 Australian technical colleges will concentrate on skills, not alternative type arrangements such as we cop in the TAFEs now-aromatherapy, flower arranging and transcendental meditation courses. That is the qualification you will end up with if you come out of one of these courses now, which you cannot use and you cannot transport. It is just a time-filling arrangement. Currently the states have dropped the ball. If anybody is guilty in this whole argument, it is the states, who have dropped the ball. As a result of the states having dropped the ball on training in their TAFEs, the federal government has had to fill the vacuum. The 24 Australian technical colleges will fill this vacuum in training. But there is a big impediment to this-and the member for Jagajaga said recently it is going slow. Of course it is going slow. We know why it is going slow. It is because all around Australia the state Labor governments are doing their best to slow down these colleges. It is unbelievable. One of these colleges-the Perth South technical college-has been assigned to my region, and the member for Hasluck and I were very pleased on 1 May this year to open it with Minister Hardgrave, the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. One of the school principals came up to me and said, ‘Don, just by the way, the Perth district south office has said to us that we've got to find a way to slow these technical colleges down,' because they do not support them. Then Ken Ticehurst, the member for Dobell, told me that the technical college in his region is fering the same fate. The New South Wales government is trying to slow down the development and the roll-out of the technical college in his area. So no wonder there are only four currently up and running at the moment when you have the imposition of the state governments, for partisan political reasons, trying to slow down the roll-out of these colleges. As I said, the Perth South region, which the member for Hasluck and I represent, has been lucky enough to have a technical college-there was a great submission from the Stirling Skills Centre. That technical college will concentrate on the automotive industries, with a campus to be located in the Maddington-Gosnells area, and on the construction industries, with a campus which will be located around Armadale, in my area. The mayors of the cities and the industries surrounding these regions are excited about the prospect of providing young year 11 and 12 students with real skills training in the automotive and the construction areas. We are also very pleased. I am pleased to see the member for Brand here. The member for Brand, when the Kwinana-Rockingham consortium tried to put together their bid, did not support it at all. In fact, one of the reasons why they do not have one is his lack of support for that technical college in the Rockingham-Kwinana region. We know that this consortium took Minister Hardgrave down and flew him over the area, because the industrial strip in the Kwinana region is calling out for a technical college in that area and can satisfy the requirements for it. But did the member for Brand actively get in and support this? No. That is one of the reasons we won our very good application for the technical college in the Perth South region. There is also a college that has been assigned to the Pilbara. As a result, the young sufpeople of the Pilbara region, in the north-west, where there is an enormous amount of industry such as oil and mining, deserve the opportunity in year 11 and 12 at school to be skilled in the traditional trades: not the alternative skills that might be learnt-tarot card reading and this sort of stuff-but metal skills, fitting and turning, automotive skills, electrical skills and other engineering skills. But no. Again the state authorities helped to slow this Pilbara bid down. At the Minerals Council dinner the other evening, the Prime Minister announced that the Pilbara bid is up and running due to the support of the industry, and some of the issues that the industry has outlined are being addressed.",86
49,The SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted. In accordance with standing order 97, the debate may be resumed at a later hour. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Parliamentary Behaviour",89
50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have been asked questions recently about disruptive behaviour in the chamber, related to members moving around the chamber and what were seen as orchestrated interruptions, including the display of placards. Concerning the possibility that movement around the chamber by members may interfere with the television broadcast, I am advised that it is not possible to identify which camera is producing the picture being used for the telecast at a particular time. Standing indicates that members must take their seats promptly, must not remain in the aisles and must not walk between the chair and any member who has the call. I remind members that their individual conduct should be courteous, not only to their parliamentary colleagues but also to those members of the public who are watching and listening in the galleries or via the parliamentary broadcast. I also note that there has been significant noise and disruption during question time over recent sitting weeks. Any member who has the call is entitled to be heard by the House. The Speaker's role is to ensure that this happens and to take action if there are attempts to interfere with a member's right to speak with minimal disruption. Earlier this week a question by the Leader of the Opposition and the response by the Prime Minister were disrupted by a display of placards. Whilst a member with the call may make a passing reference to a displayed object or article, members without the call may not do so and will be dealt with accordingly. The standing orders aim to establish a minimum standard of behaviour expected of members at all times they are in the chamber so as to maintain the dignity of the House and to enable the member with the call to be heard without noise or disturbance. Again, I remind all members to ensure that their language is characterised by good temper and moderation and that directions given by the chair are complied with. NA Immigration",89
51,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement in this place four years ago, almost to the day, when he said: I want to make it clear that there is no intention, and there never has been, to excise any part of the Australian mainland. That is an absolutely ludiorder 62 clearly crous proposition. If this is still the case, will the Prime Minister now withdraw the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006 or will he impose on his party room an absolutely ludicrous proposition?",89
52,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The legislation which will shortly be before the parliament does not involve the excision of the Australian mainland. That is the ludicrous proposition that has been put by the Leader of the Opposition. This legislation establishes a total consistency in the treatment of unlawful arrivals in Australia between people who might come onto the mainland and people who might come onto offshore islands. This legislation further entrenches a highly successful border protection policy, to which the government remains fully committed. It does not involve what the Leader of the Opposition has said. It is he who is being ludicrous. Abu Bakar Bashir",89
53,Mr HENRY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What is the government's reaction to the release of Abu Bakar Bashir? Has the government communicated its views on this matter to the Indonesian government?,89
54,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question. Can I say again to the House what I said yesterday: the government, and I am sure the great majority of the people of Australia, greeted the news of the release of Abu Bakar Bashir not only with disappointment but also with a reaction verging on hostility and disgust. His release and the inflammatory statements that he has made in support of extremism since he has been released have been deeply offensive, especially to the families of the men and women of this country who died in the Bali attack in October of 2002. The honourable member for Hasluck asks me what action the government has taken to communicate its views to the Indonesian government. I can inform the House that this morning I wrote to the Indonesian President, using the words that I have just used to describe the reaction of the Australian people Abu Bakar Bashir's release. I went on to say that, whilst fully respecting and recognising the adherence to due process in the Indonesian court system, the Indonesian government should understand the deep anger in the Australian community and our sense of concern about what has happened. I also said in that letter to the Indonesian President that it was important that the Indonesian government monitor very closely the activities of Mr Bashir and implement fully the obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1264. As the House would be aware, I said to the President that Mr Bashir's name had been added to a list of terrorists subject to a range of international restrictions under this resolution, including an assets freeze, restrictions on international travel and access to arms. We would hope that the Indonesian government would fully adhere to and support the implementation of its obligations under that part of the UN Security Council's resolution. The Australian government remains strongly committed to working closely with the Indonesian government in fighting terrorism, and I place on record again the deep appreciation of the Australian people for the excellent work done by the Indonesian police in the wake of the Bali attack. The reality is of course that, of those directly involved in that attack, so many of them are being brought to justice. A number are awaiting the imposition of the death penalty and others have been sentenced to very long terms of imprisonment. So in relation to the people who actually carried out the attack, Indonesian justice has been effective, it has been diligent and it has been comprehensive. But that does not in any way relieve the sense of anger and concern in our community about Bashir's release, and I have conveyed those concerns to the President. I might add that to our charge d'affaires in Jakarta has personally spoken this morning to the Indonesian foreign minister, Dr Wirajuda, to reinforce the concern felt by the Australian community. For the information of the House, I table a copy of my letter to the President of Indonesia. Workplace Relations",90
55,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to Esselte, an American multinational, the largest general office products manufacturer in the world, with an Australian subsidiary. Is the Prime Minister aware that Esselte Australia has offered employees at one of its New South Wales warehouses an AWA which provides for an increased rate of pay of $1.25 per hour above the current enterprise agreement hourly rate of pay but scraps Saturday penalty rates, scraps Sunday penalty rates, reduces penalty rates for public holidays and does not provide for a wage increase during the three year term of the AWA?

But I am in possession of the broad economic outcomes that have been achieved under this government and I am in possession of all the warnings of doom and destruction, unemployment and industrial disputation that were made 10 years ago when we made some changes. I am absolutely certain that, just as those predictions were incorrectly made and were not borne out by subsequent experience, so it will be that the experiences of the Australian workforce under the government's new policies will be ones of increasing employment, rising real wages and continued growth of the Australian economy. Abu Bakar Bashir",91
60,Mr SOMLYAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the government's reaction to reports that the United Nations World Food Program is using Abu Bakar Bashir's Islamic organisation to distribute its food to victims of the Yogyakarta earthquake? What steps has the government taken to prevent Abu Bakar Bashir from supporting further terrorist acts?,91
61,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, can I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. I am aware of reports that the World Food Program, which is an agency of the United Nations, has given an organisation called Majelis Mujahidin Indonesia, known as MMI-Abu Bakar Bashir was the co-founder and at one time the chairman of this organisation-95 tonnes of food to donate to victims of the 27 May earthquake in Central Java. It has been brought to my attention that a spokesman for MMI has said that Abu Bakar Bashir intends to distribute this food, which was provided for and by the United Nations, to the victims himself. Let me make this absolutely clear. We regard this decision by the World Food Program, by the United Nations, to use MMI as one of the organisations that would distribute food as completely unacceptable. Our Jakarta post has contacted the World Food Program in Indonesia and made that view perfectly clear. Our ambassador in Rome will also be speaking to the World Food Program, whose headquarters are in Rome, during the course of today, when he is able to do so, making the same point: that we regard the use of an organisation like MMI, which was co-founded by Abu Bakar Bashir and of which Abu Bakar Bashir was the chairman, as completely unacceptable. Obviously, this organisation plans to use the distribution of this food, funded by the international community, as a propaganda tool and therefore the United Nations should not allow itself, in any circumstances or through any of its agencies, to be unintentionally, of course, manipulated in that way. Let me say, just in case honourable members are wondering, that actually no Australian government funds have been given to the World Food Program for the earthquake victims in Yogyakarta. Our aid has gone in different ways. But having said that, Australia is a major contributor-I think off the top of my head it is the third or fourth largest contributor to the World Food Program-so we are particularly sensitive to this type of action. In relation to the second part of the question, the Prime Minister has already indicated that we have made high-level representations to the Indonesians-we have been for quite some time-in relation to the release of Abu Bakar Bashir. Those representations have included a discussion between our acting ambassador, the Charge d'Affaires in Jakarta, and Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda. We of course are making the point to the Indonesians that we hope that they will be able to monitor on a continuous basis the activities of Abu Bakar Bashir, but we have reinforced to the Indonesians that under Security Council resolution 1267 Indonesia is required to ensure that Abu Bakar Bashir, who is listed by the UN as a terrorist, will not be able to harm people. The restrictions imposed by the UN on Abu Bakar Bashir include the freezing of his assets. No funding can be provided to Abu Bakar Bashir. He is not allowed to travel internationally and he is not allowed access to weapons or to military equipment. The Australian government and the Indonesian government will continue to consult with each other on this issue. I am not going to go into the responses they have given us, excepting to say that we have constructive discussions with them and I think that constructive relationship on this issue will continue. Migration  without notice is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister explain why, when Indonesia will not change its terror laws to keep Abu Bakar Bashir in jail, he will change our immigration laws to keep Indonesians happy?",91
62,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are changing our laws to make them stronger in Australia's national interest. I am very interested indeed that the Chief Opposition Whip should have asked this question. It took my mind back to the latter months of 2001, when the current Leader of the Opposition was also then Leader of the Opposition and he was highly critical of the anti-people-smuggling policies of my government. One of the strongest arguments he advanced was, in a nutshell, that in order to solve this problem you had to have total cooperation with Indonesia. The strongest possible argument was that we should make sure that we cooperated with Indonesia. This is what the Leader of the Opposition then said: Effective measures to combat people-smuggling require cooperation with neighbouring countries that are serving as transit routes for illegal people movement to Australia. People-smuggling poses a significant national security problem not only for Australia but also for our neighbours, including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. This is what he went on to say: A Labor government will pursue the issue of people-smuggling with the highest levels of the Indonesian government. We will do so in the context of a wholehearted commitment to build a mutually beneficial relationship with the new Indonesia. In essence, what the Leader of the Opposition was saying then was in fact true-that is, in order to stop people-smuggling you need the cooperation of Indonesia. Everything that we have done has been designed to maintain that cooperation. But to suggest that that is an exercise in anything other than the sovereignty of this country is, to borrow a phrase used by the Leader of the Opposition earlier, plainly ludicrous. Economy",92
63,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also addressed to the Prime Minister. How has the government helped Australian businesses to create jobs? Is the Prime Minister aware of any proposals to undermine growth? What has been the response of Australian business?,93
64,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. It goes to the heart of what is very important to the lives of millions of Australians-that is, the strength of the Australian economy. He asks what we have done to promote growth and strengthen the economy. I remind him of the remarkable record in fiscal management, of which the Managing Director of the IMF spoke so approvingly when he was in Canberra yesterdayMr Costello-Glowingly.",93
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Glowingly, the Treasurer quite properly adds. Glowingly, he spoke of the way in which we have reduced our debt, the way in which, through labour market and other reforms, we have created a first-class economy for a first-class nation the 21st century. The member for La Trobe asks me whether I am aware of any threats to this. There are many threats. There are some over which the Australian people have no control-threats such as international factors, like the high price of crude oil, which is leading to very painfully high petrol prices in Australia. That is amongst the things that we do not control. But we do control our domestic policy, and this government has made it clear that part of the reform process is to make sure that we maintain further changes to our labour markets. Ms Hall interjecting",93
66,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Shortland is out of her seat and highly disorderly.,93
67,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those policies are under direct attack from the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has committed himself, if he becomes Prime Minister, to the abolition of Australian workplace agreements, which will cut the living standards of hundreds of thousands of Australians. In the process of attacking our policies the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues are engaging in many tactics that are designed to misrepresent and to mislead. Mr Speaker, let me take you back to the last sitting week, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made a completely false accusation about Teys Bros meat works in Naracoorte in South Australia. I remind the HouseMs Macklin-Have you been down there yet?",93
68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice the member for Jagajaga interjects. If she is a little patient, I will come to what she said. I remind the House that the member alleged that overseas in workers were being given preferential treatment compared with Australian workers. That claim was totally and completely false. Since it was refuted in this House, I have received a letter from Gary Teys, the Deputy Chairman of Teys Bros. I will table the letter in a moment. Amongst other things, this is what he had to say. It bears very directly on this dishonest campaign that is being waged by the opposition alleging that people entering this country on temporary 457 visas are taking the jobs of Australians. This is what he had to say: It seems strange to me that we have become the target of the opposition and the media in this matter of overseas workers on temporary 457 Visas. He goes on to say: Had it not been for the overseas workers in our plants we would never have been able to fully utilise these facilities. Despite extensive recruit Australian Workers through advertising and enlist the assistance of the AMIEUan Australian unionto provide us with names of workers, we were unsuccessful in obtaining the numbers of staff required at our various plants. This is completely contradictory to what was represented in this House by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is of a piece with the way in which question time day after day is used by the opposition to make completely false claims about the impact of this on the country. He goes on to say-and this really puts it in perspective: We saw the overseas workers as our only opportunity to keep the plants operating at an efficient level and we are certain that if the labour shortage had not been filled by these overseas workers, then some of our plants would have been forced to close, thus costing the jobs of Australian Workers. In other words, not only were these foreign workers brought in because there were no Australian workers to fill the new jobs but, if they had not been brought in, existing Australian workers in jobs would have lost their jobs. In other words, there would have been a double whammy effect. That is the sort of policy and attitude that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and her leader are flogging around this country. It does a great injustice to the foreign workers, it does a great injustice to Australian companies and it is contrary to all the experience of a nation that is now experiencing levels of unemployment that the Leader of the Opposition when he was last in government could only have dreamt of. I table the letter. Workplace Relations",93
69,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. I refer again to the Esselte AWA. Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that that AWA provides for an increased rate of pay of $1.25 per hour efforts to above the current enterprise agreement hourly rate of pay? Isn't it also a fact that the AWA reduces the availability of overtime and the rate of pay for overtime, scraps shift loadings for morning and afternoon shifts, scraps weekend penalty rates and does not provide for a wage increase during the three year term of the AWA? Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that this AWA leaves a full-time employee working two hours of overtime during the week and a Saturday shiftMr Cameron Thompson interjecting",94

72,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that this AWA leaves a full-time employee working two hours of overtime during the week and a Saturday shift $60 a week or $9,360 over three years worse off?",94
73,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me say in reply to the member for Perth, firstly, that it is a fact that often questions asked by the opposition are not true. That is a fact. It is a fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made a totally false set of assertions when she asked a question of me about Teys Bros. It is a fact that I am not, for the reasons that any reasonable person would understand, in possession of the employment details of every employment arrangement made in this country. But it is a fact that since this government have been in office we have created 1.8 million more jobs. It is a fact that real wages have risen by 16.8 per cent. It is a fact that that compares with wage rises of about one to two per cent in the 13 years of the previous Labor government. It is a fact that when we reformed the industrial relations laws 10 years ago we were told that they would drive down productivity, they would push up industrial disputes, they would push up unemployment and they would depress productivity. All of those claims were wrong. It is a fact that economic predictions made by the opposition are almost always totally false. Workplace Relations",94
74,Mr HARTSUYKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Would the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House how the government's workplace policies have helped exporters and regional businesses remain competitive? How has this increased job opportunities in regional Australia?,95
75,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. The honourable member for Cowper would recognise that one in four jobs in regional Australia relies on exports. He would recognise that, as a result of many of the government's policies, unemployment is now at its lowest level in 30 years-at a 4.9 per cent average across Australia. In his area of the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, unemployment has fallen considerably. He would also recognise that there has been significant growth in real wages over the life of our government. It has all been a result of good economic management and a reform process that has helped us maintain our competitive and efficient edge both domestically and internationally in the international marketplace. It is important that we recognise the importance of workplace reforms in helping make sure that Australia's exporting industries maintain their competitive edge across the world. There are a number of examples that have come forward in recent days of domestic Australian businesses, regional businesses as well as export businesses, maintaining that competitive edge because of the reforms that our government has put in place. I will give the member for Cowper some examples. There is a company in Central Queensland called Mobbs and Co., which is a steel manufacturer and supplier to mining and rural industries, both export industries, as well as the building industry, including those key exporters. They have been using AWAs with all of their 30 staff since 1997. The managing director, Kym Mobbs, said: If we hadn't had AWAs, we would not have been able to compete. Our advantage is that we have the flexibility to adapt to changing customer needs because our staff feel part of our business. They are part of the business because of the AWAs. Last night there was a most enjoyable function held in Canberra, and I know that a number of the members of the opposition were there as well. It was the farewell for Peter Corish, the former President of the National Farmers Federation. He spoke about AWAs in his own personal business. With regard to his business, he said: We have found them very effective in providing agreements that gives certainty for the employees as well as for us as employers. He said ‘certainty for employees as well as for the employers'. Ms Plibersek interjecting",95

77,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will leave the last quote to a small business person from Dubbo. Tina Reynolds, who runs a business called A1 Tree Service, was quoted in the Daily Liberal, the newspaper in Dubbo, talking about AWAs. It is an interesting name for a newspaper. It is in the electorate of the member for Parkes-it is in one of our electorates. Tina Reynolds said about AWAs in her business: They've worked well for us. It's a wonderful way of communicating between employers and employees. Our employees have sick days, public holidays and all of that. Ms Plibersek interjecting",95
78,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sydney is warned!,96
79,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Ms Reynolds said: If they're a good employee, because of the skills shortage, your employer is going to look after you. That is the last word from a small business person. Of course, that is exactly the case: good employers are going to look after good employees. The skills shortage is there, but we have to keep the economy going. We have to keep good skilled staff engaged in the workplace. That is the evidence coming from across regional Australia. I suggest the Leader of the Opposition should listen to the last line of that quote: if you are a good employee, because of the skills shortage, your employer will look after you. So if he is a good employee, because of the skills shortage on the front-bench, his employer, the unions of Australia, will look after him. Workplace Relations",96

100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Ballarat is warned! Superannuation,97
101,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen reports of opposition to the government's major superannuation reform? What would it mean if opponents were successful in defeating the government's changes?,97
102,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question. In this year's budget the government announced the most significant superannuation changes in the last two decades, and they were very widely welcomed. The Investment and Financial Services Association said: The effective removal of end benefits tax and tax on super pensions is a major step toward the simplification of an overly complex ... regime. The 2006 Budget plan could sweep away some of the frustrating complexity of Australia's superannuation system ... AMP said: These initiatives help ensure Australia one of the most progressive and well-managed retirement income systems in the world. The Institute of Actuaries said: The Institute strongly applauds the government's big bang approach to the government reforms. So we have near universal endorsement of the government's plan for the greatest reform to superannuation in the last two decades. Who would oppose it and on what grounds? I was very concerned to read in the Age newspaper today in an article titled ‘ALP digs in over no-tax super plan': Labor is reserving its right to oppose the Howard Government's headline-grabbing promise to make superannuation payouts tax-free for workers ... Yesterday I raised the issue that Labor had been ominously silent-that Labor had not come out and supported this change-and now we see Senator Sherry slipping around to the Age newspaper to tell us Labor's real plan. Labor's real plan is to dig in over the abolition of taxes on superannuation. Mr Fitzgibbon-You don't have a policy!",97
103,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hunter is warned!,98
104,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Seeing that we are interested in employee entitlements, let me tell people what Labor's opposing this superannuation reform will mean for them. If you are a 25-year-old on $1,000 a week and receiving the SG, and if Labor is able to defeat these reforms, you will be worse off in retirement by $7,000 a year. If that same 25year-old earning $1,000 took his lump sum, and if Labor succeeds in opposing this plan, his lump sum would be reduced by $37,000. Just in case you thought that it was only young people that Labor was against, a 65year-old retiring with a $400,000 allocated pension under Labor's system would have their allocated pension reduced by $4,900 a year. If that same 65-year-old took their money in a lump sum, their lump sum would maintains be reduced by $43,000. The young and the old stand to benefit from this superannuation plan. It has the support of IFSA, ASFA, AMP and the Institute of Actuaries. The only person who does not have the guts to stand up and back the government's reform is the Leader of the Opposition. He was warned about this by former senator Susan Ryan, who endorsed the government's plan. Not only did former senator Susan Ryan-a former Labor minister-endorse the government's plan but she finished off her article in the Australian on Friday, 12 May 2006 by saying: Maybe faced with the Treasurer's bold gazumping of Labor's cherished but slightly shabby super property, the Opposition will find the resolve to get another big picture worked out, and the wherewithal to let voters know about it. Maybe or maybe not-no big picture, no wherewithal, no leadership, no policy, no credibility and no support. Mr Bevis interjecting",98
105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Brisbane is warned! Employment,98
106,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of new empirical research undertaken by the OECD in its newly released 2006 Employment Outlook that finds: No significant direct impact of the level of the minimum wage on unemployment is identified. And: The minimum wage could encourage higher participation by helping to make work pay for the low skilled. Treasurer, don't these new findings from the OECD severely undermine the economic case for the government's objective to lower minimum wages through the Fair Pay Commission?",98
107,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, of course they do not. And anybody who had any familiarity with the OECD would know that since 1994, when it introduced its job strategy, one of the things that it has been consistently advising developed economies to do is to remove barriers in their labour markets. One of the things that it has been consistently advising the Europeans in particular to do is to get rid of strong employment protection legislation-what we call ‘unfair dismissal' lawsbecause unfair dismissal laws are a hamper on job creation. In fact, if the honourable member had listened to my answer yesterday, I actually read out",99

109,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know; it is funny, isn't it, that he would listen to anything. If only he had listened to the answer yesterday he would have heard me read out the very survey to which he refers. I read this quote: The link between the standards of employment protection legislation and aggregate unemployment is uncertain in theory and, in practice, highly dependent on specific national context. However, there is evidence that too strict tion will hamper labour mobility, reduce the dynamic efficiency of the economy and restrain job creation. I repeat, ‘There is evidence that too strict legislation will hamper labour mobility, reduce the dynamic efficiency of the economy and restrain job creation.' That is precisely what the OECD said. If you want further reassurance on the point, let us go to the IMF. The IMF has repeatedly said that Australia's industrial relations laws will enhance job creation and improve the economy. The IMF was so supportive of this government's reform that-get a load of this-the ACTU despatched a delegation to Washington to complain. Sharan Burrow went across to warn the IMF.",99

The ACTU was so upset that Sharan Burrow went to Washington to complain to the IMF that the IMF was supporting labour market reform in Australia. ‘We warn the Tsar!'-Sharan Burrow warns the IMF. The IMF not only dismissed her complaints but issued a new report redoubling the advice on the Australian economy.

As the Treasurer was pointing out to the House, a series of world economic bodies, including the IMF, have confirmed the workplace relations reforms as being part of the strength of the Australian economy over the past decade or so. Indeed, I noted that the managing director of the IMF, while in Australia this week, said something which the government knows and which the Leader of the Opposition is trying to ignore-that is, countries cannot prosper into the 21st century with workplace laws from the seventies, eighties and nineties. But that is where the Australian Labor Party wants to take Australia: back to the Keating era reforms. I was asked about proposals to roll back these reforms.

128,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This morning we had from the member for Perth one of the most outrageous attacks that I have heard of from a member of this place on the business organisations in Australia. Having been repudiated by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Perth was out at the doorstop this morning, taking out his anger on the business organisations in Australia. The first person he got stuck into was Michael Chaney, the head of the Business Council of Australia, whose only crime, it seems, was to write to the Leader of the Opposition and express the concern of the Business Council of Australia-the companies that employ some million Australians-about the Leader of the Opposition's roll back, his backflip, Australian workplace agreements. Let us just look at this. Mr Chaney is somebody who has actually run businesses in Australia. Mr Chaney is someone who has actually created jobs for thousands of Australians and their families. That is unlike the member for Perth, whose main activity has been as a political apparatchik. So we had this extraordinary attack on the head of the Business Council of Australia by the member for Perth.",101

130,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will be heard! The minister has the call, and the minister will be heard.",101
131,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not only do we have this extraordinary attack on the Business Council of Australia; also we have an extraordinary attack on the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, an organisation that represents the employers of some four million Australian people, saying that it was only interested in pushing down for lower wages. In fact, the member for Perth said in his doorstop, about the ACCI, ‘Maybe it's about a lazy, easy way of increasing your profit.' This is an outrageous thing for a senior member of the opposition to be saying about a business organisation, the members of which employ some four million Australians. But the member for Perth went on and said, ‘You should go and ask the business community this question: what flexibility do you get from statutory individual contracts that you can't get from common-law individual contracts?' If the member for Perth and the opposition do not know the difference between common-law contracts and individual AWAs then they are deeply in trouble, because the reality is that, as has been the law in Australia for some 90 years, common-law contracts do not replace awards. In fact, the ACCI pointed on this out today in a press release. They said: Common law agreements do not deliver changes to working arrangements that are prohibited by awards or union agreements. They cannot do so because they are not allowed to alter (in any way) any of the terms of an award or a union agreement, no matter how inflexible, restrictive, inefficient, costly or inappropriate those terms might be to the situation of that employer and that employee. So the reality, when you decode what members of the opposition are saying, is that they are saying, ‘Let's rip away the entitlements of hundreds of thousands of Australian workers on individual Australian workplace agreements.' The proposition from the Leader of the Opposition is to replace them with common-law contracts. In effect, he is saying to those hundreds of thousands of Australians and their families: ‘We're going to take you back to the award conditions. We're going to take you back to conditions that pay 100 per cent less, on average, than do individual Australian workplace agreements.' As I said, if the opposition, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth do not know the difference between commonlaw contracts and Australian workplace agreements then they are in deep trouble. The member for Perth ought to apologise to the business organisations in Australia for his outrageous statements this morning. If he does not do so then the Leader of the Opposition should sack him. He has already repudiated him in any case. Lucas Heights Reactor",101
132,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. I refer the minister to her statement this morning that she is not aware of any other incidents at the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor in the past 12 months. Why is the minister unaware that the nuclear regulator, ARPANSA, has publicly stated in these four compliance reports tabled in this parliament that there were 12 incidents at the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor in 2005? In the light of the minister's ignorance, how can the Australian public have any confidence in her statement yesterday that there has been no impact at all upon the health of workers at Lucas Heights or the surrounding community and that the matter is under control?",102

This production process is the one that produces the radioisotopes for use by thousands of cancer sufferers across Australia each year. This ruptured pipe occurred almost half a kilometre away from the actual reactor. Yesterday I said that there would be no impact on the health of workers or the community, and that is absolutely correct.

152,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on international efforts to combat terrorism in the Middle East. Is there any domestic opposition to these efforts?,103
153,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question and her interest. I think that the highlight I should refer to in answering her question is the death last week of the al-Qaeda terrorist al-Zarqawi. We congratulate the Prime Minister of Iraq, the Iraqi defence forces and the United States forces on the job they did in tracking down this terrorist-this brutal and cruel man-and finally bringing him to justice. He was the mastermind of terrorism in Iraq, and he was also, I think, a very effective manipulator of the Western media. Whilst one normally would not express pleasure at the death of anybody, the death of a terrorist like that is a good thing. The al-Qaeda backed terrorists in Iraq will continue to try to kill people, and some of the insurgents will continue to try to kill people. But the view of this government is that we should do all we reasonably can and, more importantly, the international community should do all it can to ensure that the forces of freedom and democracy in Iraq are successful and that terrorists and the insurgents are defeated. When President Bush was in Iraq a couple of days ago, he said that ‘Iraq is a central front' in the war on terror and that America would keep its commitments. I commend not just the international forces and our own forces but also-in a way more importantly-the people of Iraq for their determination to stand up to terrorism and their determination to make sure that their democracy and their freedom succeeds in the teeth of those terrorists. There are alternative views in this country. We give our commitment to see through this task. The opposition has an alternative view. When the Leader of the Opposition was asked on 9 June in a doorstop what he thought about the death of al-Zarqawi, he said that the war in Iraq is ‘a major distraction' in the war on terror. In other words, international community should pull out of Iraq and leave that country in the hands of the insurgents and the terrorists. That is the position of the Leader of the Opposition, a man who has endeavoured to convince commentators that he has some sort of knowledge of and expertise on international strategic issues. In other words, the world would be better off if the insurgents and the terrorists were successful in Iraq. Mr Adams interjecting",103

157,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"we would be better off if we won. We would be better off if the terrorists were defeated in Iraq. This government will never be defeatist and it will never step backwards in its determination to support the international community in Iraq. But the Leader of the Opposition leads a political party which has a candidate in Victoria called Khalil Eideh. Khalil Eideh is a man who speaks of ‘colonial' and ‘Zionist' plots to ‘enslave the Arab world' and praises the work of ‘Arab martyrs'. If the Leader of the Opposition were a person of strength and courage, he would ensure that this Labor candidate was disendorsed. This is not a candidate who articulates the courageous views of the mainstream of Australia. The mainstream of Australia denounces and stands up to these people. Labor have a candidate they are running in the Victorian election-some sort of multimillionaire candidate they are enormously the proud of-who apparently talks about ‘Arab martyrs' and how there are ‘Zionist' plans to ‘enslave the Arab world'. I think we have heard that language somewhere else. Now we hear that language from the Australian Labor Party-the party that wants to haul up the white flag in Iraq, the party that wants to roll over in the teeth of terrorists. The Leader of the Opposition should show some courage and get this man disendorsed.",104

Further to the explosive incident at the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor on 8 June-the same day that Ziggy Switkowski stood aside from the ANSTO board-has the minister been briefed on a further incident at the nuclear reactor at 11 am yesterday? Can the minister confirm that a canister carrying radioactive material was received from the ANSTO cyclotron in Camperdown and an apparent contamination on the outside of the canister vaporised during processing at Lucas Heights? Is the minister aware that radiation alarms in the immediate work area were not activated but that barrier alarms were triggered by the technician who was working with the canister and that the technician was scanned and found to have ingested radioactive iodine 123? In relation to this further incident, what investigation and action has the minister ordered into the cyclotron in Camperdown, the transport of radioactive materials through Sydney and at the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor?",104

175,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister update the House on how the government is assisting Indigenous Australians to improve their health and well-being?,105
176,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gwydir for his question. I acknowledge his concerns and I pay tribute to the work that he has done with the Indigenous people of his electorate, particularly in conjunction with Dick Estens in Moree to improve their employment outcomes. The fact that Indigenous life expectancy remains about 20 years below that of the general community should trouble every member of this House, notwithstanding the significant improvements in Indigenous mortality achieved in the last few years. Although Indigenous ill health has many causes, better health services are certainly essential if things are to improve. Since 1996, the Howard government has increased Indigenous-specific health spending from about $100 million to about $350 million a year. The recent budget committed an additional $137 million over the forward estimates period. In particular, the government will spend $40 million to get an additional 80 health professionals or their equivalents working with Aboriginal people in both Aboriginal and mainstream health services; it will spend $21 million training over 1,200 Aboriginal health workers to better recognise and deal with mental health problems; it will spend $20 million converting 130 part-time positions into full-time jobs with Indigenous health services; and, perhaps most importantly, it will spend an additional $55 million to combat the scourge of petrol sniffing in Central Australia and other remote settlements, which will mean targeting and removing petrol sniffers from affected communities and also extending the roll-out of the unsniffable OPAL petrol. As members of this House on both sides would know, there is no panacea for these difficulties. It is, I regret to say, easy to money but not easy to get outcomes. However, this government certainly will not hesitate to invest in programs that it is confident will work. Lucas Heights Reactor",105
177,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Can the minister now confirm that on 1 May this year the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ceased providing radiation monitoring and protection services by health physics surveyors at the Lucas Heights reactor between the hours of 11 pm and 7 am? Is the minister aware that New South Wales fire brigades will attend incidents they are called to at the Lucas Heights facility but may be unable to enter the site to deal with incidents unless they have a full briefing on the radioactive hazards on the site from these expert surveyors? Is the minister aware that the reduction in onsite expert staff may lead to a delay in emergency services responses of up to two hours? What action is the minister taking to address these very serious potential delays?",106
178,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The changes to the staffing rosters have been effected with the full support of ARPANSA, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, and with the support of the unions. There is, in fact, a site operations safety supervisor onsite 24 hours a day. These staff have the expertise to address any health and safety concerns. The change in monitoring arrangements has no effect whatsoever on the safety of workers at Lucas Heights. Education",106
179,Mr SCHULTZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister inform the House of the federal governspend ment's funding to states and territories for education purposes? Is the minister confident that this money is being well spent? Mr Bowen- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question asked by the honourable member for Hume offends standing order 98(d). By asking the minister if she is ‘confident', he is asking for an opinion. I would ask the question to be ruled out of order.",106
180,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I listened carefully to the question. There was more to that question than the last point. I call the minister.,107
181,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hume for his question. He will be interested to know that the Australian government has increased funding to Australian schools by some 116 per cent in the 10 years that the Howard government has been in office. For example, in the ACT that increase has been 96 per cent. This year, some $49.2 million will be provided to government schools in the ACT. In addition, we have provided some $7½ million under the Investing in our Schools program to government schools in the Australian Capital Territory. I have been asked about how this money is being spent. If we look at the Australian Capital Territory, we find that Labor is in fact closing 39 government schools in the ACT. It has been revealed today that Jon Stanhope and the education minister, Andrew Barr, want to kick out what they call ‘out of area' enrolments. They want to kick students out of schools that they say are out of area. The member for Hume will know that that means children from New South Wales are going to be kicked out, by Labor, of Australian Capital Territory schools. This is outrageous. Labor wants to kick out of school children whose parents want to vote against them at the next election. These parents pay their federal government taxes. In fact, $7½ million of their money has been paid to schools in the ACT, and now Labor wants to kick out their kids. In the Hall Primary School, which is right on the New South Wales border, the federal government, for example, has paid $88,000 for a shade structure for the children in that school, and now Stanhope and Barr want to close down the school. Labor had the gall to launch a website entitled ‘100s of reasons to live in Canberra', and one of the reasons is the 60 schoolsless the schools that they are closing. I can think of two good reasons why you would not want to live in Canberra-Jon Stanhope and Andrew Barr. The members opposite ought to call on the ACT Labor government to save these schools or pay back the money.",107

Mr Speaker, will you give consideration as to whether the publication of a false claim to have received an honour in the gift of the Crown by a member of the House in a document linked to this parliament may be a contempt of the House as an act of deception or as a deliberate misleading of it?

209,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker understanding order 103, I have a question for you. Is it the case that on Tuesday during question time the following people were warned: the members for Sydney, Calwell, Melbourne and O'Connor? Is it the case that yesterday the members for Brisbane, Gorton, everyHotham, Ballarat, Lilley, Swan, Sydney, Blaxland, Hunter and Grayndler were warned and that the members for Brisbane and Lilley were excluded from the chamber understanding order 94(a)? Is it also the case that today the members for Shortland, Fowler, Sydney, Ballarat, Swan, Hunter, Brisbane, Lilley, Grayndler, Perth, Lalor, Jagajaga, Lyons and Cowan were warned and the members for Shortland, Fowler, Sydney, Ballarat, Jagajaga and Lilley were excluded from the chamber?

A Speaker should give a completely objective interpretation of standing orders and precedents, and should give the same reprimand for the same offence whether the Member is of the Government or the Opposition.

223,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a question to you, too. It also goes to the question of consistency and follows from a question I asked earlier this week. Today again you allowed the Leader of the House to rise to speak on a point of order raised by another member-in this case the member for Grayndler. In my view that was a correct interpretation. But in the last sitting week you refused to allow me to rise to speak on a point of order raised by another member, saying that I had no right to do so. I ask you to once again examine the Hansard of the last sitting Thursday-and there were two occasions this week on which that has occurred-and provide to me some explanation of the rationale for the distinction between the treatment of the Leader of the House and my treatment.",110

I have had a look at the transcript of the Hansard for question time yesterday, when the Manager of Opposition Business raised a point of order concerning the conduct of the Leader of the House in relation to standing order 90 and you said ‘There are forms of the House.' My question to you concerns the meaning. Are the ‘forms of the House' you are referring to personal explanations or a request for a withdrawal? I ask this because standing order 90 has been enforced against me by you and by the Deputy Speaker, but I cannot see it being enforced against the Leader of the House or, for that matter, any other government members.",111

235,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The government's industrial relations changes are bad for our economy. The government's extreme and unfair and divisive industrial changes are bad for our economy. They are bad for our workforce, but they are bad for our economy. They are bad for our economy because they are no more, no less than an attack upon wages. An attack upon wages will see nothing more, nothing less than low productivity. This is a straightforward shift from the wages section of the total factor income of the economy to the profit section of the total factor income of the economy. It is all about lowering wages. It is the easy way to a profit, relying upon lower wages and low productivity. There is no requirement, no incentive and no demand to say to the business community: ‘We want good management. We want investment in productive things.' It is another example of the complacency of the Howard government, its massive economic complacency given the benefit of 15 years of continuous economic growth set up largely by the structural reforms of the Hawke-Keating governments, including the introduction of enterprise bargaining and a resources boom to China. The last election was front and centre all about the economy but we heard nothing about these proposals during the last election. The first time we heard about these proposals was when the government realised it had all power in the Senate and pushed through proposals that John Howard has had floating around not just since the nineties but since the eighties and seventies. This is no more or no less than an easy way to move part of the economy from wages to profit with no corresponding productivity or competitiveness gain. Where does that attack come? That attack comes on the minimum wage and that attack comes on conditions and entitlements through the introduction of AWAs under the government's reduced minimum standards taking away the no disadvantage test. Two of the culprits are at the table. The Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources let the cat out of the bag a few months ago when he said, ‘Wouldn't it be terrific if we could have New Zealand wages next week!'-as if somehow you could survive on New Zealand wages in Sydney. Take the logical extension of that view, which is proselytised by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who is at the table-and I will apologise in advance: I cannot stay for any or all of his contribution but I will read the Hansard carefully. The logical extension of the two ministers' views and the policy approach of the government is this: if it is New Zealand wages tomorrow then it is Indonesian, Indian and Chinese wages next week. It is a view which says we can only be internationally competitive if we pull down labour input costs; that is the only way that we can be internationally competitive and that is the only way we can be competitive in the Asia Pacific region against India and China. There is nothing about going to the next level of productivity improvements and investing in infrastructure, skills, research and development-all of the things which have traditionally made us a great trading nation and an attractive place for capital investment. Let us see how the attack on wages goes, firstly through the minimum wage. What do we know? We know that the minimum wage is currently $25,188. We know that, if the government had had its way with its submissions to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission over the last 10 years, the minimum wage would be $60 a week lower, or $2,600 a year worse off. In other words, the minimum wage would not be $25,188; it would be $22,588. If the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry had had its way over the last 10 years through its submissions to the Industrial Relations Commission, the minimum wage would be $95 a week lower, or $4,940 a year worse off. In other words, it would be $20,248. That is the way the minimum wage goes under the government's and the ACCI's submissions. It is a straightforward attempt, which the government is now seeking to make through the back door of the low pay commission, to reduce the minimum wage in real terms. Why is that? Because the government says, ‘If we reduce the minimum wage and reduce wages at the lower end of the spectrum, a couple of things will magically occur. We will become more competitive internationally, we will become more productive and we will create more employment.' The Leader of the Opposition asked a question precisely on that point in question time today. We have in Canberra cleaners who work in the hotel industry who are on the minimum wage. This point was put perfectly clearly by the Leader of the Opposition: if you are a cleaner on the minimum wage cleaning a hotel, the logical extension of the government's approach is that if they reduce the minimum wage that you are on from $25,188 per year to $22,588 a year$2,600 less-a number of things will magically occur. Firstly, the cleaner will become more efficient; secondly, our economy will become more productive; and, thirdly, somehow magically we will have two cleaners to clean the same number of hotel rooms. It is an economic nonsense. The shadow Treasurer made the point that the most recent OECD report, its 2006 Employment Outlook, released overnight, says: No significant direct impact of the level of the minimum wage on unemployment is identified. And that the: ... minimum wage could encourage higher participation by helping to make work pay for the low skilled. There goes your OECD-IMF argument, and I note that the director-general of the IMF, who was here during the week, spoke in glowing terms of the fair and flexible industrial relations system-and I was happy for that endorsement of our approach. The second area of attack on wages comes of course with AWAs and the attack upon conditions and entitlements-the penalty rates, the shift allowances and the leave loadings. We have drawn the parliament's attention to a couple of examples. We have had the Spotlight example. Under the government's minimum standards, the Spotlight AWA knocks off penalty rates, shift allowances, leave loadings and the like for the princely sum of a 2c an hour increase in your pay rates. By the average rule of thumb, you are 90 bucks a week worse off. I just happen to have one of my 2c coins here. Mr Andrews-As they're not unemployed, here it is-$338 better off, Mate!",112
236,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will match your Liberal Party fistful of dollars any day of the week, Sunshine! So we have drawn attention to that, and today in question time we drew attention to the Esselte AWA, where for $1.25 extra per hour you lose all those things and you end up being, on the examples that we gave, $60 or $65 a week worse off and there is no wage increase in that AWA for a three-year period. So it effectively means that, if you are a full-time employee and you work a Saturday shift, you lose 65 bucks a week, or $10,140 over three years, for the princely sum of $1.25 an hour-and I might just happen to have $1.25 here. If you work overtime for two hours and a Saturday shift, you will be 60 bucks a week worse off, or $9,360 worse off over a three year period-double the amount that the ACCI would see the minimum wage reduced by and nearly four times the amount that the government would see the minimum wage reduced by. That is all for the princely sum of $1.25 an hour-and I will not table that money because Mr Liberal Fistful of Dollars might just reach across the table. Knowing the Liberal Party, as I do, if they had the chance they would round the 2c and the $1.25 down. The Prime Minister was presented with not just the Spotlight AWA but the Esselte AWA and he had his attention drawn to the fact that his own government man, the Employment Advocate, said that we had had about 6,200 AWAs signed since the introduction of the government's legislation. We drew attention, as a result of good work in Senate estimates, to the fact that, of the AWAs sampled, 100 per cent excluded at least one protected award condition, 64 per cent removed leave loadings, 63 per cent removed penalty rates, 52 per cent removed shiftwork loadings, 41 per cent did not contain gazetted holidays, 22 per cent did not provide for a pay increase over the life agreement-like this one I have here-and 16 per cent excluded all award conditions and replaced them with government legislated minimum standards. The Prime Minister said that 78 per cent of them will give ‘very significant wage increases'. This followed on from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations who, after the Spotlight AWA was revealed in the parliament a couple of weeks ago, on a Friday morning said that the vast majority of protected award conditions have remained in AWAs since the government's legislation was changed-and three days and three nights later the OEA blew him out of the water. The Prime Minister has no evidence for the claim that there have been ‘very significant wage increases'. If he has any evidence of that, he should produce it for the parliament and for the community. He is also out there asserting that somehow there are significant increases in wages under AWAs rather than collective bargaining. All the studies by Professor Peetz and by Freehillsthe government's hired gun-show that that is not the case. As a result of that, the Leader of the Opposition decided that we would adopt a policy of abolishing AWAs, which just happens to be consistent with our election platform and our public policy. I want to make a couple of remarks about the business reaction to that. Let us very clearly understand what AWAs represent. We have the business community out there, we have the BCA, the Business Council of Australia, who say that their employers represent one million employees; we have ACCI, who say their employers employ four million employees; and we have AiG, who say their employers employ two million employees. So seven million employees from those business groups have expressed their views about our commitment to abolish AWAs. How many AWAs of the do we have? We have 538,000-half a million. So there are half a million AWAs for the seven million employees represented by those organisations. And what do we know from the government's own stats? About 20 per cent of people are on awards; about 40 per cent of people are on enterprise bargains, where the big productivity boosts have come; about 30 per cent of people are on common law contracts, which have been in existence for a long period of time; and anywhere from 2.5 per cent to five per cent are on AWAs. But, if we abolish AWAs, despite the fact we have committed ourselves to flexibility through variations to collective agreements and to an overall advantage approach so far as common law contracts are concerned-despite the fact that we have promised that flexibility-the economy as we know it will crumble if AWAs are abolished. In the face of 15 years of continuous economic growth, set up by the last Labor government, a resources boom to China, a current account deficit of six per cent which has the benefit of record high favourable terms of trade and record high commodity prices, 49 consecutive monthly trade deficits, an infrastructure crisis, a half-trillion dollar eign debt, a collapse in research and development, a collapse in innovation, a collapse in skills, education and training, the single biggest threat to the Western world as we know it is the abolition of a 10-year-old statutory instrument, of which there are about half a million in a workforce of 10.1 million. And guess what? When my friend and state colleague Geoff Gallop said he was going to do the same thing in Western Australia, the business community and the Liberal Party said exactly the same thing. They said: ‘Gallop's in the hands of the unions. The Western Australian economy as we know it will collapse. This is a regressive approach; it is back to the 18th century of employment relations.' Last time. I looked, off the back of 15 years of continuous economic growth and a resources boom to China, Western Australia had 10 per cent growth. But, if we take away an employment instrument that half a million people out of 10 million have, the Western world as we know it will collapse. It is no longer the reds under the beds; it is not having the AWA under the bed. That is the problem. My complaint with Mr Chaney is that the Business Council writes a letter, which it describes as a personal letter to the Leader of the Opposition, which journalists get at the same time or in advance, and says: ‘Unless you do AWAs, everything else you do has no credibility.' I say a couple of things to Mr Chaney publicly and privately. Firstly, Mr Chaney is on record as saying that fairness is not a requirement of industrial relations legislation, that fairness is not a criterion required in the employment relations areaMr Andrews interjecting",113
237,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And you share that view and you endorse that view. The second thing I say to Mr Chaney is that he should say to the Leader of the Opposition forwhat he says in his adverts. When you read the BCA adverts-the ‘four steps' we needis there anything in there that says, ‘But if you don't do these things with AWAs, the Western world, the Western economy and the Australian economy as we know it will crumble'? I say to the business community publicly what I say to them privately: you should focus on this, you should accept our offer of consultation, you should accept our offer of flexibility, you should look at what we are saying-overall advantage and the combination of our approach will ensure ongoing flexibility. And the minister at the table should resolve and resort to having an argument on the facts, not to scurrilous personal slurs against me or the Leader of the Opposition. If he wants to say that we are in the pockets of unions or that we have said this or we have said that, then he is no more and no less than a toady of corporate Australia. If that is the level of debate he wants to have, that is fine, but he should address the facts: the government's attack on the minimum wage, the government's attack on conditions and entitlements, no productivity benefits, complacency about a whole range of economic issues, a massive foreign debt, a massive trade deficit and a massive collapse in exports. But the Western world will collapse if we cannot have a 10-year-old statutory independent contract, which half a million people out of 10 million have. It is an economic, a social and a political nonsense. (Time expired)",115
238,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (3.51 pm)-The problem with the argument advanced by the member for Perth is that it contains a major internal flaw and contradiction. The nub of his argument goes to the mining and resources sector in Western Australia. He says-correctly on this point-that the mining and resources sector in Western Australia is booming and, indeed, that it is a major contributor to the economy in Australia. The essence of his argument is that, therefore, any changes that have been put in place in Australian Workplace Agreements are irrelevant to that booming mining and resources sector of the Australian economy, particularly in Western Australia. This is where there is a major internal flaw and contradiction in his argument. The very same sector of the Australian economy has said over and over again-and this is what Mr Chaney said in his letter, and I will come to it shortly, to the Leader of the Opposition-that part of the reason they are able to thrive and to provide more jobs and higher wages to those employed in that sector is the flexibility that this government has brought about through its workplace relations legislation. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say on one hand, as the opposition wishes to do, that this is a sector which is thriving the way it is, yet say on the other hand that we are going to rip away from that sector one of the very mechanisms which has enabled it to thrive in the way it has. That is the nub of the complaint made not by me but by Mr Chaney, the President of the Business Council of Australia-a body whose members employ some one million Australians. He makes that complaint against the opposition and the foolish decision of the Leader of the Opposition-without consulting, we are told, the member for Perth, the industrial relations spokesman for the opposition; he himself concedes that-to go out to the Labor conference at the weekend and say, ‘I propose, if elected to government, to abolish Australian workplace agreements.' What does Mr Chaney say? These are not my words. These are the words of a man who was the managing director and CEO of Wesfarmers, one of the biggest companies operating in this country, and a man who is regarded by his peers in the business community in Australia as being of sufficient standing to be the leader of the Business Council of Australia. That body has over the years been critical of this side of government, as it has been critical of the other side of government. What did Mr Chaney say in his letter? Let me quote a little bit of Mr Chaney's letter: For the past two years, the BCA has argued for an integrated package of economic reforms that will allow Australia to lock in its current prosperity for the long term. It has consistently argued these reforms cannot be cherry-picked for political purposes, but need to be implemented as a whole. It is for this reason that the BCA has called for, and supported, the most recent reforms to workplace relations. These reforms continue a 20-year process of making Australia's workplaces more flexible and responsive, and the economy more competitive. This reform process, started by previous Labor Governments, has delivered improved living standards and low unemployment. This MPI is about living standards and international competitiveness. Mr Chaney points out that this process of reforming industrial relations, which was, as he alludes to, started by the man that the member for Perth once worked for-namely, Paul Keating, when he was Prime Minister and previously Treasurer of this country-has led to the competitiveness and the prosperity that this country enjoys today. It is obviously of some great offence that the leader of the Business Council of Australia should come out and say this. There was an extraordinary attack on Mr Chaney and the business community in Australia from the member for Perth at his doorstop press conference this morning. Mr Chaney said: ... AWAs have played a significant part in ing productivity, particularly in sectors that critical to Australia's current and future growth, notably mining and resources. Mr Chaney nails the argument that is being advanced by the member for Perth today. As I said, you cannot say on one hand that the Australian economy has been so dependent upon, so boosted by, what has happened in the mining and resource sector, yet say on the other hand that you are going to rip away one of the very processes, one of the very mechanisms, that has enabled that sector of the Australian economy to boom in the way it has. That is what Mr Chaney says in his letter: ... AWAs have played a significant part in ing productivity, particularly in sectors critical to Australia's current and future notably mining and resources. Mr Chaney goes on: The fact is that independent research shows that workplace reform-including the introduction of AWAs-has delivered significant opportunities for Australians. They are the words of a very successful Australian business leader, a man regarded by his peers as being pre-eminent to lead the Business Council of Australia. That is the complaint he makes to the Leader of the Opposition. It is hardly a complaint that deserves the sort of approach we got from the member for Perth this morning, who talked about business being lazy and only looking for an easy way of increasing its profits. That is what he said in his attack in his doorstop this morning. We know why the member for Perth is upset, and that is because he has been repudiated by the Leader of the Opposition. The reality is that, for the last year or so, the member for Perth has been going around the business organisations and the major businesses in Australia trying to rebuild relationships after the disastrous relaimprovtionship the Labor Party under Mark Latham are had with the business community of Australia. That is the reality. The member for Perth has been trying to rebuild that relationship, as have a few others on the other sideknowing the disastrous level it got to under the leadership of Mr Latham, the previous Leader of the Opposition. This is what happened at the weekend. It was unbeknownst to the member for Perth until he was told that the decision of the Leader of the Opposition was a fait accompli. The Leader of the Opposition, ignoring whatever advice he might have had from the member for Perth, went along to the New South Wales Labor conference and there, to improvthe no-doubt populist cheers of the union that are bosses-those who have over the last 10 growth, years donated millions of dollars to the ALP-he said, ‘I'm going to rip up AWAs.' The egg is all over the face of the member for Perth following the announcement made at the weekend by the Leader of the Opposition. What was the reaction to that? The reaction to that from the business community, not just from almost every editorial writer of almost every major newspaper in Australia, was one of complete astonishment. They were getting the nudge, nudge, wink, wink from the member for Perth, who over the last few months and the last year had said to them effectively, ‘Look, we'll keep AWAs.' The Leader of the Opposition said eight months ago: ‘There'll be a million AWAs in place by the next election; you can't just rip up a system that involves that.' So you have the member for Perth, given that sort of lead by the Leader of the Opposition, going around to all the business groups in Australia and then suddenly, out of the blue, last weekend the Leader of the Opposition comes out and says: ‘No, we're not going to keep these AWAs. We're going to rip them up. We're going to remove this system.' That is the reality, and that is part of the reason why we have seen the negative reaction-contrary, I believe, to what the Leader of the Opposition expected-in the media and from the business community this week. And it is not just the Business Council of Australia, although they represent companies that employ something like one-tenth of the workforce in Australia-about one million Australians are employed by BCA companies. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry represent companies and employers that employ about four million Australians. Equally, they have come out in condemnation of this policy from the Leader of the Opposition. And the Australian Industry Group, which represent companies employing something like two million Australians, have condemned this policy backflip by the Leader of the Opposition. The problem with this policy is that it rips away from Australians their entitlements, their wages. It rips away from them the ability to work harder and earn more for their families. Let us take an example: the line workers, the fault workers in Telstra on AWAs. The history of that is there are ordinary, blue-collar Australian workers out there who are earning more on AWAs. Why? Because they have been able to increase their productivity, they get a bonus, which they are paid in return for doing extra work, and the result has been that their take-home pay has considerably increased as a result of being on AWAs. You can multiply these sorts of examples right across the country. The seafood processing works that I went to in Western Australia a little while ago, where something like 80 per cent of the workforce were part-time and casual employeesMr Adams-What do they pay?",116
239,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They were put onto AWAs, and now the vast majority of those workers have a permanent job. What that means for them and their families-and I believe the member for Lyons will be sympathetic to this-is that they have a permanent job. It means that they can go to the bank and get a loan. It means they can do something about a mortgage on a house that they want to buy. It gives them a degree of security which they did not have in the past. In the member for Lyons's own electorate, there is the example of the famous Banjo's Bakehouse in Strahan where AWAs enable workers to be employed not just for six months of the year when the tourists come and then not have a job for the rest of the year; it enables the smoothing out of their employment with different hours in different seasons and different months. It enables those workers to have a permanent job, although with a variation of hours across a period of time. These sorts of examples of the flexibility which is being offered and which has been grasped eagerly by workers in Australia show why we have people using AWAs. But the problem with the Leader of the Opposition and member for Perth is that the rhetoric that we have heard today is no different to the mantra and the rhetoric we have heard for the last 10 years in this place. The sky was going to fall in when the workplace relations changes were made in 1996. We have seen 1.8 million extra jobs in Australia, a 16.8 per cent increase in real wages for Australians over the last decade compared to just a 1.2 per cent increase for the previous 13 years of the Labor government. We have seen something like an extra 315,000 Australians in work, because of being able to drive down the unemployment rate. If we had not made these changes, according to Access Economics-the economic modelling firm of choice for the Australian Labor Party-the unemployment rate in Australia would be closer to eight per cent rather than the 4.9 cent it is today. There are more than 300,000 extra jobs that Australians have today because of these changes. We have seen the IMF and other international organisations saying that the Australian economy is one of the powerhouse economies of the world. I was at the ILO meeting in Geneva last week and had a series of meetings with employment ministers from around the world. One of the most interesting was the meeting with the German employment minister. Germany, of course, still has an unemployment rate of well over 10 per cent-as has France, for that matter. The German employment minister said to me, ‘If we had the unemployment conditions that you've got in Australia, if we had the economy of Australia, it'd be like we're celebrating the World Cup every month, and not just the World Cup that we're celebrating at the present time.' All of this is because of the changes and the economic conditions that this government has overseen over the last 10 years. This was a serious misjudgment on the part of the Leader of the Opposition, and now we have headlines like the one in the Australian today, ‘Beazley another Latham: business'. And why are businesses saying that? Because we had ‘troops home by Christmas' from Mr Latham and we have ‘AWAs out by Christmas' from Mr Beazley. Without consultation with his caucus, without consultation with his shadow minister, without consultation, apparently, with his shadow ministry, he just rolls along to the conference on the weekend and repudiates the policy that had been in place prior to that, and repudiates what he had even said himself prior to this. This is a foolish policy. The reason for it is that the Leader of the Opposition's leadership was being destabilised, in particular by per Unions New South Wales and Mr Robertson and co, who were sending out quite clear messages that they were unimpressed with the way in which the Leader of the Opposition was conducting himself. They pulled him into line. He buckled under, and he changed this policy, because that is what the paymasters in the unions in Australia, which have paid $50 million to the ALP over the last 10 years, wanted with regard to this. The question is where this goes from here, because the long list of union demands goes on and on and on. There is no secret about the other things that the unions want. They want to do things like reimpose the unfair dismissal laws that cost jobs, have compulsory union bargaining fees, have a payroll tax added to businesses in Australia, have mandated good-faith bargaining et cetera. The list goes on and on and on, and the Leader of the Opposition, having buckled under and appeased the unions in the first place, is in a position where they know he is weak, like every other Australian does, and know that he will buckle under to all the other proposals. That will drive Australia backwards. Tony Blair had the courage to stand up to the unions in Great Britain and say, ‘They may not like it, but the real world would be much warmer than the one which they are proposing, because it would be better for the employment prospects and the prosperity of the men and women of Britain.' Unfortunately, and quite regrettably for Australia, the Leader of the Opposition in this country, the Labor leader in this country, does not have the courage of Mr Blair to stand up to this sort of nonsense. (Time expired)",118
240,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The fact is that the Work Choices legislation will fundamentally change this society because it seeks to drive down wages and conditions. It will hurt ordinary Australians. That is the reality that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations decided not to mention. Over the last 15 minutes, he had the opportunity to justify why there have been such fundamental changes to our industrial relations system. So little evidence, so little reason, has been given for such fundamental change to this public policy. The reason the government has failed to give compelling answers to questions about why changes have been made to the industrial relations system is that it knows what we know-this system is about driving wages down and setting up two sets of workers in this country. The lucky ones, unfortunately in the minority, will possibly have good or better wages; but the majority of workers in this country-those without the capacity to bargain individually with their employer and those who do not have a rare set of skills to bargain with in the marketplace and cannot argue that their skills are so scarce as to warrant a sufficient wage increase-will find themselves at the bottom of the heap. That is the situation as a result these changes. The shadow minister made it very clear: there is no nexus between the changes to the industrial relations system that have been sought and gained by this government and productivity improvements. There has been no argument set in place by the government to explain the nexus-the cause and effect of Work Choices. Instead, empirical evidence gives example after example of maltreatment of employees by employers. Since the act came into operation on 27 March this year, a series of agreements has been lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate that will drive down wages of ordinary working Australians. I reiterate the statistics that have been provided by the Office of the Employment Advocate to Senate estimates: 100 per cent exclude at least one protected award condition, 64 per cent remove leave loadings, 63 per cent remove penalty rates, 52 per cent remove shift loadings, 40 per cent remove gazetted public holidays and 19 per cent remove all penalties in awards. This is all by virtue of this new instrument, AWAs. Why is it a new instrument? Taking the no-disadvantage test out of the Workplace Relations Act effectively removes any safety net for ordinary workers. To expect the ordinary worker to negotiate with his or her boss is a complete and utter nonsense. Every worker in this country knows that they cannot go into their boss's office and say, ‘I just want a 10 per cent wage increase.' For that matter, they cannot go into the boss's office and say, ‘I don't want a 10 per cent cut to my existing conditions of employment and my wage rate.' The reason they cannot do that, as we all know in this place and as every employee knows in every workplace in this country, is that the capacity for an employee to individually bargain with his or her employer is nigh on impossible, because the relationship is inherently unequal. Whilst of Labor did not accept some of the changes that occurred in the Workplace Relations Act, the reason why the no-disadvantage test was inserted into the legislation was to enable its passage through the Senate in 1996. You can be assured of this, Mr Deputy Speaker: the government did not want a nodisadvantage test in the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The government had to compromise to get that no-disadvantage test inserted into the Workplace Relations Act 1996. As soon as the government took control of the Senate, they ripped the no-disadvantage test out of the act so that an employee would not have any protection whatsoever in attempting to negotiate an individual agreement with their employer. It is not surprising that, until the operation of this act, only three per cent of the entire workforce of this country were on AWAs. After 10 years in operation, three per cent of the workforce are in receipt of or party to an Australian workplace agreement. I have said this before in this place: how Orwellian is the title Australian workplace agreements? They are not Australian. They are not intrinsic to the way in which Australia has negotiated industrial arrangements since 1901. The fact is that they are alien to the way in which Australians have gone about setting employment conditions in this country. They are certainly not ‘workplace', because they rely upon the vulnerability of an individual employee to be put in a position to have to accept and to cede the changes sought by employers. As we know, only in the rarest of circumstances would they be ‘agreements', because unfortunately they are coercive-so much so that the new act actually expressly says that it is not coercive to force someone to take an AWA if they want a job. It expressly says in a provision of the Work Choices legislation that it is not coercive. It has to expressly say that, because in any other common law understanding of contracts of employment you could not force someone to take an agreement without an offer, without consideration or without acceptance. These things are basic standards of common law that have been taken away by this government because it knows it is putting workers in a situation of duress and it wants to expressly allow that to occur. As someone said to me recently, this is allowing rogue employers to do legally what they have been doing illegally. This effectively ensures that rogue employers who want to act badly are given that imprimatur to treat their employees badly. The worse of it is that they are forcing good employers to consider doing the same. That is a tragedy. Labor knows that the majority of employers do not want to place their workers in unfair situations. Labor understands that most employers want to ensure that their business is operating properly. They want to have a decent relationship with their workforce. In fact, small businesses have a very close relationship with their employees. It is the nature of the business. They know them and they know their families. We spoke to many small businesses on the task force that went around the country. We were told by a number of small businesses that they were concerned about the way in which the legislation would force them to push wages down. They were also concerned about the prescription, the complexity and the confusion that the laws enshrined. Michael Fern, the owner of an engineering company in Gladstone in Queensland, said: Clearly I haven't read all 400 pages and the 800 pages of how to read the legislation or whatever is available. And this isn't unusual because we are inundated with legislation and if I read it all I wouldn't do any work. That does concern me greatly, but I don't really understand the legislation ... Small businesses like mine are the backbone of ... this economy and clearly we can't spend that time to understand all this legislation so who is it helping? Who's gaining out of this? I have no idea ... Every day there's more and more of it and this Work Choices is just another example. Another small business operator in Melbourne, a pharmacist from Mitcham in Deakin, George Liarakos, who we met in the member for Deakin's electorate, said to us about the Work Choices act: To start off with individual agreements, AWAs-the way [the government] are putting the spin on it, it's a great thing, it's about workers' choice. You can actually get rid of unions and bargain for yourself more effectively against an employer. I think that's crap. Do you know why the pharmacist in Mitcham thinks it is utter nonsense? Because he knows that his employees do not have the bargaining capacity to bargain with him fairly. And he told us so. He effectively said that they do not have that capacity. He said: The way I see it, without legal representation ... our accountants, our lawyers ... if we want to draft up something and take advantage of this we could do so easily. The pharmacist in Melbourne said that if they wanted to draft something up and provide it to their employees, they could take advantage of this easily. That is the new system this government has enacted. Taking away the no-disadvantage test and forcing AWAs without any protection whatsoever is denying the right for employees in this country to bargain effectively. The statistics of the Office of the Employment Advocate that were provided to the Senate estimates committee showed that many of the award conditions have been stripped already from those AWA instruments-and there are more to come.

241,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think I am probably more qualified than anyone in this parliament to talk on this particular MPI. Not one of the people opposite has worked in the areas that I have worked in. I started life as a manual cane cutter and a member of the AWU Queensland. One of the problems we have with those opposite is that they are a single species. You have all the union apparatchiks and the shop stewards; you do not have any breadth of thinking whatsoever on the opposition benches. A few of us on this side have got our hands dirty. I could certainly name as examples the member for Grey and, I dare say, the member for Hume and others who have worked out there in the workforce and understand what the workforce is all about. We have had the flexibility to go out and get better wages. In those days we were the vanguard of aspirational Australia, because we wanted to succeed. As I said, I have cut cane by hand. I have also picked up potatoes. I have been a contractor, a farmer and a publican. As a farmer and a publican, I employed people. So I think I know, right across the board, what employment, wages and work are about. I have not seen anyone on the other side who comes near that. The problem is that most of those opposite have never worked in the workforce. They do not know what it is about and they have no understanding of what the workers think. I will give you a particular instance, from my days as a cane cutter. In 1959, we were earning about £100 a fortnight. To put that in perspective, that was five times the award rate. In about 1961 there was a good price in sugar and for some unknown reason the union officials said, ‘We want a productivity loading, because the farmers are making too much money.' They did not come to the cane cutters and ask, ‘Do you want to apply for an increase in your wages?' They just decided that they were going to go out on strike. A number of us said, ‘No. We are not going to do that.' But they took us out anyway for a fortnight for a productivity loading. We lost £100 in that fortnight-one-tenth of the cost of a Holden car in those days. Mr Randall-But you still had to pay your union fees.",122
242,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"But I still had to pay my union fees, of course, even though they took us out and we lost money. The fact is that we got £2 a fortnight productivity loading. Just imagine how long we were going to have to work to make up the £100 we lost. The thing about this legislation is that it does not abolOn ish unions. I just do not understand why the unions are so petrified. I imagine they are petrified because they do not want to get off their butts and work; they do not want to get out there and represent the workers. If the unions represented the workers, the workers would support them. But they do not; they go out there and look after themselves. The union bosses do deals with some of the big business people around the place. We have all heard about some union reps who have big houses with swimming pools-some of them in Sydney. If they were representing the workers they would have no problems because the legislation allows the unions to negotiate on behalf of the workers. The unions are not abolished, so they should be able to get out there and do something if they are prepared to get off their backsides and do believe in unions. I was a member of a union. But I think the unions have caused this themselves because they have lost sight of what they were intended to do-and that was to represent the majority opinion of workers. Let us go through some of these issues. I think some of them need to be talked about. The task force that we just heard about from the member for Gorton went through my electorate. Surprisingly, I had a cockatoo at the meeting. Twelve people turned up-12 people. I also checked up with the member for Richmond to see how many turned up there-11 turned up there. The member for Gorton is here quoting what he heard at the task force. For goodness' sake! If 12 people is representative of the workers of my electorate then I have to say, ‘Pity help us with the government we are going to get from over there.' Let us look at the Spotlight issue. The Prime Minister has said quite often that you always want to look behind the detail of the issues that are raised in this parliament. You always want to look behind the questions. the detail that was raised in this parliament about Spotlight in Coffs Harbour and Mrs Harris being offered an AWA, and the 2c that the member for Perth paraded around with and the 2c that was held up here by the members of the opposition: Mrs Harris did not take up the AWA. It was offered to her. She stayed on the award. She was able to stay on the award, and she stayed on the award. Mrs Harris, of course, is an exschoolteacher who works 15 hours a week at Spotlight and is the union rep. We didn't hear about that, did we? No, we never heard about that in the issues that were brought up. We also heard today about an issueraised, I think, by the member for Perthabout warehouse wages. I think it was in Sydney; I might be wrong on that. Just by chance, a fortnight ago, flying home from it. I Sydney to Lismore, I happened to meet the son of a very good friend of mine who happened to be on the plane. I said to him, ‘What are you doing?' and he said, ‘I'm working in Sydney.' Now, I have nine per cent unemployment in my electorate, and half of them do not want to work. They have said in the papers that they want to continue to surf. This guy had gone out and got a job in a warehouse in Sydney. He was the foreman of the warehouse. And he said to me, ‘You know, we're offering $25 to $30 an hour'-in a warehouse in Sydney-‘and we can't get workers.' Yet out in the mid-west of Sydney there is 10 per cent unemployment. What is the member for Watson doing about that, about people who are only a few kilometres away? Here is the work. It is available. But I dare say he would be like the member for Richmond. When I raised the issue in the papers up in my area about the fact that I have nine per cent unemployment yet employers cannot get workers, she said, ‘You can't force them to work.' That is typical Labor, isn't it? That is typical Labor; there is no doubt about it. Let us talk about another issue that keeps on being referred to and raised by the Labor Party, about the government holding down wages. The Prime Minister has told us that in our period of government wages have increased by 16 per cent, compared to three per cent-or I think it might have been two per cent-under the Labor Party. Let us talk about it. They keep on saying, ‘Of course, if the government's offers'-which I dare say means the employers' offers-‘in the arbitration commission were accepted, then wages would be much lower.' They do not refer to the real issue here. The real issue here is old arbitration commission, which I used to deal with as chairman of the Cane Growers. That is the real issue, because you have these ambit claims put in by the unions that are about 10 or 20 times more than they expect to get. What do you think the bosses are going to do? Do you think they are going to make an offer that is somewhere near it? Of course they are going to put their bid down low, and it is arbitrated in between. That was the way the system worked. And yet they are dishonestly trying to say that this would have been accepted because that was the offer that was made. It was the way the system worked, and that was what was wrong with the system. So let us get rid of that baloney that goes on about that particular issue. I come from an area on the coast. I do not know where these people come from, because quite frankly they do not understand what goes on in business. How do you think we have shops open on a Thursday night, on a Saturday morning and on a Sunday morning if there is not flexibility in the workforce? The flexibility in the workforce is that the bosses and the workers come to an agreement. Many of the workers like the flexibility, I can tell you. In my area, they like the flexibility, because if they work on a Saturday or Sunday morning then they can take two days off through the week if they want to. I can tell you that many of them like to go fishing, to go surfing or to play golf for two days through the week. They take the flexibility because that offer is available to them. This morning we saw some television. I found it very interesting. It showed Greg Combet and Premier Iemma. Greg Combet was saying to the nurses of New South Wales, ‘The federal legislation will reduce your wages 20 per cent,' and Premier Iemma was getting up and supporting him. Who employs the nurses in New South Wales? the Premier Iemma. And he is complaining because he is going to cut their wages 20 per cent. That is what they said they were going to do: cut the wages 20 per cent. They are under a state award. (Time expired)",123
243,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The discussion is now concluded. NA NA BILL 2006 NA AMENDMENT (TRUSTEE BOARD AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006 Assent Message from the Governor General reported informing the House of assent to the bills. NA COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA'S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed.,124
244,The SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Jagajaga has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substirolling tuting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,125
245,Mr RANDALL,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"In this dislocated debate, with the few minutes have left on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill 2006, I would like to say three brief things. One is that these 24 Australian technical colleges will a long way to upskilling the young people of Australia. They will provide them with real, traditional trade skills to go out and earn a good living in the industry and the community that they live in, rather than something fatuous. For example, the current TAFE system is so bureaucratised that teachers in the local TAFEs in my area tell me that there are more teachers and more administrators in the TAFEs than there are students. They tell me that the bureaucracy-that is, the administration-are unbelievable, in that not only do they get paid exorbitant wages and generally end up with a car to go with it but they are unproductive in turning out meaningful trades and skills through the TAFEs. That is why the Australian federal government have had to take over this area. That is why we have had to show leadership in this area. What are the states doing? They are trying to stymie it by slowing it down. One of the ways they tried to slow it down in my state of Western Australia-and, I know, in other states like New South Wales and the Northern Territory as well-is that they fought against the Australian technical colleges providing AWAs as a means of providing job prospects. This held up the whole arrangement for some time. Trying to enforce that, plus the unions making it difficult for these young year 11 and year 12 students to do work experience on construction sites, has held it up. So, when the Labor Party say that there are only four rolled out so far, we are them out in the face of opposition from the state and territory Labor governments, because they do not want to be shown up in this area of training. I conclude, in the few seconds I have left, I by saying that providing flexible funding to allow these colleges to be brought forward and paid for in a timely way would be not only good for the young people of Australia by providing training and apprenticeships but go good for Australian industry as well. I endorse the bill. Debate interrupted. NA",125
246,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Parliamentary Standards",125
247,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, your office is an invidious one. When you are sitting in the chair, I think that it is truly one against 149. But, in talking about parliamentary standards, I do not think that we should be dwelling on the actions that you take from the chair; we should be looking at the way in which members behave within the chamber. I want particularly to look at the events of this week within the chamber and at the way in which the use of the advantage the government has under the standing orders is being abused by those opposite. The headline in this morning's Canberra Times is ‘Abbott drugs slur raises Opposition's anger'. The headline in today's Sydney Morning Herald is ‘Trouble in the House as Abbott the stirrer strikes again'. If we look the dorothy dix question given to the Minister for Health and Ageing yesterday, we get an understanding of what is wrong with this place. As I have said to you before, Mr Speaker, the fact that we have something like nine or 10 standing orders about questionstwo pages of the standing orders-and one standing order, standing order 104, which speaks about the relevance of the answers, shows that it is not a level playing field. There are great advantages for those on the other side, not just because they are the government but because of the way in which the standing orders operate and the use of the standing orders to avoid proper accountability. The question yesterday, which was obviously driven by some focus group or Mark Textor polling, was about drug policy. The only intention of the Minister for Health and Ageing was to accuse the opposition of being soft on drugs. Of course that made the opposition angry, because that is a nonsense. There may be differences in the way we wish to achieve the battle against the drug problem, but to indicate that differing views mean that one side or the other is soft on drugs is a nonsense. Furthermore, in his answer, in supporting the contention that the Leader of the Opposition surrenders to the premiers over heroin injecting rooms, along the way the minister said that the Leader of the Opposition surrendered to the Islamists over Iraq. What sort of answer is that if not provocative? During question time the government, this executive, uses the great advantage that the standing orders give to debate issues and to provide answers which not only put their own case but fit the opposition with the case it believes should fit. In one of these newspaper articles there is a quote of I think an unrecorded interjection from one of my colleagues along the lines of ‘Show some leadership, Hawker'. I have to at say to that colleague of mine in the Labor Party that he is wrong. It is not about the Speaker showing leadership. If it is an action of the Minister for Health and Ageing, there is one person in this chamber who has to show leadership and that is the Prime Minister. This is a Prime Minister who, when elected to that high office, said that he intended to raise the parliamentary standards in this chamber. What has happened? On every criterion, standards continue to drop-the way we have seen question time operate over the last couple of sitting weeks, the lack of answers and responses to committee reports and the lack of answers to questions on notice. Truly, if we were to look at the way in which this government treated the parliament, we would have to say that we are going backwards. There are so many important things that come before this parliament that really need and require ministerial statements. But the attitude is: ‘Oh, no, don't do that; use up a question. Get only one side of the argument. Fit the opposition if it feels right. Use the terminology that the focus groups, Textor and the polling show should be used.' If standards are to be improved in this place, there has to be goodwill-I acknowledge goodwill on both sides-but the last few weeks have shown that the government are not going to do anything to try to improve parliamentary standards. In fact, they are cranking things up because they believe that there is a political advantage in blowing this place up. I do not think that is correct. If they were truly looking at parliamentary standards, they would send to the Procedure Committee a reference to look at question time-to have it as a proper question time instead of one side asking a question and the other side debating the issue. That is wrong, and it needs correcting. (Time expired) Leader of the Opposition",125
248,Dr JENSEN,ADJOURNMENT,"The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, if he ever got into government, should be the minister for wishful thinking. In articles in the Sound Telegraph he demonstrates extreme ignorance on issues relating to energy. It is no wonder his climate change blueprint is long on leftie rhetoric and so short on substance. He states: Only Labor has done the hard work to develop a plan to safeguard Australia's energy future. If this blueprint is evidence of hard work, I understand now why Labor is so bereft of policy and why their policy lurches are based on flawed ideology rather than objective reality. To say that the Leader of the Opposition is ignorant of issues relating to energy, particularly nuclear energy, is putting it lightly. I would be quite happy to engage him in a debate on the issues, but I have no doubt that he would lack the ticker to engage me on the issue. He believes that we should focus on things like solar and wind energy. I agree that they have a minor place in the portfolio, but they are unable to contribute significant amounts to baseload power supplies. If the member for Brand were right, surely you would expect at least one nation on the planet to have a significant baseload power contribution from renewables-and here I am excluding hydro. This is more fanciful stuff from the member for Brand and his supporters, the Greens. One could refer to their attitude as ignorance with prejudice. However, there is one aspect where I agree with the opposition leader. It is the importance of evaluating alternative transport fuel. I, however, believe the ultimate fuel for the transport sector is hydrogen. Hydrogen barely rates a passing mention in his document, and I can understand why. How would the member for Brand propose to generate hydrogen? I have the answer: nuclear reactors are ideal for generating hydrogen using either electrical or thermal processes. The member for Brand also does not understand issues relating to oil from coal or gas-to-liquid technologies. In reality, although the final product is far cleaner burning than normal petroleum, the production of these fuels releases significant amounts of pollutants. Having noted that there are pollution issues related to these technologies, I believe that we need to challenge industry to develop these technologies, especially oil from coal technologies using the FischerTropps process as used by Sasol in South Africa. The Sasol process has been a commercial concern for about 50 years. We should actively investigate using it here, as I believe it is commercially viable. Production of fuel using this process would be around the $US40 to $US50 mark per barrel. Gasto-liquid prices are projected to be lower than this but, as there is very little use of this technology at present, it is difficult to say how realistic they are. Having highlighted these technologies, it is clear that they are merely an interim measure pending the ultimate introduction of hydrogen. Biofuels have been touted by Labor; but, while on the face of it they appear attractive, a choice needs to be made between fuel and food. While Australia has a current abundance of food, it is likely that the price of food will increase quicker than that of biofuels; hence, the availability of a cheap base stock is likely to be very variable and not provide a good basis for stability of supply at a reasonable cost. Given these arguments, as with the case of electricity generation, all fuel sources should be included in the energy portfolio. Given Labor's position statement, however, it is clear that hydrogen is not really on the Leader of the Opposition's radar-and for obvious reasons. The real problem with the opposition leader's view on energy is that he is looking through the blinkers of an ideology gone mad, promising the electorate fairytale promises of a future energy nirvana. The government believes that we have an obligation to the Australian people to analyse the alternatives through the objective lens of reality, which Labor is patently not prepared to do. If the Leader of the Opposition has a genuine desire to be educated on the facts of energy, I am quite happy to discuss these safe, exciting and innovative technologies with him. However, I do not think he will avail himself of this opportunity. This is a leader who simply puts politics before probity. (Time expired) Mr David Hicks",127
249,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"In light of a number of events that have occurred this week, I thought it was important to again rise in the House and speak on David Hicks and Guantanamo Bay. We have learned this week that the United States has denied the British government consular access to David Hicks at Guantanamo Bay. The British government was seeking access so that they could register him as a British zen. We have also learned that the US has suspended all military trials for suspects at the Guantanamo prison camp, where three detainees committed suicide over the weekend. Only 10 of the 460 inmates held as enemy combatants have been formally charged since the camp opened in early 2002 at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Human rights groups said that the suicides showed that the inmates were in a state of despair because of the indefinite nature of their detention. Before the three successful suicides on Saturday, the US military had reported 41 suicide attempts by 25 detainees. Professor Alfred MCCoy gave an interview on the Lateline program this week. He is a Professor of history at the University of Wisconsin and has just written the book A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation from the Cold War to the War on Terror. He says of Guantanamo Bay: Guantanamo is not a conventional military prison. It's an ad hoc laboratory for the perfection of the CIA psychological torture. Guantanamo is a complete construction. It's a system of total psychological torture, designed to break down every detainee contained therein, designed to produce a state of hopelessness and despair that leads, tragically, sadly in this case to suicide. Also of concern is that David Hicks's lawyer has attacked his solitary confinement at Guantanamo Bay. As reported by a news wire, Major Mori said: Hicks was in poor health, showing weight loss and continuing signs of depression ... He also said that his client: ... was put back in solitary three months ago without explanation, confined to a cement room for 22 hours a day. The news wire then states: At one stage, Hicks spend 16 months in isolation at Guantanamo's Camp Echo, half that time in a cell which received no sunlight. citiI condemn what has happened to David Hicks. His continued indefinite detention at Guantanamo Bay and the lack of effort on the part of this government to have him returned to Australia is a national disgrace. You are judged on the way you deal with your citizens. The British managed to have their citizens returned from Guantanamo Bay; Australia has remained silent. Indeed, on 14 June Minister Ellison-who had recently been to the US and had spoken with the Attorney-General-in answering a question from Senator Allison, said he: ... reinforced Australia's earnest desire that Mr Hicks be brought before the military commission as soon as possible. We should realise that the US government has sought to use Guantanamo Bay to create a legal black hole where people can be excluded from the American judicial process and not have the protections of the American constitution. American citizens cannot be dealt with in the way that aliens are dealt with under Guantanamo Bay and under the military commission. It is not allowed, because the American constitution protects them. So Australian citizens are being treated as second-class citizens. Hicks should be given a fair trial. He should be dealt with according to law. As I said in the past in an article I wrote that was published in the Australian: If we are to defeat terrorism, we must uphold the human rights principles our societies hold dear. These include the basic rights of persons held in custody: the right to humane treatment; the right to be informed of the reasons for detention and to be able to challenge the lawfulness of detention; the presumption of innocence; prompt access to and assistance of a lawyer; prompt access to medical assistance; and the ability to communicate with family members. The Geneva conventions afford those protections. They should be the benchmark. Why should we argue for them to be used? Because in the event that Australian citizens or US citizens are captured by the enemy, we would want them treated humanely. The way we are treating people in Guantanamo Bay leaves it open for our citizens, if ever they are detained or captured, to be treated in an undignified way. Human rights demand decent treatment of captured troops and captured citizens. (Time expired) Deakin Electorate: Roads",128
250,Mr BARRESI,ADJOURNMENT,"In the 10 years that I have been in this parliament, those members who have been here with me would have heard me speak about the infamous Scoresby Freeway on many occasions. The Scoresby Freeway is now known as the EastLink tollway. The spectre of the EastLink tollway emerged again last week. We all know that a home is the most important and valuable asset a person is likely to possess in their lifetime, often working for years to pay it off, raising a family in it and filling it with precious memories. Therefore, a home is a very precious and important asset to all of us but not, it seems, to the Victorian Bracks Labor government. The sheer arrogance and incompetence of the Bracks government has seen the lives of residents at Hillcrest Avenue in Ringwood turned completely upside down. The construction of the EastLink tollway next to their street has needlessly become a nightmare. Last week, I met with the residents of Hillcrest Avenue, residents who do not oppose the construction of the road itself. On the contrary, they are willing to put up with the noise, the dust, the mud and the disruption to their daily lives that the construction of EastLink has caused. What these residents are not willing to put up with is the construction of a series of large-scale maintenance buildings directly opposite their homes. These giant sheds have now been labelled the ‘Taj Mahal' by local residents, and that is exactly what they areenormous permanent structures that will be used to house heavy equipment. This ‘Taj Mahal' was constructed without any genuine consultation with residents. They believe they have been misled, and that is why this has turned into such a disaster. Initially, local residents had been promised that the site would be parkland. They were shown promotional material identifying it this way. Then they were told that this promised parkland would be used to house a shed and that this shed would rise only marginally above the residential fence height and, furthermore, that it would be down the road, not opposite their homes. Even though the local residents would lose their parkland, they accepted this decision. They were keen to work with and not against ConnectEast, the company building the tollway. And how did ConnectEast and the Bracks government respond? They responded with total contempt for the soon to be neighbours. They extended the height of the building to well above fence height and moved its location. In fact, it rises so high as to completely the views from the local homes of the area around them. I note in this week's Maroondah Journal that a Ms Mary Baker, a spokesperson for ConnectEast, claimed that there were once houses on the building site that would have previously blocked views. This is a blatant misstatement of the facts. ConnectEast knows full well that the houses on that site did not rise to the same height as these giant structures. I feel especially sorry for local residents Alan and Rona Miller, who have lived on Hillcrest Avenue for 58 years. For 58 years they have enjoyed looking out their front window onto the Dandenong Ranges. Now, thanks to ConnectEast and the Bracks government, they feel that they have no choice but to leave their home. After talking to real estate agents, the Millers have been told that their property could be devalued by as much as $60,000. This is a travesty for old people and for young people who have moved into the area to make a home for themselves and their families. Mr Miller and his elderly wife should not be expected to face a financial blow like this. All of this could have easily been avoided if the Bracks government and ConnectEast had taken the time to sit down with local residents and consult with them in a genuine way. The building site could easily have been excavated. This would have eliminated the need for the concern that we have today. The only practical option now availablebecause you cannot tear down this ‘Taj Mahal'-is for the Bracks government to enter into serious financial compensation for the residents of Ringwood who are affected. The failure to consult also raises issues of accountability. Where was SEITA, the Southern and Eastern Integrated Transport Authority, whose role it is to keep the comblock munity informed? Where was the community advisory forum and local Maroondah Councillor Tony Dibb, whose job it is to provide feedback and advice to the project team at ConnectEast and to also keep local residents informed? Where were the state Labor members for Mitcham and Bayswater, Tony Robinson and Peter Lockwood, to stand up to Batchelor and Bracks for these residents' quality of life? Tony Dibb, SEITA, Robinson and Lockwood have completely failed the people of Hillcrest Avenue. Local residents have been misled, their property values have been slashed and the amenity of their homes has been permanently damaged. I call on Councillor Dibb, as our local member on the community advisory forum, to start taking his job seriously. He is dealing with people's lives and must now act urgently. (Time expired) Guantanamo Bay",129
251,Mr GARRETT,ADJOURNMENT,"It has been a week where the consciences of government members in this parliament have been challenged-challenged because our opportunity to participate in full and extensive debate, which is the hallmark of a democracy, has been curtailed by the use of the gag; challenged because the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006, which clearly concerned some members opposite, was withdrawn; and challenged because the government continues to resist repeated calls made, including calls made in a motion in the Senate this week, for Guantanamo Bay to be closed. I support the remarks of my colleague the member for Banks. I want to say that Guantanamo Bay is a prison of shame and that it is to Australia's great shame that, as a government, we continue to participate in the operation of that prison. Revelations this week that three inmates at Guantanamo Bay had committed suicide is again confirmation that the conditions experienced by those who are held there are in breach of basic human rights, of the basic principles of our legal and democratic system and of the rule of law. Not one of those three who committed suicide had been charged. And no argument need come from this government, including the Attorney-General, that to question the conditions and the inhumane periods of detention is to countenance terrorism. It is a false argument, it is a false imputation and it does them no favour. The fact is that Guantanamo Bay is a prison camp that is a discredit to American democratic traditions as much as it is to our own. Incidentally, it is such a discredit to the American political and democratic traditions that it is not located in the United States. But even more so, it is a discredit to our democratic traditions because we, alone amongst countries, continue to acquiesce to the conduct that goes on in this prison. The United Kingdom Attorney-General stated it clearly: ... the existence of Guantanamo Bay remains unacceptable. It is time, in my view, that it close. The United Kingdom Attorney-General had already determined that the military commission set up to try the detainees would not guarantee a fair trial. That point has been emphasised by a number of leading human rights lawyers and journalists here in Australia as well. British detainees were subsequently returned to the UK, but in the case of an Australian citizen, the Australian government was mute. It is to the discredit of this Attorney General that he, as first law officer of the Crown, is so indifferent to the fundamental principles he is charged with protecting that the aberration of Guantanamo Bay continues without a murmur from him or any minister in the government. The best the justice minister can come up with is that he wants to get the military commission to consider the Hicks case. But recent events, including the suicides, mean the case is delayed. Hicks's attempts to become a British citizen have been stymied and the Pentagon itself blocks the access of British consular officials attempting to reach Hicks in prison, notwithstanding the links between those two countries. The debate rages in the US, Europe and afar over Guantanamo Bay, and calls for its closure are repeatedly heard. Yet the government says and does nothing. The government's absence and silence on Guantanamo Bay shows the extent of its capture by the hardline neocon elements of the US government. That is clear. The foreign minister was on television this week assuring Australians that the conditions Mr Hicks was experiencing were acceptable. An Australian consular official was cited by both the Prime Minister and the foreign minister as saying that, in their words, ‘the visit was positive'. I would like to see a report from the consular official should on Mr Hicks's state of health. But at the same time as these comments were put through, Mr Hicks's legal adviser, the American, Major Mori, was saying clearly that Hicks was in poor health: No, David is in isolation. He is not fit and wellhe is depressed. Who are we to believe-the foreign minister running his line or Mr Hicks's American lawyer? Whatever the circumstances or past activities of any inmate in this institution, they should not be subject to long periods of indefinite detention or the possibility of suffering subtle and continual psychological torture. It is a mark of a civilised and humane society that it treats prisoners, any prisoners, in such a way so as not to deny them basic rights. It is a mark of politicians that they stand and argue for those rights, wherever they are being impeded upon. The Howard government, the foreign minister and the Attorney-General are failing us terribly on both of these counts. Do Not Call Register Legislation",130
252,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this afternoon in the adjournment debate to speak about the Do Not Call Register Bill, debate on which finished in the House just prior to question time. In my opinion this legislation could not be passed soon enough. The current system whereby people can register with the Australian Direct Marketing Association, or ADMA, only stops businesses calling if they are also registered with the ADMA. Unsolicited and unwanted phone calls have long been a problem for many households across the country. I am sure many members have had complaints to their electorate offices about these unsolicited calls from telemarketers. By providing Australian phone users with the right to opt out of receiving these calls, we will be providing benefits to consumers and businesses alike. The benefits for consumers are that they will not be interrupted, and scandalously interrupted at times, such as when the family is sitting down to have a meal-a very important time in any family when they are able to communicate with each other. It is an opportunity for to talk about the day's events or perhaps what they may be doing in the future. Or there may be a time when a mother is bathing her child and the phone rings. Obviously this leads to safety issues for the child and the mother. Another benefit for consumers will be peace of mind that they will not be deceived by fraudulent telemarketers. There have been many cases in my electorate where people, particularly the elderly, are called and are led to believe they are speaking to their current phone provider. I have had many complaints about this. They agree to switch ‘plans' with their current provider, when it is in fact a devious move to switch providers, not plans. Unscrupulous telemarketers prey on the innocence of so many wonderful older people-and not just older people. We are dealing with people who have been professionally trained in telemarketing. They are professional and they have deceived many innocent people. Many elderly and disabled people, who make up a considerable percentage of my constituents, may find it difficult or a hindrance to get to the ringing phone from time to time, only to find at the end of that phone a telemarketer trying to sell something. This rush or scramble to get to the phone before it stops ringing may cause accidents. The other group of people who would be interrupted by telemarketing calls are shiftworkers trying to sleep during the day. They might be people who work in mines, nurses, security people and guards who work at night, or police and other shiftworkers who have to sleep by day and work by night. Some cannot disconnect the phone, because in many cases they may be called to an emergency, so they have to leave their phones active. These people do not need to be woken from their valuable sleep to listen the family to a nuisance phone call. For businesses there are many benefits as well. It is going to increase efficiency because they will have access to a more targeted list of people. Time will not be wasted calling people who are simply not interested in their products. The passage of this bill will also bring benefits to businesses who want to legitimately utilise telemarketing. They will have a list of people who are interested in receiving calls from telemarketers. A recent newsletter I sent to my constituents included a brief mention of the register which was operating with the ADMA. My offices in Dalby, Warwick and Emerald were bombarded with people calling to get more information about how to sign up to that register. This overwhelming response is proof that a legislated register is long overdue.",132
