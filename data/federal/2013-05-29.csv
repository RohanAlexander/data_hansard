In fact, there has this place in the last few years, with the cooperation cases, debates being truncated and no real opportunity So often there have been reams of new regulations, running through this parliament, against the one in, one out pledge. Last Friday I did my 133rd boardroom since most consistent and overwhelming concern raised Australia, from all sectors, is the choking discouragement to risk and investment. This number of sovereign risk issues with rule changes a weight of regulation and reporting requirements responsibility and are excessive in the extreme. contractors, telecommunications, aged care, they overregulated it. It has happened in Labor's term of office. ComLaw register figures show new items of regulation. By comparison, it were redundant items that have no material against a promise of one in, one out.

This stocktake bill, being the seventh since up the statute book by repealing legislation that 84 old annual appropriations acts, as has been The current appropriations bills are being stocktake bill was passed in 2012 and then, current stocktake bill is not a controversial bill housekeeping. I will run through the bill and bill. Again, I suggest this government would government slashing of red tape and the bureaucratic redundant. The stocktake bill does not appropriate any acts. The amounts appropriated by the old annual money has already been exhausted or lapsed reappropriation with all the current expenditure forecast. The stocktake bill also facilitates case connected to the old annual appropriations acts.

It can hardly deregulation agenda to remove some appropriations years ago.

This bill does not make regulatory burden on business as suggested in be described as a feature of a meaningful acts that applied over three years some 20 of the things we are tidying up. This bill serves to honour its key commitment on deregulation. to honour its so-called 'one-in, one-out' be the champion of deregulation. You heard the making the comment that 21,000 new pieces of out. There was a commitment to repeal one piece introduced. I thought we were going to see that was going to improve the productivity or of Labor leadership. Yet despite a frantic supports any easing for the business sector. This commitment to repeal one piece of red tape added to in any significant way through this Library figures drawn from the ComLaw register, new items, as I mentioned earlier on. This commitment of one in and one out. I want to go now to a part of the explanatory Court comments. It says: The High Court has emphasised that Appropriation importantly, impose any duties. But the more important thing that I want to bring are going to be repealed. This schedule ensure 1999-2000 to 2009-10 inclusive. They are still old appropriation acts comprising of 28 government, 28 old acts for other ordinary services, departments and 13 acts in relation to supplementary that mean?

I will give you another example. the federal government to provide some financial overseas. That was our contribution. Again, legislation, an act that was enabled, but the not want to be nasty-unfair for the government these acts is a cutting of red tape for business. number of water entitlements acts. of regulation for each piece introduced is not legislation. According to the Parliamentary the government has introduced over 21,000 is at complete odds with Labor's original memorandum which speaks about some High Acts do not create rights and nor do they, to the room's attention is the actual acts that seeks to repeal 84 old appropriation acts from on the statute book. The bill would repeal 84 old acts on the ordinary annual service of 15 acts for the operation of parliamentary estimates appropriations. What does all have appropriations bills 1 and 2.

22,Mr ROBERT,BILLS," I rise to and associated appropriation bills. I think it Labor's financial and budget management at does nothing for Australian families to deal improve services. It delivers more debt, it delivers it has greater taxes and there is more uncertainty. This is now six years-this is the sixth associated spin that the Labor Party puts on a stable and a competent government, and this will breach the $300 billion ceiling within the in five years and there are two more deficits history have all been on this Treasurer's watch. There is no credible path to surplus. Even time is based on carbon price assumptions that will be $25 a tonne in 2017-18, though it is five bucks. So a 500 per cent increase is surplus. The member for North Sydney was Wayne Swan, will never deliver a surplus. delivered one since 1989, since the member deliver a surplus, and we are kidding ourselves family payments have been scrapped, there is million of spending on government advertising. commitment on government advertising, Last year the Treasurer forecast an underlying deliver?

The budget with the rising cost of living. It does nothing to more deficit, it has more broken promises, budget I have spoken on-of chaos, debt and the it. Australians have had a gutful and they deserve budget has failed. It delivers a gross debt that forward estimates. This is its fifth record deficit to come. Indeed, the nation's largest deficits in Labor's much promised surplus in three years are patently ridiculous-that the carbon price linked to the European scheme, which is currently how this government is hoping to get back into right: the member for Lilley, the Treasurer, Labor will never deliver a surplus. It has not for Longman, Wyatt Roy, was born. It will not to think it may. Tax cuts have been scrapped, $25 billion in higher taxes and there is $100 The hubris, considering the 2007 election is something to truly behold. surplus of $1.5 billion, and what did he year, 2013-14, a deficit of $18 billion is deficit. It simply cannot be believed. Their is simply and utterly farcical. With gross debt and borrowings at almost $50 million a day, it is tired of the mismanagement of this government. the situation is parlous because revenues have case-and it is not, but if it were-with a $19.4 The issue is not that revenues have collapsed. The Revenue in 2013-14 is $80 billion more than it was in the last year of the coalition is that the spending is $120 billion more. The had a $20 billion surplus. This government is is not revenue-$80 billion more revenue. poorly targeted spending, poorly outlined money that frankly it does not have. Spending the last two years of the coalition government, revenue problem; it is a spending problem. The government is not proceeding with budget, worth $2.5 billion. Its promised tax cuts under Keating that were l-a-w law-I supposed to share the benefits of the boom, yet Christendom has raised literally nothing. 13 have been cancelled. The blow-out in our billion since the last budget, with costs government found a solution and created a people who have come without a visa-have sugar on the table. And of course the cost of driven in many cases. It is a legacy that the nation is ashamed of. If we look in my area, defence, the story billion to defence next financial year, which $24.482 billion. You will forgive me if I go, 'This is great for defence.' No, you have vaunted phrase that Labor would guarantee That they would guarantee two per cent of GDP? All gone. There are modest, at best, increases to million to the acquisition budget, and the sustainment 2012-13 to $5.63 billion in 2013-14, an increase acquisition and sustainment, the government rise by $1 billion for acquisition and Yet prior to this budget, prior to this government, as a statement of fact, has cut five years. I expect that number may increase his much-anticipated, indeed relied upon, calculations, the cuts that this Labor government billion. It is staggering to think that our national This financial year we are in now has the lowest 1938, since pre-war, at 1.56 per cent of GDP. funding remains relatively flat, with funding a major theme in Labor's budget, can I just say. Defence is now in a position where much units and formations are receiving cuts of up enough days to make the minimum mandatory government-a fact beyond dispute. The problem last budget of the coalition government actually delivering almost a $20 billion deficit. The issue The issue is the government's poor spendingspending. The government cannot stop spending as a percentage of GDP remains higher than in as it has every year under Labor. It is not a family tax benefit A, which it announced in the cuts have been abolished, reminiscent of the tax think we all remember that.

Over 40,000 illegal entrants-that is, arrived because this government has put the living, which is killing families, is carbon tax is not proud of. It is a legacy that the nation is no better. The budget committed $25.434 is an increase in CPI of 2.25 per cent, up from do not share the enthusiasm of commentators who just kept it at CPI.

What has happened in real terms That is the problem with this government: they are struggling to live within their means. The surpluses-structural surpluses are when surplus-to structural deficits: deficit, deficit, head around how big these deficits have been. Since From 1929 to 1932 we had the Great Depression, six deficits that we have incurred have been time. The Labor Party will try to blame the GFC. 'It's too high.' Do you know that there were has been at $1.20 against the US dollar, much And yet we have businesses today going broke deficits-the biggest deficit, the second-biggest deficit and the fifth-biggest deficit, not their fault. This government is not dishonest. It is not their fault, they claim. They say it came out and said, 'There's been a $7.5 billion Treasurer, you believe him. He is not dishonest. Minister trotted out and said: 'Wayne's wrong. write-down. Because of the economic fallout ago'-this is three days after the previous now $12 billion.' They are not dishonest. Then, for Finance and Deregulation, trotted out and The Treasurer was wrong. Treasury was wrong. everybody else's fault. This government is not dishonest. Was this an isolated incident? If it were, it history of the government's ability to run the books. these blokes have made a mistake, you could look at last year's forecasts. The easiest way to look at the integrity go back four years and see what was budgeted real figures today. That was not an isolated those record high ones I spoke about, was $44 forecast that there was going to be an $8-billion the revised MYEFO figures forecast it was going should be able to pull it up there 12 months forecast a $6-billion and they delivered a $44 to see a track record emerging from the incompetence dealing with the nation's finances? It would appear at face value if you look continually out by about $20 billion. Just think think we too easily go from using the word 'million' the tongue. I really challenge you to stop and trajectory that we are on at the moment government in adopting the word 'trillion'. We left money in the bank. Our gross debt That was our capped rate.

I remind you of the integrity of those fiscal budget. Who will ever forget 'come hell very words uttered by our Treasurer. Just in is a revenue thing. I remember when the Treasurer write-down in our revenue.' As he is the Then a couple of days later the Prime It's not $7.5 billion. It's actually a $12 billion from the global financial crisis, five years announcement-'our numbers have changed. It's a week after that, Senator Wong, the Minister said: 'No, no. The Prime Minister was wrong. The write-down now is $17 billion.' It is could be forgiven as just a really ugly part of the I thought, 'If it were just the first time that let them get away with it.' So I went and had a of the four-year forecasts from a government is to for four years ago and measure it against the incident. Last year's deficit, which was one of billion. Two years prior to that the government deficit in the budget papers. Six months later to be a deficit of $22 billion. They said, 'We out.' The MYEFO, six months from the budget, billion deficit. Am I the only one that is starting of this government when it comes to at a graph how far these guys are out. They are what that money could buy. As a parliament, I to using the word 'billion'. It just rolls off think what $20 billion can buy. I hope on the that we do not make the same mistake as the or credit card limit in 2008 was $75 billion.

The real problem is Labor came to power in November 2007. That or 25 per cent in real terms. Profligate spending use of taxpayers' funds has become ingrained. The Saying that the government has a revenue a spendthrift and regularly maxes out his credit like any spendthrift, has a spending problem; in Little wonder that almost a quarter of a century delivered by Paul Keating in 1989-90 before the left in and that we will inherit if the people of in September is far from being a proud It is a shameful legacy for the current Treasurer with the most favourable terms of trade in our in those years including the five largest recent weeks-and particularly since Treasury and their respective opinions regarding the balance-there has been a lot of finger-pointing to the current state of the budget. By the of the budget once the effects of the economic benefits when the cycle slows or the offsetting are rapid-are abstracted away and other in capital gains tax collections or the of 2009-are also removed. the Howard government enjoyed the wisdom of none of us, and had known then what we know now and their impact on revenues, no doubt it would office than the already prodigious public sector Of course, in that world of perfect hindsight, five years and see what the future held, no doubt the many voices calling for the Howard have been similarly converted to thrift.

The Howard government addressed these concerns of wild swings in the economy, the high interest taking government, and the credit squeezes features. In fact, as the Leader of the The last Coalition government grew GDP per person government it's limped along at well under 1 per cent.

It would the future. Remarkably, in Australia's history on the regions. We have never seen a regional our own blueprint for the future. Asian century-which depends very heavily on but it never actually makes it clear how facing regional Australia in order to fully paper. We need to ask questions-and answer the questions-about how we are going to meet the future. What can the federal government do potential? Are we ever going to get serious driving growth in our regional communities delivering better services in our towns and our size-fits-all approach and give regional towns actually work in their own communities? It is in our regional centres to make the right decisions experts. We need to invest in the leadership people achieve their full potential and communities where they were born, where they their future-not be forced to travel away prefer to live and work outside our major capitals. There is a great news story to be told about in the media are about floods, about droughts, grim news. We need to get better at selling which exist throughout regional Australia, the paths which exist for many young people-way to achieve in a metropolitan environment. In an era when we have a constant debate poor parents in the big cities trying to juggle care, trying to excel in their chosen career and to get to work on congested roads and visiting dark, we have a very positive story to tell quality of life, and it is about the work-life natural beauty of our extraordinary environment. world-class health services and education services would surprise many people in metropolitan crime. We can also boast of the housing affordability One of the great things about regional life having a sense that you belong to something part of life through volunteering and other activities. professional opportunities which are often what is available to them in a non-metropolitan amount of diversity, responsibility and opportunities centres that it is sometimes staggering for me professions in regional Australia. As regional Australians, we need to get better to industry and commerce throughout Australia welcoming to newcomers from all walks of life. governments also need to lift their game in that Australia white paper. We need to build the infrastructure and the key services skills and infrastructure challenges of the to help our regional towns achieve their full about relieving congestion in our major cities by through strategic infrastructure upgrades and provincial centres? Will we ever drop the onethe flexibility to deliver service models that about time we trusted the people on the ground for their community.

Too often the stories we see about fires, about population loss and other the story about the extraordinary opportunities lifestyle advantages we can offer and the career beyond the experience they could ever hope about the work-life balance, where we have timejobs, trying to do the double drop-off to child also be the wonder parents of the year, battling parks where they dare not walk alone after about regional Australia. That story is about the balance that we can offer. It is also about the It is about the access, in many cases, to in larger regional centres, which I think environments.

There is such an incredible for rapid promotion in our regional to believe that we have a skill shortage in many at selling that message. We need to explain that we are open for business and we are We have a job ahead of us in that regard. But respect, and I think it starts with a regional case for further strategic investment in critical to drive growth in our regional areas. This week I met with the Regional Cities report which is titled Implications of population regional cities. It makes pretty much the same infrastructure in regional areas to help support metropolitan areas makes sense at every environmentally. I know I do not need to tell regional provincial centre, and you understand growth we have already experienced in regions continue into the future. But, with the right and with the right policy framework, I believe in our nation's future. We need the bold nation-building initiatives has been talked about for decades, but we are improvements it can deliver to our nation. Our local councils throughout Australia are struggling costs, let alone having the capacity to invest rural areas, while basic community services in from state to state and can be a limitation when We still have some of the really simple things have a policy from the current government I believe that a regional Australia white would provide greater focus and would build stands as the collaborative approach Commonwealth. We need to take a whole-of-government business case for that strategic investment facilities and services while also examining the investment. When I talk about infrastructure investment, bridges, ports and rail-the really heavy infrastructure economic growth. There needs to be a greater infrastructure: the swimming pools, the walking other recreational facilities that contribute significantly that complete package of life in rural and regional our tourism sector. Governments are already pouring an enormous our capital cities-the stadiums, the art galleries, that a proportionate amount of public spending communities? At the moment, many of our major would argue that adding a few more lanes many of our regional centres could actually quality of life for many of the residents. Today people sitting in traffic.

By my reading, that is fewer jobs is already higher unemployment, this is intolerable. Last year the Treasurer said in his budget surpluses'. This year he has delivered a $19.4 billion for 2013-14. Labor promised no carbon record deficits, and in this budget we witness much of the so-called modelling in this budget Australia, and the assumptions and commitments relying on the money tax to prop up its bottom favourable terms of trade and royalties not an entirely implausible and untested proposition. of prescribed savings, but of those savings, $25 cent of the deemed savings as new or increased will grow to be $35 million a day and the debt that should have been written in pencil.

Two weeks ago we witnessed this government's chamber about what that budget delivered for five years and at least two more deficits to billion-debt ceiling within forward estimates; apparent credible path back to surplus; more and family payments; more than $25 billion in $100 million spending on government advertising; million.

I have consistently raised these issues in this tenure which is not far away now. First of all I would like to raise concerns business sector, particularly the mining industry. many of you are aware, is one of the largest across Australia and one I have been immensely many commentators mentioned during the budget election budget. This government has made cuts to get Australia back on track and back in and changes that do not support ordinary Australians Labor government needs.

This is an issue very important Even though my federal WA colleagues that this is an important issue, their state GST return could fall to 42 per cent is just GST was structured I do not think anybody had they are currently falling to.

So many people who would have have sold their sheep and gone into cattle sheep flocks in the central western Queensland on the population of those towns? When you go I am sure that the member for Kennedy would towns. You lose their families whose children fewer teachers.

Of course, it is right speaks on these bills focuses, to a large extent, government tells the nation its priorities and its competence and on its priorities. In this debate and if we could go back to that moment some cases announcing, that they had achieved current Treasurer's budgets, they all have grand promises that are always followed by incompetent government. The Australian people last five or six years. In my contribution I want to look at this and the only indication of their future capability. the opposition they had returned the budget believe that a Treasurer who had missed miraculously take a budget deficit of some $40 fact, together with the Prime Minister, the budget to surplus this year. As it got closer that the Treasurer was going to miss his target As a corollary, for those opposite who spoke occurred this year, that will not occur next year it will be near balance the year from my area, such as me, and going north. This is nearly $1 billion worth of work. I of my electorate that the federal government give money for main roads. So, unfortunately, million for part of the National Highway, which We deeply appreciate that money, which to a vanishing race, but in Australia we are years time, there will be more deaths than births start to eliminate ourselves from the gene pool. both did a lot of good work in coming to grips from that position. It was divulged this in Australia. If you want to be $1 million A lot of our young people say, 'Oh, jeez, we can't put it off and put it off.

With a budget the the public in turn can judge it on its capacity, on very Federation Chamber last year we had this in time we had those opposite pledging, and in a budget surplus. As I reflect on each of our one underlying theme: with each budget there are broken promises, nasty surprises and, frankly, have been paying the price for that over the government's track record, because it is the best Last year we had those in government telling to surplus. The Australian public were meant to each of his previous budget targets would billion and return it to surplus in one year. In Treasurer pledged on 500 occasions to return the to the budget and even as it became more obvious by a long way they kept making that pledge. last year on the budget surplus that has not or the year after. If you believe the Treasurer after that and then a small surplus. The Australian people have seen this Treasurer's for meeting targets. What they see is a government then spends the rest of the year working out also spoke on the budget last year also spoke budget. They spoke of the importance of an billion. That was in all of their newsletters with hand on heart in last year's budget was were also abolished. The mining tax which was course, only delivered a fraction of what Labor while. The Australian public-who has seen by this Treasurer and this government is a government in the days, weeks and months ahead. state of the budget; that has deteriorated year gross debt limit increase from $75 billion increased this debt limit, he has said that he would never reach the cap. Now it is obvious it will be necessary for him to again seek to Treasurer-I think, a year or two ago, there cannot believe that there are any of those benches who honestly believe in the competence Treasurer-each year, they have seen I could run through how much he has missed before in similar debates. But I want to talk cost of this incompetence. Our net government the gross level of debt-which has escalated From a Treasurer who inherited $45 billion turnaround. And with that debt comes an interest-servicing servicing cost. It is basically $7 to $8 billion debt figure. That is just to keep the debt. It is keep it. The price Australians pay is the price with that amount of money every single year, one way to pay that debt down and that is with Of course, the Treasurer has never delivered The Treasurer would have us believe that revenue. Nothing could be further from the point. six per cent. It is way up, of course, when you years. The Treasurer's problem is not that problem is that he has so overestimated what spent the money-that when the increase did a fall in revenue. It is a bit like a family assumption that at the end of the year they will assumption spending every single cent of it. Then the problem arises not that they get something a bit smaller. The best example of this, track record. They have seen his capacity that makes a promise on budget night and how to break that promise. Those opposite who about a number of commitments that were in the increase to Family Tax Benefit A, worth $2.5 and in all of their speeches. That promise pledged broken in this year's budget. Promised tax cuts supposed to share the benefits of the boom, of claimed. I will come back to that in a short this track record-knows that any promise made promise that will surely be broken by this Labor We have looked at the deterioration in the after year with this Treasurer. We have seen the up to $300 billion. Each time the Treasurer has would not have to increase it further and that he that he will breach that $300 billion cap and that increase it. For those opposite who listen to their were some that believed their Treasurer, but I in the government and on the government back of this Treasurer or the honesty of this the results of his budget promises. on each budget projection. I have done that about the cost of these broken promises and the debt-let me be generous; I have referred to to projections up towards $170 or $180 billion. in cash in the bank, this is a monumental cost-a significant interesta year-$21 million a day. And that is on the net not to pay a dollar of the debt off; it is just to of the services that could have been delivered and the cost of paying that down. There is only a budget surplus, which would be a repayment. a budget surplus and never will. this is all because he has had a collapse in Revenue is up this year. It is up by about look at the figures going back over the last few he has had a decline in revenue; the Treasurer's he saw to be the increase in revenue-and then not turn out to be so much, he claims he has had sitting down to do an annual budget and making the get a $30,000 bonus, and on the basis of that no bonus but that the bonus is not $30,000; it is if you want to go to the detail in the budget papers, is the mining tax, which was going to basis of the projection by the Treasurer, that fact, as we famously discovered, the mining tax its first six months. You would have thought If you look at the budget figures where he has miraculously there is the projection that revenue out years, coincidentally at the time he says surplus. This government does not have a revenue small businesses in the Yarra Valley and in the government's incompetence and irresponsibility government in Canberra spreads a lack of confidence be in my electorate or in the electorates Treasurer and this government's approach to years they know that not a word that is pledged surprises around the corner. This set of appropriation bills following for those opposite to reflect on the promises budget. As they start to talk to their electorates done in the past. They should think about Australian people are not going to be lectured this opposition are not going to be lectured up to the election about what they will deliver promise made to families-like the schoolkids which they are promising hand on heart-I say as the promise they made on family tax A in schoolkids bonus is the same as what has promised with such fanfare last year. On these appropriation bills the government better. What Australia desperately needs is needs a new Treasurer delivering the budget deliver a responsible budget, a budget of integrity, economic problems. That is what we want",289

(Time expired) to speak on the latest artwork the Treasurer final budget. When the Treasurer stood up in he should have had a top hat, complete with white gloves, a pigeon cage and the box and saw the greatest work the Treasurer has done and an art of illusion. Just like we had last year, we when it comes to this budget. And this budget budget, because the illusion can only last so what is going on. I think the smoke has already miles away from this budget. It has been a Last year's wafer-thin surplus promise, re-promised and re-announced, with the Prime gone before the Treasurer even finished his $1.5 billion surplus, we were told, with surpluses life of the budget. Instead, what we have is a a $19.4 billion deficit, this year it is $18 billion, no budget surplus until 2015-16-but if Treasurer said last year, that there was going to the nation's debt, and that debt The gross debt is likely to exceed $300 would never ever get to, but it is likely to blow $370-odd billion being announced as where we country is going to get that far into debt. around $12 billion to $13 billion a year just most people to get their heads around. It equates what the taxpayers will be facing: $1½ million for the life of this government, and that figure racking the debt up and up and up. The Gillard Labor government and the Rudd in government with money in the bank and situation we are in right now where the debt is slow down. If we had actually used the money hard infrastructure, on stuff that was really probably would not have been wasted, but the seen substantial funding for major projects. I can point to the Bruce Highway as one begging with this government. Sure, there has business as usual: the flood maintenance stuff, budgeted for and left over from the Howard years. been anything substantial.

We have Sandy Gully a bit further north issues as well. We have perhaps the biggest Abbot Point coal terminal expansion about which the Treasurer promised and announced and Minister doing the same thing-well, that was budget speech last year. That promise was for a out over the forward estimates, the four-year projected $18 billion deficit. Last year there was and on and on it is going to go. There is now you believe that you would believe what the to be a surplus. What does this do? This all adds continues to grow and grow and grow. billion. That is a figure we would were told we that limit, to burst out. I recall the figure of would hit peak debt. It is atrocious that this At $300 billion, this nation is probably paying in interest on that debt. That is a big number for to about $1½ million every hour.

95,Mr CIOBO,BILLS," Here we my perspective it has been another example when it comes to Labor Party budgets, it is what Labor is going to do. Who would forget was elected at the end of the coalition's period conservative. The Labor Party held themselves lessons of the past. The Labor Party is not fixed broadband that supports viewing a YouTube the NBN sooner, more affordably and at less cost businesses in Australia have access to broadband, 25 megabits per second by 2016. Within three speeds at least five times faster than the households, retirees and pensioners get ahead will do this by scrapping the carbon tax and and benefit increases are kept. This is good savings from wasteful government spending to and benefit recipients in Macarthur, including the coalition will generate sufficient savings commenced last year, including the increase in the retain all of the fortnightly pension and benefit tax compensation package. This means people fortnightly benefit increases-but without the genuine cost of living relief. economy. We believe that this is the key to It means more jobs, higher wages, greater ultimately, stronger and more cohesive and discipline to return the budget to provide real support to Macarthur families to in Macarthur the certainty they need to by building a diverse, world-class, five-pillar jobs over the next five years. This budget has aside from pain and empty promises. Our Real Solutions Plan will take pressure off This will ensure that over time there will The people of Macarthur deserve much better and broken promises. Through responsible the coalition will provide hope, reward and something the people of Macarthur can get excited are: another year, another Labor budget. From of more of the same. Unfortunately we know that a case of looking what Labor does not look at that it was not that long ago that Kevin Rudd of office in 2007 promising to be a fiscal out to the electorate and said, 'We learned the going to be a tax-and-spend government anymore. You can trust us to steer the Australian economy. surpluses and to make the big calls correctly people.' Here we are six years later and what Australian Labor Party, true to form, has been saw when Labor was last in office. We have taxing and spending. We saw the hard work of to making the tough calls, committed itself because we knew it was not in Australia's long-term tax relief where we could afford to do so. After introducing the GST to make sure that Australia coalition saw the economic opportunity squandered. If the Labor Party were elected in 2007 delivered-I would use the word 'delivered' $20 billion to $22 billion, from memory, built that had been taken by the coalition in, at the accurately over the 12 years prior. We note the Labor Party got a firm grip and made decisions about what they believed behold, what we saw was the massive erosion Australia's fiscal position. Over the past six we have seen Australia's financial position Future Fund, the Higher Education Fund, Medicare deficits of $44 billion, $58 billion and, who your-life-on-it surplus of a billion dollars that is more, after the Treasurer stood up and said surplus with years of surplus to follow', deficit and a deficit of $18 billion over the deficit the year after that. The Labor Party, again true to form, says: 'But international circumstances. If only we hadn't could have governed effectively and we could up to their eyeballs in debt.' If only it continued getting the big calls right and we enjoy strong economic growth. If only the Labor wrong place at the wrong time, then it would Australia moved from $70 billion of net assets six years. The problem with that approach is that inescapable facts about Australia's economic pronounced in Europe and we have seen fiscal Great Depression throughout Europe. But that not the story with respect to our major trading the United States. The simple reality is that You can trust the Labor Party to deliver to ensure ongoing prosperity for the Australian do we know? We know the track record of the a continuation of the exact same profligacy we seen the Labor Party engage in a process of the coalition that for 12 years committed itself to saying no to people when we had to say no financial interests and also to providing a period of abolishing wholesale sales tax and was on a sustainable fiscal platform, the and in a matter of about six months later they in quotation marks-a budget surplus of around off the back of the hard work and the decisions very least, the 12 months prior but perhaps more on the levers controlling the Australian economy to be the priorities for our nation. Lo and of Australia's competitive standing and of years of Labor Party government and incumbency move from having $70 billion worth of assets-the Fund-and $20 billion plus surpluses to could forget, this year a guaranteed, you-can-bethas turned out to be $19.4 billion deficit. What in the budget speech last year, 'This is the first we now find-oops, typical Labor-a $19.4 billion next financial year to be followed by a $17 billion this isn't our fault. It's all a consequence of been in the wrong place at the wrong time, we have made sure the Australian people weren't was not for the GFC the Labor Party would have would have seen the Australian people continue to Party had not been the victim of being in the not have allowed a situation to arise where to now gross debt approaching $400 billion in is just not supported by the facts. There are performance. Granted, the GFC was particularly problems of a magnitude not seen since the is not the story in our part of the world. That is partners. That is not the story with respect to in our region the countries with which Australia does the bulk of its trade and to which we export three or five years ago, but since then there growth. China has seen growth remain above currently seeing a strong economic recovery Asian neighbours continuing economic resilience. When you look at the economic profile mid-range economies similar to Australia-the Australian experience. Those countries are again paying down debt; once again provisioning strong contrast to the Labor Party, which continues is the problem.' My constituents on the Gold the problem is that this is a Labor government spending. There has never been a spending initiative there has never been a tax that the Labor party about on a regular basis is their sense of betrayal know, stabbed the former Prime Minister in the we were making some major policy errors.' To mining tax and border protection. These were excuse used by the current Labor Prime Minister for Griffith and Australia's elected What do we discover? The Prime Minister, had looked down the barrel of TV cameras and government I lead.' The current Treasurer had that stage that Labor had plans to introduce to pass? We now know that those claims accurate. We know that the Prime Minister who government I lead,' introduced a carbon tax. the member for Griffith in the back because seen effectively an armada of boats coming Australia's very mainland, with about 40,000 changed the laws. The falseness with which Labor goes about We know that the Labor Party needs to fudge make out that they have got everything under That is the reason we have seen the Labor Party protection were going to reduce. At the very seekers coming to Australia, because our situation where the Labor Party says: 'No, sure, comes to the cost of dealing with the problem know what? Trust us, in the next 12 months we've got it under control.' No change to policy costs went up, just as the coalition predicted they would. Likewise, when the coalition effectively surplus, and then this year the Treasurer says: there was significant economic tumult about has been a sustained pathway of strong economic seven per cent for years. The United States is take hold. And we see throughout the bulk of our of other countries-for example, Canada or other story could not be more different to the once again back into positions of surplus; once for the future. That is in remarkable and to say, 'It's not us; it's everybody else that Coast know what the problem is. They know that that, true to form, is big taxing and big that the Labor Party does not like and does not like. What constituents talk to me by this Labor Prime Minister, who, we all back and said, 'I was forced to do it because name two that immediately spring to mind: the issues that needed to be addressed. That was the to stab in the back Kevin Rudd, the member Prime Minister prior to that. only six days out from the last federal election, said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the said claims that the coalition was making at a carbon tax were 'hysterical'. And what has come were not hysterical, they were exceptionally said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the And the Prime Minister who said, 'I had to stab we got it wrong on border protection,' has now not only to the islands around Australia but to asylum seekers coming to Australia since Labor its budget process that concerns me as well. the figures, frankly, when they are trying to control when it comes to the nation's finances. claim, for example, that the costs of border time we are getting record numbers of asylum borders are effectively non-existent, we have a there's been a $6½ billion blow-out when it we created when we changed the laws, but you the costs are going to go down. It's all right, and, lo and behold, what we saw was that the openly laughed at Labor's projected $1 billion 'Well, these events were unpredictable. How were we to know we would have revenue write-downs Once again, we saw Labor playing the victim year, the shadow Treasurer and member for North Press Club that we simply could not rely on expected increase in revenue of $39 billion. said there would be a miraculous $39 billion deliver a $1 billion surplus this year. Lo and $39 billion recovery. It was all just spin hoodwink the Australian people. I know that in my electorate on the Gold government. They do not believe a word that certainly do not believe the fiscal strategy relevance and it is absolutely bereft of any government: 'We reject you and we reject the new or increased taxes since Labor were elected. They reject a mining tax that raises $125 million going to raise over $2 billion. Australians they smell one and they know that this For that reason I am certainly pleased to be of delivering not only for the people of Australia media and constituents were concerned that in mention of the Gold Coast, Australia's sixth solitary mention. I am not surprised because the Gold Coast for years. The Prime Minister physically set foot in address the AWU conference and cloistered the reality is that the Labor Party has no form The Labor Party does not understand the Gold trait that is consistent with all my constituents and entrepreneurship.

The problem was that, after the budget last Sydney stated in his address to the National Labor's forecasts because they were built off an The shadow Treasurer mocked the fact that Labor recovery in revenue and that is what would behold, he was right. There was no miraculous put in place by the Labor Party to attempt to Coast people are sick and tired of this Labor comes from the lips of the Prime Minister.

They recognise a foul stench when government has a foul stench about it. part of a coalition that has a proud track record but for my city of the Gold Coast. Local this year's budget papers there was one solitary largest city. In some 4,800 pages there was one the Labor Party has not been seen anywhere near the city twice over the last term, both times to within the confines of an AWU conference, but when it comes to understanding the Gold Coast. Coast because fundamentally, if there is one across the city, it is a belief in small business is foreign to Labor. It is foreign to Labor because about their approach to industrial relations and it to running government. That is the reason the action on the Gold Coast for years. that tomorrow can be better than today. The in place to get Australia back on track. The that demonstrates not only that we are committed also that we are committed to tourism and employers across the city. We get small and property industries. That is the reason the coalition got unemployment down to a record we will resolve to recommit ourselves to paying has racked up in getting Australia's economy of Gold Coasters deserve it. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (19:11): I rise to and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2013-2014. more spin from a desperate government reeling announced that his much-promised surplus of surprise! On more than 500 occasions the Prime Labor government promised a budget surplus members sent out newsletters to their electorate surplus. But as a result of this government's spending, there is now a $19.4 billion deficit be $18 billion. In total, all six of the Treasurer's budgets have been deficits. In fact, this is government in more than a generation. Yet the when he says that, with Labor's fifth record deficit come, Australia will magically see a return Five years of Labor deficits means $192 billion the $300 billion limit in the forward estimates. that debt ceiling on four occasions from $75 stands at $300 billion. After this year's budget, fifth time when our gross debt exceeds $300 paying $35 million a day in interest-that is, cover the full-year costs of the NDIS without Labor government's addiction to spending taxpayers' Sloan recently commented about the Parliamentary government structural deficits, this has been net debt position it inherited, to raid any even more money.

We need to only look at the mining tax. receive $3 billion. This year they have announced less than 10 per cent of that-only $200 million. more than $80 billion higher than in the last that was running a real, sizeable surplus government is $120 billion higher than in result, in true Labor style the Treasurer announced the next four years while also abandoning previous and companies.

Indeed, many ALP claiming that Labor had already delivered a incompetence, as a result of their addiction to for 2012-13. For 2013-14, the budget deficit will budgets have been deficits.

That means Australian taxpayers are $13 billion a year, which is more than enough to a levy. The $192 billion of debt comes from this money which it does not have. As Judith Budget Offices' publication on Australian a government prepared to run down the negative trust funds hanging around and to borrow to spend had received the extra receipts it had falsely government would have spent those anyway spend. This government has forecast wildly the forecast, but in the meantime it has Last year the government said that they would that net receipts from the mining tax are In 2013-14, federal government revenue is year of the coalition government, a government at the time.
