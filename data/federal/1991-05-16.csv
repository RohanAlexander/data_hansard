2,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: - That every abortion kills an unborn human baby. - That the right to life of all innocent human beings is the most fundamental of all human rights. - That the first duty of the Parliament and of the Government is to protect this right to life. - That in 1989/90 alone Medicare provided medical benefits for almost 70,000 abortions at a cost to taxpayers of $7.8 million. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will protect the right to life of unborn Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare and by all other means at its disposal. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Dubois (from 14 citizens), Ms MCHugh (from 101 citizens), Mr MacKellar (from 346 citizens) and Mr Snow (from 169 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: - That every human being, from the first instance of fertilization, is of unique and precious value, not only to him/herself, but also to his/her parents and to the community at large. - That every abortion kills a human being before his/her birth. - That the right to life of all human beings is the most fundamental of all human rights according to article 3 of the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. - That the primary duty of the Parliament is to protect this inalienable right to life of all citizens, born and unborn. - That in 1989/90 alone, medical benefits were paid for almost 70,000 abortions at a cost to Australian tax-payers of $7.8 million. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will protect the right to life of all Australian citizens before birth by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare and by other means at its disposal. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Webster (from 116 citizens). Political Advertising on Radio and Television To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled; the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we call upon Honourable Members to reject legislation denying Australians the right to advertise electoral material on radio and television, believing such bans amount to a denial of free speech, an unfair advantage to an incumbent government, and a denial of information to printhandicapped and other Australians. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mrs Bailey (from 65 citizens), Mr Reid (from 96 citizens) and Mr Reith (from 180 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their deep concern that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: 1. (a) makes inadequate provision for a subjective judgement by parents as to what is in the best interests of their children (b) makes inadequate provision for parents to use their discretionary powers to act on such judgements. 2. creates the potential for conflict between parent and child (rather than the atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding mentioned as valuable in the preamble). 3. will produce closer monitoring by Government agencies of relationships between parents and children. Your Petitioners therefore pray that: 1. By Act, Parliament ensure that all international treaties (excluding national security) are debated by the Parliament. 2. The Parliament take action to have the Convention amended in order to pay the highest regard. to the importance of the family unit, and to the rights and responsibilities of parents. by Mr Cadman (from 290 citizens). Political Advertising To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia expressing complete opposition to the banning of political advertising, and regard any ban as: - a denial of the freedom of speech; - promoting the government in power by allowing the continuation of government department advertising; - a guise to cover a move toward massive direct-mail campaigns which will make the removal of sitting members a virtual impossibility. Your petitioners therefore pray that: 1. The Parliament rejects any move to abolish political advertising; and 2. Parliament enacts legislation to abolish public funding of political parties, which costs taxpayers up to $13 million each election, and acts to artificially boost expenditure on politihardest cal advertising. by Mr Cadman (from 33 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: We the undersigned petitioners draw to the attention of the members the central role played by the arms trade in creating an environment in which armed conflict such as the Gulf War can occur. Your Petitioners request that the members in Parliament assembled, should demand that the Australian Government: (a) outlaw sales of armaments and arms-related technology to overseas organisations: government and private. (b) lobby internationally, including at the United Nations, for the banning of sales of armaments and arms-related technology. (c) cancel the AIDEX 91 arms bazaar. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mrs Darling (from 2,289 citizens). Arms Trade To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the central role played by the arms trade in creating an environment in which wars such as the Gulf War can occur. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: (i) call on the Federal Government to outlaw sales of armaments and arms-related technology to overseas organisations, government and private. (ii) call on the Federal Government to lobby internationally, including at the United Nations, for the banning of sales of armaments and armsrelated technology. by Mrs Darling (from 42 citizens). Medicare: Abortions The Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of the pelow citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare. Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hit by proposals' to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion. Arms Trade Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the House will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule. by Ms MCHugh (from 99 citizens). Political Advertising To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled; the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we call upon Honourable Members to reject legislation denying Australians the right to advertise political material on radio and television, believing such a ban to be arbitrary and discriminatory, a denial of freedom of speech and a curtailment of criticism (or support) of political parties and/or their policies. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Reith (from 444 citizens). Petitions received. NA NA",12

5,Mr MARTIN,ADMINISTRATION,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I present report of the Committee entitled A tour of duties: The final report of an inquiry into aspects of the Australian Customs Service, together with the minutes of ceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",14
6,Mr MARTIN,ADMINISTRATION,"Macarthur) (9.34 a.m.)The report I have tabled today is the second and final report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public cause Administration on an inquiry into aspects of the Australian Customs Service. report focuses on the program management structure of the Service and the imits port-export control subprogram. In doing so, it gives an overview of the allocation of roles or duties within the Customs Service and examines the operations the subprogram, whose first objective the collection of the correct amount customs duties and other revenue. In 1989-90, the Committee conducted an inquiry into the financial management improvement program (FMIP) of the penalty public sector reform. At that time, the Australian Customs Service was recogthat nised as being a leader in the implementation of its reforms. Following this Report inquiry the Committee has concluded that reputation continues to be a valid one. The program structure introduced by Customs in September 1987 ha·s proved to be a successful one for an organisation administering a range of programs in a complex and changing environment. While the Committee was impressed by the structure and the finetuning which has occurred since 1987, room for improvement was evident in some areas. Most notable was the need for refinement of performance indicators to more accurately measure the achievement of desired outcomes. This observation is consistent with the conclusions of the Committee's FMIP inquiry; In relation to import-export control, the bulk of the submissions to the inquiry addressed amendments to the Customs Act which came into effect in July 1989. These amendments have been generally referred to as the CELA legislation-the the customs and excise amendment legislation. In the view of many who gave evidence to the inquiry, the administrative penalties introduced in the CELA legislaprotion are too severe. Administrative penalties are applied for errors in import documentation which result in short. payment of duty, whether such errors are made knowingly, recklessly or otherwise. The existence of the penalties and their administration by Customs was also considered by many to have been a major of a reported deterioration in relationships between the Customs Service The and the trading community. The Committee has concluded that in present form the legislation appears to be too harsh in its effects on owners and agents and has recommended that a formal review be undertaken in late 1991 by of an independent body such as the Austrais lian Law Reform Commission. Some speof cific changes have also been suggested. The first is that consideration be given to the introduction of a sliding scale of penalties to replace the present mandatory of 200 per cent of duty short paid. The second is to include the recognition what are now deemed to be classification errors could, in some cases, be interpreted as differences of opinion. Having reviewed the reports of a downturn in relationships between Customs and its clients, the Committee believes that, while the penalty provisions provided the catalyst for complaints, other factors were also involved. Wider considerations such as customs recruitment, training and staff rotation practices and its consultative processes also have a significant impact on the response of Customs clients. The Committee has recommended that Customs address some real or perceived shortcomings in these areas. Specific recommendations include a review of training programs to evaluate the success in achieving desired skill levels and, in particular, to evaluate their intermany nal components. Several witnesses suggested that internal training was not sufficient. The low percentage of Customs personnel who have tertiary qualifications was of concern to the Committee. Customs management has taken steps to improve this percentage by encouraging staff to undertake further education. A studies assistance scheme is in place to facilitate study at universities and technical and further education colleges through the provision of bursaries for part time study and scholarships for full time undergraduates and postgraduate study. The Committee endorses these actions and has recommended that Customs also conduct a recruitment campaign at tertiary training institutions to increase the mix of educational qualifications within the ice. The Committee was pleased to observe the Customs Service's decision to review the staff rotation policy. The Committee believes that the new staff mobility policy should ensure a more flexible and sensitively applied policy in accordance with the l8 principles negotiated last October between the Customs Service and the Public Sector Union. To address a need for increased liaison with client bodies, the Committee has recommended the establishment of a Customs consultative committee. It is envisaged that such a forum will meet regularly at a national level for the discussion of customs issues. Such issues could include administrative procedures, changes in policy and draft legislation, where that is appropriate. Membership could be drawn from customs agents associations, the Law Council, customs consultants and importers' representatives. The Committee concluded that there is a need for importers to become more aware of the policy and practices of Customs. Customs agents reported to the Committee that they experienced a degree of frustration with importers-particularly in their efforts to convince importers of the desirability of seeking early advice on classification, valuation and quota matters. The Committee, in fact, received reports of inconsistencies in tariff classification rulings between States and allegations of its corollary, that is, port shopping. By this is meant the practice of routing shipments to clear them at the port providing the most favourable duty rate. In the course of the inquiry, Customs announced its decision to establish a central dispute settling body in Canberra. The Committee supports this move. It believes that the existence of such a body will increase the confidence of importers and their agents by providing an increased degree of certainty and rulings. While the Committee found it difficult to establish the extent of port shopping, it believes its existence has been sufficiently substantiated to warrant further inquiry. Serv- To this end, the Committee has recommended that Customs conduct an investigation to gain an accurate measure of its extent in order to remove possible inequities and to gauge the potential loss to the revenue caused by such practices. An aspect of import control which impresses the Committee is the area of electronic initiatives. Customs has placed considerable emphasis on the development of electronic initiatives in import and export processing, both within Customs and in the wider trading community. The Committee commends these developments and commends particularly the leading role played by Customs in its implementation throughout the trade network. In view of the important role played by electronic initiatives in achieving waterfront reform and the integral role played by Customs in their development, the Committee has recommended that sufficient funding should be allocated in the Budget process to ensure that the overall project can be completed within the planned time-frame. Two other issues were addressed in the report. They were the question of security at Sydney Airport and the provision of customs facilities at planned and potential new airports, particularly in Queensland. Both of those issues are canvassed fully in the report. Despite some shortcomings highlighted in this final report, the Committee remains impressed by overall administration of the Australian Customs Service and by the commitment of its personnel to the achievement of corporate goals. The . Committee has enjoyed its interaction with Customs and has appreciated the cooperation extended to it in the course of the inquiry. I would like to take the opportunity to thank my fellow subcommittee members-the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), the honourable member for St George (Mr Dubois), the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) and the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear)-for their work in this inquiry. 1 would also at this stage pay particular thanks to the secretariat staff for their assistance with the inquiry. I am pleased that they are here in the chamber today. I refer particularly to the subcommittee secretary, Ms Geraldine Skinner, and to Mr Darcy Abbey, a secondee from the Australian Customs Service who acted as adviser to the Committee. I am sure he learned as much about the processes of the Parliament as we learned about the Customs Service. We thank Darcy sincerely. I also convey thanks to Ms Amanda Garlick and to David Elder, the Committee Secretary, who, as usual, considered the whole operation of our Committee work' to the minute detail. In all, I think this again demonstrates the role that, can be played by parliamentary committees in examining important topics, important exercises, which have ramifications for the Parliament and, indeed, government. I commend the report to the House.",14
7,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADMINISTRATION,"I take this opportunity to speak on this report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which is actually a revisitation in two respects to the original report, Risky Business-the 37, 000 Kilometre Challenge. The revisit is in connection with security at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The second matter I want to talk to is the establishment of international airports. I want to thank, particularly, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) for giving me the opportunity to respond. It appears that the first report was made at a time when too much reliance was placed on the Australian Customs Service evidence but too little on the players in the business of international airports. Perhaps it was unfortunate that the inquiry was held at the time during and after the very devastating effects of the air pilots dispute, which actually made international airports throughout all of Australia almost superfluous. The airline pilots dispute, of course, drastically reduced international travel to the Whitsundays north of Mackay and almost excluded domestic travel to the region by air. Two international airports in the region might appear to be rather extravagant, but it has been indicated in many reports, including the Boeing report, that Mackay and areas to the north, particularly north Queensland, are being consistently targeted as growth areas for international and national travel. No doubt the Whitsundays, the islands and the reef are paramount and central to this development; they are internationally famous. They would probably provide, as far as the tourist looking for a Mediterranean atmosphere is concerned; the best . sun, the best sea and the best sand. Mr Downer-Better than the Mediterranean.",16
8,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADMINISTRATION,"It is much better than the Mediterranean; much better than the Bahamas. I think anybody who was on the Committee formulating the report would agree with that, because the area is unique. It is unique because the whole area, just in this one particular location, offers a variety of on-reef, on-island, onshore and hinterland holidays and accommodation. For example, with Hamilton Island on the one hand and Proserpine on the other, there is a diversification of interest. They are single destinations in themselves. I want to report to the House some of the latest statistics on this particular area. For the year ended 31 December, Hamilton Island, of all the airports in Queensland-including the capital-recorded the biggest growth for that year: 45.4 per cent. When one looks at the quarter ended 31 December, it is interesting that one sees Hamilton Island's increase over that previous equivalent quarter is 173.9 per cent; Mackay is 190.6 per cent; and Proserpine 227.9 per cent. That is relevant because the latter statistics would have been affected by the record wet weather from December to March. Further evidence given before the Committee showed there was a need for backto-back charters, because international tourists these days are looking at travelling for a short time, going directly to their destination, spending their time there and going. It also indicates what is being done in connection with Hamilton Island. I would like to recommend to anybody who is interested in this subject the evidence of Hamilton Island through Mr Keith Williams, on pages 442 to 455 of the transcript. This evidence shows the difficulty of trying to have an internationally recognised facility without an international airport. What has been done there is described in those pages, and it speaks volumes. The Hamilton Island airport can currently take Boeing 767s, and it was demonstrated during the evidence that there is a water hazard greater than Venice in trying to get people from the shore to the island and back again. In connection with the Proserpine airport, there is a massive development going on there, with everything already in place. Evidence for Aqua Del Rey was given by Mr Chris Hughes and also the Ansett sponsor. They are prepared to add 1,200 metres of airstrip to the existing 2,000 metres, to take 747s. It was also indicated by the council that there is the Peter Faust Dam, which has infrastructure already in place, and there is a beach development. That again, with Aqua Del Rey, makes this a separate destination, and with a back-to-back charter arrangement everything would be great. In actual fact, there is no dispute between Hamilton Island and Proserpine airports, but what has to be borne in mind is that in Australia, and Queensland in particular, there is a problem if an area does not have an international airport because the movement of traffic is different from that in Europe, where people can move about by bus or train. Tourists expect to get to their destination quickly, spend their holiday and go. The people involved in these projects are the risk takers. I just mention again that the Mackay Port Authority also has plans for internationalisation. We cannot expect these people to develop markets, unless our policy is open enough to provide the encouragement for those people who are prepared to pay and provide the proper services to do so. The capital cost in this case would be borne, as would the Customs service costs, by the Authority. I believe the recommendations are most welcome. I think they will be well received by those people involved, although they indicate, of course, that there is a responsibility on Customs even though their service is paid for. They should investigate the feasibility of part time Australian Customs Service employment, and the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), has already made reference to that trend.",17

11,Mr FITZGIBBON,ACCOUNTS,"On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the 309th report entitled Annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities. Ordered that the report be printed.",18
12,Mr FITZGIBBON,ACCOUNTS,"The Committee initiated this inquiry into annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities in the context of, and in respon-e to, the significant public sector reforms that occurred during the 1980s. The present guidelines for the content, preparation and presentation of annual reports by statutory authorities were issued in November 1982. However since that time the guidelines have been neither updated nor reissued to reflect the major changes to the reporting requirements of all Commonwealth entities. From the early days of the inquiry, it was abundantly clear to the Committee that the current 1982 guidelines were out 01 date and did not adequately reflect the changes that had taken place in both the present day administrative environment and the legislative framework within which Commonwealth Government entities operate. In the Committee's view, the annual report lies at the heart of the accountability process and is one of the most important vehicles for effective parliamentary scrutiny. Statutory authorities have generally been afforded more management autonomy and, flexibility in financial administration than departments of state. This is particularly the case in the light of the ongoing reforms to public sector management and since the issue in October 1987 of the Government's Policy Guidelines for Commonwealth Statutory Authorities and Government Business Enterprises. This increased autonomy and flexibility give rise to an even greater need for detail and proper reporting by statutory authorities of their performance so as to fulfil their accountability requirements to Parliament and, through Parliament, to the public at large. Accordingly, the Committee strongly endorses the existence of guidelines which lay the foundation for statutory authorities to prepare high quality annual reports that focus on the meaningful reporting of both financial and nonfinancial performance. Furthermore, the Committee is of the view that no statutory authority, large or small, commercial or Budget dependent, should be exempt from meeting the minimum requirements set down by the annual reporting guidelines. The Committee is particularly concerned that, while many statutory authorities have specific annual reporting provisions in the Acts by which they are established and others are subject to the annual reporting provisions of the Audit Act 1901, there is no consistent or all embracing legislative requirement for every statutory authority to report to Parliament annually. The fact that there is no statutory backing for the annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities is incongruous with the existence of statutory backing for the departmental annual reporting guidelines, by virtue of the Public Service Act 1922, and the requirements of the Companies Code in relation to annual reporting by private sector companies. In the Committee's view, the most effective way to ensure that there is a minimum level of quality information presented to Parliament each year by all statutory authorities is to give new annual reporting guidelines statutory backing and it has recommended accordingly. Furthermore, in line with the current practice for guidelines for departmental annual reports, the Committee has recommended that the statutory authority guidelines and any amendments made to them from time to time be approved by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The Committee has also recommended that new annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities be prepared by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and that the Department be responsible for an annual review and update of the guidelines. A vast array of bodies can be classified as statutory authorities and as part of the inquiry the Committee closely examined the classes of statutory authorities to which the annual reporting guidelines should apply. The Committee has recommended that there should be one set of annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities and that these new guidelines should clearly state the categories of statutory authorities to which they apply. These categories should include government business enterprises, statutory marketing authorities, other commercial statutory authorities and non-commercial statutory authorities. Furthermore, the Committee recommends that the guidelines should be presented on two levels: the first covering broad issues applicable to all authorities with an emphasis on accountability requirements for both financial and nonfinancial information; and the second divided into sections relevant to particular categories of statutory authorities which outline the reporting requirements applicable to each category. The Committee believes that these recommendations will clarify the present state of confusion surrounding the annual reporting requirements for statutory authorities. All statutory authorities are accountable to Parliament for their performance and, as I have already mentioned, the reporting of performance takes on added importance in the context of the recent reforms in public sector management. In the light of the reforms, the Committee has concluded that the current annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities do not adequately emphasise the importance of results oriented reporting. The Committee considers that currently there is inadequate guidance from central Commonwealth departments for production of performance information by agencies, but readily recognises that development of quality information is a dynamic process and is still in its relative infancy. Against this background, the Committee has recommended that all statutory authorities be required to report on nonfinancial performance in their annual reports, providing as a minimum an outline of program objectives and desired results together with a description of key performance indicators. Comparative data over successive years should be presented where relevant. During the inquiry, the Committee paid particular attention to the situation of statutory authorities with commercial operations. With the aim of improving the quality and timeliness of information to Parliament, the Committee has recommended that such authorities be required to present to the relevant Minister, on a half-yearly basis, interim reports on financial position. Furthermore, all statutory authorities should be required to report to relevant Ministers critical events which have a material effect on financial position as they occur. In the formulation of the new annual reporting guidelines, the Committee has also recommended that stronger consideration be given in the annual reports to the treatment and disclosure of commercially sensitive information. Parliamentary scrutiny of annual reports is an essential link in the accountability chain. Such scrutiny can have direct benefit in improving the accuracy of information provided in annual reports and in promoting adherence to annual reporting guidelines. The Committee also recognises the need for direct feedback to authorities from Parliament about the type of information presented in annual reports. Without such feedback, reporting entities are left in the dark about the quality of the information they have provided, how useful it is and how and where it could be expanded upon. The Committee considers that a valuable form of parliamentary scrutiny is that conducted by standing committees of both t-e Senate and the House. of RepresentatIves. . As a result of the Senate resolution 14 December 1989, the legislative and general purpose standing committees of the Senate now undertake a systematic review of annual reports of all Commonterms wealth entities, although the Committee notes that the review process is somewhat uneven. The Committee also notes that scrutiny by the House of Representatives standing committees tends to be of a more ad hoc nature than that conducted by the Senate. The Government, however, has indiof cated its intention to implement ommendation made in the Committee's report No. 304, Guidelines for Departmental Annual Reports, that the House of Representatives standing committees forcause malise the scrutiny process. Against this background, the Committee has made number of specific recommendations to bring about enhanced scrutiny by the lio:ment. In this report, No. 309, the Comsome mIttee has endeavoured to set the major parameters for the drafting of new guidestatus lines for annual reporting by statutory thorities. While the report address all detailed issues in annual reporting-",18

16,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION REGULATIONS,"As Chairman of the Joint Standits ing Committee on Migration Regulations, I was pleased to present the Committee's second report, entitled Change of status on on grounds of spouse/de facto relationships. This report is part of the Committee's ongoing inquiry into the Migration Act and regulations as required by its of reference. Change of status from being a temporary resident to having permanent residency on grounds of marriage or de facto relationship has become more of an issue in recent years. Dramatically increased numbers of applications and allegations of fraudulent practices on the part of individuals and migration agents have heightened concerns that this means remaining in Australia on a permanent a recbasis is being abused. The Committee felt concerned about the increase in spouse applications beof the potential for abuse of the system. Applicants for change of status on a spouse grounds are preferential applicants. They are given priority for assessParment and they do not have to satisfy aspects of the public interest test. It may also be said that the ability to change from within Australia encourages aupeople to do so in preference to their does not applying from overseas. The amended Migration Act and regulations came into force on 19 December The legal regime established by that and regulations gave very little scope for visitors to change status on grounds of marriage or de facto relationship. However, it became clear very quickly that the new law was extremely harsh and operated unjustly in many cases. On 15 February 1990 the previous Minister responsible for immigration, Robert Ray, moved to institute a adconcessional arrangement for an interim period whereby visitors here legally could the apply to change status on grounds of a spouse relationship with an Australian citAt the same time the Minister referred the whole problem to a working party of the National Population Council for consideration and recommendation. The working party's recommendations were then referred to this Committee for consideration. The working party recommended a return to the pre-December 1989 situation, that is, that visitors should be permitted to be able to change status on grounds of marriage or a de facto lationship with added measures to reduce situation. fraud. The Committee in November 1990 sent its own interim advice to the Minister Immigration, Local Government and Ethdence nic Affairs (Mr Hand) essentially concurpartmental ring with the recommendations of the National Population Council but recomthis mending specific measures to reduce fraud and for the assessment of de facto reladatabase. tionships. The Committee also argued strongly for victims of domestic violence to be given special consideration for manent residency, even though their marriage riages may have broken down. Following the Committee's interim vice to the Minister, the Committee consponsible tinued to investigate change of status has made a number of conclusions and recommendations, principally in the lowing areas: collection and provision of statistical data; consideration of cultural factors; marriage and immigration law; immigration marriage fraud; and marriage breakdown., The Committee discusses at length the problem of immigration marriage fraud. The Committee notes that marriage fraud is of particular concern for the following reasons: firstly, the integrity of the immiis gration program is compromised when those who cannot qualify within the prorelating gram secure permanent residence through a sham marriage; secondly, such sham marriages jeopardise the community goodwill which is necessary to sustain mane migration provisions facilitating family reunion; and, thirdly, prevention and detection of marriage fraud are pensive in terms of staff and time remittee sources of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The Committee attempted to assess the the extent of the problem by analysing the statistical data relating to change of status; however, this proved to be difficult, given the unavailability of much of data and the paucity of data provided by the Department, especially in its annual reports to Parliament. The Committee has commented particularly on this aspect of the inquiry in its report and has made reseveral recommendations to rectify the Further, the Committee was unable to get a clear picture of the incidence of for sham marriages, with much of the evibeing suggestive or based on decase officers' experience. The Committee has made recommendations in area to ensure that the Department collects and maintains a more effective The necessity for departmental officers to be made aware of the different cultural pervalues and practices with regard to maris discussed in the report. Case studies discussed in the report illustrate the adproblems which can arise if officers refor assessing the validity of a and relationship do not understand the relevant cultural factors. The Committee has folrecommended in the report that assessment officers receive appropriate training relevant in cultural considerations. The marriage issue itself is an inherently difficult one. Moreover, the current legislative procedures in place to assess the validity or otherwise of a relationship for immigration purposes have complicated the task that departmental officers are required to perform. The Committee especially concerned at the lack of guidance in the procedures advice manuals to some areas of assessment; for example, the test for a genuine marriage for immigration purposes. The Committee regards this issue as central to the huquestion of marriage and immigration and discusses it at length in the report. As well as recommending and endorsing a exnumber of changes to the law, the Comhas recommended that the Department provide more data in its annual report and more support for its staff in in form of training and better guidance the procedures advice manuals. In January 1991, in response to the Committee's interim report, the Minister the announced a number of changes to the procedures for changing status on the basis of marriage and de facto relationships. These included: increased evidentiary requirements through changes to documentary and interview procedures; a two-year period of conditional residence for eligible spouse or de facto applicants with limited sponsorship rights and permission to work; a requirement that a de facto relationship be in existence for six months prior to date of application; increased application fees; and provision for domestic violence victims to be granted permanent residence in certain cases. On 15 April this year the regulations were amended to put into effect the changes announced by the Minister in January. The Committee welcomes the Minister's response to the recommendations made to him on this issue. However, the Committee does have some reservations about the 15 February amendments, particularly the mandatory condition that there be no material change in the circumstances of the applicant during the period of the validity of the visa. The Committee has recommended that such material changes be confined to changes in the nature of the marriage or de facto relationship, such as that the relationship is no longer genuine or continuing. The regulations as a body continue to be a source of concern to the Committee given the complexity, frequency and number of changes being made. The Committee feels that such a degree of constant change to an already complex system, without the simplification foreshadowed by the Minister in May 1990, disadvantages all those involved in the immigration process, including applicants, departmental officers, community advisers and migration advisers. All Committee members and staff have worked hard to finalise this report. I would like to express particular gratitude for the advice and assistance given to the Committee in its endeavours by Dr Kathryn Cronin, the Committee's legal consultant. Dr Cronin's objective and intelligent advice has enabled the Committee to pursue its inquiries effectively and has, without doubt, enhanced the quality of the Committee's deliberations. I would also like to thank the members of the Committee for the large amount of time they devoted to the work of this Committee. It is a very demanding and sensitive subject area. My thanks also go to the secretariat staff. This report is the most comprehensive discussion of the issues in relation to marriage and change of status undertaken by any public body or institution in Australia. It compares favourably with other reports on this difficult issue prepared in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. I commend the report to all honourable members and urge that they study it.",20
17,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION REGULATIONS,"I thank the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) for his comments. He is one of the members who have contributed to the development of this report by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. I compliment him on his very detailed exposition of the matters that have been addressed in this document tabled today. It should be clearly understood that the report has been dealt with in two stages. The major problems associated with sham marriages, and the inability of the system to detect such situations when they occur and to make a proper assessment of the bona fides of parties entering into marriage relationships where immigration may be the principal objective, were addressed in an earlier report given by the Committee to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) and tabled in this House. The urgent questions that we thought were deserving of attention received some consideration by the Minister. A number of regulations, which have been detailed in this report, have been implemented to give effect to the decisions that the Government took in following the recommendations from the Committee. On behalf of the Opposition, I welcomed the decisions that the Government took as being an appropriate response. We now have the more detailed report which deals with the way in which the Committee developed its recommendations. It gives the detailed evidence as to the situations which led to the recommendations that the Committee brought forward on the earlier occasion. Also ·in this report are some helpful comments about matters of detail, particularly the way in which the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs might develop its procedure and advice manual to ensure that officers are aware of the difficult cultural factors which pinge on marriage relationships and how they might be considered. There is also advice in the report from the Committee in relation to the difficult question that arises where people are required to come forward two years after they have been given conditional entry, and where one party to a relationship may have been involved in some domestic violence, committed domestic violence or made the circumstances in which the parties' relationship was going to continue almost impossible for it to be maintained. In such circumstances-although I know we now have no-fault divorce in this country-obviously regard has to be taken of the possibility that a person who would otherwise have been able to obtain residency in Australia would be denied it because of being battered and bruised by a spouse in circumstances in which one could not conscionably believe that the individual should continue to remain in such a relationship. We did not want to see such people disadvantaged. There are recommendations dealing with those questions. I want to go beyond those matters and raise questions that the Committee has brought forward, which are of very considerable and continuing importance and which are new. The first matter I want to draw to the attention of the Parliament is the significant absence of reliable data upon which conclusions can be drawn. The Committee helpfully offers the view that statistical data ought to be provided in annual reports in a standard format to enable comparison year on year. What is the situation? The situation the Committee found is that the Department changes the basis upon which statIstics are kept. In some years it does not even publicly report information that it has been able to report before, and meaningful comparisons are not possible. This matter needs to be addressed seriously by the Minister. The fact is that the very breakdown in administration in the immigration program that is occurring right now is personified by the problems we found in this area of change of status, marriage and de facto relationships. Of imcourse, it is becoming obvious over time that the same difficulties are arising in other areas, particularly in relation to refugees and the decision the Government took in relation to Chinese students. The very border arrangements for this country are at risk because of the breakdown in administration. What the Committee is saying is that this material that is collected in the way of statistical data ought to be comprehensive and ought to be comprehensible, and we are concerned that it is neither comprehensive nor comprehensible. The second matter I want to raise in relation to this report occurs in chapter 5. Essentially, what the Committee was there looking at was the way in which the Department deals with situations when it becomes obvious, after applications have been made for a change of status, that fraud was involved. I point out to the House those paragraphs of the report, on pages 70, 71, 72, 73, 74 and 75, dealing with the question of investigation following the grant of permanent residence. While it is not a simple matter for immigration officials to refuse residence of spouse applications, the fact is that in the past the departmental officers, because of the possible administrative review of their decisions, have very often allowed people to apply for migrant entry to Australia on the basis of a spouse or de facto relationship where the officers seriously questioned the bona fides of the relationship but were uncertain about whether there was sufficient evidence. Because decisions could be challenged, because those people could go to the courts, the officers erred in favour of admitting people where fraud was likely to be involved. Of course, when a marriage has involved fraud by one party alone, we have the situation where an aggrieved party will come along and say, 'I have been taken. I didn't realise this was happening. My partner has obtained residence in Australia; he has walked out on me. What can you do about it?'. The fact is that inevitably in such situations people are aggrieved but the Department has been able to do very little about it. Quite comprehensive reports are contained in this document of cases that have been before the Family Court where this has happened, cases where people have sought to have marriages nullified rather than enter into a divorce situation. Duped Australian partners came before the Committee and gave evidence of situations in which they had brought to the Department their concern and the Department was unwilling or unable to investigate such matters. The Committee acknowledges that investigations after a spouse has acquired residence can be very difficult and that not all spouses reporting marriage shams are victims of marriage fraud. But what became apparent was that, while many reports are made, very few are investigated. Therefore, the Committee makes the recommendation that it is adamant that in clear cases when such bogus or sham marriages are detected the non-Australian partner, who has used the marriage to gain entry to Australia, be removed. The Committee particularly emphasises that the provisions that deal with overturning grants of residency in such cases ought to be used. The Committee also says that, in cases where people are involved in a number of marriages involving partners overseas and where they break down with rapidity, there should be some limitation on the number of spouses or de facto partners that people are, over time, able to bring to this country. These are new issues that have been raised by the Committee; they are matters deserving of consideration. I certainly hope that the Minister will take on board the very positive and constructive recommendations offered by the Committee to ensure that the law in this area is effectively reviewed and repaired in order to ensure that our immigration system is properly operated.",22
18,Mr SINCLAIR,MIGRATION REGULATIONS,"I wish to join the Chairman, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), and the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations in offering a few words on the presentation of the report Change of Status on Grounds of Spouse/De Facto Relationships. Firstly, I join with the Chairman in commending Dr Cronin and Robina Mills of the secretariat for the work they have done in presenting the report. Secondly, I say to the wider community that I think it is essential that reports of the detail included in this be available for greater scrutiny and consideration of future migration programs. As a relative newcomer to this Committee, what has concerned me above all is that there seems to be so little accurate information available from which the public debate on immigration can proceed. It is an important issue; there are many strong views around the community as to the nature and character of our program; and, with the present horrific level of unemployment and the downturn in the economy, there are inevitably personal pressures against migration. It worries me that in so many instances our program has been developed on a basis of prejudice and lack of understanding and it seems almost to be a closed shop within the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Indeed, in this very area of change of status on the basis of marriage, there is a worry that in some instances the program is prejudiced by the degree to which overseas applications are expedited or delayed in their processing. There are a great many other factors outside the control of this Parliament and the program which influence where the program eventuates. In the few minutes I have, I want to say a few simple things. The first is that both the Chairman and Deputy Chairman have referred to the availability of statistical data relating to change of status in the incidence of sham marriages. The Department has come along and said that it is a field that is rort with fraud, that there are a large number of instances occurring; yet there has been no statistical data to justify that allegation. I think that it is essential not only that the Department produces and collates data-it now claims to have the computer hardware and software to do so-but also that the data is published and available through this place to the public of Australia. Indeed, I think that the annual report should have attached to it statistical data that covers whole range of circumstances affecting applicants, affecting each of the areas of the program, so that there is a better opportunity for the community to understand and reach conclusions upon it. The report itself of course follows an initial letter submitted by the Chairman of the Committee and which is appended to the report. That letter, written on the basis that something needed to be done in the short term, highlighted a number of issues on which I feel strongly. The issue to which I refer briefly is that the letter, which, as I say, is attached to the report and is under the hand of the Chairman of the Committee, dated 7 November 1990, in referring to de facto relationships sets down a period of 12 months proven cohabitation as distinct from the six months that the Government itself has adopted. That extra six months is desirable. I am most concerned that in this field of change of status there should not be a putting into place of an acceptance that marriage and de facto relationships are identical. In my view, 12 months cohabitation is far preferable, and I feel dissatisfied, therefore, that the Government has provided for only six months. I am concerned that, in the nature of the overall circumstances of our program, there are many still unaware of the nature and character of how they will prove their change of status. In this report we have properly referred to the manner by which a genuine marriage for immigration purposes can be established. I commend that to the Department. Above all, to those in the community, as the Chairman has suggested, I make specific mention of the fact that there is a two-year waiting period within which they are allowed a temporary entry permit. That two-year waiting period is a qualifying period during which they must be seen to maintain their relationship. In all, this report marks a number of practical and worthwhile comments in a field which is of high public moment. I commend the report to the Parliament. I wish that there were more time to speak on details of it. It is essential that the the recommendations included in the report are accepted, and that the matters included in the dissenting report are used merely by the Department as matters of which it can take note during consideration of particular applications.",24
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION REGULATIONS, The debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Charles.,25
20,Mr CHARLES,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1991 seeks to amend section 299 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988, which deals with offences in relation to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Section 299 contains subparagraph (1) (d) (ii), which provides that a person shall not, by writing or speech, use words calculated to bring the Commission or a member of the Commission into disrepute. To contravene this subparagraph is an offence punishable, upon conviction, by a penalty, in the case of a natural person, of $500 or imprisonment for six months or both, and, in the case of a body corporate, of $1,000. My Bill will omit section 299 (1) (d) (ii). That offending subparagraph gives to members of the Commission rights and powers and a form of protection not given to ordinary citizens, members of parliament, or, in fact, Justices of the Federal Court. That form of protection is a denial of freedom of the press and freedom of speech. I am disappointed that I am today reintroducing a Bill which I first introduced into this House on 8 November 1990. It is disappointing that the Government has not seen fit to support my Bill and support the removal of this iniquitous section, this denial of basic human rights, from the Industrial Relations Act 1988. However, it is appropriate today to examine the industrial relations debate in Australia as it relates to my Bill. Section 299 (1) (d) (ii) has been used only very selectively by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and its successor, the Industrial Relations Commission. I have noted previously the Commission's unsuccessful attempt to charge Mr H. R. Nicholls, editor of the Hobart Mercury, in 1911. In 1989 and continuing, the Commission has pursued Nationwide News, publisher of the Australian, and Mr Chris Gorrick, Federal Vice-President of Civil Air Operations Officers Association of Australia. However, it seems to me that those so-called offences were minor in comparison with statements reported in the daily press over the past few weeks since the Commission rejected accord mark 6. The Victorian Secretary of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, Mr Wally Curran, is repo'rted to have made one of the most blistering attacks of all time when he accused the Commission and the commissioners: : .. of .lacking - bility, obvious bias, hypocrisy, Impropnety and Incompetence. But Mr Curran said he unequivocally supported the role of the Industrial Relations Commission in central wage fixing; it is just that he did not like the selection criteria for commissioners in the recent national wage decision that had led to his attack. The Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Bill Kelty, when referring to that same decision, said: It is a sickening decision but there is no reason for the trade union movement to eat the vomit. The Federal Treasurer (Mr Keating), was reported in the Sunday Age as having said: The problem is that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is thrashing around trying to find a role for itself in the new Australian economy. It's got in its mind a 60s role for in a 90s environment and it's just got to rethink its position or it won't have a position. Asked if he was hopeful that the Industrial Relations Commission would see the virtue of the accord, Mr Keating said: I don't need to be hopeful about them. They need to be hopeful about themselves. They're just a cog in a very big machine, and if they're feeling as though they're a tooth or two out of alignment with other cogs, well then they're feeling it correctly. Clearly, those attacks on the Commission and commissioners have brought the Commission into disrepute. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) can either support my Bill or prosecute. I suggest to the Government that it is timely that it support this private members Bill and rush it through the House and the Senate before the Federal Court is jammed with its mates and perhaps even a few of its members. If the Attorney-General allows section 299 (1) (d) (ii) to remain in the Industrial Relations Act imd does not take action against those who are attacking the commissioners and the Commission, and clearly bringing the lot into disrepute, then he will be seen by the community as being derelict in the performance of his Commonwealth responsibilities. Bill read a first time.",25
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"In accordance with sessional order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA (STANDARD TIME) AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Second Reading . Consideration resumed from 18 April 1991.",26
22,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. I am very pleased to be presenting the National Measurement (Standard Time) Amendment Bill 1990 before the Parliament. I thank my colleagues the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), itself the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), who I understand will speak on this Bill. In particular, I would like to thank the honourable member for Fairfax and the honourable member for Perth, who will be supporting the Bill. I would also like to thank the Minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), and a colleague from Western Australia, the Minister for Employment,' Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), who have played a significant role in the debate on this Bill. the National Standards Commission, and in particular, Mr John Birch from that Commission. He has been very helpful and has given expert advice on these matters. The origin of time zones is significant. In the period up to the mid-nineteenth century, each town or city kept its own time. This time was determined by setting local clocks so that 12 noon corresponded to the sun being in its highest position in the sky. Travel from city to city took several days and the traveller was unaware of any problem. Local time, as it was known, persisted in most countries until the introduction of rail transport. The experience in the United States was similar to that in other countries. Following the end of the Civil War in 1863, a multitude of railway and telegraph companies sprang up across the country. The introduction of these relatively fast forms of transport and communications caused difficulties when correlating time across large distances. A different time was kept by each railway for timetabling, and each city along the railway kept its own local time. The multitude of different local and railway times caused considerable confusion and led to the introduction of a system of time zones. At the International Meridian Conference held in Washington in October 1884, the proposal that the longitude of the Greenwich Observatory be adopted as the prime meridian for longitude throughout the world was accepted. This resulted in the adoption of universal time based on this meridian and known as Greenwich Mean Time. A corresponding resolution provided for time zones based on a onehour difference for every 15 degrees of longitude from the Greenwich meridian. These time zones have been adopted by almost all nations, with some variations for local conditions. Incidentally, I note that western and central continental Europe spans two time zones, but operates on a uniform time zone one hour ahead of coordinated universal time (UTC), that is, Greenwich Mean Time. This is done because it suits the business and recreational needs of western and central contiI also thank nental.Europe. The zone covers all members of the European Community except the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Turkey; all members of the European Free Trade Association, except Finland; as well as Yugoslavia, Albania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland. In other words, all those countries choose to be in one time zone, and I know that the honourable member for Perth is aware of that too. In November 1892 an inter-colonial conference of surveyors was held in Melbourne to consider the Washington proposals and it recommended the introduction of three time zones for Australia, in which the standard times would be the mean solar times of 120 degrees, 135 degrees and 150 degrees East of Greenwich. All States enacted time Acts in the 1890s, which defined the time zones and the mean solar times for use within those zones. It is under these Acts that the State and Territory governments have provided for daylight saving. I make the point that it arose only because at that stage we did not have a federal government. The history of daylight saving is interesting. It was first introduced in Australia in World War I as an energy saving measure from 1 January 1917 to 15 March 1917. It was also introduced during World War II for the same reason: that is, as an energy saving measure. In 1967 Tasmania experienced a drought which depleted its water supplies for hydro-electric stations. In 1971 all States, except Western Australia and the Northern Territory, passed legislation for a trial daylight saving period. I now turn to the arguments for daylight saving. The first, clearly, is the question of energy saving in a world in which energy saving is significant. We have seen the Tasmanian and wartime experiences, in which it was clear to everyone that energy saving was relevant. I believe that those arguments are still relevant and are particularly relevant across Australia, including Western Australia. Secondly, there are recreational benefits. One can see in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, for example, the enormous benefits to people of having those evenings in which they can undertake a range of recreations, be they walking the dog, sailing, playing tennis, going swimming or simply being together in the evenings. I know that from my colleagues and from talking to people in those other cities. It is something that we should also enjoy in Western Australia. The micro-economic reform element is very important. When one talks to people in other countries, it is interesting to that they place efficiency very highly in terms of their economic performance. If Australia is to have micro-economic reform, it is important that we look at issues such as this as ways of improving our performance. I believe it is central to the issue. ' The fourth point is interesting: I talked to many people before taking on the issue of banning smoking on airlines. Many people said to me, 'You should have a referendum about it'. I do not know of anyone who would argue now that we should have a referendum about it. In fact, the time for it had arrived, and the Government did the right thing in following the Caucus view, which was that we should ban smoking on airlines. I would also draw a parallel in the question of fluoridation of water. Were we to put to a referendum the question of fluoridation of water, it is interesting that we would find opposition to it, because there tends to be an opposition position. However, I do not know anyone to whom one speaks professionally or in terms of public health who would argue against the fact that fluoridation provides a public benefit. It does; it is something that needed to be done and it was important that it was done. I now turn to the arguments against daylight saving, and the first is the question of States' rights. I would argue by analogy: if one says that the States are best at doing it, let us look at what a good job they did with the rail system in this country. We still cannot fix the mess, even with the national rail freight network, and we are still working on it. If the States are so good at it, that is one example. My second point is: are people saying to me that the States should also have the power to set their own· currency? Is that what they are saying by analogy? Section 51 placitum (xv) of the Constitution makes it clear that the weights and measures power is a power of the Federal government; it is not a power of State governments. Are people saying that State governments should have power over time and that they should also have power over currency? We would end up with an abnote solute mishmash both of currencies and of time. The position is clear and no-one has really challenged this constitutional right. Incidentally, the legislation provides under clause 15D (4) that State Premiers and Chief Ministers can be consulted as to their views. I would reassure people who say that what we are seeking to do is to overrule the rights of the States that that is not the case. In fact, the big problem is in Western Australia, and this is the second argument about the role of State parliaments. The upper House in Western Australia actually blocked the corporations legislation that was designed to deal with corporate malpractice; it has also blocked this matter. However, it was the view of the lower House of the State Parliament and the Premier that daylight saving was impQrtant. The answer to the third question-why do I not accept the outcome of the 1984 referendum?-is that that referendum was narrowly defeated. It is also important to observe that there is now a much greater consensus about daylight ·saving. In fact, there is now a very strong view in favour of daylight saving across eastern Australia. There are also more people now in Western Australia who are of the view that we need daylight saving, particularly for those micro-economic reform and efficiency benefits. I am told that the dairy industry will suffer. That is extraordinary. No-one has told me that productivity in the dairy industry in eastern Australia or throughout Europe is below that of Western Australia; yet there is daylight saving in all those places. The argument has no substance. I accept that people do not like change, but sometimes there are changes one needs to make. I am told that business people should get up earlier. We have tried to deal with that practically. Say a businessman starts his office at 7 a.m. In fairness to his staff, he tries to close the office at 4 p.m. However, there are people ringing up at 4.30 saying 'Where have you gone?' and knocking on the door asking why the office has been shut. The answer is that his office starts at 7 a.m. and goes until 5.30 p.m. or 6 p.m. and he therefore pays overtime. If that is the logic of the argument, that is extraordinary. The point is that people have to deal with eastern Australia and with the local constituency, be' they in business, parliament or other circumstances, and it makes sense to have rationalised time zones. The next point I think is a sensible one. By being west of the meridian of longitude, Perth already experiences some daylight saving. I acknowledge that. It is also true of Melbourne vis-a-vis Sydney. That will arise whenever a meridian of longitude is the measurement device. Be that as it may, it is still necessary in terms of the overall argument to have this. Finally, I have been told that I should not be talking about issues such as this, I should be talking about unemployment, inflation, et cetera. In fact, we already address those issues in the Federal Parliament. I resent people who would put up a smokescreen and say that we should deal only with those issues. This is an important issue. I believe it is one that we ought to be bringing before the Parliament. I thank my colleagues for their support. I think the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) will speak on this issue for the Opposition. In particular, I thank my excellent colleague the honourable member for Perth for his support in this matter. This is important legislation and I believe it should go through this Parliament.",26
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Is the motion seconded? Dr Charlesworth-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,29
24,Mrs GALLUS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Hawker) (10.43 a.m.)1 oppose the National Measurement (Standard Time) Amendment Bill, but not because I am against daylight saving. I believe very strongly that, daylight saving having been instituted, it should at least be uniform around the country. I refer to 1989 when, from memory, the time was 9 o'Clock in New South Wales, in Victoria and Tasmania it was 10 o'clock, in South Australia 9.30 and in Western Australia 6 o'clock. That is a disaster when one considers businesses having to cope with different times in different States. Australia is a large continent-it is 4,000 kilometres across-so we have to accept time differences. I am rather disappointed that the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), for whom I have a great respect, has introduced this Bill. It proposes to do something to which I am opposed, that is, to force Commonwealth legislation on States which have clearly decided that they do not want this legislation. Mr Ronald Edwards-No, it hasn't.",29
25,Mrs GALLUS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I will read some of the reports which insist the State of Western Australia did not want daylight saving. The reports go back as far as 1975. As the honourable member for Stirling has pointed out, in 1975 there was a referendum. I want to read some reports of the results of that referendum. Fifty-three per' cent of Western Australian residents voted against having daylight saving. The Canberra Times said: The new Government decided to follow the lead of most of the eastern States this summer, but to cap the experimental daylight-saving period with a referendum asking the people to decide. The people did have the time to see what they thought about daylight saving. After that the Government did go to a referendum. The article continued: In retrospect it was the fairest thing to do, and no Western Australian can reasonably protest against the result. Students of the democratic process are shouting hooray. That was in 1975. The people made it very clear what they wanted in Western Australia, but the Government was not yet satisfied. Also in 1975, the West Australian said: The people have spoken-and the result is binding. But the result was not binding and the Government decided to have another go in 1984. Again the people were asked what they wanted to do about daylight saving. There was a referendum and this time 55 per cent of the people said they did not want daylight saving. That was an increase on the previous referendum. They had made up their minds. Be they right or wrong, the people of Western Australia had decided they did not want a referendum. On 9 April 1984 the West Australian said: Despite the addition of quarter of a million voters to the State's TOlls, the vote on Saturday was a virtual repeat of the 1975 result. The Australian said: The Premier, Mr Burke, said yesterday the result was clear-cut and the matter had been settled 'for many years to come'. Mr Ronald Edwards-Burkie is no longer in charge. Dr Charlesworth-He is your authority, . is he?",29
26,Mrs GALLUS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I would hate to quote Mr Burke as my authority. If I could find a better authority, I would, but the fact remains that Mr Burke, whom honourable members opposite now repudiate, apparently-from the noise from the other side of the House, clearly repudiate-was then the Premier of Western Australia, and that was his comment on the referendum. The people in Western Australia made up their own minds; they made their decision. Whether honourable members opposite agree with it, or whether I agree with it, it was their decision. But it turns out that that is not good enough for the present Commonwealth Government. Mr Ronald Edwards-No, it is a private member's Bill, not the Government's.",30
27,Mrs GALLUS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"The honourable member for Stirling said that it is a private member's Bill and not a Government Bill. But the Government does seem to get into this. The West Australian of 8 December had a headline 'Dawkins plan could force time zones'. It said: CANBERRA: The Federal Government could force notice the word 'force'WA to adopt daylight saving, Education Minister John Dawkins said yesterday. I realise it is not the responsibility of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), but, being a Minister in the Labor Government, he is certainly putting his authority behind this move to force Western Australians to accept daylight saving. The Minister had approached Western Australia on this matter and, perhaps in a particularly high handed attitude, had not even told the Premier. The article said: Dr Lawrence said in the Legislative Assembly yesterday that she could not respond to Mr Dawkins' proposal because he had not had the courtesy to send her the letter before distributing it to the media. It seems that unilaterally the Minister has decided that the people of Western Australia will have daylight saving whether they want it or not. Mr Ronald Edwards-It is my Bill. , Mrs GALLUS-The honourable member for Stirling keeps insisting it is his Bill. I would hate to take his Bill away from him' I give him back his Bill. I was looking at where the impetus for the Bill came from. On 25 February the Sydney . Morning Herald said: Late last year the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, raised the possibility of Federal legislation with Dr Lawrence. A spokesman for Mr Dawkins confirmed that Mr Dawkins and the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Crean, had recently sought advice. 'The advice we have is that it is. constitutional,' he said, 'but you don't want to be seen to be imposing your will unnecessarily on something the States have always had a keen interest in.' So here is not what really matters. I notice the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) is at the table. I am glad he is also interested in this Bill. There is then a rather key quote, which might refer to the claims of the honourable member for Stirling to own this Bill: 'It may be most appropriate if it came up as a private member's bill.' It seems that the honourable member for Stirling got stuck with the Minister's Bill, so it has come up as a private member's Bill. That leads us to where we are now: this Government forcing the States the people of Western Australia to do something they do not want to do. In giving the honourable member for Stirling his Bill back, I quote some of the comout. ments he has made on it. He said: 'It still belongs to the fading curtains that somehow if daylight saving were introduced their curtains would fade,' Mr Edwards said. That was in the West Australian of 19 April 1991. In his first reading speech, honourable member for Stirling said: Someone actually telephoned me and said, 'My grass has been drier this summer, and bring daylight saving in it will get worse'. I suggest to the honourable member for Stirling that he is trivialising some issues. This is a real issue to people Western Australia where 55 per cent the people voted against the Bill, and they did not vote on the basis of fading curstands tains. I refer to another item in the newspaper about a Mr Johnson, who was directly affected by the daylight saving experiTime) Amendment Bill. ment. Mr Johnson is a farmer-Mr Ronald Edwards-He was travelling on the bus, was he?",30
28,Mrs GALLUS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"No, he was not travelltry ing on the bus, and I do not know the relevance of the bus. Mr Johnson was getting up early in accordance with daythat light saving to look after his cows. As the honourable member for Stirling might know, cows are found in the country and have to be looked after early in the mornplace ing. The article said: Mr Johnson stumbled in the dark at 6.15 am while trying to herd one of his cows into the milking bails. His wounds became infected and he spent five days in hospital. He was unable to resume milking until January 26. Mr Johnson said he had to work in the dark during daylight saving because his cows needed to be milked before the tanker arrived at 8 am. I have many more examples, not just of milking cows but of children in the country who have to go to school in the dark, who have to sit up late in the afternoon in the heat of the sun and who have to go home in the heat of the sun. There are and radio broadcasts which do not come through very clearly in the dark or in the early hours of the morning. I have numerous examples here but my time has run I simply make the point that the Westbrigadeern Australian people made their decision, be it right or wrong, that they did not want daylight saving in Western Austndia. It is not up to the Commonwealth the Government to change the game. It is centralism gone mad.",31

30,Dr CHARLESWORTH,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"The honourable member for in Hawker (Mrs Gallus), whose room is opof posite mine across the corridor, and I agree on many issues. I think she underthat I am not necessarily a centralist, but she really has come up with a couple of puny arguments in respect of the National Measurement (Standard I wholeheartedly support the position of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards). He is arguing here for a uniform system to exist across the counwhich is in place all year round so that we in Western Australia know that the time difference will be two hours and it will be two hours all year round. This will mean that all those things which are in place-broadcasting and airline schedules-and which businesses have in will be consistent and will not need to be redrawn every year. There will not be the need for the changes, the shifting and the swapping which occurs. The honourable member for Stirling has outlined very clearly the benefits, which occur principally in three areas: recreation, micro-economic reform and energy saving. Those issues are increasingly important-Mr Hawker-Interesting priorities.",31
31,Dr CHARLESWORTH,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I did not put them in any particular order. They are increasingly important as our lives change. Honourable members opposite have to understand that the world has changed. We have the honourable member for Hawker talking about the circumstance 15 years ago and seven years ago, and talking about a popularity contest. In this place we are talking about making decisions, making judgments and passing legislation for the benefit of the whole community. We have to consider that. There are times when individual freedoms and individual choices, unfortunately, take second place; but that is because we believe the benefits to the whole community are substantial. Some of the arguments that have been thrown up are unbelievable. If I get the time, hopefully, I will be able to raise some of them in respect of this issue. What we need to consider first, and I will take it first, is the energy issue. It is an increasingly important issue. Environmental issues, land degradation, and the greenhouse effect are issues seminal to the future of our country and of our planet. They are important issues and need to be considered. We have used daylight saving for energy conservation in war time and we have used it in times of particular need. In a country like Japan, one of the most energy efficient countries in the world, this issue is central in debate at the moment. It makes sense. I do not want to carry that any further, except to say that it makes sense, in terms of energy conservation, to introduce a move such as this. Honourable members on the other side of the House, over the last year or two, have been pushing the trolley of microeconomic reform. Mrs Gallus-Someone had to do it.",32
32,Dr CHARLESWORTH,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"The Opposition has been pushing it for two years; we have been pushing for it for 10. What I am saying is that it is important. If it was not an issue 10 years ago-when the honourable member for Hawker said that there should have been debates and referenda-it certainly is one now; and it is something that needs to be taken into account. We have to look at the disasters that have occurred in the past because we have not had some coincidence of view between all the States in this country. The honourable member for Stirling mentioned that we have never had a standard gauge railway system. In Western -.us­ tralia recently we had the absurd pOSItIon of the upper House rejecting the Australian Securities Commission legislation, which would have brought about uniform legislation for the protection of businesses and for company law in this country. We had an absurd situation where Western Australia wanted to go another way. All of the other States agreed. We had a coincidence of interests among all of the States; unfortunately, Western Australia disagreed. Eventually, because of public pressure and pressure applied by the Federal Government and other Liberal leaders in this country, to their credit, we have turned that situation around. We have the absurd situation in Western Australia where we are trying to eliminate petrol rostering, which is an anachronism, an inefficient way of operating. It props up inefficient service stations. We have been trying, and the Minister for Consumer Affairs in Western Australia has been trying, to change that; but the upper House in Western Australia, controlled by the Liberals, for God knows what reason-certainly not for reasons of economic efficiency-is defeating that legislation. Time and time again, if we look at the history of this country, we find those sorts of debates occurring and we find those sorts of obstructions. We are trying to smooth out the obstructions. This legislation is consistent with other Government decisions. I was at school in 1966, when we introduced decimal currency. I cannot remember whether there was a referendum held on decimal currency. I do not think there was. Is the Opposition suggesting that, if Western Australia had said, 'No, we want to stay with pounds, shillings and pence', that position should have obtained? Of course it should not have obtained. The introduction of metric measures was also mentioned. This legislation, indeed, comes under the Commonwealth purview of being in control of measurements and time. We introduced metric measures; we went to kilograms and kilometres. But there was no referendum to agree to that. We were talking about economic efficiency in this country, and we were talking about having a coincidence of interests right across the country. In many areas that has been the case. The suggestion by members of the Opposition that this is a States' rights issue is an absurdity. We get it thrown at us time and time again, but we have to look beyond the puny political advantage that may be gained by a few people in a particular position. Some of the other arguments raised by the honourable member for Hawker were absurd. He suggested that school children will be unable to handle a change in the time zones. We only need to spend a summer in Europe to understand that it is daylight until 11 o'clock at night there. I do not hear those cries and complaints from families and children in Europe. People make adjustments. They are capable of making adjustments. We have to give them credit for having the ability to do so. It is absurd to suggest that they cannot. The honourable member for Stirling mentioned farmers. Farmers in western Europe seem to be able to manage, even when it is daylight until 11 o'clock at night. Why is it such a problem if it is daylight until 9 o'clock at night in some places in Australia? It is absurd to put view that we are not able to make these adjustments. From Queensland we get even more ridiculous arguments. I will mention a number of them. Eidsvold Shire Chairman Peter Webster says that the daylightsaving trial led to grumpy and irritable people. Children had suffered by having to catch buses ih the dark for long trips to school and it affected their concentration. Someone else in Queensland suggested that the divorce rate would increase because people would nag one another more because they would be awake longer. My God! It gets even more absurd. The doozey of them all was reported in the Australian on 14 August 1990: One woman even advised an investigating task force, which recommended the introduction of two time zones, that her husband could be embarrassed if he had his morning erection on the bus to work . . . There is some sense in Queensland. Most of the sense in Queensland comes, of course, from Brisbane. Mr Ronald Edwards-The member for Fairfax.",32
33,Dr CHARLESWORTH,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"The honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) is well known for his sensitivity and common sense. A headline in the Courier-Mail says, 'How daylight savers turn over a new leaf. The Brisbane City Council reported a decrease in absenteeism with the introduction of daylight-saving. Not only that, but there was better work attendance and there were better work attitudes and practices. The other interesting thing it found out was that the use of Council facilities, including parks, bikeways, golf courses and swimming pools, all increased during daylight-saving. This goes to the third element of those things that I mentioned-micro-economic reform, energy saving and, of course, recreation. This represents an important measure to unify Australia, not to set Australians apart. All of us who have to conduct business between the west coast and the east coast understand the difficulties that occur during the summer months. This is an important piece of legislathe tion. There are those who will disagree, but it is within the purview of the Parliament, it is consistent with our role here, to make changes to the way in which Australia functions to make us more efficient. It is absolutely central to our role. If we can improve the lives of people in Western Australia by giving them more recreation time, if we can improve the efficiency with which we operate and with which Australia does business with the rest of the country, and if we can save energy, then this important piece of legislation should be supported in this place.",33
34,Mr SOMLYAY,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Fairfax) (11.03 a.m.)The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) has argued for uniformity. I believe that this is where his argument breaks down. If he wanted real uniformity across Australia, he would not have any time zone differences at all between Perth and Sydney if daylight means nothing. Dr Charlesworth-Uniformity all year round.",34
35,Mr SOMLYAY,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"! recall that when metric conversion occurred in Australia, it certainly did not happen without debate. Dr Charlesworth-There was no referendum.",34
36,Mr SOMLYAY,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I recall a government member standing up in Parliament and saying that if God meant us to go metric, we would have had 10 apostles, not 12. Dr Charlesworth-We used to have troglodytes.",34
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Order! The honourable member for Perth! Dr Charlesworth-They are all on your . side.,34
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Order! The honourable member for Perth will remain silent.,34
39,Mr SOMLYAY,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I have been a supporter of daylight-saving very vocally in Queensland for quite some time. We achieved daylight-saving in Queensland recently. Daylight-saving was first trialled in Queensland in 1971 and quickly abandoned in 1972. As the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) and the honourable member for Perth said with regard to Western Australia, the same happened in Queensland. Queensland experienced enormous growth in the following 20 years after the first daylight-saving trial, particularly in the south-east corner, where the growth was greatest. There was also massive growth in small business. Summertime has only recently been reintroduced despite strong opposition. The division in opinion was clearly defined between the south-east corner of the State-the most populous area of the State-and the northern and the western sections of Queensland. Prior to Queensland's adoption of daylight-saving in 1989, business and tourism in the south-east corner of Queensland were affected adversely by the time differences during the summer months; there was no question about that. The community found it extremely difficult when dealing with its southern counterparts. In the southern States an hour would be lost in the morning waiting for Queensland businesses to open, with the reverse situation occurring in the afternoon where southern businesses closed an hour earlier than they did in Queensland. The worse situation was during lunchtime, when two hours were lost instead of one hour. The effective contact between the States was lost for two hours each working day. Within the tourism industry-my electorate of Fairfax is a well-known electorate based on tourism and small business-the airline schedules had to be reprinted to take into account the different time standards between States. Summer tourists holidaying in border towns and cities of Queensland and New South Wales were continually changing their watches. I know my colleague the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) would agree with me. A lot of confusion occurred when people crossed the Queensland border into New South Wales at the Gold Coast. People were also inconvenienced by different trading hours. The time difference was confusing for . international airlines. I think we looked quite stupid in the eyes of the world when people arrived in Queensland for holidays via Sydney and found that they were getting to Queensland 15 minutes earlier thawhen they arrived in Australia. It was totally confusing. With the reintroduction of daylight-saving in Queensland, the State has benefited both economically and socially. There no question about that. From a business and economic standpoint, the introducAs tion of summertime is in the best interests of the State as a whole. The phrase 'the business of doing business' is vital to ductivity and efficiency of the commercial and industrial sectors of the State. The experience of past years when and, Queensland was not in the same time zone as the rest of the eastern seaboard showed that there was considerable disness ruption to commercial activities, with communications between interstate offices being particularly affected. In tough nomic times-this is outside. the scope this Bill, but I am tempted to comment on the reason for our tough economic times-we cannot afford to be out of step with the interstate business community. The problems in north Queensland and far-western Queensland are real. The honourable member for Perth and the legislation honourable member for Stirling made funny comments and ridiculed people for their opposition to daylight-saving. But we cannot change nature's clock. That is a simple fact. The concerns of these people in the rural and remote areas are real and I have great sympathy for them. The real problem is that we have to legislate for the good of the majority rather than the minority. That was the situation in Queensland. For instance, not many people would realise that Mount Isa, the most western city of Queensland, is most due north of Adelaide. The sun rises in Mount Isa over an hour later than Brisbane, yet Mount Isa is in the same time zone as Brisbane. Honourable memof summertime. bers can well imagine the problems faced by children who have to get up before dawn to travel long distances to school in the dark, in some cases for a journey more than an hour, and then return home in the heat of the afternoon. The so-called benefit to north Queenslanders' social lives is an increase in leior sure hours. With average temperatures in their burden. summer in the high 30s and low 40s it would be hard to imagine that anyone would take advantage of this leisure time. The southern States do not have the is tremes of temperature that we experience in Queensland in our far north and west. has been mentioned, with the sun not setting until well after 8.30 p.m., parents have the real problem of feeding their proyoung children and getting them to bed during the heat of daylight hours. Queensland did adopt daylight-saving as I said, I supported daylight-saving in Queensland. I believe it is important not to lose that competitive edge in busifor five months each year. Daylightsaving in Queensland was championed by my Party-the Liberal Party of Ausecotralia-and, in particular, by Sally anne of Atkinson, the previous Lord Mayor of Brisbane. It was supported by the State Parliamentary Liberal Party, which influenced public opinion to the extent that the Ahern Government had no choice but to introduce daylight-saving. The Queensland Government passed in 1989 to trial daylight-saving for a year, and a committee was established to monitor the success or otherwise of the trial. It is now history that that trial has been accepted and daylight-saving is a permanent feature in Queensland. Queensland legislation establishes a procedure to make it possible for local communities to seek to change the times of various activities such as school hours, hours of employment and trading hours, to lessen the perceived adverse effects of summertime. Local authorities are being alasked to coordinate their submissions from their local communities suggesting in ways to alleviate problems which might be seen as arising out of the introduction While the majority of people in Queensland believe that summertime is essential, they recognise that it does disof advantage others. A mechanism has been set up in Queensland-it could also be set up in Western Australia-to allow variation to trading hours, school hours other hours which would help lessen As I said, I support daylight-saving but I do have reservations. As my colleague the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs exGallus) said, this is not a question of daylight-saving but a question of States rights. There are special circumstances in Western Australia, as the honourable member for Stirling has pointed out, in that Perth already has half an hour daylight-saving because of its geographic position. However, I believe that it is not a Commonwealth function to legislate for the people of Western Australia regarding daylight-saving; it is a State matter. My colleagues from Western Australia the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), with whom I have discussed this, and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) support what I have said. They believe that it is a States' rights matter, and the people of the State have spoken on two occasions in referenda. If the circumstances have changed so radically, as the honourable member for Perth and the honourable member for Stirling claim, then perhaps it is time for another referendum on the issue. Regarding the question of uniformity across Australia, I suggest that this House would be better served by-",34
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Order! The time for debate has expired. The Bill will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA (MEMBERSHIP OF ASSOCIATIONS) BILL 1990 Second Reading,36
41,Mr CHARLES,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Industrial Relations (Membership of Associations) Bill 1990 will give legislative effect to the concept of voluntary union membership, voluntary membership of industry associations and the true end to the closed shop in Australia. The Bill is legislation at least two decades, if not more, out of its time. It is a Bill which should have been introduced in this House, passed and enacted in the middle of this century, not in its dying years. Except for the Australian Council of Trade Unions, union officials, delegates, shop stewards, safety officers et cetera, who make up the union bureaucracy, there are very few people in this country who believe any longer that compulsory union membership-the closed shop-has any place in Australian industrial relations. It is largely the high degree of unionism in the public sector of our country which props up the entire system. A research poll by the Roy Morgan Research Centre, published on 8 November 1989, indicated that 87 per cent of the general population believes that union membership should be voluntary and that 82 per cent of union members hold the same view. There is, of course, no logical reason why individuals, groups of individuals, associations or companies should be compelled to join or be members of any association. Such compulsion is, in fact, undemocratic. This Bill is an act to ensure that in Australia, in the future, membership of associations will be truly voluntary. This Bill is clearly intended to give effect to community and individual concerns. We shall once and for all be finished with the outdated and draconian implications and costly practical results of the closed shop. I remind honourable members that the closed shop is true restraint of trade and should represent a violation under the Trade Practices Act. Over and over I have said that this is 1991, not 1891, and the time has long since passed when we gave away those attitudes to industrial relations which were fostered during the industrial revolution, and as a result of what we would today call inhumane treatment of employees by business owners and managers during the late 1800s and very early 1900s. Those times have gone and the majority of management throughout the developed world well recognises the value and contribution of the human work force to any company or enterprise operation. Over time we have become increasingly aware of the social responsibility of employers and the enterprise responsibility of employees. Both have learned that they must work together for the common good of the enterprise, and share the economic gains of the enterprise through wages and conditions of employment for employees, and a share of the profits for the owners who have invested in the enterprise. In Australia today, as in general throughout the industrialised world, union membership is in a long term decline. Between May 1982 and August 1990 the proportion of employees belonging to unions in our country fell from 49.5 cent to 40.5 per cent. The proportion union membership in the private sector down to 31 per cent. Among female emto ployees it is down to less than 35 per cent, and among those aged 15 to 19 years it is down to 25 per cent and falling. Among casual employees it is only 19 cent. No doubt, if the Public Service to be freed up, union membership would fall even more rapidly. I am led to believe that many on the eastern Virginia. other side of this House and those within the union bureaucracy view my contribusociety tion to the national debate on industrial relations as being to the extreme right. Personally, I find it difficult to understand the rationale behind such an hypothesis, as I ,view this private member's Bill being nothing other than a moderate, middle-of-the-road proposal to give equal, indivi<;lual human rights to individuals our Australian society. Many members of the Australian Labor Party constantly remind us of their lower or middle class socio-economic backhis grounds. I share with those members opconstruction posite such a heritage. My three decadesin plus of active working life began as a soefit called exploited youth in a so-called dustrial sweatshop. From that point, working life spanned such experiences as labourer, carpenter, draftsman, welder, fitter and turner, trainee, foreman, engiests themselves? neer, manager and managing director. In my working life, which spans four continents and almost countless countries, had not, until I arrived in Australia, covered any system of labour law which was as incomprehensible and against the best interests of employees as the system of labour relations which we employ in Australia. That system is, of course, cenindustrial trally, bureaucratically and legally conadopt trolled. The fact that we legally allow, and in some cases legally enforce, compulsory union membership is beyond my comprehension. Even as a piece rate paid labourer in the potato fields of south-eastern Virginia, I could not imagine anything worse than being required to join a union of my fellows and allowing the union hierarchy to negotiate for me my wages and condiper tions of employment. Under the Austraof lian system of national awards and an is accord between those who were supposed represent my interests and the Federal Government, I would not have had a job because no-one would have been able to afford to employ me. There is no possiper bility that any national agreement on were wages and conditions of employment could have satisfied the economic imperatives of the potato industry in southIt is indeed a sad reflection on our that we allow in this day and age a violation of human rights wherein we require an individual to become a member of a union of his peers before he is entitled to accept a position of employas ment. How sad it is that a farmer who has been driven by economic circumstances from his farm to the city and who in wishes only employment where he can use his skills and his ability and desire to work hard for the wages he is able to obtain is required to join a union and pay union dues before he is allowed on a site in a major capital city our country. If unions are for the benof employees, if they exist to advance in the case of working men and women, then my why should employees or contractors be forced to join a union when they are quite willing and able to look after their interAs long as we allow and condone comI pulsory union membership, we allow and discondone union management bureaucracy which is under no compulsion to look after the best interests of its membership. I have no doubt that unions have a place and a role to play in whatever system of relations labour law we finally in Australia. But that place should be one of service to its membership, not one of dominance, coercion or legal requirement for compliance in membership. As companies must compete in the marketplace for purchasers of their goods and services, so should unions be required to compete for their membership in the market for labour. If employees decide to negotiate individually employment contracts with management, why not? If groups of employees decide to negotiate conditions of employment with management, why not? If employees decide to form groups of unions or join a national union body to negotiate with employers, why not? Why must we have any system of compulsion with respect to wage and employment condition determination? The answer is that we need not. There are many on the other side of this House and many in the Senate who agree with my sentiments. I call on those members of the House and of the Senate who agree that compulsory union membership or compulsory membership of any association is a denial of basic rights to join with me and support my private member's Bill for voluntary membership of associations. I thank the House, and I look forward to honourable members' support.",36
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Atkinson-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak later.,38
43,Mr COURTICE,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"I totally oppose this private member's Bill-the Industrial Relations (Membership of Associations) Bill. I find it one of the most objectionable Bills that have ever come before this House. I am very proud to stand up and support compulsory membership of unions and of associations and to fight for the very principles we fought for 100 years to achieve in this country: that is, the right for working men and women to have decent conditions to live under. Those conditions have been achieved only through the establishment of the trade union movement in this country and the political arm of the trade union movement, which is the Australian Labor Party. Over the past 6,000 years of civilisation we have seen slavery-and, sadly, still see it today in many nations of the worldpeople who are oppressed, and countries without freedom. It is only in those nations where we have a strong and viable union movement that we actually have democracy. I suggest to those people who support this Bill that they talk to Lech Walesa and the Polish workers, who got rid of communism through the strength of the union movement. Throughout the tough times of the last 10 years, members on both sides of the House were proud of the way in which those Polish steelworkers and shipbuilders stuck up for freedom. This issue goes further than just a private member's Bill. It demonstrates what is different in philosophy between the Labor Party and the Opposition. There is a massive difference in attitudes towards the working men and women of this country. There is no doubt that, if compulsory membership is dissipated and the union movement membership becomes weaker, the unions will have a harder job financially representing the work force. But it goes even further than that because there are other associations that are compulsory, and I have belonged to one. Canefarmers in Queensland belong to a compulsory union; we are all members of the Queensland canegrowers organisation. On this premise, of course, the levies they pay compulsorily would also be waived and we would see the great work that the Queensland canegrowers do disappear. If it were voluntary, people would simply say, 'Well, things are tough; we won't belong to that association'.  Intosh, President of Burnett Queensland Grain Growers Association. This is the first time and probably will be the only time that Mr MCIntosh and I agree. He certainly does not belong to my philosophy. About the grain industry he says: The industry must make the freeloaders pay, because the QGGA members are sick and tired of contributing all the funds while other people sit back and let them pay, while the freeloaders get all the benefits for nothing. I endorse those views, as Ido with regard to the attitude that all canefarmers take about their association. Of course, what is repugnant about people who accept rises and the benefits that flow through from unions and their representation and from the members who actually contriband ute is that they are happy to have a ride. It takes money to take applications to the Commission; it takes money to fight for workers' conditions; and if bership drops the unions are less able do it. I am fully aware that the philosophy the other side of the House is to bring voluntary agreements. No individuals, five or six or 10 people, can represent themselves in any negotiation with emthat ployers as adequately as a union can. Firstly, they do not have the expertise; they do not have the skills. Worse than that, I challenge anyone who has the other view to tell me how, in a recession, a group of sawmill workers can sit down with their employer and negotiate anyfarming thing that would be beneficial to them. The only income they would receive would be much less than they have now. What voluntary agreements do is take away the Union. conditions that have taken 100 years of fighting to achieve. It is interesting that the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) menand tioned what it was like working in Virearly ginia. While I have never worked there, am fully aware of what it was like workowners ing in Virginia in 1860. The workers had voluntary agreements there too, but they were in chains, and it took Abraham Linper coln to change that structure. The honourbanned able member mentioned other countries that he thinks have a more flexible and better system of working. We should also remember the Triangle fire in the United States. A group of women were working in a textile factory, where they were locked in for something like 12 hours a day. fire broke out and they were burnt to death. Those sorts of things cannot hapthey pen any more, and certainly cannot hapdistrict. pen in this country because we have a strong trade union movement. Prior to 1891, of course, we did have organised labour and we did not have a political arm to represent the working men and women in this country. The conditions that have flowed on since pay then have come only through the representation of the union movement and the Labor Party. If those things were to change if we did not have a strong union free movement today, we would go back to that very same position. Human nature does not change. People may become more memeloquent, people may be better dressed, to but the fact is that human nature has not changed in 6,000 years. Anyone who on thinks it has need go only to places such in as South Korea, the Eastern bloc counno tries and some of the countries in the South Americas and Africa to see that is exactly what happens when there is not a strong trade union movement and a political party that is prepared to fight for the working men and women. Closer to home, in my city of Bundaberg I am very proud to say that my family has been involved in organised labour, as well as and the sugar industry, for some 100 years. In fact, my grandfather's brother, the late Fred Courtice, was the first organiser for the Sugar Workers At that time we had competition in the workplace between the sons of European immigrants who were looking for work voluntary agreements set up by the plantation owners. Those voluntary I agreements were between the plantation and men from the South Sea islands. It was called Kanaka labour and it was slavery. They were paid 10 shillings year and Fairymead plantation, which my great-uncle from entering because he was trying to fight for organised labour, actually set up its own religion. Kanakas were paid 10 shillings per year and were sold tickets to heaven for 10 shillings per year, and so the 10 shillings were taken back. They worked six days A per week for nothing, and on Sundays, to get around the archaic laws of the day, were released to wander around the That went on until 1906. It was phased out after 1906, only because of the Sugar not Workers Union, which became the Australian Workers Union in 1913, and with the election of the T. J. Ryan Labor Government in 1915. That is how those conditions changed. I quote from an article referring to what Uncle Fred said in those early days. It states: At Bonna, men had to work from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. six days a week, the only concession a 4 p.m. finishing time on Saturdays. He ted Buss Brothers provided good food. At dale, 58 hours work was expected for one pound ($2) per week plus rations, with a tin of jam supposed to last the men for a week. That is the sort of attitude that existed prior to the union movement and the Labor Party getting established, and that is the sort of attitude that would exist again. I have no hesitation in opposing this Bill and opposing voluntary agreements. There is no doubt that we need to be flexible in the workplace, and the trade union movement has demonstrated that, but only the union movement can adequately represent the hopes and aspirations of the working men and women in negotiation with their employers and the Government. That is what has happened over the past eight years under the Hawke Government. We have seen common sense between the workers, the unions and the employers. That is why non-farm unit labour costs have been reduced by some 10 per cent in real terms since Labor came to office. That is why, with the support of the trade union movement, we have been able to see inflation come down, as was announced yesterday, to the historic low level of 4.9 per cent. Even if the figures for the next quarter are half as good as those of the last quarter, we will come in at about 3.8 per cent for the year. That gives companies an opportunity to be more competitive. It gives our economy a better opportunity to be placed in the world scene, and that has come about through cooperation between the trade union movement and employers, whether it be the Confederation of Australian Industry or the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Government. That is what it is about. It is sad that there is a psychological attitude exhibited by honourable members opposite to still want to stand on the working men and women of the country, as has always been the case. The real difference in this House is that honourable members opposite represent capital and we represent labour. By that, I mean being that honourable members opposite repreadmitsent greed, and I am very proud to say Avon- that we represent manhood and womanhood. That has not changed, and it never will.",38
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,Mr Cowan)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,40
45,Mr ATKINSON,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Isaacs) (11.33 a.m.)I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the Industrial Relations (Membership of Associations) Bill 1990 and I congratulate the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) on his hard work and initiative in bringing this Bill before the House. I find it interesting that the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) supports compulsory union membership. Most honourable members on his side of the House would say that compulsory membership of unions does not exist. At the outset, I wish to place on the record my disbelief that the need still exists in 1991 to debate this matter. It amazes me that, in a democratic society such as ours, freedom of choice with regard to union membership is not an entrenched feature of our industrial relations system. In 1991, compulsory unionism has no place in our society. This Bill before the House gives legislative effect to the concept of voluntary union membership, and I am certain that such a concept would have the support of the Australian community. Indeed, as the honourable member for La Trobe stated in his speech, a recent Roy Morgan Research Centre survey indicated that 87 per cent of Australians support voluntary unionism and that 82 per cent of union members support voluntary union membership. This country has a proud history of upholding democratic traditions and supporting and encouraging the individual. Central to our democratic tradition is the right of freedom of association. As part of its industrial relations history, Australia has had a strong and active union movement. The right to form and join unions has been an essential part of our industrial system, but the right not a union has never been entrenched into our system. In 1991, it is time that we corrected the ledger. The trade union movement has a legitimate and central role to play in the Aus. tralian system of industrial relations, and unions have achieved many worthwhile reforms and concessions for their members. As one who supports the great democratic traditions, of which freedom of association is a central feature, I would defend the right of any Australian to join a trade union but, equally, I would defend the right of any Australian not to join a trade union. Surely, in a democratic society, both rights must be guaranteed under the law of the land. Unionism in Australia is declining. The decline has been caused by union bureaucrats who have lost touch with their own membership. Union membership has fallen to just over 40 per cent of the work force and in the private sector it has slumped to 31 per cent. If it were not for de facto compulsory unionism which exists in the public sector, the union movement in Australia would be facing a complete crisis. The decline has come about because union bureaucrats have attempted to protect their own vested interests. They have forgotten that their main role is to secure a fair wage and good and safe conditions for their members. To highlight my point that the trade union leadership has lost touch with its own constituency, I remind the House of the fiasco currently taking place in my home State of Victoria. Honourable members will recall the disgraceful actions of Martin Ferguson, President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), and John Halfpenny, Secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, who in January of this year attempted to extort $10 000 from Tennis Australia in return for' an Australian Tennis Open free of interference from unions and the antiapartheid movement. The letter of demand appeared on ACTU letterhead. One can only hope that the Victorian Opposition pursues this matter to its rightful conclusions. Such actions by the ACTU highlight why ordinary Australians should to join not be compelled to join a union. I believe that the vast majority of Australians-unionists and non-unionists alike-would be ashamed of the actions of Martin Ferguson and John Halfpenny. Yet under today's industrial relations system many Australians are forced against their will to pay subscriptions to unions affiliated to the ACTU. Hardworking Australians want nothing to do with the type of behaviour displayed by Ferguson and Halfpenny, and this is why this legislation is both necessary and long overdue. Those who advocate compulsory unionism fail to realise that our, industrial society has changed dramatically during the course of the last century. In today's industrial society, employers and employees need not be at loggerheads; in the vast majority of cases, management and employers are fully aware of the value and contribution of employees. In 1991, most employers and employees wish to work together for the common good of the enterprise so that all parties can benefit from the success of the business. In most cases, there is no need for unions to negotiate wages and conditions, as this can be successfully achieved between employer and employee. The fact that 60 per cen- of Australians are not members of UnIons must be a clear indication that many employees are capable of negotiating satisfactory wages and conditions; so why waste money paying union subscriptions when employees can negotiate directly with their employers? I am amused when I hear the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) attempt to denigrate the Liberal and National parties by describing those on this side of the House as conservatives. The truth is that the Australian Labor Party is the conservative party when it comes to the issue of. industrial relations. It will not move WIth the times; it will not accept that many of the features of Australia's industrial system belong to a time long past. In 1991 this Labor Government continues to s-pport a centralised wage fixing system, outdated and inefficient work practices and compulsory unionism-as we heard from the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) a little earlier. It has immersed itself in an ised labour system that it is afraid to change. The Labor Party is afraid to implement change. It owes too many favours to its mates in - the union movement. Many Australians are compelled and, in some cases, coerced to join a trade union. The trade union they are forced to join will be affiliated with the ACTU and, therefore, affiliated with the Labor Party. Many Australians are dismay€d that a proportion of their union subscriptions are donated to the Australian Labor Party. This is surely most undemocratic and one of the most objectionable aspects of compulsory unionism in Australia. It clearly explains why this Labor Government is unwilling to introduce reform in this area and why the Labor Party will not support this Bill. Earlier in my speech I said that I would defend the right of any Australian to join a union. I believe that unions have played, and will continue to play, a valuable role within our industrial relations and sociopolitical systems. However, the union movement must be willing to be part of a free market. Like business, it must be subject to the laws of demand and supply. If people wish to join a union, so be itas long as it is of their free choice. There must be no compulsion. Unions must offer a service to their membership and, like businesses, they must compete in the market. If their product is good, they will have no trouble in attracting members. The days of institutionalised labour are over. The Labor Party must now move with the times. This Bill offers a challenge to the Labor Party. This Government has espoused the virtues of deregulation with regard to the private sector. We have witnessed the deregulation of the banking industry. The Government has flirted with the concept of privatisation, and most recently we have listened to the Government preach about the removal of tariffs. This Bill fers the Government the opportunity to embrace the concept of deregulation within the labour market and to relegate the 'closed shop' to the history book of Australian industrial relations. I urge honourable members to support this priinstitutional- vate member's Bill.",40
46,Ms CRAWFORD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"I rise to speak in opposition to the Industrial Relations (Membership of Associations) Bill, which, I draw to the attention of the House, raises the issue of the denial of the right of free speech in a democratic society, which is surely a proposition that cannot be supported here. Any debate on this provision must be constrained by the fact that the question of the breadth of the particular provision which it is proposed to delete from the Act is currently before the High Court of Australia. However, we are of the view that the provision goes no further than the common law concept of scandalising the court and that the defence of fair comment is available to any action undertaken under the provision. Such a provision is not uncommon in other Commonwealth legislation. A similar provision existed in the now repealed Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The same wording is used in provisions of legislation applying to the Coal Industry Tribunal, the Defence Force Disciplinary Appeals Tribunal and the local coal authorities. I wonder whether honourable members opposite suggest that all those provisions, and hence those tribunals and authorities, should be disbanded. But what is really at the heart of the repeal of this provision is a questioning of the whole notion of the rights of Australians in the context of the Industrial Relations Commission and the rights of Australians to join trade unions and to find support within that. For us on this side of the House, the right to join a trade union, to participate in a trade union, and to find unity in the work force is at the very heart of our existence: it is at the heart of the Labor movement. Having just celebrated our centenary at Barcaldine, where we saw the troops brought in yet again to fight the of- work force-which saw the birth of the Labor Party-we hear now, 100 years later, the same proposition pursued by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in terms of the Opposition's industrial relations policy: 'If waterfront reform does not happen, we will bring in the troops'. It is the same thing which saw the very birth of our movement and the right of ordinary men and women to work with honour and dignity. I am constantly amazed at the discussions which emanate from the other side and in which 1hey raise the issue of unions, unions which are affiliated with the Labor Party, and the way in which those processes operate. Of course, we never hear of the way in which big business is allied to business organisations which make very large donations to the Liberal Party. All of this is fair and just. This is what a democratic society is all about and it is what Australians have fought for-the right of free speech. It is a nonsense to suggest that unified labour, which supports a particular Party on this side of the House, is wrong, and that big business, which supports a particular Party on the other side of the House, is correct. It is an absolute nonsense. the kind of confrontationist policy which we have seen, which I saw when growing up through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, and which has placed Australia in the kind of industrial backyard that it is in now. We have heard much about the arguments for enterprise bargaining. Indeed, the difficulties with enterprise bargaining have come from the heart of the actual business corps. I am constantly amazed when we hear people ask, 'Why should people join unions? They can negotiate with employers themselves'. Nonsense! We all have anecdotal evidence. We all know the kind of power that employers have over people, particularly in times when fewer jobs are available-workers are told they will take a cut or there will be no job. Reality! I attend a chamber of commerce in my local electorate where local business people stand up and say, 'Isn't it good. None of these people belong to unions. You can pay them what you like'. And they do. They espouse that as being something that is good, valuable and, even worse, a smart business practice. I say that it is exploitation. The need for our unions and the union movement to protect the rights of workers and the conditions under which they work is now as strong as ever. It is true that the unions have declining membership. One of the reasons for that is that over a period of time, because of the struggle of unions for the kinds of rights that they have achieved, people take the conditions which they enjoy now for granted. They do not understand where their award wages came from; where sick leave came from; where recreational leave came from; or where any of their other rights and conditions came from. Many of our young people assume that they have always been so, not that some of them are only a mere 10, 15 or 20 years old. When people are in crisis, whom are the first people they turn to? It is the unions. They say, 'I am not a member of the union, but can you help?'. It is the same cry all the time. Those very same It is people who are not members of a union are quick to take the pay rises, to take the award conditions, to take the health benefits and to take the occupational health and safety benefits. If we are going to be preferential about such treatment, let us be fully preferential and say that only those people who are members of unions get the same benefits, in the same way as it is only members of business organisations who participate in their processes who get the same sorts of rights. But we have heard all the arguments about preferential clauses. I am particularly interested to read that the father of laissez-faire business, Adam Smith, back in 1776-perhaps before the founding of Australia-exhorted all of us to look at the way in which people treat labour: All for ourselves and nothing for other people, seems, in every age of the world, to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind. Indeed, such a notion is still very much prevalent. Further he said: Our merchants and master-manufacturers complain much of the bad effects of high wages in raising the price, and thereby lessening the sale of their goods both at home and abroad. They say nothing concerning the bad effects of high profits. They are silent with regard to the cious effects of their own gains. They complain only of those of other people. How right that is! In this House we have heard constantly, and have read on the front pages of the printed media, that the reason manufacturers are unable to export is the high wages they pay their workers. That is a nonsense, and yesterday proved it, once again, in terms of the low inflation rate, which is lower than most of our competitors. Indeed the very countries which members of the Opposition emulate-Germany and Japan-have very strong and powerful labour move the ments. Indeed there are mega-unions the within Germany which play a significant and role in terms of negotiating or enterprise bargaining and membership of unions. At the heart of the criticism of the Into dustrial Relations Commission, of its exthe istence and of this very Bill is an onslaught on the whole notion of the way in which from private homes. industrial relations in this country operate. It is imperative that members on this side of the House remain true to our traing dition. It is often said that we on this are now lawyers, teachers and doctors. Indeed we are, because for 100 years people in the labour movement fought and struggled so that we might education and have part of the gains in the society in which they worked. I have great pride in the fact that I was entitled and able to get a university education because I worked for it and because people fought and struggled. It was not because my parents were rich-they were notmake but because we have a society which, through the hard work of the labour traced. movement, has seen every Australian thieving treated with equality and dignity. The tions of equality and of people being treated fairly and w-th dignity are inherwell ent in the Australian Labor Party. This industrial relations amendment Bill is an attempt to undermine the whole process in which the Industrial Relations Commission is part and parcel of the opfinancial eration of the industrial relations strucsured. ture with Australia. The Government sault rejects this out of hand, and hopes that the labour movement will go from strength to strength. I hope that we never see again pernithe troops out fighting the workers of this country, which is the promise of the Leader of the Opposition.",42
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Mr Cowan)The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA Debate resumed from 21 February, on those of motion by Mr Scholes: That this House: (1) is concerned at the enormous growth in the amount of goods stolen from private homes and apparent failure of police forces to uncover disposal networks which clearly must exist; (2) calls on the Minister for Justice to establish a special Commonwealth/State task force drawn from the various law enforcement organisations carry out a comprehensive investigation into movement of, and subsequent disposal of, the extremely large amounts of goods being stolen",44
48,Mr CAMPBELL,DISPOSAL OF STOLEN GOODS,"I rise to support the motion relatto the disposal of stolen goods, brought side forward by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). I commend the honourable member for this motion. I know it is an issue that he has been conhave an cerned about for some time. It is clear that the stealing of goods is imposing a massive cost on Australia of probably something like $200m in excess insurance premiums alone. I do not think that it is beyond the power of man's ingenuity to devise a scheme which would it much harder for stolen goods to be sold or disposed of, or easier to be It has been suggested that a lot of is the result of drugs. Frankly I nodoubt that very much; it is much more likely to be, and has the hallmarks of, a organised plan where groups of people move into a house, often in broad daylight, and strip it completely. That has a devastating effect on the owners of the property; it often puts them into a strained position if they are not fully inIt leaves them with a sense of ason their person, because many people regard their homes as very much their castles and extensions of themselves. If we are to be genuine about tackling this issue, there must be a method of marking general household goods. I think it is feasible to stamp all Australian niture sold with numbers that could not easily be removed, and that would lead to the furniture being traceable. Numbers are already impressed into electronic items, and if people were to take the trouble to register those items, it would help to protect them, and the country, and it would bring down the high costs imposed by this dangerous and discomforting practice of thievery. In passing I note the comments made by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) who tried to turn debate on this sensible motion into an attack on the Victorian Government, as though this problem occurs only in Victoria. The honourable member cited the example of police staffing in Ballarat, but I would many places in Australia could claim to be understaffed in respect of the police. I notice that the police staffing level in Ballarat is higher than that of Kalgoorlie, which is, I would suggest, a town that would have more problems requiring police attention than Ballarat. I wonder whether it is because Western Australian police are more efficient than the Victorians. I doubt that, although I note that Western Australia does many things much better than the rest of Australia. . Mr Broadbent-Thanks very much.",44
49,Mr CAMPBELL,DISPOSAL OF STOLEN GOODS,There is no doubt about that. I could go on at great length about what Western Australia does better. Mr Broadbent-Victoria has the best police force in Australia bar none.,45
50,Mr CAMPBELL,DISPOSAL OF STOLEN GOODS,"The Western Australian Police Force is also very good. It seems that in his attack on the Victorian Government, the honourable member for Ballarat is actually also attacking the torian police. If we were to devote our attention to this issue, we could tackle We are faced throughout Australia with a misallocation of police resources. I do not blame the police for this; in fact, I blame State governments. In my view road traffic infringement charges, for example, are used as revenue raising devices and not for road safety purposes. I note that the multanova camera, beloved of the Victorian State Government and introduced refur- cently into Western Australia, is often placed in locations where everybody gets caught. On freeways, for example, there is a tendency for traffic to be moving at such a speed that everyone is caught. I do not see any addition to road safety at all in this, and it is a practice I would very much discourage. It locks up police numbers that could be better used in other areas. I get back to this proposal to register all items or have a catalogue. I do not believe it is necessarily the role of government to become involved here. The big gainers here will be insurance companies, which, as big contributors to the fire-fighting capacity of Australia, have, I believe, a responsibility to look at this issue to see say what they can do to remedy it or greatly reduce it. I know it can be done. In Australia we are alarmed at the increase in the incidence of car theft. The same phenomenon occurred in Ireland some years ago. I spoke to a fellow recently who has some knowledge of the situation and who said that there was a large push in Ireland to get all vehicles fitted with antitheft devices. These varied in sophistication, but there is no doubt that this move massively reduced the incidence of car theft in Ireland. I believe the same thing could be done in this country and also in respect of household goods. I think the population generally has a responsibility to try to protect itself, and it is beholden on householders to make their houses as burglar proof as possible and to observe all the guidelines issued by the various police forces, which tell people what to do. When we flaunt our absence from home we are asking for trouble, not only as it Vicimpacts on ourselves, but also as it impacts on the whole of society. It is simply it. not good enough to say, 'I have a right to be left unaffected. I have a right to be safe from this sort of thievery'. Theft does occur in society; it is an unfortunate facet of society. We have a responsibility to make efforts to protect ourselves to the best of our ability. I believe that those efforts are, and should be, rewarded by means of insurance rebates. In respect of motor cars I believe that we should look at rebates on registration. After all, a large amount of work for police forces and others in society results from the stealing of vehicles, and the state would actually save money if it could discourage vehicle thefts. Stolen cars are often taken by young people for joy riding. It will be very hard to stop the professional thief who seems to be able to keep up with the technology; but if we can delay people who steal cars for a joy ride, just for a few minutes, we will thwart them because they will go off and look for something else. I make the point-I do not think I can make it too strongly-that people have a responsibility to ensure that they protect their property and put it beyond the easy reach of thieves. It is quite clear that the stolen goods must go somewhere. We hear of people having their houses cleaned out-lounge suites, beds, the whole lot. Those things are not flogged across the bar at the local pub; those things are not shoved off to the corner fence. Somehow or other, there must be a method of disposing of those goods. It has been suggested that these are thefts by people who want the stuff for their own use. It is possible that some are, but I believe that they are very much a minority. People in that desperate situation usually do not have the wherewithal to organise thievery on the scale on which it is occurring. The honourable member for Corio cited some figures which showed that the loss to Australia from theft amounts to well over $1 billion a year. That is a real cost, just as the lack of waterfront reform is a cost. It is a cost that impacts on every facet of our society and imposes strains on the whole economy. It is something that we must look at. I commend the motion. I think the honourable member for Corio has done a great job. I know that it has been an area of concern of his for some time.",45
51,Mr BROADBENT,DISPOSAL OF STOLEN GOODS,"I rise to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) regarding the disposal of stolen goods, not because I believe that the task force he has proposed will achieve the aims he desires, but because, by introducing this matter for debate in the House, he is reflecting his community's concern at the rising crime rate in the area he represents. I also represent a Melbourne electorate, but I represent an electorate on the other side of the bay from Coriothe seat of Corinella. We are also understaffed in terms of police numbers in that electorate. We have the same problem that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) suggested exists throughout Australia-insufficient public funds to support the police forces in the way we would desire. In a telephone conversation with me about this motion this morning, the honourable member for Corio said, 'People are now worried about the protection of their own homes'. Today in Australia, community standards have been so lowered that it is not just a case of criminals stealing goods and wrecking homes-I will come to my own experience in a moment-but also these goods are being received by other people. Whether they are being ordered or sold in a hotel or sold on the street, I am not sure. At the moment my inquiries of police officers I know are not suggesting to me that there is a major movement of goods across borders or into other townships. Goods are, rather, locally sold. That means people in the community are entering into crimes by buying stolen goods. People do not sell a $1,500 stereo television over the counter in the local pub. Obviously someone is taking orders for those televisions and then stealing them and delivering them to people. I want to mention the experience of my family; I think the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) mentioned his experience. A number years ago we had a short holiday. Who knows how the people who robbed my house found out that we were having a short holiday? Was it through kids - t school? Was there just a bit of loose talk about it? We do not see in the local paper any more that soand-so is going on a holiday. Our place was robbed, damaged, ransacked. What valuables were in the home-and I will not go into that-were taken. For anybody who is listening now who would like to steal again from my home, I would like to let them know that the colour television is about 10 years old and the video recorder is about four or five years old and is one of the old models which require buttons to be pressed. No other valuables are kept in the home. What was there, including a modest coin collection of my wife's, is now gone. The coin collection went with the culprits who took the rest of the goods and destroyed the inside of the home. The television, which we picked up out of the front paddock at our place, is still there. There considerable damage, but the hurt and pain that was experienced not only by my wife but also by the kids-being in an outer area and in a fairly remote spotwas very hard. We had to introduce all sorts of security measures. I want to return to the Bill and what is happening in the area of crime. I am speaking not only of Victoria. Yes, Victoria is having a tough time financially because of the mistakes of the Cain-Kirner Government, but let us talk about what is happening in Brisbane. I was up there a few weeks ago and made some inquiries. As I knocked on a few doors with a friend of mine in the Nundah by-election, one of the major concerns that came forward was that in Brisbane there has been a 25 per cent increase in crime within the last six months, while at the same time youth unemployment has risen to 36 per cent, an increase of 10 per cent in one month. I do not know whether there is a correlation between those two, but I would put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that sometimes idle hands are not put to the best use. The honourable member for Corio said that 10 per cent of the population of Australia is affected by break-ins; between 1,700 and 1,800 dwellings per 100,000 were broken into in 1988-89. In 1989, as was suggested by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, purportedly the value of the goods stolen in burglaries was $ 1.2 billion across Australia. That means one in 100 Australian homes will be burgled this year, with an average loss of $1,000, and every Australian will pay an extra $50 in insurance because of these burglaries. Burglaries are happening in every street in every township across Australia. We as a community have taken a stand via our taxes, through our police forces that we cannot afford to fund enough. We as a community have introduced such programs as Neighbourhood Watch. I commend anybody who has taken part in Neighbourhood Watch and the Rural Watch program that is now working in Victoria. Many members of this House was have supported the programs in their own areas, as I have. I was one of the inaugural members of Neighbourhood Watch in our area. We have achieved dramatic gains and are very well supported by our local police force. But we as a community are buying the stolen goods. Somebody is buying the stolen goods. We must be prepared to raise our standards and not to look at the criminal as a victim, as we often do. How many times do members of the public say that the people who have been robbed are the victims, that they would like to see stricter penalties, would like to see people brought to account and would like to see the police given more powers. As we make contact with our constituents, as in Nundah in Queensland and Corinella in Victoria, we find that this is a major concern of people. The first concern of people in the Nundah by-election is the Hawke-Keating Government. People are not voting on State issues; they are going to send a message to this House via that by-election. But the second concern is law and order. There is a great concern in our community for law and order. Representatives in this House and in the State Houses are being asked to have regard to the issue of law and order. I come back to my situation in Victoria. A promise of 10,000 police was made by the then Minister, Mr Crabb, to support the concern he obviously noticed throughout the community. To this date there are only 9,200 police in Victoria. In 1990 there were 800 recruits, but there were also 457 resignations and 81 retirements. So there is frustration within the force also about its responsibilities in matter. Today in Australia we have many social problems. This is only one of them. I would like to think that, because this motion has come before the House, there will be renewed efforts for changes in our community to stop this breaking into and pillaging of homes. I have experienced this and I know the discontent it creates. The concern is not only the major items we lose that are resold; in our case we lost a Mickey Mouse money box that had been in our home for 20 years. I thank the State Bank of Victoria. When it became known, through one of my friends, that my wife had lost that money box we received from the State Bank display department a brand new Mickey Mouse money box. We have now lost that bank. Those Mickey Mouse money boxes will not be going into households in Victoria because that bank is now owned by the Commonwealth Bank. I hope the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), who is about to speak, has received a letter from me telling him that the Commonwealth Bank is about to retrench people in that display department. There was a promise from Mrs Kirner and from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that there would be no forced retrenchments in the State Bank of Victoria. In fact, the officer concerned said, 'We want you all out'. That is a shame for the State Bank people because they are experts in their field, on the technical side, in support of the State Bank of Victoria. The fact is that we are now losing $1.2 billion in goods and, although the honourable member would like a national task force, I do not think it would achieve his aim. However, I believe that Australians will be better off because this matter has been drawn to the attention of the House.",46
52,Mr GEAR,DISPOSAL OF STOLEN GOODS,"I rise to support the motion before the House, although I must say that I have reservations about it, mainly because I believe the topic is one more readily addressed by State governments than by Federal governments. I agree with many this of the other speakers that, to the extent that we have stolen goods taken from houses throughout Australia, I doubt whether there is a large, national organisation doing the stealing. Therefore, the scope for the Fed-ral Government to become directly involved may be more one of coordination than addressing the day to day problems of crime. I read the speech of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), who made a number of very good points. Like the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent), my house has been broken into and I have also had a car stolen. So, like the honourable member, I speak from personal experience. In my case I was rather fortunate in that no damage was actually done to the house, except for a broken window where the thieves entered the house. The State police who came along to investigate did tell me that they were not surprised to get a call from my house. Prior to my house being broken into, a lady two suburbs away came home after dropping her children at school and actually interrupted the thieves, who by that time had the stolen goods on the back table ready to take them out of the property. Because they were interrupted by the occupant of the house, the police thought, 'Well, they have an order for these goods, so they are bound to steal them from someone else.' In my case, I lost a couple of television sets, the video, the hi-fi, a camera and a few other things. It is the belief of the police that these people take orders. There are people out there willing to buy the stolen goods at a much reduced rate. The thieves go into the homes and take just the items they are looking for. As I said, in my case I was lucky as they did not do any damage to the house apart from a broken window; but they did make a mess and it is not one of the most pleasant experiences in life to come home and find that one's house has been broken into. Luckily, I was insured and the insurance company was very good in that it replaced the goods within a week. There is no doubt that housebreaking is a community problem. I do not think that talking about the numbers in our police force is the only answer. Of course, it is always good to have more resources rather than fewer. The honourable member for Corinella touched on the Neighbourhood Watch programs that are in operation around Australia. Because housebreaking is a community problem, those programs hold out the best hope for addressing the problem. In my electorate of Canning, we have started up several Neighbourhood Watch programs and they are going particularly well. As local members of parliament, I believe we could playa valuable role in helping Neighbourhood Watch. Certainly, we have the resources to help get the message out to the people in the areas concerned and I have been able to do that. Like a lot of other people, I had been to Neighbourhood Watch meetings a number of times and heard police constables talk about how we should mark the valuables in our houses with our driver's licence numbers, but I never actually did it until it happened tome. The new equipment that I received from the insurance company now has that mark on it, and I wish I had done it before. It asked me at the time whether I had recorded the serial numbers anywhere. I said that I had not. I have now recorded them in a book which I keep separate from the goods. One way in which we might be able to establish a trail is to require retailers-I know retailers have enough to do-to record in a book serial numbers of goods such as television sets sold by them against the names of the purchasers. In my case, I did not record a serial number and did not have a clue what the serial number was. I would say that the majority of . people in Australia do not record the serial numbers of goods purchased. We can always remember where we bought the goods and about when we bought them. If we remember that and have a way of finding out the serial number of the goods that were stolen, then at least the police have something to go with to establish a trail to trace some of these stolen goods. Certainly, if people are to help in combating break-ins, Neighbourhood Watch is the best way of going about it. The police playa very active and valuable role in that. The $1.2 billion worth of stolen goods that the honourable member for Corio spoke of is a huge national problem. That is a lot of money. To the extent that insurance companies have to make good the losses, we all bear the cost. It did not surprise me when I got my insurance premium notice for my house and contents policy to find that this year it had gone up by about $80. That $80 cost is built in and we will be paying it every year that we insure our houses. There may well be a case for Federal Government involvement where cars are stolen and stripped, made up again and sold interstate. I think there may be a case for that. Certainly, a report I read in a newspaper in the last couple of days showed how that could be done. The article was very plausible. It would seem that if a car is stolen in, say, New South Wales, it may be sold in any other State after those who know what they are doing go through a fairly simple process. It may well be that the task force that the honourable member for Corio spoke of, the joint Commonwealth-State task force, may be able to playa valuable role where that happens. As I said before, I do not think that there is an established, nationwide network dealing in furniture and electrical goods. They seem to be more the province of local gangs who work in their own areas. If anybody is going to steal these goods, there has to be somebody willing to buy them. I do not know and have not heard in any of the speeches so far what the penalties are for people who order stolen goods. It may well be that a tougheningup of those penalties may deter people from going to the local thief to get their goods instead of going down to the retailer. Without those orders, there is no real reason for people to steal the goods. There has to be a market there somewhere. If a task force is to be established, the penalties for people who order stolen goods and therefore create the market for them should be addressed. The honourable member for Corio also said that the arrest rate was about 10 per cent. He admitted that the figures were fairly sketchy, but if we accept them at face value, they show-as my experience shows-that where there is no way of identifying the goods it makes it very hard for the police. Finding goods that have been stolen, if they are unmarked or the serial number is not known, is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Previous speakers put up a case for more police. Certainly that is one way in which we could go. But when we talk about more police, we talk about more taxpayers' money. I am not sure whether that is required in terms of this motion. Certainly, if the police can get together with Neighbourhood Watch and Rural Watch, I think that is the best way of going about it. As I said at the outset, the Commonwealth has a fairly limited role to play in this, nevertheless it could be an important one.",48
53,Mr TRUSS,DISPOSAL OF STOLEN GOODS,"Wide Bay) (12.22 p.m.)The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) raises in this motion the distressing national problem of burglary and household theft. He said that every year one family in 100 is affected by break-ins and having goods stolen. That is a tragic statistic for all Australians. ularly shattering experience for those fami11es which are involved. Their pGssessions-often irreplaceable treasures and items of great sentimental value are taken. Perhaps more importantly from a psychological point of view, many families feel that their privacy has been violated and in other instances the damage done by those breaking in is even greater in value than the cost of the items that have been lost. These days, break-ins and burglaries have become such regular occurrences that they rarely even make the news. But certainly, it is a tragic experience for the families who are involved. The honourable member for Corio mentioned that in 1989 burglary cost Australia $1.2 billion. It is a major industry, but it is an industry of misery and despair. Not all families are covered by insurance. In those circumstances it guarantees that the families will move into a period of considerable debt-hire purchase bills still have to be paid and, in many instances, families are financially ruined as a result of the actions of somebody breaking into their home. The motion refers to 'disposal networks which clearly must exist'. In that regard, I guess the honourable member is referring particularly to professional gangs. I do not deny that those particular enterprises exist. Much of the burglaries, breakins and robberies are committed by amateurs-people who act on impulse, sometimes under the influence of alcohol or drugs or perhaps even as a pub-room dare. Sometimes a burglar is seeking a specific item; at other times, as a result of personal financial crisis a burglary is entered into in a desperate attempt to make ends meet in the home of the burglar. In that regard the Government is not without responsibility. The economic crisis is certainly a circumstance which tempts people to crime. In a consumer society where we offer and expect everything, people who do not have everything are sometimes tempted to take what others do have. I think poverty, of all things, is clearly the mother of crime. In the dreadful economic circumstances of our country at present, more people are placed in It is a particthat circumstance. When 844,000 people are unemployed there is a lot of idle time. In such circumstances many people use that idle time unproductively. I think that is particularly a problem for juveniles. Much of the breaking and entering that goes on is a result of young people having time on their hands. The Prime Minister said that no child would live in poverty, but we all know that the number of homeless children-the number of children living on the streets-is increasing. It is very easy for children who are homeless and living on the streets to use that idle time to do damage to other people's property. Whether it is in the pursuit of drugs or other personal needs, many young children and juveniles are leaders in this whole area of breaking and entering and causing tragedy to so many Australian families. That is really an indictment on our whole society. We have failed to support the family unit; economic circumstances force parents out to work to earn enough to raise their children and meet their needs; and single parent families sometimes battle or are unable to cope with young adults and crises in the family. There are also many other tragic stories of children being left abandoned as their parents move off to a new life. Recently read a tragic story of children coming home from school to find that their family home had been abandoned and their parthey ents had moved away. Those kinds of tragic circumstances put children in a uation where they are forced to fend for themselves. They are often led into a life of petty crime and who knows what else after that. Children are expected to be more dependent but sometimes the rebel heroes encourage them to get involved in this kind of a circumstance. Robbery is a symptom of a breakdown of our family and community way of life. I think it essential that we look at our society as whole. If we can resolve some of those difficulties we will go a long way to ing the problems of petty crime as it appears in every community. In a productive country like Australia it should never have come to this. There is plenty for all; there are plenty portunities. We need to give our young people, in particular, the opportunities take advantage of the wonderful life that Australia can offer. This motion draws attention to the of the police. The police, of course, have a thankless profession. They are criticised gard. for not making enough arrests but when they do make arrests they are accused brutality or fabricating evidence or cordebate ruption; if they happen to arrest an riginal, they are accused of being racist. That kind of attitude does not help them in carrying out their responsibilities. Like previous speakers, I commend community policing programs like Neighbourhood Watch which have helped to involve the community in ensuring their own protection. The police can do their job effectively only if they have widespread community support. These kinds of programs can be very helpful in breaking down the regime of crime that is presbasic ent in so many communities. Inquiries such as the Fitzgerald Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct have done a great deal of damage to law and order in I our community. They have helped to destroy the confidence of the community in its police force. Perhaps more particularly have damaged the police force's confidence in its future. In many regards these sorts of inquiries really fail to come to sitgrips with corruption, but many innocent reputations are destroyed. Queensland at present has a Police Minister who rarely supports his own force when it is under criticism and that kind of thing is a scanindal. More often than not, he takes the opposite side. We imported a new police commissioner from Victoria and often the commissioner, too, fails to back his own men. They prefer to believe left wing acis ademics and do-gooders rather than rea cognise the difficult role the police have in our society and the need to give them resolvthe kind of support that they need. Those sorts of things are important. Communities need to support their police forces; in particular, they need to identify with their responsibility for ensuring that of opeach member of a community cares for his own property and keeps an eye on his neighbour's property as well so that we to are all ready to take the action that is necessary to stamp out these kinds of offences. I support others who call upon the role whole community to make an effort to recognise their responsibilities in this re",50

55,Mr ANDREW,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I welcome this opportunity to participate in this grievance debate. I point out to those listening to the debate-essought pecially those in the press gallery-that, as one who is involved in the chamber the House of Representatives, I suspect that this is a much misunderstood chamstudent ber. The impression that the public has that there is very little cooperation in this chamber, that there is very little sense perspective about what the nation's desnal tiny ought to be and very little endeavour on. the part of all members to push in the same direction. This perception is not aided by the. press gallery. During debates on private memassets bers' business, the gallery is usually empty. On this occasion a representative of the Australian Associated Press (AAP) is presing ent. It is a matter of great concern to that when confrontation in this chamber is at its worse-Question Time-the pubfamilies lic galleries are packed and the press gallery is packed. For the rest of the day, when debate takes a constructive mould and people are concerned about the direcat tion the nation is taking, it is difficult find people in the press gallery, the public galleries or even the chamber itself. In referring to the cooperation that ists in this chamber, I do not want in any sense to understate the difference between the two political parties on issues such as the capital gains tax, broad-based sumption tax or the future of the Departto ment of Social Security. Of course, are total differences in perspective. There is across this chamber a recogniAs tion of the problems that are facing tralia and an attempt by the major to political parties to be accountable for the things that they advocate. It is rare, unknown, for anyone of the major parties to choose to deliberately sabotage the diset. rection being taken by the other party. For all the nonsense that is frequently spoken in this chamber-I do not excuse or exonerate myself from any of that there is, as the 148 of us would agree, an underlying sense of accountability and perspective. Against this backdrop, I want to refer to a debate that occurred in the Senate this week, a debate on Austudy and assets testing, where the Australian Democrats to deliberately sabotage the Austudy scheme. In spite of a joint parliaof mentary inquiry, which only last month handed down its recommendations· on financial assistance, recommendis ing that the assets test for Austudy ought to remain and in spite of the fact that the of Australian Democrats voted for the origiassets test which is still in place, they propose to abolish the assets test completely because they sense an air of electoral appeal about that action. The Democrats' proposal to abolish the test was, of course, motivated principally by what they saw as the present severe disadvantage being faced by farmfaniilies. Had their disallowance mome tion gone ahead they would have rubbed out the assets test for not only farming but other families as well. All of the effort that was made to target Austudy to those in real need would have been lost a cost conservatively estimated at $57m. to They did it hoping they would have the support of the Opposition, seeking to embarrass the Government, simply because they supposed that the Government would exthen be forced to reintroduce the assets test amendments in a changed form. I suggest to you that the Government conwould have been sorely tempted simply maintain the confusion that would have there then surrounded the entire Austudy scheme and blame the Opposition for it. if that were not irresponsible enough Ausof the Democrats, Senator Bell proposed disallow regulation 61, under which the rate for Austudy benefits is set. If he had if not succeeded, no-one could have received Austudy because no rate could have been In rising in this grievance debate to take issue with the action of the Australian Democrats, I do not want in any way to appear to be siding with what I think has been the Government's inaction on reforming the Austudy scheme. I simply want to reinforce my initial argument that there is in this place a measure of cooperation and I call on the Government in the interests of rural Australians to review the Austudy scheme. Frankly, rural Australia is hurting and there are children in rural Australia who will be denied a tertiary education because of the present impact of the assets test on Austudy. To have supported the Australian Democrats' motion would have been to sabotage what the Government was about and to put the entire Austudy scheme at risk. The fact that we failed to support that Democrat motion does not, in any sense, take the Government off the hook. The Government has an obligation to review immediately the Austudy scheme. In recognition of the present disadvantage that rural Australians are facing, the Opposition and the Democrats successfully moved the motion: That the Senate calls on the Government to mediately introduce emergency educational sistance in the form of hardship provisions that families excluded from Austudy by the assets test, but whose income has collapsed in the rural crisis, will not be forced to withdraw their dren from education on financial grounds. The Government should not suppose that the Opposition is content merely to move that motion. We are not pussyfooting around on this issue. We demand action from the Government in the interests rural Australians. The call for hardship provisions is tiary courses. something that the Government can act on immediately. Hardship provisions allow the Government to recognise the ircalls refutable fact that the assets test, wherever it applies, can sometimes be unfair. In fact, it allows the Government to ensure so immediately. that people who are in hardship are able to access tertiary education no matter what their assets may be. It allows the Government to offer help to the rural constituFirstly, ents of Wakefield-and of Grey, let me add. Hardship provisions already exist for the assets test on pensions and benefits. The very least the Government can do is to apply these hardship provisions to the assets test on Austudy. The rural crisis cannot wait while the Government reviews the Austudy scheme once again. The rural crisis is now. I know it, the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) knows it, and the Government needs to act upon it. Unsympathetic Government members have suggested that a $700,000 assets test in rural Australia is fair enough. 'After all, if you have got $700,000 without the house, without the curtilage around the house, surely anyone can go to the bank and borrow $20,000', I have heard from people opposite. But an assets test, set as it is at $695,000, bears no recognition of the cash flow which is, in many cases, negative in rural Australia. Let us say that a farm is valued at $900,000 without the house. That is perfectly conceivable. But let us say what is equally conceivable-that the farmer has a debt, as most farmers do, of $205,000. The owner of that $900,000 property has not got a hope in Hades of servicing that $205,000 debt in the presiment crisis, much less of being allowed to asoffer to his children the support they need so in order to access a tertiary education. Farmers are in trouble-not because of chilanything they have done, but because of Government policy on interest rates; the failure of the wool floor price scheme, particularly the failure of major markets, and the failure of wheat marketing around the world with subsidised wheat. The all of too ominous reality of a drought means that they face the uncomfortable fact of having to take their children out of terThis Government, which so proudly for a clever country, owes it to rural Australians to introduce hardship provisions on the Austudy assets test and to do Australian Citizenship",52
56,Mr ONEIL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Grey) (12.40 p.m.)let me say that it is a pleasure to follow my friend the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), who always puts a constructive case. I do not argue with him at all on the issue that he has raised because it is something that I have spoken about in the House on a number of occasions and on which I agree with him. Today, however, I want to speak about a different subject. During my time as a member of this House, I have often spoken of the multicultural community that I represent and of the pride and esteem in which I hold it. As most honourable members assembled here would know, the largest city in my electorate, Whyalla, boasts 65 different nationalities living in a population of less than 27,000-and, I add, living in complete and utter harmony. My electorate of Grey is a veritable melting pot of nationalities from all over the world. Communities in all parts of my electorate are proud of the differing cultures and traditions interacting with the Spencer Gulf region and the outlying communities, the population of which has a high migrant content. They have every right to be proud. They are an example not only to the rest of Australia, but to the world. Australia, as we know it today, is a culturally diverse society. Our country's migrants originate from over 120 different nations around the world. The United Kingdom and Ireland have provided Australia with a large number of settlers over the years. However, the remaining migrant population has brought a combined total of over 100 languages to Australia. The majority of settlers, excluding those from the United Kingdom, come from European countries. We, as Australians, are fortunate to live in a democratic society. Those of us born in Australia are very often not aware of the trials that some of our migrant population have faced. Prior to coming to Australia, many of the migrants had not experienced the freedom of living in a democratic society. The fear of civil war, acts of violence or prejudice are things which we, having been born in a democratic society, have not experienced personally and, therefore, cannot fully understand. Acts of violence being perpetrated on innocent people each day in other countries of the world-often because these people have merely voiced an opinion-are things that we only read about or see on television. This is truly unfortunate as, having not undergone such experiences, some of us do not understand the importance of exercising our democratic right. There are some of us who take such rights for granted and who actually see these rights as an imposition on us, whereas individuals in other nations of the world are prepared to spill blood or give their lives to obtain these rights. Australia has been enriched by the contribution provided to our nation by its migrants. Under the migration system, migrants are accepted into our country regardless of race, colour or creed. Participation in Australian life and acceptance by Australians are prime factors in the settlement of these newcomers to our country, from which we as a nation will reap the benefits. It is saddening, however, that there is a small minority within our community that is opposed to this policy. New arrivals are not prevented from contributing their talents and skills to the Australian way of life. On the contrary, they are encouraged to share these skills and talents with the community, enriching our way of life and subsequently forming part of our Australian heritage. Protection of individual rights, such as participation and integration in the work force, is recognised and plays a large and important role in enhancing this nation's future. We, as a nation, still require migrants to assist in our economic recovery, but to a much lesser degree than in previous years. To keep in line with our country's rapid economic and social changes, the immigration policy has been gradually adjusted and modified, in line with our ever changing socio-economic needs. It is, however, of grave concern that a number of Australia's permanent residents fail to apply for Australian citizenship. In failing to do so, they are in fact denying themselves the opportunity to participate in our country's democratic process. I believe that all residents of Australia should show their commitment to Australia, its principles, its ideals and its way of life. That should be a two-way commitment between Australia and its migrant population. As I represent a multicultural constituency, each day either I or my electorate staff are approached by constituents who are eligible under our criteria to apply for Australian citizenship. They are eager to know what steps must be taken to fulfil their commitment and allegiance to the country that now means home to them. These people genuinely wish to become Australian citizens and assume the rights and responsibilities associated with becoming a citizen. One would think that this would prove . to be an easy exercise; however, there are barriers. What we have done is to increase community awareness of the importance of participation in our democracy. Having succeeded in raising awareness through a massive and costly advertising campaign we then turn our backs on the very people we have targeted and who are now showing their willingness to become citizens. How, you may ask, has this been done? We have raised a barrier-a major barrier-which is insurmountable for the disadvantaged people in our community. In other words, we have succeeded in changing attitudes to obtaining Australian citizenship. However, the mighty dollar dictates participation in citizenship as we put out our hand saying, 'This privilege will cost you $35, mate, unless you are a pensioner, because we have recently granted a $15 concession for pensioners'. But the bulk of the people miss out and these people are Australians in every way, having made this country their home for most or all of their adult life. In all aspects have actively participated in our way of life, contributed their taxes and paid their dues. They have every right to believe themselves to be Australians in the true sense; they lack only the paperwork. I am firmly of the opinion that we are doing these people an injustice by making them pay for the privilege of citizenship. While the cost factor may not seem to be beyond the budget range of most people, it must be remembered that families living on low incomes or relying on social security benefits and who wish to obtain Australian citizenship simply cannot justify such an outlay from their limited budget. In some instances, when more than one family member wishes to obtain citizenship, the cost is doubled or trebled. We have families where one or two members are citizens, but the balance of the family are not, simply because they cannot afford it. We are holding these people to ransom. We tell them that they may work for the good of Australia and participate in our way of life on a cultural and social level; however, they must become citizens if they wish to participate in our democratic process. If they cannot afford the $ 3 5 fee, they have no say in our country's future. Are we in fact saying that only the rich have the right to be part of Australia's democratic process? It is inconceivable to me, as a member of a democratic socialist party and a Government whose record is renowned on social justice issues, that this situation has been allowed to develop. The disadvantaged in our community are being denied their basic right for the paltry sum of $35. This is totally unacceptable for a party which bases its own structure on democratic rights and professes to be the defender of basic human rights and civil liberties. I put it to this House that this situation must be rectified. I call upon the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) to implement an amnesty of at least three months duration, making citizenship free. I feel it would be fitting to present these certifithey cates to those availing themselves of the opportunity during such an amnesty on Australia Day, 1992. This would be a real cause for celebration of our nation's birthday and will show our commitment to our multicultural society. If we are truly. genuine in our beliefs, and want people to embrace our nation and its democratic process by be-· coming Australian citizens, it is our responsibility as a government to ensure that cost is not the prohibitive factor in determining a person's commitment to this nation. Political Corruption",53
57,Mr TUCKEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The issue of my grievance today is the corruption of the community resulting from corrupt politicians. Whilst there is no excuse for members of the general community who seek favours from politicians in an improper fashion, the simple fact remains that the corruption occurs when the politician cooperates. The Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters, the WA Inc. royal commission, has put a focus on this matter that has probably never been so stark. The shock waves have not stopped at the West Australian border, but have raised a storm here in Canberra as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) ineptly and unconvincingly attempted to distance himself from events and people from whom he had previously sought reflected glory. The current events also raise queries as to the competence, energy and, in fact, integrity of the West Australian media, who seemed, amongst other matters, so incompetent as to fail to discover the simple fact that a senior West Australian Cabinet Minister had paid a $13,000 cash deposit on a house, notwithstanding that such news would have rocketed around that real estate office within seconds of the writing of the receipt. More amazing was the evidence given by the Premier and Deputy Premier of their habit of keeping large amounts of cash in such containers as manila envelopes or initialled briefcases. I considered this an unlikely story, until I discovered that the practice was more common amongst Australian Labor Party (ALP) members of parliament (MPs) than I had first realised. I came to this conclusion when I re-read a New South Wales police report in my possession, which is dated 21 February 1982, prepared by Detective Sergeants Ferguson and Harvey, Detective Keene and Constable Laverack. It reports the theft of a sum of $3,600 in Commonwealth bank notes, a sum of $1,000 in United States (US) currency and, most surprisingly, a quantity of travellers cheques, quoted in the report as 'bank and number unknown'. That someone who was reporting the theft of personal property could not remember the bank upon which they drew their own travellers cheques is inconceivable. It appears that the person concerned did not want the police to know the origin of those cheques. Also of interest to me are the circumstances of the theft, which are described under the heading of 'Information'. The report states in part: The offenders forced open a combination lock on a dark brown leather briefcase and removed the above That means, of course, the money and travellers cheques. Here is another briefcase bank, another large sum of money left carelessly lying around in a vacant hotel room for all and sundry to steal or misuse. The briefcase, of course, belonged to Robert Hawke and the offence occurred at the Boulevard Hotel in quite bizarre circumstances. Everyone in the Labor Party in Australia has queried the Prime Minister's determined defence of his mate, Brian Burke, but this situation throws a new light on the subject. Clearly, from his own actions, the Prime Minister finds nothing unusual in politicians, whose salary is paid by cheque and who have no other means of income, wandering around with thousands of dollars in cash, equivalent in this case to 16 per cent of annual salary, in their briefcase. Nevertheless, there are a number of other questions that should be answered. The first is that, notwithstanding that Mr Hawke's room at the Boulevard was the only room burgled that night, suggesting an inside job, the police have never made an arrest. In fact, it has been reported that they were forbidden even to discuss the matter amongst themselveshardly the best way to solve a crime. The second is the matter of the origins of the US currency and travellers cheques, particularly as access to foreign currency was strictly limited at the time by section 5 (1) (a) of the Reserve Bank Act. The issue has been raised in this Parliament before but, in the light of more recent revelations in Western Australia, it is time the Prime Minister gave an explanation to this Parliament as to the circumstances of his having these funds. In particular, he should explain whether the funds related to his lobbying of Queensland MPs .on behalf of Eddie Kornhauser and his casino application-as reported in the press-which he was conducting at that time to the embarrassment of the Queensland ALP. This was expressed in a telegram on 9 March 1982 to the Secretary of Caucus, Ros Kelly, by the then Labor spokesman on justice and police, Bob Gibbs. This was reported, along with a response from the Prime Minister, in the National Times of 4-10 April 1982. I quote from that paper both the response of Mr Hawke and the remarks of Mr Gibbs: In his telegram sent on March 9 to the secretary of the Caucus, Ros Kelly, Gibbs said that he was lodging ""the strongest of protests warranted interference by one of your Caucus members, namely R. J. Hawke, on the Queensland casino licence issue"". ""Following exhaustive discussions with people in Melbourne, and having perused the findings of the 1954 New South Wales Royal Commission on Liquor Laws, I laid certain information ing to one of the applicants, Kornhauser, before the Queensland Parliament. ""I find it absolutely extraordinary that a prominent member of the parliamentary Labor Party should then come to Queensland and attempt to coerce the State secretary, State president and State parliamentary leader to use their influence to shut me up."" In November last year, Gibbs said in Queensland Parliament that a ""stench"" hung over Kornhauser's application. On March 2, when the State Parliament resumed, Gibbs again attacked Kornhauser alleging that he had laundered illegally collected money. The following evening Gibbs was summoned by the State Opposition Leader, Ed Casey, to his Parliament House office. Casey asked Gibbs to meet with Hawke, who was coming to Brisbane. Casey has told the National Times that Hawke wanted to speak with Gibbs about his attack on Kornhauser. Casey said that Hawke was not happy with what Gibbs had said and that it was wrong that Hawke was travelling to Brisbane specifically to speak to Gibbs. According to Gibbs, he said that he would not discuss the matter with Hawke and refused to meet with him. Gibbs said that Hawke had also telephoned his residence in an endeavour to speak to him. Further on in the article-and I will quote Mr Hawke to make this balanced-it states: When Hawke was contacted by the National Times, I make the point that he did answer the allegationshe refused to discuss the Gibbs telegram. Hawke said that he did not go to Queensland seeking to speak to Gibbs. He said: ""That matter arose and I sought to speak to him and found it singularly difficult to find him. ""I tried him at Parliament House, I tried him at home and couldn't speak to him."" Hawke said that he spoke to Casey and Beattie. Hawke said he told Casey that Gibbs was acting on wrong information on Kornhauser. "" Mr Casey took the opportunity provided to him to look at the police file and he issued a at the un- public statement. ""I am indebted to Mr Casey for having clarified that matter."" Hawke denies that he asked Casey and Beattie to take disciplinary action against Gibbs. ""Casey did what was necessary."" relat- That is what Mr Hawke said. He denies that he met or spoke with the Queensland National Country Party minister, Russ Hinze . . . over the matter. ""I have known Kornhauser for a very long time. This is a quote from Hawke againFrom when I first met him he has, over a long period of time, been a substantial helper of the Labor Party in Victoria."" Asked if Kornhauser was a financial backer of the Labor Party, Hawke answered that""he has provided assistance over time, yes"". Further on the article states: Hawke says that he saw Kornhauser and stayed with him on the Gold Coast. Of course, there has been substantial movement in both Queensland and Western Australia regarding matters of this nature. Mr Kornhauser certainly did not come out of the Queensland Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct in very good shape. In fact, he came out of it in dreadful shape. But the issue before the Parliament now is: should the Prime ister further explain why he could not or time has expired. was not prepared to remember where those travellers cheques came from? If they were his own, we can feel sorry for the fact that he lost his money out of hotel room. I add that it was the most expensive room in the place-I think it was th- Lady Forrest Room or something - costmg about $185 a night, which is a remarkable price for a backbencher. I tainly do not use those rooms when I go to Sydney. . The reality is that things have changed. What has changed is that, when this matter was raised before, it was considered to be a scurrilous personal attack. That was the defence used in Western Australia. Every time the Opposition attempted come up with queries of the early stages of WA Inc., it was attacked for mudpermit slinging. It was all so dreadful to suggest that the Premier of Western Australia might be giving people favours and misgulagdifficult using ALP funds. It was all too dreadful to suggest that a cheque given by the failed teachers credit union for $5,000 had been donated to the ALP after it decided that the Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia would bail it out. Others, amongst them the Leader the National Party, accused the Liberals of mud-slinging and told them to 'put or shut up'. They eventually put that que up. The point I make in all these matters that, had all that funny business been stopped in the early stages, tralian taxpayers would have been saved $1 billion-$1,000m-because the PICL the Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd, aster and all those that followed as attempt to cover up would never· have occurred. This is the tragedy and this why the Prime Minister has got to tell a bit more about his working to get Mr that Kornhauser a licence to run a casinoone which, fortunately, he did not get, partly through the honest efforts of members the Labor Party in Queensland whom the active Prime Minister, as Mr Gibbs said, tried counter-revolutionary to shut up.",56

Asia Watch obtained and translated articles from a restricted circulation of journal for Chinese prison and labour camp officials entitled 'Theoretical Studup ies in Labor-Reform and Labor-Re-educhecation'. These articles from issues published in 1989 and 1990 were written by prison officials or officials of provincial is bureaus of labour reform. Asia Watch released the articles and its own overview Western Auson 19 April this year. Included among this prison population are large numbers of political and relidis- gious detainees and other prisoners of an conscience. Asia Watch says it recently uncovered a secret directive issued on 25 is August 1983 by the Central Committee of us the Chinese Communist Party revealing political dissidents have all·along been of the main targets of an eight-yearlong campaign to 'crack down on crime'. of This confidential party document states: counter-revolutionary elements who write slogans, fliers, liaison messages and anonymous letters are to be dealt resolute blows and given severe and prompt punishment. The human rights group claims that millions of those who have served out their sentences since 1949 remain in the Chinese gulag as a captive labour force as a result of China's 'forcible retention' icy. This forcible retention policy is commonly applied against inmates who have allegedly remained unrepentant even after they have completed their sentences. Political dissidents are included in this egory as well as some individuals with skills that authorities do not wish to lose. There is no reference to goods produced by such people forcibly retained being sold in Australia. However, it does not require a great stretch of the imagination to assume that, if the Asia Watch report is accurate, goods produced by slave labour in China are finding their way into overseas export markets. Australia could also be on the receiving end of such inhumane practices. Chinese statistics have Australia ranked as China's tenth largest trading partner by value after Hong Kong-Macau, Japan, the United States of America, West Germany, the Soviet Union, Singapore, Canada, Taiwan and Britain. Australia's exports to China in 1989-90 totalled $1.192 billion, while imports were valued at $1.24 billion. Since China first permitted direct private investment in 1979, Australian companies have established approximately 40 joint ventures in China. These joint venture companies produce for both the Chinese domestic and export markets, including re-export to Australia. I repeat 'including re-export to Australia'. I am not suggesting that Australian companies are involved in-or are even aware of-the use of prison labour by China, but this question must be asked. Are products produced by prisoners in forced labour camps in China finding their way into Australia? Asia Watch maintains that the use of forced labour in China is central to government policy. It is not a policy developed on an ad hoc basis by labour reform units and coastal provinces where a large portion of the goods are produced. In September 1983, the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce produced a two-volume report entitled Prospects for Trade Between Australia and polChina. This Committee's inquiry was considered timely because the then Department of Trade believed that trade and investment links between Australia and China were poised for steady and solid cat- growth over the following 10 years. The Department's prediction was well-founded. Two-way trade between Australia and China in 1982-83 was $899.8m compared with the $2.432 billion in 1989-90. Australia cannot accept trade at any price, especially when that price may be accounted for in terms of human lives and suffering. The Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce in its 1983 report said: China's policy of equality and mutual benefit in foreign trade probably results from recollection of exploitation by foreign companies in the years before the Revolution. The principle of self-reliance reflects China's determination not to be dependent on foreigners nor to be subservient to trade relations. It has been repeatedly stated, for instance, that foreign investors in China .must respect China's sovereignty and abide by its laws, policies and decrees. If China's policy of equality and mutual benefit in foreign trade results from recollections of exploitation by foreign companies in the year prior to the Revolution, as the Committee suggests in this report, that is not an excuse for any country to condone China's exploitation of its own people under a policy of forced retention. There is no excuse for Australia to permit any of its trade to be tainted with human rights abuses. Australia was China's first bilateral aid donor when it signed an agreement for Technical Cooperation for Development on 2 October 1981. This agreement aimed to support China's modernisation through specific activities addressing priority Chinese sectors in which Australia had significant expertise. The Australian program has been augmented by other forms of aid-funded cooperation. Apart from trade relations, Australia and China have achieved much in recent times in the field of development assistance. Relationships between Australian States and Chinese provinces, science and technology relations, cultural relations, and legal, education, military and other specialised exchanges have been vastly improved. Our association with China-except for the substantial set-back caused by the Chinese Government's appalling actions in June 1989-has been one of warmness and mutual support. But now a heavy cloud hangs over the progress made in Australia-China relations. We cannot and must not countenance the continued use of slave labour in China. We must voice our protest in the strongest possible terms. Asia Watch has urged the United States Customs Service to require certification from importers that products arriving in the United States are not the result of forced labour. The organisation has also urged. the United States to request that the Chinese permit the inspection of all prison factories and farms so that a complete picture of China's export industry can be obtained. The United States State Department, in a statement issued by Mr Richard Boucher, had this to say: We have suspected for some time that some Chinese prison products were making their way to the US. market. We've been cooperating with the Customs Service for over a year now to investigate the extent of such imports and whether they violate the Tariff Act of 1930. Should those investigations uncover exports in violation of US. laws we will take firm steps to enforce those laws. Australia needs to adopt similar measures. Our conscience demands that we take action and if we fail to do that"" Australia will be properly criticised in the United Nations and other international forums for condoning what is a blatant abuse of human rights. Education Industry; Overseas Students",58
60,Mr MACKELLAR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would like to draw to the attention of the House today the continuing fiasco which goes under the name of the Government's export education policy. At the very least it can be described as a shambles which, despite the best efforts of the Government, is not going to go away just because it hopes it will or by its ignoring it. The education of overseas students in this country is an ongoing debacle which is ruining lives, putting decent young people into debt for years, sending businesses to the wall, losing this country hundreds of millions of dollars of overseas earnings, and making Australia a target of ill will and ridicule, particularly in South East Asia and the Pacific. The picture is one of total confusion and unfortunately that confusion still exists. The extent to which the Government is ignoring the problem is highlighted by the fact that since his return last month from Beijing, where the angst and dissatisfaction is understandably most prevalent, the Minister for Education, Employment and Training (Mr Dawkins) has not, to my knowledge, made one public statement on the subject. ' The seriousness of the problem and the extent of the bewilderment in the industry was brought home to me earlier this month when I visited an English language school in my electorate. It is a perfectly responsible and well-run college that is ' having difficulties staying in business; it is operating on the brink of viability, and faces the possibility of going out of operation unless there is a brisker and more efficient turnaround of visa applications and it is able to increase its student roll. Two years ago, it was operating at full capacity. Early last year when the visa rules were changed, the school was half full; now it is operating at about three-quarters capacity, but it has had to shed four teachers. To demonstrate the amount of money that is being lost to Australia, this one school alone, if operating at full capacity, would put more than $2m of overseas earnings into our economy in 40 weeks. The owners and operators of this school were very good, reasonable, responsible and polite people. They outlined to me a litany of government mismanagement and incompetence; constant and irrational changes of the rules; frustration; lack of direction; a shameful lack of understanding of industry problems; a very apparent inability of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to communicate with the industry and with each other; and no control from the Minister-in other words, a damning indictment of a government which has made a complete botch of the whole thing. It has washed its hands of the havoc that is has wrought. The Government thought that all it had to do was sit back, do nothing and let the· money roll in. Instead, at a time when Australia should be earning its share in an industry which worldwide is worth $12 billion a year, we have seen earnings drop from $300m in 1988-89 to $103m, with every indication that things are going to get even worse. In the last two years, we have seen four sets of visa changes, some of which were retrospective, so that there is confusion not only here, but also overseas among the students we should be attracting. Foreign students, quite reasonably, are going elsewhere. The intake from Thailand, which in 1988-89 amounted to 1,765 feepaying students has virtually disappeared, with New Zealand picking up much of this business. In fact, Canada and New Zealand, which only entered the industry over the last two years, now outstrip Australia in the number of students they receive. Also in the 1988-89 period, the number of students coming from Hong Kong and Taiwan fell by 45 per cent; from Indonesia, 33 per cent; from South Korea, 27 per cent; and from Japan, 16 per cent. What a tremendous example of the efficacy and credibility of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. The attitude of the Government towards China is a perfect example of the woolly government thinking which is crippling colleges. Following the horrendous Tiananmen Square killings in mid-1989, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), off his own bat, made the emotional decision to offer fouryear visa extensions to 20,000 Chinese. Since that time, student visa regulations for Chinese have been successively tightened on three separate occasions. The Immigration Department is now rejecting 95 per cent of Chinese applications. Is it any wonder, given that situation, that Australia's reputation is very much on the nose in China and that thousands of potential students are very angry because they borrowed money for their full courses, paid in advance and then found themselves frozen out of Australia because this Government suddenly changed the rules? It said to the students, 'We are very sorry about that; it is just too bad'. One result of all this, of course, is that Australia's immigration program is in a complete mess and some day we will have to face the consequences in the form of a very gravely distorted total intake. Mr Ruddock-It is distorted now.",60
61,Mr MACKELLAR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"As the shadow Minister says, it is distorted now, but it will become increasingly so, dependent upon the decisions which are taken in the .next couple of years about those thousands of students and the refugee component which is also adding problems to the total situation. That emotional Chinese student decision was made by the Prime Minister without any knowledge of the flow-on effects, the history, the difficulties and sensitivities in the immigration area just because he felt like it at the time. It was almost like the streaker's defence offered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) on one occasion during his career: it seemed like a good idea. at the time. Seriously, this has disturbed the potential migrant flows in the future and, of course, the attitude in the whole of the student area has only exacerbated the problem. There is no doubt that a number of buccaneers and people who should not be operating colleges have been and still are in the industry. But it is not good enough that the Minister should stand idly by and say good riddance as the schools go broke and throw the problem in the lap of the States by saying that education is a State responsibility. If one followed that logic through, of course, one would probably come to the inevitable conclusion that Australia does not need a Federal Minishis ter for Education. The Minister, although he appears to choose to ignore it, has an obligation that obligation is to rein in and control an industry which he has allowed, by apathy and incompetence, to run out control. By working together with the States, he has an obligation to bring in legislation which will protect the nation's interests in terms of immigration, the colthe leges and, most particularly, the trusting, genuine foreign students who wish to come here for an education. This area could bring great benefit the students who wish to study in AusSouth tralia. It could bring to the country as whole great benefits in terms of international relations as those students go back and make their ways in their own country. It could bring great benefit terms of the economies which will be tended by the people coming to Australia. At the present time, unfortunately, have a situation where all is confusion. On 8 May 1991, the Embassy of the People's Republic of China issued a news bulletin on the collapse of English colpublished leges. Mr Ferguson-A credible source?",61
62,Mr MACKELLAR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is a credible sue source because at the bottom it says: The Chinese Embassy hopes that the Australian Government, setting store by the credibility of its education export, take effective measures to improve the management of and rectify the remaining English colleges so as to avoid more unnecessary losses on the part of the Chinese students. What an indictment of this Government and this Minister's handling of an extremely important and sensitive area of administration. It really is appalling and the Government stands condemned. High Temperature Incinerators",62
63,Mr FERGUSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Reid) (1.20 p.m.)In the last fortnight, there has been a very unfortunate domestic tiff between the National and Liberal Party leaders of New South Wales about the question of high temperature incinerators. In the course of that the New South Wales Premier made the profound comment that if it were in electorate he· would want it to go somewhere else. Equally, in the same process he has undermined the one perand son who has attempted over a long period to overcome the huge cracks in credibility his within that Government over environof mental matters-the New South Wales Minister for Environment, Mr Moore. The axe has been taken to his credibility, in so far as the Premier has announced that question of the siting of this incinerator will possibly have to go back to square one, and the original report, which actually said that high temperature incinerators are a good idea, might have to be to looked at again. As well as that, the New Wales Premier has certainly quesa tioned a number of the siting situations. This issue of high temperature incinerators is a bit more serious than the quesin tion of siting and perhaps the Ministers exinvolved previously, under both governments, should have tackled it a bit more we thoroughly. But I am particularly concerned with this matter because of the report, Management and Technologies of Waste: A Perspective for Australia 1990, by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and written by Kerry Hubick. There is a number of interesting comments about this very is in that report. One of the two alternative technologies-the starved air method-is mentioned on page 77 of that international report. It states: The starved-air method of incineration works well under conditions where continuous operation maintains uniform temperatures and in large-scale operations where wastes are fairly uniform because of mixing. Starved-air incineration has a poor reputation for excessive emissions. Some international experts believe that the poor reputation derives from an inadequate ability of the technology to deal with very heterogeneous wastes, particularly for the types of medical wastes produced at hospitals. Obviously, the whole starved-air technology is questioned by this Federal report. Yet, as it points out, New South Wales does not seem to be too inclined to let a thousand flowers bloom. The approach of the party of liberalism and lack of restrictions and controls is described on page 124 of the report, which states: In Australia, the New South Wales Government appears to be embarking on an unusual regulatory route concerning incineration. The draft ulations for the incineration of pathological! biomedical wastes include a specification of the technology to be used. Such an approach contrasts with the usual type of government regulations where emissions are to be controlled. regulations of this nature can only serve to the development of new, improved technologies. So New South Wales is saying that there is only one road to go down in this new area of technology and that is the starvedair technology. That, of course, emerges in the draft guidelines for pathological and biomedical waste incinerators of the New South Wales Government. I am interested to note Cthat the authorities. it cites in support of this starved-air technology are Calvin Brunner and C. H. Brown and their article 'Hospital Waste Disposal by Incineration' in the journal, Air Pollution Control and Waste Management. When we go to that article to find out why New South Wales should have this starved-air technology, we find that on page 1304 those experts state, ' Avoid the starved air/pyrolysis process.' That is the advice of the experts the New South Wales Government cites in support of its technology line. It went on to say: With the extreme variation inherent in biomedical waste feeding, the stoichiometric requirement is constantly changing. It is virtually impossible for a starved air process to be maintained when the stoichiometric air demand ratio ranges from less than 2 to greater than 15. As I say, there seems to be some question about why the New South Wales Government went down this road. It cites an internationally acknowledged authority whose reputation was enforced recently in my electorate by the decision on 16 April of the Bankstown City Council to veto the building of an incinerator based on this technology. Despite the fact that the New South Wales Government thought that we should go down only this one road, it was so unconvincing that the Bankstown Council threw it out the door in five seconds and rejected the technology. It is interesting to note that this form of technology is used by only a minority of incinerators in the United States; of the 130 units in the States, a mere 10 to reg- 15 use it. Messrs Dean and Collom of the Air Branch of the State Pollution Control Commission, on a whirlwind tour of the United States of America to provide Further background material to the New South stifle Wales Government for its policy position, for some unknown reason looked at only those plants that utilised this technology. Similarly, as I understand it, in their visits to other countries, they were very selective about the plants they visited. As I have said, there is a very big question mark as to why this Government has gone down this road and there is a very big question mark over its selective support for a company called Clinical Waste Australia Pty Ltd, which has a plant in Auburn in my electorate. In 1990, when a rival company, Scholer Incineration Co. Pty Ltd, approached the State Pollution Control CommissIon, it was given an - bundance of, conditions and requirements. The State Pollution Control Commission noted in point (h) of its letter of 18 January 1990: Should the waste be made up of significant amounts of chlorinated plastics . . . then we would consider the need for the proponent to carry out tests for dioxins. Nevertheless, we would require tests for particulates and acid gases to be carried out, within one month of the incinerator being commissioned and thereafter, at three month intervals. So there was a requirement on the Scholer company, seeking to build a plant in January 1990, that it look at three-monthly and then at further six-monthly tests. But what were the requirements put on the company Clinical Waste Australia? What performance did the State Government require of that particular company? I think it has been noticeably different. In actual fact, we are still awaiting the first report, more than two years after it established its plant in Silverwater, Auburn. It still has not produced one public document with regard to the figures of its pollution levels. However, it has produced a document by a company called Auckland Environmental Protection Agency Ltd. It just happens, by a series of interlocking relationships amongst managers in Liberticorp Holdings Ltd, Waste Technology (NZ) Ltd, Auckland Environmental Protection Agency Ltd and Rahiri Holdings Ltd, that it has commissioned a report on the waste levels from a related company. That is the kind of evidence that this State Government in New South Wales requires. But I am still amazed that this company is allowed by this State Government to continue to operate, because the figures even in this report, two years after it was set up, and which was not produced publicly by the Minister, cast great credibility problems over the company. I will just briefly note a few results of that report: cadmium, lead and hexavalent chromium are not reported in the document; it deliberately obscures the issue of pollution levels by utilising unconventional units of mass per actual cubic metre; it does not state the temperature at the sampling point; and it does not mention the stack flow rate which is required to change the. analysis of pollutant concentrations to emission rates in mass per second. When we get on to the actual figures that this document did come out with, it gave these statistics: hydrogen chloride was above the State required guideline of 400 milligrams per cubic metre-it actually reached 520. In regard to dioxins-I think everyone would appreciate that this is quite a serious by-product-this company-commissioned, internal company document showed levels of 42 times the dioxin level that would be allowed at the Corowa plant. Finally, it is very interesting to note that, whereas this great draft report by the State Pollution Control Commission requires a level of 1100 degrees centigrade for burning off, this document by the Auckland Environmental Protection Agency states that it must be only over 1050-no doubt because it was burning at only 1085. So, once again, it was below the State requirement. We have a situation here where Springbok tourist enthusiast Mr Winston Churchill MCDonald, despite being gaoled for two years for embezzlement in New Zealand, is allowed to be a company director in New South Wales-at the very centre of this company that is getting such selective support from the State Government of New South Wales. New South Wales State Election",62
64,Mr NEHL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It will not have escaped the attention of the honourable members of this House that there is a State election on in New South Wales. I think that became abundantly clear from the comments of the previous speaker. It is also abundantly clear that, because of the performance of the Labor governments in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania, the people of Australia have become disenchanted, to a degree, with the mainstream of politics. Therefore, it is obvious that there has been quite an upsurge in the number of Independents in the State election in New South Wales. What I would like to say to the people of New South Wales, and indeed to the people of Australia, is that Independents can be a very weak reed to rest upon. They have no input whatsoever into policies and they do not even have any policies. They have no input into the expenditure of the government or into constructive policy generation by oppositions. In fact, they are orphans in the parliamentary sense; they just sit there, not even like a voice in the wilderness. So what I would like to do on this occasion is to say to the people of New South Wales in particular that, before casting their vote on Saturday week, they should give very serious consideration to not wasting it by voting for an Independent. I know that Independents have been the flavour of the month in some places and I even know of one Independent in one of the State electorates in my area who was promising to model himself on the New South Wales Independent, Mr Frank Arkell. It is interesting that, from the end of 1986 to 29 April 1991, Frank Arkell asked absolutely no questions without notice in the Parliament, and that in that whole period of many years from 1986 to 1991 he made a total of nine speeches. Just as a point of comparison, the candidate for Port Macquarie, Wendy Machin, who is a great member of the New South Wales House, asked 17 questions and made 78 speeches, which was quite a valuable contribution. I find it very difficult to understand any person seeking to enter politics, to participate in the governments of this country, would do it outside the mainstream because, unless one is in one of the mainstream parties-my own National Party of Australia, the Liberal Party of Australia of which the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) is a member or the Australian Labor Party of which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) is a member-one can achieve very little indeed. I just want to say again to the people of New South Wales, and in particular to the people on the north coast-that growing area-that we have a strong National Party team of members, starting at the southern end: John Turner, Wendy Machin, Bruce Jeffery, Andrew Fraser, Ian Cawsley, Don Page, Bill Rixon and Don Beck, that it is a great team of hard working men and a woman who have done enormous amounts for their electorates and are working strongly within the whole of the Government's activity. I would just like to go through a few things which are important and relevant when people are considering how they are going to vote. For instance, let us look at electricity generation in New South Wales since the Greiner-Murray Government came in. It has cut off the fat, the nonworkers and the non-productive people. Employment is down by 33 per cent, while productivity is up by 78 per cent. If we look at county councils, employment is down by 17 per cent, while productivity is up 61 per cent. Not one Independent had any say in that at all. Within the State Rail Authority, employment has been cut by a massive 46 per cent, as it had to be, because it was losing $3m a day. It had to take the knife to it and cut it back. Productivity for Countrylink is now up 100 per cent, and freight is up 109 per cent. It is worth noting that, although there was a great deal of anguish about rail services, particularly on the north coast last year at the time of the Federal election, no station up there has closed in the lower area; local use has increased by 10 per cent; why and the people that I talked to who are actually using State Rail are now expressing great satisfaction. We are all concerned about law and order. The Murray-Greiner Government has increased the police force by 1,600 since the election of 1988. That is a great number of people.",64
65,Mr GOODLUCK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Sixteen hundred?,65
66,Mr NEHL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Yes. There are 950 extra police on the beat, some of them in Port Macquarie-and no Independents had anything to do with that. The police budget for 1991 is 50 per cent higher than Labor's last Budget and is now more than $1 billion a year. That shows a total commitment to law and order that is essential in this country. I, like other members, particularly those who are in the chamber at the present time, am very concerned about health. This is another area in which the GreinerMurray Government has really shone since taking office. Orthopaedic surgeons have been able to return to the public hospitals and 10,000 additional operations have been undertaken since that time. Waiting lists have dropped 6,000 in the last two years. The average waiting time is three weeks-still too long but a drop of two weeks under what it was with Labor. Capital works are up over 80 per cent, particularly on the north coast which is a great growth area that had been neglected by the previous Labor Government. In Port Macquarie, at the southern end of my electorate, construction of a new hospital is about to commence at a cost of $80m. Projects at and improvements to the Hastings District Hospital over the last three years amount to nearly $6m. Of course, the previous Government's spending on that hospital was only about $2m. This was not the expenditure for just one year. From 1983-84 to 1987-88 a total of under $2m was spent, whereas up to $6m has been spent over the last three years under the present Government. North coast health funding has been enhanced by 8 per cent already and over this decade the north coast will receive additional $52m for new services. This recognition of the needs and the growth of the north coast. But the Independents have not had one bit of input into getting that going. Education is very important. The future be put anda the of this nation rests on what we do for our children's education. A record lion has been spent on schools under Greiner-Murray Government. Maintenance is up 50 per cent to $89m in 1988for 89 and to $90m in 1989-90. These are tremendous steps forward. There were worth. hiccups with the way in which the education system was tackled when the presas ent Government came to office but they have been sorted out. The schools are working well; the teachers are doing a good job; their salaries have been increased; an extra $40m has been provided for computer education over four years; and $142m has been allocated especially for rural education over the four years. Port Macquarie itself, stage two of Westport High School-a new technology high school-is on track. In the State electorate of Port Macquarie, $10m has been spent already on capital works-this is quite apart from the $80m for the new hospital at Port Macquarie and another $60m for the new Coffs Harbour hospital. The Greinerfeature Murray Government has made an outKind of Madness'. standing and tremendous contribution to the rejuvenation of New South Wales in general and, in particular, to the north coast of New South Wales. We all bleed about unemployment. But we know from the unemployment figures released last week that the level of ployment in New South Wales was only staff. 8.6 per cent against a national average 9.9 per cent and figures in the other States of 10 per cent and up to 11.1 per cent. Without New South Wales, the average unemployment figure. would have been well over 10 per cent. The Independents had nothing whatsoily ever to do with that. They never can beselves. cause they have no policies; they do not have the opportunity to have an input into either Government policy or Oppoan sition policy. The Independent member is for North Sydney (Mr Mack), who sits behind me in the chamber, made the point a couple of days ago that he can ask in this place only one question in 125. We in the Opposition can ask at least seven questions day in which our views can issues that we consider to $4.134 bilsay to the people be be important can pursued. I want to the and to the north coast, New of South Wales in particular: vote a team that has produced the goods. Mr Tim Fischer-Especially in Tam",65
67,Mr NEHL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Especially in Tamworth, my colleague says. It is not the time to go back on success: do not turn your back on success; stay with the winning teamthe National Party and the Liberal Party. Schizophrenia",66
68,Mrs JAKOBSEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Cowan) (1.39 p.m.) In the short time remaining, I would . like In to speak about minds in overdrive. I am the sure that most members of the House would be aware that this is Schizophrenia Awareness Week. Last night the Australian Broadcasting Corporation screened a sensitive and informative documentary on this most misunderstood mental illness. The documentary was called Spinning Out. Last week the Bulletin magazine ran a entitled 'Schizophrenia-A Fine I count myself fortunate to have a friend who is a schizophrenic. He is a clever, gentle, hard working and good humoured person of whom I am extremely fond and to whom I am very grateful. The worth of his work, wit and general understanding of problems in the community is greatly unemappreciated by me, my husband and my I believe that our close association of over a number of years with this person has enabled me to became more familiar with the manifestations of this illness and the problems which can be associated with its treatment, as well as the pressures which the condition places upon the fammembers and the individuals themSchizophrenics suffer from an unspecified disorder of the brain. Development of the condition does not result from bad behaviour on the part of the person affected or a bad upbringing on the part of that person's family. It seems to be a chemical abnormality which is genetically transmitted. It is suggested that this chemical abnormality produces a change in the way the brain functions so as to alter its ability filter or screen information. As a result, many sufferers experience a phenomenon best described as an overload of stimulithat is, their head is full to overflowing with information; their brain is flooded with stimuli of all sorts and sizes; and their mind is in a state of overdrive. They are unable to select out the things that really matter from those that are just ancillary objects in their mind. The flood of messages to the brain makes it extremely difficult for the schizophrenic person to make sense of the world, even at the best of times. The disorder in the brain distorts experience and thinking. Schizophrenia is not a split personality. It is not a Jekyll-and-Hyde syndrome. Fear and ignorance in society mean that schizophrenia is, however, considered to be a stigma and that stigma makes things even more difficult for the sufferer and for the members of the family who are desperately trying to cope with the disease and its worrisome side effects. A mind in tumult produces anxiety and fear on the part of the sufferer. He or she will often experience thought disorders, paranoid delusions and exhibit some other bizarre behavioural symptoms. They frequently talk about hearing voices or having auditory delusions of that nature. Sometimes they have visitations from ghosts and other hallucinations. The vast majority-that is, 99 per cent-of schizophrenics are much more likely to hurt themselves than anyone else and depression and confusion are commonly experienced by them. Schizophrenia is an illness dogged by despair. Between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of sufferers commit suicide. As caring human beings and elected representatives in this place, members of this Parliament have an obligation to do everything they can to reduce that percentage and the sum of human misery.",66
69,Mr GOODLUCK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Hear, hear!",67
70,Mrs JAKOBSEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I thank the honourable member. I am convinced that much more needs to be done to assist with research into this illness and to better eduto cate people in the community about its manifestations and treatment. Early intervention is essential and a family's request for help with a sufferer should be responded to quickly and sympathetically by the authorities and by medical practitioners. One per cent of the general population will suffer from schizophrenia. Twentyfive per cent of sufferers will have a single attack and recover completely. The remaining 75 per cent will suffer for most, if not all, of their lives. This disorder affects men and women in equal numbers but men seem to suffer at an earlier age, that is, in their late teens or early 20s, while women tend to be struck down in their mid-to late 20s. Medication is a prerequisite to sufferers coming to grips with their illness and making the decision to get their lives back together. Unfortunately, it may take many years before this point is reached and in the interim the sufferer can exhibit a marked reluctance to take medication on occasions. Many schizophrenics are homeless and it has been estimated that between 30 and 50 per cent of homeless people in our cities are mentally ill. Unfortunately, self-help and support groups are still few and far between in Australia and hospitalisation is not a solution for most sufferers. Schizophrenics are human beings with an illness. They deserve to be treated with consideration by the community and the medical profession. They deserve to be able to participate usefully in our society, to the extent that their illness allows, along with everyone else.",67

72,Mr GOODLUCK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,Franklin) We hear ment. many speeches in the House and my friend the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) made a very good speech a few minutes ago. Mr Sciacca-A good member.,68
73,Mr GOODLUCK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Yes, a good memuse. ber. One can be ecumenical in this place and one can give praise to the Australian Labor Party when it deserves it. Much the time it does not deserve it, but this occasion it does. I have been thinking about speeches. Lately, a lot of people have written to me saying, 'Bruce, we ingly. have listened to your speeches in the House during the 16 years; some are good and some are bad'. The last person who wrote to me asked, 'Bruce, can you sing?'. Well I can sing: 'The autumn leaves'. One is not allowed to sing in this House but can sing. The point I am making is that a lot people listen to us and want us to tell them the good things as well as the nomic woes that are occurring in Ausmanuals. tralia. If we have an opportunity in this House, we should not waste the time of the Australian people. We should come to the point and tell them exactly where we stand on issues. We should to point out, as our good friend the honourable member for Cowan did, some of the plights people face in Australia day who really need help. If we draw attention to such things, then we are earnheld ing our money. Libraries",68
74,Mr SAWFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to highlight today one of our nation's greatest assets, libraries. Fifty per cent all Australians make use of one or other of the nation's 15,000 libraries. In fact, every year some 122 million library items are borrowed from public libraries alone, making libraries among the most heavily used of public assets. This fact may prise some, but each year more Austrais lians use libraries than attend sporting fixtures. Information is critical to the future of the Australian economy. It is in fact as critical as any other form of capital investWhenever decisions are to be made that will affect the future of any enterprise or organisation, information is needed-information that is accurate, timely and concise. It has to be current information, regularly updated, and easy to access and The servicing of that information need is provided by Australia's 15,000 libraries. The Australian Council of Li-of braries and Information Services needs on the support of people in this House to ensure that the importance of libraries is valued, supported and funded accordLibraries do many things for this country. They assist industry; they aid export enterprise; they help to maintain Australia's defences; they help to educate tomorrow's professionals; they help to formulate I public policy; they support the rural economy; they help to save lives through medof ical research data and information; and they help to enhance efficiency by giving ecoaccess to design data and maintenance They are important to this nato speak tion's successful future. Queensland By-elections",68
75,Mr TAYLOR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Deputy try Speaker, as a fellow Queenslander, of course you would know that next Saturday, 18 May there will be two State bytoelections in Queensland-one in the Brisbane Australian Labor Party (ALP) seat of Nundah and the other in the National Party of Australia held seat of Toowoomba South. The latter is, of course, in that great electorate, the Fed, eral seat of Groom. I predict that the results of both of these by-elections will of demonstrate two things: firstly, that the honeymoon of Premier Goss is over and, secondly, that the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party in Queensland must and will work more closely together from now on if the Labor Party surmachine-dominated Goss Administration to be seen for what it is-a government of non-decision and one that is increasingly singing the song of sectional interests, as have its colleagues in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria, with obviously disastrous results. The buckets poured on Mr Goss from within his own Party this week are indicative of panic by the ALP in both seats. In the last four weeks the Liberal Party candidate in Toowoomba South has shown himself to be by far the best performer on the hustings and one who understands grassroots people power. It will be a tough contest-but come Saturday night, I look forward to welcoming Neville Stewart as the new State Liberal member in the Darling Downs region. State Pollution Control Commission",68
76,Mr FERGUSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"As I indicated in the grievance debate, we have this situation in New South Wales where, despite the whole philosophy of those opposite, one technology has been favoured by this Government regarding waste incineration-the starved air technology. We have a situation where, despite the demands put on other companies, in the case of the one company that is heavily into this field of technology, after two years no public tests have been provided. We have a situation where, despite their own draft regulations which indicate a need for the plants to be no closer than 500 metres, this particular plant in Silverwould water is 300. We have a situation where the local Auburn Council, after the funding of a visit to New Zealand by aldermen and officers, agreed to the construction of this plant on the basis of the only tests which were provided to them, which were of an operation within New Zealand which was far smaller and owned by the same plant. We have a situation where there is obviously very close collusion between the New South Wales Government, which has an inability to face up to the breadth of technology that is possible in this field, and the selective support of this company to the point where the State Pollution Control Commission is sitting back, allowing dioxin levels way above what is allowed and allowing acid rain levels above what is allowed. It is not looking at the temperature levels under which this plant is operating, and it is not looking at the input of materials. We have a situation where, as I say, it is far more serious than this debate between the two parties in New South Wales as to whether it be in Corowa or Bathurst or Maryland. We have a situation they have repudiated-",69

78,Mr RONALDSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In the very short time allowed me today I will read from a letter from the city of Ballarat. It reads: Dear Mr Ronaldson The Municipal Association of Victoria have advised the Council of the City of Ballarat that the Treasurer and the Australian Taxation Office are considering the imposition of PA YE tax instalments on allowances paid to Councillors, and to imposing Fringe Benefits Tax upon alleged benefits (such as meals provided at Council meetings,) and the attendance of Councillors at Civic functions. Council has directed that I write to you to convey their extreme concern and utmost disappointment that such a proposal should even be in the consideration stage. Councillors of the City of Ballarat are paid an extremely modest $2500 p.a. (which would work out to no more than several dollars an hour for the time that they put into their municipal role), and are taxed in any event at year end. To impose PAYE arrangements on these small sums incur an administration cost to the Council and gain Federal Treasury very little in additional net revenues . . . . . . Council hopes that both the Treasurer and the Australian Taxation Office will see that there is no merit whatever in imposing PAYE tax on Councillors or Fringe Benefits Tax on Civic functions, and reject the ideal totally. I ask the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to look into these matters. I would hate to see that small band of people who keep local government going in this country in any way threatened by the imposition of these taxes, and I urge him to review the matter. Coalmining",69
79,Mr FITZGIBBON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Hunter) Yesterday and today the Coal Industry Tribunal (CIT) has been meeting to settle an industrial dispute at the Howick mine in the Hunter Valley. I hope the CIT comes down with the right decision and that the jobs of 278 miners are saved. The 15,000 coal workers in New South Wales have won a $12 a week pay rise. One of my Liberal Party colleagues said, 'They don't need it, nor do they deserve it.' My Liberal colleague was· crazy to make that statement. Obviously, he has no appreciation of the dangers faced daily by coalminers. As The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, said yesterday, coal mining is a dangerous occupation. I know the good mates that I have lost through roof fall. In my area since 1965 there have been 41 deaths because of roof fall alone. Since 1980 about 60 miners in the northern district have been killed in mining tragedies-that is about six a year. How dare the conservatives or anyone else belittle the lives of miners. What about the lives ruined through dusting? Miners deserve a decent wage. While ever I am here, I will be fighting to help them achieve their aim. Austudy",69
80,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Marano a) The National-Liberal Party bashing has reached fervour point over misinformed debate regarding Austudy. Many rural families are, by and large, entitled to no Austudy assistance due to an inequitable and antiquated asset test that is forcing students to forfeit higher education. We have a situation where a Gold Coast canal estate is exempt from the assets test, while the genuine working assets of a farm or business are not. On 13 May this year, the Senate passed a coalition urgency motion to introduce immediate education assistance for families suffering financial hardship. The policy is designed to make Austudy available to such families in circumstances where they would otherwise be excluded by the assets test. The significance of this motion has been lost on the national media, which has instead pandered to the incompetent proposal of the Australian Democrats to allow various Austudy regulations. This is quite apart from the proposal to make Austudy available to many not in genuine need. The motion would have served to dismantle Austudy altogether. The amendment was therefore never a viable alternative. The Government must extend the June parliamentary sitting to ensure adequate time to draft the necessary legislation to have these emergency provisions enacted. If it fails to do so, higher priority will have been given to our winter recess than the future of an entire generation of Australian children. Electro Optics",70
81,Mr SNOW,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Eden-Monaro) I want to pay tribute to the firm Electro Optics in Queanbeyan, which is an example to investqrs throughout Australia-investors who are all to often nervous Nellies in Australia. Dr Ben Grene and his team at Electro Optics have developed a laser radar tracking system, which is going to bring millions of dollars to Australia as a result of its unique export market. The tracking system is already being sold to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the United States, to Saudi Arabia, and now to the United States defence forces in an evaluation test for a range finder. The system is unique in the world. It has a potential market of just under $2 billion at least throughout the world. Yesterday, Dr Ben Grene, along with Senator Button and I, made it clear that this has come through research and development tax deductions through this Government of 150 per cent. While people are investing in property, while people are sending their money overseas, a firm like this is setting the example. With a staff of 16 people, with employment going into other areas because of its high use of Australian contents, and because it is an entirely export industry, it is showing Australia where investment should go. It is going to yield a great return for Australia, and a great return for Australian employees in this region. So here we have a former Canberra public servant with a bit of imagination-",70
82,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Questions on Notice,70
83,Mr MACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"North Sydney) It is the duty of members of this House to ask . questions of Ministers about matters of public interest concerning their administration. I suggest that it is an equally important responsibility of Ministers to answer those questions. When a Minister's answer to a question placed on the Notice Paper is so brief, uninformative and evasive as to amount to a non-answer, then I do not believe that Minister is doing his job. A classic non-answer was recently given by the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) to a question I placed on the Notice Paper on 11 March. I asked the Minister a detailed question in 11 parts which sought information about the Government's proposed resource security legislation, which was not then and is not now available. The Minister's answer on 18 April gave none of the information I asked for. It made very little effort to even address the points that were raised. It gave a reply that was remarkable for its brevity, evasion and irrelevance. I suppose the penalty for governments that become too arrogant is a political one. But there is more to it than that. A nonanswer contributes to the widespread impression that the Parliament is irrelevant, and that we come here to waste our time and large amounts of public money. It helps to undermine our political system. Aged Care",71
84,Mr FITZGIBBON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Hunter) Because of improved medical technology, and because of the postwar baby boom, we are all aware of the extent to which the aging problem has been accelerated within Australia. It is interesting to compare ative handling of that problem by respective governments. In the last year of the Fraser Government, the sum total spent on aged care accommodation was $S.6m. Since this Government has come to office, the average expenditure per year has been about $160m per year. One can judge from that which side of the House genuinely cares about the care of the aged. I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), the Minister at the table, is present in the chamber at the moment. In the last six years, in the electorate of Hunter, where nothing has been spent for so many years, at long last we are getting somewhere-$10m has been spent to provide nursing home and hostel beds in my electorate. It is a tribute to this Government that it genuinely cares for the aged, whereas before, nobody had any respect or care whatsoever for the aged. Recession",71
85,Mr BROADBENT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Corinella) To follow the advice of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) that we should take account of what we say in this House and use the time effectively, I wish to draw the attention of this Government to the problems that some of my constituents are having due to this recession that we had to have. I mention Becky, who is 19 years of age and works in Dandenong. She and three other employees, due to this recession, have had their work cut from five days to two days a week. They are not recorded on the unemployment benefits list. Becky has found another part time job, one day a week, to pay for her food and to run her car to and from that job. That money also pays for rent. John is a good mechanic who has been retrenched, in the words of his boss, 'Due to what is happening in Victoria at the moment'. He has a disabled son and a wife who has not worked because she has had to look after their son. John is unable to find a position in the motor car industry at the moment. Dennis operates a quarry truck. His business is down 70 per cent. Where he had six to eight loads a the relday, he is now doing one load.",71

87,Mr HAWKE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Tickner, is attending a meeting of the Torres Strait Regional Council and will be absent from Question Time today. Questions which would normally be addressed to Mr Tickner should be directed to the portfolio Minister, Mr Dawkins. NA NA",71
88,Dr HEWSON,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. This morning the Treasurer, in a call to arms, told all Australians to get on with it. When will the Prime Minister and the Government get on with introducing genuine labour market reforms and enterprise bargaining? When will they get on with introducing full competition telecommunications? When will they get on with mining Coronation Hill? When will they get on with building the third runway at Sydney Airport? When will they get on with scrapping their illogical threemine uranium policy? In short, if they do not get on with it, how can the rest of Australia? If they will not get on with it, why do they not get out?",72
89,Mr HAWKE,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,"That is a devastating opening over. First of all, let us look at how we-that is, the Government and the community together-have been getting on with this question of labour market reform, because the Leader of the Opposition seems to imply that we have not been doing that. Let us see what we have done together to this point in the area of labour market reform. We started in 1983, when we inherited that dreadful mess that the Opposition left us-and we started immediately. We did not have to wait until the Opposition came along. We had to deal with the mess that Professor Hewson and the honourable member for Bennelong had left us. The economic adviser, Professor Hewson, left this unique achievement. No-one else had ever been able to do what Professor Hewson had done. He left us simultaneous double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. That was his achievement. We started from day one to rectify it. Let us see what we have done together in rectifying that mess that the Opposition left. It is quite useful, I think-particularly in terms of the pathetic speech that the Leader of the Opposition made on the censure motion the other day in this place-to quote what he had to say in that respect. This was just about the only accurate thing he said in his speech: There is nothing more compassionate that one can do for people in Australia than to give them a job.",72
90,Mr TUCKEY,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,When are you going to give them a job?,72
91,Mr HAWKE,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,"I take you up. I think you are right. There is nothing more compassionate that you can do than to give them a job. I will tell you what you did when you had the responsibility. into Opposition membersYou, you!",72
92,Mr HAWKE,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,"Y au had a rate of job growth over the whole of your period of office of 0.7 per cent per annum. We started the job that the Leader of the Opposition asked me about in this question from day one. As a result of the things that we have done together in the area of labour market reform, I can say, after eight years in office, that as against the Opposition's 0.7 per cent per annum rate of job creation we have 2.6 per cent per annum. Even the Leader of the Opposition's relative incapacity in the area of numeracy would allow him to understand that a relationship between 0.7 per cent per annum-the Opposition's rate of growth-and our 2.6 per cent per annum shows that we have a rate of growth nearly four times as high as that of the Opposition. Mr Tuckey interjecting",72
93,Mr SPEAKER,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor!,72
94,Mr HAWKE,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,"In other words, putting it as simply as I can so that the Leader of the Opposition and those behind him may be able to understand, the simple fact is that, if we had only replicated in our term of Government the same rate of job creation as the Opposition did, there would be one million fewer Australians in employment today. Mr Carlton interjecting",72
95,Mr SPEAKER,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,Order! The honourable member for Mackellar!,73
96,Mr HAWKE,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,"If the rate of employment growth under the Hawke Government had been 0.7 per cent, which was the one the Opposition engineered, there would be one million fewer Australians in work today. There is the answer as to what we are going to do. We have done almost four times better than the Opposition, and we have done it basically because of what we have done in the area of labour market reform. Instead of having confrontation, we have consultation. We have a situation where, in regard to the Opposition's rate of industrial disputation, we have reduced the area of industrial disputes by 60 per cent compared to what the Opposition did. We have reduced real non-farm unit labour costs by over 10 per cent. We have shifted the miserably low profit share which the Opposition inflicted upon this country.",73
97,Mr HOWARD,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,That is not true.,73
98,Mr SPEAKER,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong will cease interjecting.,73
99,Mr HAWKE,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,"We have lifted the profit share to significantly higher levels, which led to record levels of investment as a proportion of gross domestic product as well as in absolute terms. That is what we have done. We do not have to sit here listening to those opposite telling us what to do, because we not only listened to what they had to say but we were also the inheritors of what they did. They made the worse mess of economy in the history of this country. Only Hewson and Howard were able to do it. Only they were able to produce record unemployment and record inflation simultaneously. It is because we sat down immediately with the trade union movement and with the employers that we transformed the industrial landscape of this country. May I finally say in respect of two of the issues that Leader of the Opposition has raised, that is, Coronation Hill and the third runway-Mr Tim Fischer-And uranium.",73
100,Mr HAWKE,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,"I will mention uranium, if the honourable member likes. If he wants to talk about uranium, we will talk about that as well. Let us take the three issues. Mr Sharp-Tell us about that one.",73
101,Mr SPEAKER,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,Order! The honourable member for Gilmore!,73
102,Mr HAWKE,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,"In regard to Coronation Hill, we established under the law a process for investigating the various claims and positions of people in the community with interests as to what should happen. We had a lengthy Resource Assessment Commission process whereby the developers have had the full opportunity to put their case. People concerned with the environment have had the opportunity to put their case. And those representing Aboriginal interests have had the opportunity to put their case. We have now received that report from the Resource Assessment Commission. The Cabinet and the Government will consider that and make a decision accordingly. I would suggest that the people of Australia would infinitely prefer that process-a process whereby all people are given an opportunity to put their case before an independent commission-than that of those opposite, who would mine everything and cut everything down. If that is what they want to do, they should go to the election in two years time saying that is what they want to do: do not 'worry about having an independent process; just dig it all up and cut it all down. We will be quite prepared to face them on that. Secondly, in regard to the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, we are operating according to the law. The facts are quite straightforward. Presumably, those opposite would want to ignore what has happened in regard to the environmental impact statement processes. We now have a situation where under this the Government, following the law, 2,000-odd public submissions have been received on the draft environmental impact statement, with some 14,000 specific comments. They canvass a broad range of technical, economic and environmental issues. They require investigation and analysis. According to what those opposite are saying, presumably they do not give a damn about the environment; they simply say that they will make that decisionthey will not give people the opportunity of putting their position and having it independently heard. As far as· we are concerned, we will allow those submissions to be made. I believe that we will be in a position· to make a decision on this matter well before the end of this year. That is a process which I believe is appropriate and should be followed. The honourable gentleman raised the question of uranium. Let us have a look at the question of uranium. The position IS known-we have a three-mines policy. Mr Tim Fischer-It is illogical.",73

104,Mr HAWKE,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,"Let me say that within the Party, we have had a committee looking at this and the Party will examine the outcome.

Of all people, the Prime Minister is abusing Question Time. This is the first question of the day, he has taken 10 minutes, and he is not yet part through his answer.",74
108,Mr SPEAKER,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,"Does the honourable member for Hume have a point of order? Mr Fife-I ask you, Mr Speaker, to require the Prime Minister to draw his answer to a close.",74
109,Mr SPEAKER,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,Order! The Prime Minister was asked a very wide ranging question and he is answering the question.,74

112,Mr SPEAKER,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,Order! There is no point of order.,74
113,Mr HAWKE,LABOUR MARKET REFORM,"The Government is proud of the fact that we have, in regard to the sale of uranium mined in Australia, the most stringent safeguards in the world. Our policy, which I believe would have the overwhelming endorsement of the Australian people, is that we should not recklessly intrude Australian uranium into the international fuel cycle, which is a fundamentally important consideration. Against that position, which we have religiously followed, the Leader of the Opposition wanders off and says that he would be prepared to consider selling uranium to Taiwan. Let me say this: this Government will not sell uranium to any country without an appropriate bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement. We require, as a minimum, that a non-nuclear weapon country be a party to the Treaty for the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and that it has concluded a full scope safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Taiwan does not meet those requirements. It is very ironic that it was the Liberal Party, under Malcolm Fraser, I might say, which developed these safeguards in an era of concern about nuclear proliferation. That concern certainly could not have lessened over the succeeding decade. This is what Malcolm Fraser said in this Parliament: We urge the universal adoption of a safeguards standard of similarly high quality. What a pity it is that this latest Liberal Party Leader does not share those same principles. We do, and we will not recklessly add to the dangers of the international fuel cycle by being prepared to sell uranium to people who do not meet those safeguard standards. NA Ms eRAWFORD-My question is dihas rected to the Treasurer. Would he please repayments-advise the House of the economic implications of today's one per cent reduction in official interest rates? A Government member-All good.",74
114,Mr KEATING,INTEREST RATES,"As one of my colleagues interjected, the implications of it are all good. And they are, because what we have seen today is the Government and the Reserve Bank of Australia taking the view that official interest rates should be reduced by one percentage point in cash rates, which brings the fall in rates now to 71f2 percentage points. have seen the bill rate, which is a measure of commercial interest rates, fall from per cent before the release of the conments sumer price index the day before yester17 day to 10.4 per cent this morning, and the 10-year bond rate falling to as low lO.5 per cent. I might just add that although I am not ployment comprehensively informed about this, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, at least, moved down its housing and prime lending rates this morning, and other banks no doubt will follow because there is no reason why that one per cent cannot go straight through into prime lending rates and housing rates.

124,Mr KEATING,INTEREST RATES,"The monthly repayments on a mortgage of $100,000 at 17 its per cent were $1,438 over 25 years, and cash they are now down to $1,128-a $3lO a We month difference. That is down from the peak and is $70-odd a week. At 15 years, 11 for the same $100,000 mortgage, repayhave gone from $1,539 a month at per cent to $1,265 at 13 per cent-or $274 a month difference. That is a very as substantial benefit to employees and to people who have a mortgage and, of course, those lower rates must affect empositively. The most substantial thing the Government can do to produce a recovery in the economy is to reduce nominal interest rates, which we have now done by 71h percentage points. The point I made today, which the Leader of the Opposition picked up and which I am happy to repeat, is that the Government is saying to it Australia now that rates are down a long way, and Australians should not accept any gloomy analysis that there is a recession here and there is no way out of it. There is a way out of it, and the best way of it is for them to take the opportuninities which are there now' and to get cracking with them-take up those opportunities which official policy has now proThis is. another significant fall in interI est rates which I think will be passed very quickly through the banking system, all underpinned by a genuinely lower rate of inflation with inflationary expectations coming down to match and the 10-year bond rate, which is fixed in the market without any reference to the central bank's market operations, falling to 10.5 per cent.

We knew that this country was in a position-honourable members opposite have heard the Treasurer and me say time after time; it is a simple statistic the Opposition has refused to acknowlresume his seat. edge and understand-where its expenditure was rising twice as fast as its Sir. production. If one has that situation, one cannot allow it to continue. So we had a position of existing tight fiscal policy, a tighter fiscal policy than in case-we had ever seen before, where we had turned the Budget deficit around into a Budget surplus. We had a tight wages poliey where wages were not increasing as fast as inflation. In that situation, if were going to slow down the economy we had to have a tightening of monetary policy. We have rehearsed those facts with Opposition members on many occasions. They know as well as we do that, if we had not taken the decisions we did to monetary policy, the world would have visited upon Australia an infinitely . more draconian solution. My answer to honourable member's constituent and other people around this country-Mr Costello-Frank! Frank!",76
129,Mr HAWKE,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I have already identified him-is that we regret that he is suffering at this time; that in fact it would have brobeen infinitely worse, not only now but also for far longer into the future, if we had not taken those decisions. I would also ask the honourable member to say to if the honourable member has the honesty to be able to do it, and I doubt it-Mr Broadbent-I have. Opposition members-Withdraw!",76

Those opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that they are going to saving $0.75 billion from cutting off unearnings employment benefits and saying they do not mean it. They are saying that they going to save $0.75 billion, but now get up and say to me that they do not mean it. All I can say is that if the honourable member for Co rinella, when he meets Frank, will tell him that he is a 1990-91. member of a party which is going to save $0.75 billion by throwing him· and others off the unemployment benefit after nine months, then I will be very satisfied.

170,Mr JOHNS,INFLATION,Can the Treasurer advise the House what contribution the Government wage-tax arrangements made to yesterday's historically low inflation rate? What action does the Government intend to take to ensure continuing low inflation?,78
171,Mr KEATING,INFLATION,"The lower inflation number recorded yesterday would simply not have been there without the wage-tax arrangements under accords mark 5 and 6. I demonstrate this claim by making the be point that in 1989-90 average weekly on a national accounts basis came out at 7.1 per cent, at a time when emare ployers were offering 15 per cent wage they settlements. National average weekly earnings were held at 7.1 per cent into that period and, of course, had a pipeline of only about 5 per cent running into . To secure that number, the Government introduced two tax cuts-one from 1 July 1989 and one from 1 January 1990. Honourable members will remember that were split, with the top marginal rate falling on 1 January 1990. They cost $5.76 billion; they were worth $26 a week to the average taxpayer around average weekly earnings; and they were worth a wage equivalent of 5.2 per cent of average That is why wages were held at 7 per cent during 1989-90 and did not blow to 15 per cent in a boom. On 1 January 1991, we spent on an annual basis an$ 3.5 billion, or $18 a week, for such a person's average weekly earnings, with a wage equivalent of 3.1 per cent to wage and salary earners. Between the two tax the wage equivalent was 8.3 per cent, which was brought out by the strength of the Government's surplus and by its operations under the accord. If that 8 per cent were in the wage system today, we would be looking at an inflation rate of around 11 per cent to 13 per cent. The reason inflation is now at 5 per cent is the accord and the wage-tax trade-offs. While there is some deflationary influence, obviously, from the recession, the great bulk of the fall in inflation has not come from the recession itself, but from the accord. Mr Bradford-Rubbish!",78
172,Mr KEATING,INFLATION,How can the honourable member say 'Rubbish' when I have just read the figures to the House? Mr Bradford-Because you always talk rubbish.,79

190,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,Has the Treasurer completed his answer?,79
191,Mr KEATING,INFLATION,"Taking away from the Government the credit for a massive fall in inflation funded by fiscal policy built on cuts in government spending is a very paltry thing for the Opposition to try to do. We have had an historic breakthrough on inflation, and yet what we find is that the Opposition wishes to pin this on the recession only and not on the strength of the Government's wage policy under the accord. I make the claim again: the ac- . cord is the principal reason why inflation has fallen and it will be the accord which be will be the principal reason why inflation will remain low, coupled with a sensible monetary policy. NA",79
192,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the statement of the Treasurer made during the election campaign of 1990 on his Government's new unemployment policy, in which he said: . . . we've got to go now and intensively interview them . . . make them apply for work. If they don't apply for work, we'll bump them off. What was meant by the statement that he would 'bump them off'? Is it not a fact that Frank will not get his job back until the Prime Minister loses his?",79
193,Mr HAWKE,UNEMPLOYMENT,"What the Treasurer was saying, in shorthand form, was that the Government had taken a decision, which I think was applauded generally at the time, that we would tighten up the work tests. Thus we would have the situation that if a person were in a position of applying for unemployment benefit but had not satisfied the increased stringency of the work test or were not in a training or education program, in those circumstances, and those circumstances alone, unemployment benefit would not be paid. Of course, if in fact that person had sought to get a job, could not get one, met the work test and was not in a training or education program, there would be no question that that person would get the unemployment benefit, and would get it indefinitely while those conditions were met. The Treasurer, in shorthand terms, was referring to that. That was the factual situation of which the Treasurer was aware. NA",79
194,Dr THEOPHANOUS,INFLATION RATE,"I ask the Treasurer whether he is aware of suggestions that the Government should set an inflation target of zero to 2 per cent? What are the implications of such a suggestion and, in particular, what would the implications be for monetary policy with the adoption of such a target?",80
195,Mr KEATING,INFLATION RATE,"The notion of having an inflation target to be policed by a tral bank without any recourse or reference to the state of the economy is something which is unreal and for which this country has no institutional framework for delivery. There is no way that a group of appointed officials in a central bank can simply decimate the economy without reference to the parliamentary processes and the democratic processes that go with that. The Leader of the Opposition yesterday suggested that he should .expropriate the Government's low inflation rate and then take it down to a range of from zero to 2 per cent. The inflation rate for the March quarter for Japan is 4.1 per cent; for the United States, 5.2 per cent; for Germany, 2.7 per cent; and for France, 3.4 per cent. If it was so easy that one just waved a magic wand and told a central bank, 'Here is your target, zero to 2 per cent; go get them and get the rate down', how is it that Japan, which has a very subtle economy, a properly managed monetary system and sitting with 4.1 per cent inflation, Germany with 2.7 per cent inflation and the United States with 5.2 per cent cannot do it? The answer is that there must be a national consensus to bring inflation down. It cannot be brought down simply by a central bank. The notion that one can just hand across, by some legislative amendment, control of such an inflation target to a central bank, when we have seen the economy recessed and unemployment rising in order to get inflation to 4.9 per cent with the wage tax trade-off and, as I said earlier, with nearly $9 billion of tax cuts in place to do it-to think that one can just click one's fingers and down it goes to zero or one per cent has no basis in reality. The Opposition may seek to traffic in it as a way of promoting itself, but it has no basis in reality. That is why, particularly without any recourse to the labour market, without any recourse to the trade unions, particularly outside the context of an incomes policy, it is fairyland stuff. However, on top of that, the Leader of the Opposition wants to add 15 percentcen- age points to prices through a consumption tax while he is going to zero inflation. He wants to take inflation down to zero while he is adding 15 percentage points through a consumption tax. Last night on television he said that it was a one-off increase that would pass through the system. Well, Chernobyl was a one-off event; but the radiation is still passing through the Swiss cows three or fours later. That is what would happen to our inflation rate. It would be a one-off shock, but it would take a while to pass through the Australian economy as we floated back to 15 per cent. As all the dairy herds of Europe are living with the one-off effect of an event in their lives, we would be living with the one-off effect of this simplistic nonsense that we can have a 15 percentage point addition to the price system and zero inflation. It is rubbish. It is not even reportable rubbish. To be proposing at once a zero inflation rate and a 15 per cent consumption tax to go with it is such rubbish it does not even deserve reporting. And this is all at a· time when this Government's policies produce an inflation rate of under 5 per cent, coming from the 11 per cent those opposite produced in similar circumstances in the early 1980s. There is no possibility of the Opposition having a realistic-Dr Hewson interjecting",80

205,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION RATE,"Order! I am sure that members of the Opposition will also take on board what the right honourable member for New England has said-that interjections across the table unparliamentary. Ministers should not respond to interjections, but often, I am sure, even the right honourable member for New England might have been known to have responded to an interjection. We are probably less likely to have this problem if members of the Opposition do not interject while Ministers are giving their answers.",81

207,Mr LLOYD,WATERFRONT WAGES,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that the wage deal he negotiated with the wharfies will, together with national wage increases and other bonuses, ultimately give them more than $100 a week extra on top of the $45,000 they now receive? Is it also a fact that the average farmer will earn this year less than $100 a week? Given the Prime Minister's comments yesterday about social divisions, how does he justify a weekly wage rise for the wharfies which is greater than the income of the farmer? Is this what he means by bringing the nation together?",81
208,Mr HAWKE,WATERFRONT WAGES,"I assume from the question by the honourable gentleman that he believes there should be some indexing or correlation between farm income and the income of wharfies. What a remarkable situation that would be! He knows very well that the income of farmers, by the very nature of their occupation, is highly variable.",81

211,Mr HAWKE,WATERFRONT WAGES,"Unfortunately, it is the case that at this time the income of farmers has been massively reduced-and massively reduced predominantly because of what has happened to the prices they receive for their products. The honourable gentleman well knows-and has been are good enough on occasions to acknowledge it, and I think publicly-the work that the Government is doing to try to tackle the problem. When I go to Europe in a few weeks time, as requested by the members of the Opposition, I will be directly talking to leaders in Europe to try to bring them to their senses on this issue so that our farmers-I believe the most competitive in the world-will be able to do what they would do in an uncorrupted international market for agricultural products, and that is take on and beat the best in the world. The honourable gentleman knows the truth of what I am sayingthat the predominant determinant - ",81

213,Mr SPEAKER,WATERFRONT WAGES,Order! The Deputy Leader of the National Party!,82
214,Mr HAWKE,WATERFRONT WAGES,"The predominant determinant of the present position of low farm incomes is what is happening to prices. The honourable gentleman knows that and he knows, when he is prepared to talk directly on these things, that the Government is doing. all it can to address that problem. If the honourable gentleman wants to suggest that somehow or other, whether with regard to wharfies or any other employed people in the community, there will be an indexed relationship between what happens to farm income and the income of these other people in the community, then that would have to take the blue ribbon prize for stupidity in what is already an array of stupidity from the other side of the House with regard to wage fixing. I have already had cause to quote from the recent issue of Australian Business of 1""i May with regard to the waterfront Wilere the employers point out that the increases in remuneration will flow not merely from the arrangements in which I was involved but will also involve, in particular, incentive and productivity, enterprise-based agreements still to be negotiated. Employers believe that they are appropriate because of the massive increase in productivity which will come from these arrangements. As I said in the House the other day, it is acknowledged in the industry by employers that there will be productivity improvements on the waterfront of the order of 60 per cent as a result of these changes. It is appropriate that the workers involved who will be engaged in relocation, retraining, undertaking more productive duties in a more productive wayand the employers themselves recognise this-should receive some of the benefit of those increases in productivity. Of course, it is appropriate that they should; that is the very essence of getting effective structural reform in this country. We will not get effective structural reform-effective micro-economic reform-if we go along to employees and say, 'Look, you are going to be in a position where a whole lot of your workmates can be put out of a job. You are going to be retrained, ,you are going to have to undertake to work with new machinery in new ways, in more productive ways but'parenthetically-Owe want to tell you that you are not going to get anything out of it, you are not going to get any contribution'. This is a fundamental absurdity. It is my profound hope that the Opposition will not change from the position it has adopted now, and that it will go into the next election with the proposition which underlines the question I have just had put to me; that is, with regard to employees, whether they be on the waterfront or elsewhere, if they are involved in restructuring and reform which produces mas. sive productivity increases, the position of the Opposition will be that those employees get no reward whatsoever for it. I tell the Opposition this: if it goes to the next election with that as its policy, it will be decimated as it deserves to be. NA",82
215,Mr OKEEFE,OVERSEAS TRADING,My question is directed to the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development. Can the Minister inform the House of the significance of the lower domestic inflation rate on Australia's trade performance?,82
216,Dr BLEWETT,OVERSEAS TRADING,"As all honourable members would recognise, the achievement of this lower inflation rate will clearly improve the international competitiveness of our industries and, particularly, I think, the growing competitiveness of Australian goods-I will indicate some figures on that in a moment-will be given further enhancement by the comparative position on inflation. Our inflation rate is now 4.9 per cent which is well below the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of around· 6.3 per cent, and also lower than the average of the seven major industrial economies which include some of our major trading partners. It is important to note that there been a long term decline in the inflation rate in this country over the last three years, and that has tended to run against the international trend which has been moving in the other direction. Our inflation rate reached some 7 per cent in late 1988, and at that time the annual inflation in the seven major industrial economies was running at around 3.5 per cent. Of course, that gap between inflation in this country and in the seven major industrial powers overseas was much commented upon by the media in this country. We have now reversed that relationship between our inflation rate and those of the major industrial countries.",82

222,Dr BLEWETT,OVERSEAS TRADING,"May I make the comment that, as I have already said, that is something that has been trending over time and running contrary to the general movement in the OECD countries. I think we can look forward to a further welcome boost to our trading position as a result of this. We are already running a significant surplus on merchandise trade. Trade surpluses have been recorded in 10 out of the last 12 months. Despite very weak commodity prices and major problems in two of our major export industries, we have been running a significant surplus on merchandise trade. If we look at the figures over the last year, exports rose by over 10 per cent in March 1991 compared to the March 1990 figure. Even more importantly, given our emphasis on the nations of the Association of South East Asian Nations, over the last year there has been a 30 per cent increase in export trade with those countries; that is, up from $3.2 billion to $4.2 billion. We can look forward to a further has competitive advantage in relation to our trading partners as a result of this inflation change. NA NA",83
223,Mr HOWARD,RELATIONS COMMISSION,My question is directed to. the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. What is the future role of the Industrial Relations Commission in wage fixation in Australia?,83
224,Mr WILLIS,RELATIONS COMMISSION,I think that is something that will be determined by the evolution of events in the course of this year. Dr Hewson interjecting,83
225,Mr SPEAKER,RELATIONS COMMISSION,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,83
226,Mr WILLIS,RELATIONS COMMISSION,"As I said, it will be determined by the evolution of events. We have a situation where the Commission has, for the first time since the accord has been in place, refused to implement the accord. Of course, that is the absolute right of the Commission. It is an independent body and it has the absolute right, if it so wishes, not to accept the arguments of the parties supporting the accord and to come to a decision of some other kind, which it has done in the national wage case. That is the Commission's absolute right. However, it must accept that if it does that and the parties still believe that the accord is in the national good and should be pursued despite the Commission's decision, and that they have an absolute right to do that, the Commission's role must necessarily change. The Commission's importance has been enormously enhanced in recent years by the accord. The Commission's historic role was not to determine the absolute level of wage increases year by year; its role was to establish award conditions which were minima, on top of which there were additional conditions of employment, including additional wage increases, built in in the marketplace. That was the role it played. It was a part role, not the whole of the role. But through the accord, what has been happening is that the Commission, through its decisions up until now to implement the accord, has been determining not just the minimum increases that would apply but also the absolute level of increases that would apply year by year. That has given it an enhanced role over and above that which it has historically had. The Commission's absolute right to make the decision in the national wage case a month ago not to continue that process carries with it the implication that the role that it has had in the last six or seven years will no longer apply, particularly in light of the view of the parties to the accord that they wish, for reasons which I and the Government believe to be very good ones, to proceed with the accord. It will be carried out without the involvement of the Commission, I suspect. Of course, it may be that the Commission, in the light of events, would still see that perhaps it should carry out a role. In some respects I guess it will continue to do so, but in general we must expect that the outcome, until there is a further review of the principles, will be that the Commission's role will be a reduced one. How it develops after that depends on what further principles are developed by the Commission and the parties' response to them. NA EDUCATION: NEW SOUTH WALES",83
227,Mr DUBOIS,TECHNICAL AND FURTHER,"Is the Minister for Employment, Education and Training aware of reports that the New South Wales technical and further education system is in chaos, with large numbers of both intending and continuing students being unable to obtain places in T AFE?

228,Mr DAWKINS,TECHNICAL AND FURTHER,"I am bound to agree with the assessment that the New South Wales TAFE system does find itself in a state of chaos.

Unfortunately, the New South Wales Government has decided to reduce its funding commitments to the T AFE system in New South Wales, thereby reducing the number of opportunities available for people desiring to enter T AFE and even in relation to those people in the T AFE system in T AFE courses desiring to complete them. If we look at the report of the Auditor General in New South Wales, we find that in 1988 there were 474,000 places. By 1990, this had fallen by nearly 100,000 places to 373,000 places, growing only slightly back to 400,000 places in 1991. This is as a result of the New South Wales Government pursuing a policy which introduced fees extensively into the TAFE system and rdying on the development of courses for which it could either charge fees through that system or, in other ways, charge industry. I think this has had appalling consequences for young people. It means that the queues outside T AFE colleges have extended. Worse than that, people halfway through their courses have been obliged to discontinue those courses. The honourable member asks what the Commonwealth's role has been in this area. As he would know, the Commonwealth has a minor role in the funding of T AFE throughout Australia. But to the extent that we have been funding T AFE, our funding has increased in real terms in recent years, in terms of our commitment to both recurrent and capital expenditure. I remind the House that in the March statement the Prime Minister announced that we would increase our funding for TAFE in New South Wales by $16.6m in order to increase by some 5,000 the number of places in prevocational courses. This is a serious matter, not only for those people who are affected but also for the training effort which is so crucial to Australia's future development. In an area which is more centrally the Commonwealth's obligation, that of higher education, between the period 1987 to this triennium ending in 1993 we have increased the number of university places by more than 26,000 at a time when the New South Wales Government has chosen to reduce the number of places in T AFE. For a party and a government which prides itself on good management, this is a very poor example of management of its own financial resources and, more importantly, appalling planning in terms of the human resource requirements of New South Wales in the future. POLITICAL ADVERTISING: HUMAN NA  dressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to advice that the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, has provided to the Government. He said that the political advertising ban contravenes article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Does the Government still maintain that the role of the Commission is to act as a public watchdog for the Government on abuses of human rights? If so, can he explain the seemingly inexplicable, namely, why the Government refuses to make Mr Burdekin's advice public?",84
229,Mr HAWKE,RIGHTS COMMISSION,"The Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Burdekin, has made his views known both publicly and privately from the time the Government announced its decision to introduce legislation to regulate broadcasting of litical advertisements and to provide for effective disclosure of political donations. Relevant Ministers have always been concerned to ensure that the proposed legislation would be consistent with Australia's international obligations under the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Mr Burdekin's advice was provided before he had seen the Bill, which was introduced into the Parliament on Thursday, 9 May. On receipt of Mr Burdekin's advice, the Government considered whether it should proceed with the Bill. It was satisfied that the issues raised by Mr Burdekin concerning freedom of speech were those which had been considered by Ministers during the preparation of the legislation and, therefore, were matters of which the Government was fully aware. The Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, sent copies of the Bill, the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech to the Human Rights Commissioner and has sought a meeting with him to discuss any concerns which Mr Burdekin might still have considering the Bill. I assure the honourable member that the Government will review the position in the light of those discussions between Senator Bolkus and Mr Burdekin.  you table his advice?",85
230,Mr HAWKE,RIGHTS COMMISSION,"I am not prepared to give that undertaking. I will have discussion with the relevant Ministers and see whether it is appropriate to provide it. I know that the honourable member has asked the question seriously. I think the important thing is to say that those discussions will be held with Mr Burdekin to see whether, in the light of what the Government has done, he still has those concerns. We will review the position in the light of the discussions between the Minister and Mr Burdekin. NA NA",85
231,Mr HULLS,COMMISSION,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The House, I am sure, would be po- aware that the Minister has recently announced the establishment of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the appointment of a chairman designate as part of the Government's recovery plan for the wool industry. I ask the Minister: what indeed is the role of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission?",85
232,Mr KERIN,COMMISSION,"Basically, the role of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission is to clear, on behalf of the wool industry, the wool industry's debt and to clear the stockpile in the most sensitive and the most commercial way possible. During the life of the previous reserve price scheme, on two occasions about two million bales of wool were cleared, but in the present circumstances we have a far different situation from any we have ever had before. Following the Vines committee report and a range of other advice to the Government, we decided that the best way to handle this unprecedentedly large stockpile and debt was to set up a Wool Realisation Commission at some distance from the Wool Corporation itself, but certainly in conjunction with it as far as the Wool Corporation's ongoing role is concerned. We think that, once we have the Wool Realisation Commission selected, it will get on with the job in as transparent a way as is possible with removing the stockpile and putting it out onto the market. I have already made announcements about the Government's strategy in this regard, and the transparency is very much contained within the approach of a debt reduction schedule. The reason why the Government put in a loan facility of some $200m up front-that is, effectively some $45m cash up front-was so that there is no undue pressure put on the Realisation Commission to put wool onto the market in the first year or two of the Commission's activities. This is all a question of balance; it is all a question of estimation; it is all a question of commercial adaptation to circumstances as they unfold. At present, there are all sorts of estimates around, for example, of the size of the wool clip in the year ahead. Some estimates are now down to 900 million kilograms, and of course there are all sorts of estimates around as to the price that will prevail in a free market; and it is because we are dealing with conjecture that there is a need for commercial flexibility as well as transparency. In passing, I point out that there has been a lot of discussion about whether or not the wool tax or levy should be 12 or 15 per cent, and what everyone ignores, of course, is that we do not understand what 12 or 15 per cent is going to be of. In other words, we do not know the price. If the price averaged 400c for the season ahead, the difference between 12 and 15 per cent is exactly 12c. That is why, when the Leader of the National Party says that 15 per cent is pure thuggery, 12 per cent is okay and 8 per cent is delectable, it is a complete nonsense. An amount of 12c is not going to send 25 per cent of the wool industry broke, as the Leader of the National Party would have us believe. These are all matters for a very fine commercial judgment. I believe that with the setting-up of the Wool Realisation Commission and the appointment of Mr David Clarke of the Macquarie Bank, an astute leading financial figure, as Chairman of that Commission-he has accepted the position-we will certainly see the most sensible path being taken in getting on with the job of getting rid of the stockpile, getting rid of the debt and reestablishing the wool industry to fit the role that it once played in our economy. NA",85
233,Mr TIM FISCHER,URANIUM MINING,"I might add, there is a big difference, in fact. My question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will be aware that the Supervising Scientist, Mr Bob Fry, has told a Senate Estimates committee that the Ranger mine is not causing any harm to the environment of Kakadu National Park. Therefore, what reason has he for persisting with the present 'illogical' uranium policy, other than to stop the Left and Centre Left deserting him in his hour of need? Has the Prime Minister taken it off the agenda? Why is the Prime Minister continually putting his own leadership problems ahead of the national interest?",86
234,Mr HAWKE,URANIUM MINING,"The premise of the question is entirely false. We only have to examine this question to see the absurdity of it. I am told and the House is told by the questioner that the Supervising Scientist has said in respect of an existing mine, Ranger mine, that there is no problem. Therefore, it follows that there is no problem for any mine anywhere in Australia. Is the logic of that premise not devastating? The honourable member was so absurd in his question that he really should be laughed out of court. Let us just pursue it through with him. He is saying that the Supervising· Scientist has said in respect of Ranger, 'No problem'. So, therefore, we are to draw the conclusion that wherever, in whatever conditions, in whatever environment we were to have a mine, because the Ranger mine is all right, every other mine is all right. Do not be so damn stupid! ROADS: BLACK SPOT PROGRAM",86
235,Mr HARRY WOODS,URANIUM MINING,My question is directed to the Minister for Land Transport. Could he advise whether the black spot program that he recently announced for New South Wales includes funding for the upgrading of the Pacific Highway?,87
236,Mr ROBERT BROWN,URANIUM MINING,"In short, the answer is yes. But I would like to compliment all honourable members of the Parliament who have indicated, by their support for that program, a very positive endorsement of it. I have very recently had the opportunity of announcing the projects which have been adopted in the first year of that program for New South Wales, Victoria and some of the other States as well. Queensland is imminent. In Victoria, for example, in the first year, there will be over 200 of those death spots on the road network that will· be corrected. In New South Wales for the first year, it is about $141j2m towards a total of $32m for that State over the total three-year term of that program. In New South Wales it is going to make it possible to correct, just in that first year, about Paper. 195 death spots on the New South Wales road network. The honourable member refers particularly to the Pa,cific Highway. In this first year, it is $3.7m, which is going to make it possible to correct about 35 of the death spots on the Pacific Highway, including some of those to which the honourable member for Page and the honourable member for Richmond and some of their colleagues along the coast as well have drawn my attention. One, for example, is in the electorate of Page at the intersection of the Pacific Highway and the Bruxner Highway. I know that the honourable member for Page has been particularly concerned about that. That is one of those that, from the total of $899,000 that has been allocated for his electorate in the first year alone, will be fixed up. But I want to emphasise that-Mr Downer-Only in Labor electorates, is it?",87
237,Mr ROBERT BROWN,URANIUM MINING,"No, of course that is not the case. If the honourable member opposite will just listen for a moment, he will hear. As a result of the commitment on the part of this Government to put $11 Om into the correction of those death spots, we expect that the impact could be the saving of something like 220 lives a year. So do not trivialise it. There will be major reductions in crashes and injuries as well, so do not trivialise it. We are delighted, and I want to indicate my personal appreciation of the very strong level of commitment that the Prime Minister himself brought to that program. The amount of $11 Om will be applied by this Government over three years to correct those death spots. It is one of the most outstanding programs for road safety that has ever been adopted by any government in Australia. While honourable members will never be able to identify those people whose lives will be saved as a result of it, they can be damned sure that hundreds of people will live as a result of it.",87
238,Mr HAWKE,URANIUM MINING,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice NA",87
239,Dr HEWSON,LEGISLATION,I was wondering whether I could seek advice from the Prime Minister concerning a Bill presently before the Parliament entitled the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991. I have written to the Prime Minister about this matter and I wonder whether he could now inform the House whether he intends to split this into two Bills and treat them separately.,87
240,Mr SPEAKER,LEGISLATION,"Order! The time for asking questions is during Question Time, not after Question Time-except for questions to me. PARLIAMENT: TELEVISING OF NA",87
241,Mr CADMAN,PROCEEDINGS,"Mr Speaker, I wish to draw your attention to a matter concerning the televising of the House. Yesterday, my colleague the honourable member for Corinella asked a brilliant question of the Prime Minister about the problems he is having with leadership.",88
242,Mr SPEAKER,PROCEEDINGS,Order! The honourable member for Mitchell will get to his question.,88
243,Mr CADMAN,PROCEEDINGS,"Strangely, at that time, Mr Speaker, when the Prime Minister went t-o answer, the cameras recording the process stayed on you.",88
244,Mr SPEAKER,PROCEEDINGS,That is probably very appropriate. They ought to do that all the time. What is wrong with that?,88
245,Mr CADMAN,PROCEEDINGS,"None of the medianone of the press and none of the television stations of Australia-have had a chance to record what the Prime Minister said. To ensure a proper record of the proceedings of the Parliament, the camera operators ought to be instructed to move immediately to the person who is going to respond rather than focus on people who may have an interest in the answer.",88
246,Mr SPEAKER,PROCEEDINGS,I think that the honourable member for Mitchell has just commended to me some great moments in television that should continue. It would be very wrong of me to issue instructions that camera operators should not film me-maybe they should not put the cameras onto the honourable member for Mitchell.,88
247,Unknown,PROCEEDINGS,Opposition members interjecting,88
248,Mr SPEAKER,PROCEEDINGS,"They have not focused on the honourable member for Mackellar because he is underemployed. The honourable member for Mitchell also raised a matter with me a day or so ago which I will have a look at. I am sure that the television audience in my electorate, at least, is probably more interested in seeing as much of me as it possibly can. If that means that it misses out on seeing the honourable member for Corinella, we might seek some advice. MENZIES BY-ELECTION",88
249,Mr FIFE,PROCEEDINGS,"Mr Speaker, I wish to raise a question with you. On Saturday, 13 May, Mr Kevin Andrews was elected to represent the electorate of Menzies. I am informed that as a result of a recent amendment to the Commonwealth Electorate Act, notwithstanding that he won approximately 68 per cent of the primary vote and that the poll has been declared, he could not be sworn in today as a member of this House. I ask you as Speaker whether you would take up the matter with the Government with a view to having the Act amended to remove what must surely be an unintended consequence, so that the happening that has occurred on this occasion will not occur again.",88
250,Mr SPEAKER,PROCEEDINGS,"If both Houses of Parliament-the House of Representatives and the Senate-have passed legislation that has prevented this occurring, that is a matter that the Houses after due and proper deliberation have decided upon. You have raised your point, the Leader of the House has heard your point and it is a matter for the Government to take up, not a matter for me to deal with. NA",88
251,Mr DOWNER,AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY,"Mr Speaker, I refer you to an article which appears in this morning's edition of the Sydney Morning Herald written by Pilita Clark in which the following words appeared: Another MP-Ml' SPEAKE--Order!",88
252,Mr DOWNER,AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY,"With due respect, Mr Speaker, you will not understand the question if I cannot tell you what the quote is. The article states: Another MP summed up t,he feelings of many of his colleagues when he commented on the MPs widely regarded as Mr Keating's campaign managers: This is the quote which is relevant to the question: ""Just look who's pushing this; Leo [MCLeay], [Laurie] Brereton and Squeaky [Gary] Punch. These guys are hardly the brains trust of the Party . . .",88
253,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY,I remind the honourable member for Mayo that it has always been a practice of the House that one sions should not use quotations as a mechanism thorises to use unparliamentary language.,89
254,Mr DOWNER,AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY,"Mr Speaker, to say you are not the brains trust of the Party is unparliamentary?",89
255,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY,"I am sure that is most particularly not unparliamentary but, having read the quote, I hope the honourschedule able member will not allow himself to fall into a trap that I might then pick him on.",89
256,Mr DOWNER,AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY,"I am not going to, Mr Speaker, in the light of the fact these references to you are a contempt your very high office, will you endeavour to establish who made these comments and Health Services. and take the appropriate action against that member?",89
257,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY,"I must say to the honourable member for Mayo that been reliably informed by a number members of the Government that they believe a phone call was made to the TATIVES honourable member for Mayo, who ported himself to be a member of Government and thus may have made those quotes. I think the members Government-Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, that is so fatuous and fictitious that I do not think anyone in Australia would remotely believe it.",89
258,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY,"I think the members of the Government who said that to me were probably only being mischievous, but it just goes to show the difficulty one has in tracking down quotes that come particularly from the Sydney Morning Herald and from those who want to be anonymous in dealing with that newspaper.

261,Mr BEAZLEY,ADMINISTRATION,"I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the detailed response to the recommendations from the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, Not Dollars Alone. Leave granted. The document read as followsNA NA NA ADMINISTRATION-""NOT DOLLARS NA NA Recommendation 1 (paragraph 4.21) The Committee recommends that departments: - accord high priority to internal devolution of the running costs system including to regional offices; and - increase their efforts in identifying the results to be achieved with given resources and in linking resource allocation decisions to those results. Government Response The Government is determined that devolution of responsibility within the public sector will remain a key thrust of the reforms introduced under the Financial Management Improvement Program. In particular, it believes that future progress in this area will depend on the internal devolution of administrative responsibilities for running costs appropriations within departments and agencies, including their regional offices. The Government also will continue to encourage departments and agencies to focus attention on the link between resource ""inputs"" and the achievement of program results. It also should be recognised, however, that the Parliament, through its scrutiny of the efficiency and effectiveness of programs has an important role to play in achieving ""value for money"". Comment The Government's response to recommendations dealing with devolution are dealt with in detail in relation to Recommendation 9. With regard to the inter-relationship of devolution and running costs, the Government considers that the introduction of the overall running costs system has provided agencies with a medium-term, predictable base for resource allocation decisions, together with the flexibility to manage within broader-but tighter-budgetary limits. The flexibility of the system allows program managers freedom to make transfers between various inputs, including between administrative expenditures and salaries andwithin prescribed limits-between financial years. The Government shares the view of the Committee that devolution within agencies-including that to Commonwealth Regional Offices-has scope for improvement. The Government has a commitment to further encouraging agencies to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the FMIP reforms. This will include the further devolution of authority and responsibility throughout their administrative structures. In relation to the better linking of resource ""inputs"" and the ""results"" achieved by programs, the Government considers that the manner in which Program Management and Budgeting ALONE"" (PMB) has been introduced has acted to focus managers' attention on the issue of""value for money"". The Government is confident that the framework is now in place by which strategicallyfocused, outcome-oriented objectives will work to bring about increasingly cost-effective ""results"". This framework will also provide a firm basis for the reporting of performance-both internally and to the Parliament-and aid both portfolio Ministers and those concerned with central budgetary decision-making in determining resource allocations and the setting of priorities within Government. Recommendation 2 (paragraph 4.39) The Committee recommends that the DOF - take steps to improve its marketing of 'the efficiency dividend' policy to public service organisations; and - continue to take careful account of the merits of exceptional cases in applying the 'efficiency dividend' policy. Government Response The Government accepts the recommendation of the Committee. Comment The Government has repeatedly espoused the obligation on the Public Service to generate ongoing efficiencies in its general operations, and the prerogative of governments to decide on the distribution or utilisation of the savings generated by the efficiency gains. In a letter to public service union officials in 1988, the then Ministers for Finance and Industrial Relations stated that the: "". .. Government's policy to seek efficiency gains . . . was designed to provide departments with a medium term perspective and a stable planning environment rather than subject them to arbitrary and last minute savings measures. ""The justification for the efficiency dividend rests on the very substantial improvements in the management environment in recent years . . . It is necessary both for central budgeting, and also for management and planning in each department, to set annual targets and to anticipate the achievement of those targets in departmental budgets."" The Government believes that there is scope for efficiency improvements in the public sector as elsewhere and has therefore decided on an annual 'dividend' of 1.25% of running costs to be returned to the budget by all agencies, bar a small number of explicit exemptions. This procedure imposes an even-handed degree of discipline on agencies for the efficient use of operational expenses and delivers an incentive for managers to utilise the opportunities provided by the financial management reforms. There are other direct incentives for efficient management deriving from the ability of agencies to retain savings over and above the dividend and other revenues arising, for example, from retention of some receipts earned discretionally by agencies. Recommendation 3 (paragraph 5.29) The Committee recommends that departments and agencies should have in place appropriate management information systems to provide accurate costing information either in conjunction with or as soon as possible after the introduction of charging. Government Response The Government accepts the recommendation of the Committee. Comment As discussed further in relation to Recommendation 11 of the Committee's report, the Government recognises the importance of effective Management Information Systems (MISs). Such systems are considered essential to the successful implementation of a range of reforms introduced under the FMIP including; the devolution of responsibility; performance monitoring and the subsequent internal and external reporting of results for accountability purposes; evaluation; and user charging. With specific regard to user charging, the Government notes that, as detailed in the Committee's report, tangible incentives are now available through receipts retention for departments and agtmcies to benefit from a proportion of the receipts arising from the sale of goods or services. Any receipts retained by agencies, however, will involve only those monies over and above the costs incmred in the production of the goods and services sold. This situation will send powerful signals to the individual managers involved. The Government is confident, therefore, that managers will respond to these signals and ensure that Management Information Systems which can provide accurate costing information on production activities are in place, or soon will be set in place, the time of the introduction of user charging. Recommendation 4 (paragraph 5.50) The Committee recommends that there should be a case by case determination of 'public interest' elements of government programs and that the DOF accept responsibilities for the consistency of the criteria applied. Government Response The Government accepts the recommendation of the Committee. Comment The Government agrees with the Committee's view that the Department of Finance, as the central agency with particular responsibility in this matter, should take a consistent approach in the determination of ""public interest"" elements within Government programs. Clear, central guidance will enable individual managers in departments and agencies to assess their particular circumstances and take advantage of the opportunities available following the introduction of user charging and the related retention of receipts. At the same time, however, it should be recognised that criteria produced by central agencies such as Finance necessarily will provide only general guidance to agencies and individual managers. In the final analysis, determination of the public interest elements of government programs resides with the individuals who manage those programs. Recommendation 5 (paragraph 5.69) The Committee recommends that DOF give particular attention to reviewing the revenue retention arrangements for research organisations such as the Defence Science and Technology Organisation to ensure that those organisations receive adequate financial returns and incentive in commercialising their innovations. Government Response The Government notes the Committee's recommendation. In response, it points out that, on 7 \ November 1990, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel announced that the profits arising from the commercial activities of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) would be retained by the Defence portfolio and, in the first instance, would go toward providing working capital for developing DSTO's commercial activities. (The text of the relevant News Release is attached.) The Government is confident that the new arrangements announced in relation to DSTO will form a broad model by which national research organisations can receive incentives to further commercialise their operations and subsequent innovations. Recommendation 6 (paragraph 5.88) at The Committee recommends that DOF should review reporting requirements in relation to user charging under Explanatory Notes and other statutory reporting requirements with a view to resolving any unnecessary duplication. Government Response The Government is committed to ensure that proper accountability information on program performance and activities is available in the various reporting documents with the least practicable duplication. In relation to Portfolio Explanatory Notes, the Government considers that, subject to the on-going inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration (SSCFPA) into Matters Relating to Estimates Committees' Documentation and Procedures, the current guidelines for the presentation of information relating to receipts from user charging will require only marginal changes into the medium-term. Comment The Government notes that the present guidelines for the preparation of Portfolio Explanatory Notes require that, for each program element reporting in the Notes, all details of staffing and other resources available are set-out for scrutiny by Parliament. Further, this specifically includes ""receipts included in net annotated appropriations"" which would encompass most agencies' receipts from the implementation of charging for services. (Attachment A to 1990-91 Portfolio Explanatory Notes Guidelines, issued as Estimates Memorandum 1990/17, page 13 refers.) In the case of larger commercial activities within agencies, the Government notes that the current inquiry by the SSCFP A into Matters Relating to Estimates Committees' Documentation and Procedures will report on the effective parliamentary scrutiny of Trust Accounts. This will inform future Government decisions on the reporting mechanisms for public sector Trust Accounts. Recommendation 7 (paragraph 5.89) The Committee asks to be informed of the present policies applied by DOF in the following areas: - revenue retention; - budget supplementation; - public interest' issues; - external charging; - charging under competitive conditions; and - incentives for good performance. This information is to be made available shortly after the end of each financial year between now and the end of the 1992/93 financial year. Government Response The Government welcomes the opportunity to regularly inform Parliament and parliamentary committees of the changes which are, and have been, taking place within the Commonwealth public sector. With regard to the actual format and timing of such briefing, however, the Government is of the view that this would be best left to further negotiation and agreement between the Department of Finance and the Committee itself. Recommendation 8 (paragraph 6.29) The Committee recommends that further streamlining of the budgetary and regulatory framework should have regard to a demonstrated and significant improvement in performance information and evaluation and accountability practices within the public sector. Government Response The Government accepts the recommendation of the Committee, and points to past achievements in this area. Comment A common theme of the budgetary and other major public sector reforms has been the expectation that efficiency and effectiveness would improve if individual Ministers and their departments assumed more active control over their program resource- and outcomes-that is, through the devolution of responsibility for these matters to the individuals who are best placed to take necessary decisions. This is being done by a lessening of many of the detailed and prescriptive controls exercised by central agencies, and encouraging departments to use the greater flexibility now available to them to actually manage (as opposed to administer) their functional responsibilities; managing the resources given to them; managing the risks that may be inherent in their activities; and accepting the fact that they will be called to account for the results they achieve. Devolution is not an end in itself, but rather a means to achieve improved performance. Quite properly, those who are devolving authority expect improved reporting on how devolved powers are being used to enhance performance. Thus the reforms have also given major emphasis to the issue of accountability. (Aspects of accountability are also dealt with in response to the Committee's Recommendation 13, below). In terms of the actual reporting of program performance, the Government believes that the quality of performance information available for proper accountability to internal management, the Executive and Parliament has been materially enhanced. There has been a deliberate attempt to focus accountability on performance and what is being achieved with the resources made available. This contrastS with the previous system of accountability which concentrated almost exclusively on reporting inputs and processes. (A further discussion of Performance Information is offered in response to the Committee's Recommendation 10, while a detailed treatment of the issue of the evaluation of programs is given in response to Recommendation 12.) Recommendation 9 (paragraph 6.53) The Committee recommends that departments: - review the appropriateness of the devolutionary steps taken to date and identify where further devolutionary steps (if any) are justified; - plan and train staff to ensure that devolution is undertaken effectively; and . - progress the development of relevant information, communication and evaluation systems. Government Response The Government accepts the view of the Committee. Comment The need to provide public sector managers with greater authority has been a consistent theme running through reports on public administration since the mid-1970s (eg the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration [1976] and the Reid Review of Commonwealth Administration [1983]). A common concern has been an imbalance between authority and responsibility. Of perhaps greater importance has been the low level, and diffuse nature, of both these concepts. Budgetary and regulatory reforms have paid particular attention to placing decision-making in the hands of those best placed to make particular decisions. At the same time, however, increased devolution of responsibility must be matched by an enhanced level of accountability for the decisions which have been taken. In terms of centralised controls, the Government believes that devolution of budgetary and financial management authority from the traditional ""watch-dog"" agencies to ""line"" departments has gone as far as it can. The total to each agency from the budget must continue to be set by Ministers collectively, with agencies having incentives to achieve savings within that total and, in some cases, to pursue additional revenue through charging. Within this framework, portfolio budgeting means that all but the more politically sensitive and costly resource allocation decisions are now in the hands of individual Ministers and their portfolios, subject only to ratification by Cabinet - the The Government is aware, however, that devolution of responsibility within agencies has substantial scope for improvement. As recognised by the Committee, devolution can be a protracted process, which may be extended by ""some attitudinal and systemic obstacles to implementation of devolution which will take time to overcome"" (paragraph 6.52). A major impediment to devolution at this level has been the lack of adequate information systems. Another impediment has been the attitude of many managers, which is sometimes the result of inadequate training and development. At the same time, senior departmental management has had to grapple with getting the right balance between devolved decision making and corporate management. As made clear in the response to the first recommendation presented by the Committee, the Government will continue to encourage agencies to overcome these obstacles to introduce further devolution within their administration. In this regard it should be noted that the Management Improvement Advisory Committee (MIAC), the structure and function of which is detailed in response to Recommendation 11 of the Committee, has given priority to investigating current practices as they relate to devolution. The results of the MIAC review will contribute significantly to the development of strategies to encourage further, effective devolution within agencies. In light of this, the Government welcomes the recommendation of the Committee on devolution and endorses its view that ""devolution must lead to improved performance and systems"" (ibid). Recommendation 10 (paragraph 7.23) The Committee recommends that: - Departments and agencies should make a concerted effort to develop performance information that assists decision-making and accountability. There should be a demonstrated improvement in this regard by 1992; and - the Department of Finance should increase its practical assistance to departments with emphasis on development of performance information relating to program effectiveness. Government Response The Government accepts the premise of the Committee's recommendation. resources available Comment As noted in the 1988 FMIP Report, the report originally referred to the Committee, ""the task of change and improvement has just started."" (pp 83) Three broad areas were then identified as requiring priority in the period ahead, namely: - performance information and enhanced accountability; - performance incentives; and development of departmental management systems. It was indicated that these will be areas to be given priority in further developing the overall FMI Program. The Government is confident that, on the evidence of past improvements in performance reporting, departments and agencies will meet the challenge of further, ""demonstrated"" improvements by 1992. With regard to the future efforts of the Department of Finance, the Government notes that, as the agency with primary responsibility for implementation of the FMIP, it is itself open to the scrutiny of the Executive and Parliament. The Government, therefore, would direct attention to the basic accountability documentation provided by the Department of Finance, most notably its Portfolio Explanatory Notes and Annual Report. The Government invites monitoring and scrutiny of the activities and associated results which Finance must achieve over the stated reporting period. Recommendation 11 (paragraph 7.46) The Committee recommends that: - departments and agencies should make consistent and substantial efforts to develop appropriate management information and reporting systems that facilitate monitoring performance, decision-making and accountability; and - the monitoring of developments within departments and agencies and the identification and dissemination of 'best practice' should be a priority focus of the MIAC's annual work plan. Government Response The Government accepts the Committee's view regarding the development of MISs within departments and agencies. With regard to the work priorities of the MIAC, the Government points out that the MIAC itself has nominated ""best practice"" as the focus of its efforts. Comment As noted by the Committee, line managers at the operating levels of departments and agencies require detailed information relating to basic transactions, inputs, workload, standards, activities and outputs. Higher levels of management meanwhile-within the same organisation and concerned with meeting the same basic objectivesrequire information which is more condensed, relying on disparate sources and identifying the critical factors affecting overall program or organisational performance. In particular, higher-level management have a need for access - to information on outcomes. It is up to the organisation's Management Information System (MIS) to service the information requirements of all managers so that soundly-based decisions can be taken at all levels. The Government endorses the view that the development of appropriate management information systems is essential to devolved management, implementation of user charging, monitoring of performance, good evaluation practices and the meeting of internal and external accountability requirements. The Government acknowledges the Committee's view that departments' and agencies' achievements in this area to date have been limited, but is confident that MIS development will be a focus for future efforts. With regard to the future work of the Management Improvement Advisory Committee (MIAC), the Government notes that the Committee was specifically formed as a body to provide advice to the Management Advisory Board (MAB) across a broad range of management issues and to ensure that individual managers have access to examples of ""best practice"" or ""models of success"" as an underpinning to their development of management systems and practices. The Government considers the formation of the MIAC, and particularly the emphasis placed on structuring the Committee to be representative of the public service as a whole, to be a valuable initiative in improving public administration. It is confident that the MIAC will contribute maniof festly to the future success of the FMIP. Recommendation 12 (paragraph 7.62) The Committee recommends that: - departments and agencies should make a consistent and systematic effort to develop their evaluation planning processes and link these more consistently to their decision making and priority setting. Th-re should be a demonstrated improvement in this regard by 1992; - the Department of Finance should: - increase and more effectively target its practical assistance on evaluation to departments; and - ensure that departmental evaluations are linked into the decision-making of the central budgetary processes. Government Response As previously discussed in relation to performance information (recommendation 10), program evaluation has been identified by the Government as a priority area for further work in implementing the FMIP reforms. The Government is confident, therefore, that the challenges set out in this recommendation can' be met. Comment The development of systematic evaluation is integral to the Commonwealth budgetary and financial management reforms. Systematic evaluation is important to those reforms and to public sector management generally, because of its key role in linking program implementation with planning and budgeting and its ability to allow individual programs to demonstrate their achievements against planned outcomes. The primary purpose of program evaluation is program improvement. Evaluation also is intended, however, to aid resource allocation decisions-at each of the program, agency and Cabinet levels-provide a basis for accounting for the utilisation of public funds and enhancing the basic knowledge which managers possess of their program's operations and outcomes. While there has always been a significant amount of evaluation activity in Commonwealth departments and agencies, it has not in the past been an explicit, planned and systematic part of public sector management. In response to this, the Government, in November 1988, endorsed a broad strategy aimed at incorporating systematic evaluation as part of public sector management. Specific requirements of this strategy included: - each department and agency was required to develop evaluation plans covering all of their evaluation activities which provided that all programs would undergo a major evaluation over a rolling five year periodthis was intended to promote the better linking of evaluation to other agency-based plans (eg Corporate Plans); - each portfolio was to prepare a rolling three year Portfolio Evaluation Plan (PEP) for major evaluations-with terms of reference to be included for evaluations in the first yearwhich would be provided to the Department of Financethis was intended to promote portfolio coordination of evaluation activity, and enhance actual progress in evaluation through developing a documented commitment to be fulfilled. It should be noted that the definition of ""major"" evaluations in terms of the PEPs embraced those evaluations which were deemed significant in resource or policy terms. The Government acknowledges that there has so far been considerable variation in the performance of departments and agencies in both evaluation planning and practice. The Government is satisfied, however, that evaluation will become established as a normal element of management through the ""management cycle"". In particular, it would point out that: - the quality of terms of reference for evaluations has improved since the 1988 strategy was announced; - an increasing number of evaluations are directed toward testing achievement against planned outcomes; - portfolios and agencies across the Commonwealth public sector are taking active steps to expand evaluation-rela-ed knowledge and skills amongst staff; and - the results of evaluations are increasingly being linked to decisions on future resource allocation decisions both within portfolios and at the level of the budget itself. Much effort within evaluation continues to focus on de-mystifying the subject. Perceptions that evaluation is an intricately complex process, not readily understandable by, or accessible to, program personnel is not uncommon. Reducing such barriers to the adoption of good evaluation planning and practice is not a simple matter. Clear articulation and shared agreement with relevant parties of purposes of a particular evaluation, involvement of program personnel in identifying the questions an evaluation should answer etc, are all approaches currently being encouraged as aids to this process of de-mystification. It is in this context that the future involvement of the Department of Finance should be discussed. As part of the strategy announced in 1988, the Government directed that Finance was to contribute, within the framework of the FMIP, to enhancing evaluation processes and skills in portfolios by: - acting as a catalyst and co-ordinator to identify and promulgate best practices in evaluation; - producing guidelines booklets on program evaluation and cost benefit analysis; - making available Department of Finance resources to provide economic, statistical and methodological advice on program evaluation issues; - participating in selected joint evaluations with portfolios where that would serve to enhance Service-wide evaluation skills and promulgate best practices; and - assisting in the development of management information systems to support evaluation. Progress made by Finance in what is now a key element of its overall functions is reported through the major accountability documents produced by the portfolio-Portfolio Explanatory Notes (to be re-titled as Program Performance Statements, as called for in Recommendation 14, below) and the Department of Finance Annual Report. The Government suggests that the discussion of the results achieved in this regard will provide valuable, on-going information on the progress of evaluation within the public sector, and of Finance's role in fostering this progress. Recommendation 13 (paragraph 8.54) The Committee recommends that: - the Department of Finance, in consultation with the Parliament and its committees, undertake a regular program of seminars to inform· members and staff of the Parliament about FMIP changes and their accountability implications; - the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet consider revising the 'Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses Appearing Before Parliamentary Committees and Related Matters' to better reflect the accountability requirements of public servants that arise from the FMIP changes; and - an arrangement be formalised for parliamentary committee chairpersons and deputy chairpersons to meet on a regular basis to discuss parliamentary committee objectives and interrelationships. Government Response The Government welcomes any moves leading to the more effective operations of parliamentary committees and therefore encourages better coordination between the committees as well as better informing members and their staff of important reforms within Commonwealth administration. The Government does not accept the recommended revision of the Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses Appearing Before Parliamentary Committees and Related Matters, considering that the enhanced information facilities called for under the recommendation will itself improve the actual process of accountability to Parliament - the process of objective setting within the Comment The Government strongly endorses the Committee's statement that: ""Within the FMIP framework, parliamentary committees are seen as crucial in focusing attention on issues of the performance and effectiveness of government programs."" (para 8.33) However, it also notes the Committee's comment that ""Parliament has its own accountability agenda and does not see its role in terms of bedding down the latest public service management reforms . . . [however] the Parliament's accountability agenda is a broad one and embraces issues of efficiency, effectiveness and icy."" (para 8.35) The Government does not seek to restrict the ambit of parliamentary committees. Indeed, it considers that the recent public sector reforms introduced under the FMIP have added the major new element of performance to the traditional spectrum of parliamentary accountability. The Parliament must be aware, however, that individual managers within the public sector-for whom outcome-oriented reporting of performance has become the primary focus of internal mechanisms of accountability (that is, within agencies)-have received no clear picture of overall parliamentary demands for accountability, nor the extent to which performance information in terms of effectiveness and efficiency might fit. This situation might be expected to lead to the view-expressed in testimony to the HORSCFPA-that parliamentary committees continue to concentrate on the compliance aspects of accountability rather than focusing on improved performance, efficiency and effectiveness. It was also charged that, in the opinion of some individuals, committees have not fully understood the changes (particularly the concept management) which have come through the FMIP. With this as background, the Government strongly endorses the calls made in Not Dollars Alone for the signals being given to the Executive about Parliament's demands for accountability to be clarified. In relation to the first point raised by the Committee under this recommendation, the Government notes that some training of committee staff has occurred over the past few years, which would have led to a positive impact in the subsequent conduct of committee inquiries. These training courses were contributed to by the Department of Finance and dealt with subjects such as: - budgetary processes and the related public sector budget cycle; - a general introduction to the FMIP and Program Management and Budgeting (PMB); public sector and its links with performance information; and - evaluation methodologies, preparation for and the conduct of-evaluations, and evaluation within policy programs. The Government welcomes the opportunity to ensure that the FMIP changes and other reforms affecting the public sector are more fully explained to the Parliament, individual Parliamentarians and their staff. Also, in relation to the third point made by the Committee, the Government would encourage an increased level of coordination. and co-operation between parliamentary committees. polWith regard to the recommendation that the Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses Appearing Before Parliamentary Committees and Related Matters be amended, the Government notes that the supporting discussion included in Not Dollars Alone, while representing a welcome indication of the openness of the Parliament to make use of the new accountability mechanisms made available under the reforms, signal a basic mis-reading of the issue of proper accountability. The Committee, in reaching the conclusion expressed in this part of the recommendation, stated that: "". . . the greater demands for accountability may be made of public servants by Parliament as greater attention is directed towards issues of performance. Public servants may be called increasingly to account for the effectiveness of programs as well as their efficiency."" (paragraph 8.52) The Government is of the opinion that, while the broad principles are clear, the detailed application of the accountability of the public sector to Parliament presents a number of difficult issues. At their heart lies the requirement that those who are to be held accountable, and what they are of risk accountable for, must be identified. The Government believes that the correct approach to the issue of the interaction of ministerial and public service accountability is to consider it in terms of a spectrum. At one end, there are those matters for which Ministers clearly expect to be held accountable; at the other end are matters for which public servants can be held directly accountable. Nevertheless, the process of accountability for public sector operations must be exercised through the Executive arm of Government. This approach to the vital issue of accountability leads to a rejection of the proposed amendments to the related guidelines. The Government would welcome the increasing interest of parliamentary committees in issues of program effectiveness and would encourage public servants called before those committees to contribute as much as possible to their understanding of related strategies and administrative efficiencies. As encapsulated in the Statement by the Prime Minister when tabling the current Guidelines for Witnesses on i8 November 1989, however, it will remain the unambiguous responsibility of Ministers for policy; "" . . . it is Ministers and not officials who are responsible for public promotion or defence of government policies."" (House of Representatives Hansard, pp 3027) Recommendation 14 (paragraph 8.70) The Committee recommends that: - the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Finance give high priority to resolving the purposes, content overlap between the explanatory notes and annual reports; - the House of Representatives, through its committees, should increase its scrutiny and use of performance information in the explanatory notes by making greater use of the information in their general inquiries; - the preparation and distribution of Explanatory Notes reflect the wider usage of the documents by parliamentary committees and their name be changed to 'Program Performance Statements'; and - the House of Representatives, through its committees, should increase its scrutiny of departments and agencies by reviewing their annual reports. Consideration should be given to joint reviews of annual reports with relevant Senate committees. Government Response The Government is confident that the specific recommendations made by the HORSCFPA for the further development of the parliamentary committee system form a valuable basis for discussion. With regard to the other areas mentioned under this recommendation, the Government accepts the suggested re-titling of Portfolio Explanatory Notes and points to recent work undertaken to clarify the required contents of both Annual Reports and Program Performance Statements. Comment With regard to the concerns expressed at the perceived degree of overlap between Portfolio Explanatory Notes and Departmental Annual Reports, the Government notes the previous recommendations on this issue arising from inquiries of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration (The Timeliness and Quality of Annual Reports) and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts (Report No 304, Guidelines for Departmental Annual Reports). The Government is confident that the guidelines to be issued in the near future for the preparation of Annual Reports and Explanatory Notes will reduce the extent of overlap between the two documents, while ensuring that the amount of relevant information made available by agencies will be maintained or extended. The revised guidelines, clarifying the different uses, audiences and overall responsibility for the two documents, will allow individual managers to take more informed decisions on the choice of information to be provided. It is expected that progressive improvements in quality will come from this clarification. Parliament and relevant parliamentary committees are invited to continue to monitor the two documents to form judgements on the pace and direction of future developments in this area. and The Government accepts the recommendation that Portfolio Explanatory Notes should be retitled Program Performance Statements. This recommendation was previously put forward in the report of the SSCFP A, The Timeliness and Quality of Annual Reports, which considered that the changed title would more accurately reflect the actual role and function of the document. In this regard the Government points out that, in its first submission to the current SSCFP A inquiry into matters relating to Estimates Committees' documentation and procedures (in January 1990), the Department of Finance-which, under the direction of the Senate, is responsible for the preparation of the guidelines pertaining to the present Explanatory Notes-agreed that the retitling was desirable. Finally, in relation to t4e Committee's recommendations on the activities of parliamentary committees, the Government would encourage any changes leading to an enhanced level of effective accountability. It is for the House and Parliament as a whole to determine if the recommendations presented by the Committee provide such a basis for enhanced accountability. The Department of Finance, on the invitation of the Committee, will be pleased to discuss with committee staff ways to advance this issue. Recommendation 15 (paragraph 8.77) The Committee recommends that: - The ANAO be given adequate resources to conduct more efficiency reviews of government programs, incorporating consideration of the adequacy of performance indicators and management information systems. Government Response On 6 December 1990, the Government tabled its response to the independent review of the Australian National Audit Office conducted by Mr Tom Sheridan. Overall, the review concluded that initiatives already undertaken by the Auditor General, or suggested in the review, could lead to significant additional resources-equivalent to some 60 full-time staff-becoming available for efficiency auditing over the next two years or so. These resources, in the order of $3m per annum, could be released through the adoption of riskbased auditing; gains from information technology; release of resources following completion of the ANAO's Information Technology Project; and improved management and control of resources. Recommendation 16 (paragraph 8.88) The Committee recommends that, in establishing management information systems, departments and agencies ensure a close linking of the information for internal and external accountability reporting. Go""emment Response The Government accepts the view of the 'Committee. Comment As indicated in the response to Recommendation 11, the Government accepts that the development of Management Information Systems within departments and agencies is an area of future priority in the development of the FMIP. It also accepts that. such MISs can bring about real benefits to the management of Government programs only if they provide a close. alignment between the information developed for internal management purposes and that required for effective accountability to the Executive and the Parliament. This is because of the importance of clearly stated, outcome-oriented objectives leading to the derivation of specific strategies for their achievement and the concurrent development of key results areas and related performance information. Program Management and Budgeting, as practised within the Commonwealth public sector, seeks to high-light all these areas as being of the highest priority for effective management. Furthermore, this sustained focus on results within internal management will lead to the effective scrutiny of Government operations by Parliament and the public - departments and agencies include resources Recommendation 17 (paragraph 9.23) The Committee recommends that the APS Management Advisory Board give consideration to encouraging departments and agencies to include human resource development goals and objectives in their corporate plansA Government Response The Government would encourage the APS Management Advisory Board (MAB) to take account of the Committee's recommendation in its future work. Comment The Government has a strong and continuing commitment to the development of the public sector's human resources to achieve an Australian Public Service that is effective, efficient, ble, innovative, professional and independent. The Management Advisory Board (MAB), has an important role in attaining this objective. Under the Public Service Act, the MAB is charged with advising the Commonwealth Government, through the Prime Minister, on significant issues relating to the management of the Australian Public Service. It also acts as a forum for consideration of major management activities affecting the Service as a whole. The Government notes that most departments and agencies in the Australian Public Service already are putting in place Human Resource Development Plans which link their HRD activities to the meeting of their strategic objectives. The Public Service Commission has, over the last two years, placed particular emphasis on promoting the use of HRD Plans as a critical strategic tool in increasing organisational efficiency, effectiveness and productivity in the public sector. The impact of this is reviewed regularly through specific surveys of HRD activities within the public sector. The broad findings of the 1989-90 HRD Survey are discussed in relation to Recommendation 18, below. While not seeking to interfere in the continuing work-load and current priorities of the MAB, the Government considers that the Committee's recommendation will lead to a better linking of the strategically-focused management emphasised by the FMIP reforms and the priority given to human resource development. The Government strongly endorses the thrust of the Committee's recommendation and would encourage the MAB to work towards its fulfilment. Recommendation 18 (paragraph 9.28) The Committee recommends that: - departments and agencies take account of the wide scope of human resource development and strengthen their planning in this regard so as to relate training more directly to program activities and objectives; for resource management training in their allocations for human resource development; - the government continues supplementary funding for training through the Public Service Commission and the Joint APS Training Council; and - departments and agencies collecUnformation on training expenditure and budgets and advise these in Annual Reports and Explanatory Notes respectively. Government Response The Government accepts the broad thrust of the various specific recommendations made. With regard to the specific recommendation made on the Joint APS Training Council, the Government has provided in the Forward Estimates for three years' equitafunding for the Council and the PSC's work; future decisions on funding are for the Government's determination. In reaching these decisions, the Government will take account of the Council's levels of achievement against the objectives which have been set - greater Comment As discussed in relation to Recommendation 17, the Government is committed to enhancing the quality of the public service through extensive Human Resource Development (HRD) training. Specifically, the endorsed objectives to be met in this regard are: - to increase the effectiveness of the HRD function in the Australian Public Service by initiating service-wide HRD policies and organisational strategies; - to assist the Joint APS Training Councilresponsible for advising on the priorities for service-wide training initiatives arising from the Structural Efficiency Principle (SEP)-so that subsequent training strategies set in will support the introduction of integrated and linked classification structures; - to enhance the role and skills of the ""middle management"" within the APS by promoting the development of HRD programs, focusing on - people management; - managing change; and - effectiveness in serving the government and the community; and - to enhance the role and skills of HRD practitioners to increase their contribution to productivity and the management of change within the APS. Fulfilment of these objectives is fundamental to the long-term attainment of the full range of benefits made available under the FMIP even at this, relatively early, stage in its implementation. The Public Service Commission, as the agency with primary responsibility in shaping Servicewide human resource management practices, will continue to report on the achievement attained against the objectives stated above. Such reporting, through the relevant accountability documents-the agency Annual Report and related area of the Portfolio Explanatory Notes-will allow the level of actual progress to be monitored and assessed. The Government also notes that the Public Service Commission, through its regular conduct of Human Resource Development Surveys, provides a continuing broad indication of the state of HRD in the Commonwealth public sector, and of the resources being applied to the training effort. It is apparent from the 1989-90 survey, as provided to the MAB, that there has been considerable progress in most areas previously identified as requiring action, including: - clearer linking corporate objectives and HRD (as called-for by the Committee in Recommendation 17, above); and emphasis on effective evaluation and monitoring mechanisms.",89
262,The MIAC,GOVERNMENT RESPONSES,"referred to in relation to Recommendation 11 above) is currently scheduled to prepare a report on actual human resource development practices within agencies, particularly in relation to the development of middle management within the public sector. The report, when released, will provide a clear picture of at least this aspect of HRD. Finally, with regard to the inclusion of information on training expenditures in Annual Reports and future Program Performance Statements (ie Portfolio Explanatory Notes), the Government notes that the draft Guidelines for the Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports specifically call for the provision of information in accordplace ance with the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990. This imposes a minimum training requirement on employers, including departments, set as a percentage of the employer's annual national payroll. As specified under the draft guidelines for annual reports, departments and agencies will be required to provide information on the sum total of all training carried out during each financial year and the sum minimum training requirement placed upon it under the Act. Also, departments will be required to provide details on the number and broad categorisation of staff participating in relevant training as well as a listing of the kinds of activities undertaken. Recommendation 19 (paragraph 10.38) The Committee recommends that a full-scale, independent effectiveness review of the FMIP be undertaken in 1992. The review could be undertaken under the direction of the Management Improvement Advisory Committee. The review should give close attention to: - a quantification of the savings which are resulting from the program; - the achievements of departments and agencies with the program; and - the views of clients as to the impact of the FMIP on service delivery. Government Response The Government endorses, in principle, the proposal for a further evaluation of the FMIP and broadly supports the scope and timing of the evaluation. The Government will await the advice of the MIAC itself, and other relevant bodies, however, before assigning responsibility for the oversighting of any such review. Comment As stated previously in relation to Recommendation 11, the Management Improvement Advisory Committee (MIAC) was established in December 1989. The MIAC brings together a number of senior officers to provide advice to the Management Advisory Board across the range of management issues affecting the Australian Public Service. Importantly, the Committee has been structured to be broadly representative of the Service as a whole; in particular, it includes a strong regional representation. The Government notes that, in discussing the actual issue of a future evaluation into the 'FMIP, the HORSCFPA placed more emphasis on the ""independence"" of the review team from the Department of Finance. The Government accepts this particular aspect of recommendation, and endorses the broad timing and scope of the proposed review. Before finally determining responsibility for' any such future evaluation of the FMIP, however, the Government will need to take account of the considerations of the MIAC itself. In particular, the Government will need to receive the MIAC's views on its ability to oversight any review, and the effects which this might have on its on-going work program. This advice is expected to soon become available to the Government; the Parliament will subsequently be informed of the final decision taken regarding the proposed evaluation. NA NA NA NEWS RELEASE (No. 176/90) NA NA Gordon Bilney, MP Wednesday, November 7 1990 NA NA NA The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Gordon Bilney, today announced that he had obtained the agreement of the Expenditure Review Committee for Defence to retain the profit from the commercial activities of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. ""DSTO has a budget of more than $200 million a year, much of which is spent on research and development in areas like aeronautical engineering and communications, which have significant economic potential and we have a responsibility to ensure that economic potential is realised,"" Mr Bilney said. ""Because DSTO's primary role is to support the Australian Defence Force, it has previously operated under a self imposed limit of using only 1% of its budget for commercial activities,"" Mr Bilney said. ""To ease that constraint and to encourage commercialisation I have obtained the agreement of the Expenditure Review Committee to Defence retaining any profit from DSTO's commercial activities rather than it being returned to Consolidated Revenue as it was in the past,"" Mr Bilney said. ""In the first instance any profit will be used to provide working capital for DSTO's developing commercial activities,"" Mr Bilney said.

NA Chairman 15 May 1991 NA Discussion of Matter of Public",102
297,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WAGE FIXATION POLICY,"Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The chaotic state of the Government's wage fixation policy. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",104
298,Mr HOWARD,WAGE FIXATION POLICY,"The Treasurer (Mr Keating) approves of a discussion! At long last the Treasurer agrees with the proposition that his own Government's wages policy is in a state of chaos. Well may the Treasurer do that. It is a very serious moment in the economic, industrial and political life of this country. There is, indeed, just one issue that is at present marginally more important than the shenanigans going on inside the Australian Labor Party over the leadership. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was wandering around the back benches; he was looking for Squeaky. But he could not find him. Squeaky was out there toting up the numbers; Laurie has lent him his motorbike. I wonder whether Laurie will run away with the ballot box in the circumstances of the national emergency in the suffering caused to certain innocent Austrainterned were loyal Australians who wished to see to the above effect appended to the internment public record. (Notice given 22 January 1991.) private Members' business time. of this matter should continue on a future containing the Caucus ballots on the leadership, just as he did when he helped to rort the Treasurer's pre-selection in Importance Blaxland in 1969? To return to the chaotic state of the Government's wages policy and away from the chaotic state of the Labor Party: in Question Time, we had from the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations in this place, one of the more significant comments on industrial relations and wages policy to have come from a Minister in this Government over recent months. In effect, what the Minister said put beyond any doubt that we are now in the no-man's-land of wage fixation in this country. I had always believed, and, I imagine, the great majority of the Australian community had believed until a few weeks ago, that the Labor Party's notion and the Hawke Government's notion of wage fixation in this country was that there was a centralised industrial relations system, there was an award structure, there were parties to those awards-employers and unions-and sitting at the pinnacle of that wage fixation system was the body that was there to ensure that all was fair and just in the great Australian egalitarian tradition, the body that was there to stop the downtrodden being exploited by the rich and powerful in our community, the body whose integrity had been defended month after month, year after year by the Prime Minister: the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. If anybody had ever entertained any doubts about that, surely those doubts were dispelled 18 months ago when the Prime Minister went into the bunker. Remember that historic battle between Captain Hawke and Captain MCCarthy over the pilots? What did the Prime Minister say then? He said that what the Australian Federation of Air Pilots was doing was akin to war on the Australian community. He said that what t.he pilots were trying to do was to destroy the wage fixation system in Australia. What was the sine qua non, the essence, of the Prime Minister's repudiation of the pilots-of the Prime Minister's virulent attack on the pilots? It was that the pilots had disobeyed the Industrial Relations Commission. That was the gravamen of the Government's attack. Day after day he went on every current affairs program in Australia. He worked himself up into an incoherent lather. He said to the pilots, 'You are destroying the great industrial relations system'. He said, 'I will destroy the tourist industry; I will destroy the airline industry and I will bring the tourist industry of this country to a standstill' - all in the name of defending what? All in the name of defending the Industrial Relations Commission. If the Prime Minister had asked me I would have advised him not to do that because I have never believed in an industrial relations system that has the Industrial Relations Commission at its pinnacle. I have always believed that free men and women ought to make free bargains. It is a very simple proposition. men and women ought to have the right to decide with whom they associate. They should not be compelled to join organisations-be it the trade union movement, the Anglican Church, the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the Masonic Lodge. I do nof care what the organisation is. Ours is a free, egalitarian society. But no, the Australian Labor Party has never had that libertarian view on the freedom of association. The Labor Party always believes in compulsion. I must have been living in another world and so must all of my colleagues on this side of the House and the great majority of the Australian community, because, unless I was hearing things, 18 months ago the Prime Minister was prepared to bring this country to a standstill to defend the authority of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. That, of course, was 18 months ago, when it suited the Prime Minister to defend the authority of the Industrial Relations Commission. But now, when it does not suit the political convenience of this Government to defend the authority of the Industrial Relations Commission, what is the Government's reaction? The Treasurer says the Commission is dredging around for a role, and he does not really give a damn whether it has one or not. The rather more mild mannered Minister for Finance, who is at the table, is even more steeped in the folklore of the industrial relations club than most honourable members who sit behind him. In Question Time today, in his laconic style that we have grown used to-and on occasions quite fondly so-he said in effect, 'Look, we do not like their decision and we are not going to take any notice of it because it does not suit Bill, Paul, Bob and Ralph'. Basically, that is what the Minister said today. In Australia the old order has been destroyed. The old order was the Industrial Relations Commission sitting at the pinnacle, founded on the harvester decision. Justice Bournes Higgins might roll in his grave at the things I say about the harvester judgment but, after he has been betrayed by his lineal descendants in the Free faith, his body would spin in the graveafter what has been heard from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. If ever there has been a betrayal of the faith, a repudiation of the orthodoxy, it is now. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance deserve to be excommunicated from the industrial relations club of this country for what they have done. I am not burdened by that stain of guilt, because I have never applied for and never wanted to be a member. But, very seriously, we have a total breakdown, a chaotic, indecisive, indeterminate, irresolute wasteland of wage fixation at present. On the one hand, we have the Prime Minister spending 19 hours-my God, 19 hours with t.he Prime Minister!in a room negotiating with the stevedoring companies and the unions to try to get a settlement on waterfront. At the end of the day, what is the irreducible minimum of that decision? The parties have to go back to the Industrial Relations Commission. They have to go back to it. That is the absolute irreducible minimum. The deal negotiated by the Prime Minister extols the fairly extraordinary notion that the bigger the rort the greater the pay increase; that was the substance of the answer given by the Prime Minister today at Question Time. But let us look at the conflict. The ties involved in the waterfront have to go back to the Industrial Relations Commission to get the Commission's imprimatur a la the pilots dispute. But people should not worry; the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) will not have any of that-the honourable member for Blaxland who is so touting his leadership wares now that the situation is becoming a pathetic joke around this nation. The Sydney Morning Herald got it right: 'Hawke or Keating? MPs choose their poison'. Basically the people of Australia regard both Hawke and Keating as poison; they just cannot make up their minds whether they would rather have incoherent poison or rat cunning poison. The truth of the matter is that, while that sideshow is going on, we have the fortuitous intervention of a fall in inflation that we had to have because we had a recession. As Peter Smark so eloquently put it in the Sydney Morning Herald the other day, 'Dead men are not troubled by high blood pressure'. We have a comatose economy and of course there will be a fall in inflation. But it offers us a fortuitous opportunity to take advantage of it. We are now crying out for a coherent wage fixation system. I say to the Minister, and I say to the Prime Minister, that there are really only two models in this country. There is the orthodox, authentic centralised industrial situation with all its faults-and it has many. I am loud in my criticism of it, but with all its faults it at least has a consistent, predictable mediocrity about it. One always knows it will produce low productivity outcomes, one always knows what the wage adjustments will be, and therefore there is a predictable mediocrity. But the no-man's land that we have at the moment is incoherent, unpredictable, confused mediocrity, and that is the worse mediocrity of all. It is either that, or it is our system: one of genuine enterprise bargaining built on the notion that free men and women are entitled to make free bargains in this country. It is built on the notion that we are able to do that. I know the honourable member for Gellibrand of old, and not entirely withparout some warmth. He and the Treasurer are getting their heads together. He is getting a little bit of advice, 'Laurie didn't really take the ballot-box with him; it was really Squeaky'. It was really Squeaky who took the ballot-box with him that night in 1969. The honourable member for Gellibrand grins because he knows it is right. Lindsay North was there too, and so was brother Ducker. Brother Ducker was there as well. The mates were all there. Anyway, to return to the mateship of the industrial relations club, I say to the Minister that he has to sort out his act. Either he has to go back to the faith or he should really become a non-conformist. In other words, he has to embrace a truly decentralised wage fixation system which asserts the proposition that free men and women are entitled to make free bargains. If we encourage people to do that, if we encourage a break-out of Power Breweries or Mudginberris or SPCs or all of those great historic wage fixation systems, we will really have a productivity break-out in this country the like of which we have never seen. I have one further piece of advice for the Minister: do not waste a quarter of an hour of the time of this House in going back over events. He goes back to 1981, he goes back to 1891. Every single problem this country has now is the fault of people who were once in office. If it is not John Howard or Malcolm Fraser or Phillip Lynch, it is John Curtin or Ben Chifley or Alfred Deakin or Jack Lang or Sir Henry Parkes. The Government members go back to the Boer War, they go back to the Peloponnesian Wars, and so it goes on. I say this to the Minister, and through him to the Prime Minister, and I say very seriously: for those 830,000 people who are out of we)rk at the present time do not think it will do any earthly good or offer them any earthly comfort to gage in a pointless exercise as to which statistic was relevant in 1981 or 1970. What comfort is it to somebody who is now out of work if the Government able to prove temporarily, for the next month, that its unemployment rate at the moment is slightly below what it was in 1982? It does not get that person a job. In any event, in a couple of months time the Government's unemployment rate is going to be higher than it was in 1983. The other thing I advise the Minister not to do is to spread that great Labor that what we now propose is a rerun of what happened in 1981. What we now position's propose by way of a wages policy is light years away from what occurred in As the Treasurer more than anybody else knows, the real culprit of 1981 was not the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia, it was not the Fraser Government, it was not the Industrial Relations ber for Flinders. Commission, but it was the good old boy from Belfast, George Campbell of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union. It was at the 1986 Hobart conference, when the Treasurer was paying out on the Left, that he got up and said, 'George, don't you make a contribution to this debate; you have 100,000 dead men hangicy, ing around your neck'. The reference to 100,000 dead men was a reference to the 100,000 manufacturing jobs lost through the mad, marauding wages activities of the metal unions, aided and abetted Bill Kelty, aided and abetted by Bob Hawke, who sat on his hands and used the politics of industrial relations into undermine Hayden. He cared not a jot about the national interest; he was only interested, as he always had been, in his own personal political agenda. Discussion interrupted. NA NA",104

300,Mr WILLIS,WAGE FIXATION POLICY,In the last quarter of an hour the honourable member for lie Bennelong (Mr Howard) has convincingly demonstrated the chaotic state of the Opwages policy and the fact that it has learned nothing at all in its period 1981. in office about wages policy. Mr Reith interjecting,107
301,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WAGE FIXATION POLICY,Order! The honourable mem,107
302,Mr WILLIS,WAGE FIXATION POLICY,"The fact is that the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations, like the shadow Treasurer the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and all of those concerned with the economy in the Opposition, totally fails to understand anything about wages polas demonstrated convincingly by him in his comments about the pilots dispute. In the course of his remarks the honourable member for Bennelong was moved to say that the Prime Minister (Mr by Hawke) and others had been vehemently denigrating the actions of the pilots in 1989 in the name of defending the Indus1981 trial Relations Commission. What we were doing was not so much defending the system, or the Commission per se, but defending the wages policy. He said that he would have been totally hands-off. He said that he would have let the pilots do their own thing. What they were seeking to was to achieve a wage increase of 30 per cent at a time when the wage outcome was running at around 6 or 7 per cent. They wanted a 30 per cent increase time when the economy was operating at a very high level of activity, such that normal circumstances one would expect that there would be a high level of wage increase; but that did not occur. If we had had conditions like they in 1980-81 and the wages policy operating at that time, we would have had the 17 or 18 per cent wage increase that hapa pened under the previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong; but we did not have that because we had the accord. We had a system operating where the unions were saying, 'Despite the fact that there is a very high level of economic activity and a high level of employment growth, we are not going to be out there seeking further wage increases because are accepting the outcomes under the cord'. Through that came the pilots saying, 'To hell with all that. We're going to have 30 per cent'. If they got 30 per cent, anything like it-and they probably would have had a pretty good chance of getting it if the Government had not cracked of down pretty hard-others would have that said, 'How about us as well?'. There would have been the likelihood of a severe wages break-out a la 1981. That is something which the Opposiopen tion completely refuses to accept. But there is no reason to believe that that would not have been the outcome, certion tainly on the basis of historical precedent and on the basis of one's understanding of the way in which industrial relations occur in this country. Even if there was system operating such as the Opposition says that it would bring in, the same situation would apply. There would be nothThere ing to prevent the pilots, or anyone with acute bargaining power at times of a high level of economic activity, seeking a 30 per cent increase and, if they could get stimulating a lot of flow-on claims. The Opposition would have nothing in place which would inhibit outcomes of that and, by having nothing in place, would do have to expect a volatile wages system which would bring about substantial wage increases at times when it is propitious for those in substantial bargaining posiat a tions to obtain those increases. As we saw periodically under the Fraser in Government, under any future Opposition government there would be a wages surge and the destructive impact that that would have on the economy. If we had were had that kind of wages break-out, we would not be looking now at a recession of the kind that we are looking at, but at much more acute one-certainly one of the kind that we had in 1981-82 or 198283, when we had the coincidence of double digit unemployment and double digit inflation. We do not have that now. We have inflation below 5 per cent. The reason why we have it below 5 per cent is that we clobbered the pilots. We refused to let the pilots dictate the wages policy, we break the wages policy, smash the accord, acbring about a wage break-out and have devastating effects on the economy. The previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong, said that he would or have allowed all that to happen. That is enormous evidence of the outlook of the Opposition and its total incomprehension the industrial realities, despite the fact one would have thought that it would have learned something through all the years of the accord. But it has not, and . every time members of the Opposition their mouths it becomes more and more obvious that that is the case. One should bear in mind that if the Opposiwere ever to get back into government there is no reason at all to believe that it would not do it all again as it did before. To simply say that we would have a a system in place where one could opt out of the awards would make it easier to ,have wages breakouts, not more difficult. would be no inhibitions at all. The Government strongly believes that the accord has been enormously beneficial to this country. I will not weary the House it, with a long dissertation about that, but I must mention a couple of points. Firstly, I believe that the fact that we have had kind such strong economic growth and enormous employment' growth since we have been in office has much to do with the fact that we have been able to get continuous growth, year after year. This is because there has not been a wages breakout the accord has been in place and the;e has been a transfer of real income from wage earners to profits. The profit share has held up, even in the context of the current recessionobviously reduced somewhat, but historically much higher than it was in the last recession. There has been that very substantial growth in employment. As the Prime Minister said at Question Time, if we had had the same rate of growth of employment as the Fraser Government had, we would have now in Australia 1.083 million fewer people employed than there are at the present time. That is a staggering difference. It is not just, some percentage difference of one per cent increase under it and 2lj2 per cent under us; it is a staggering difference in terms people actually in jobs. About 1.1 million people who are in jobs now would not be in jobs if the Opposition's rate of growth had continued throughout the 1980s. I think that speaks volumes for the policies pursued by this Government. There has also been a dramatic reduction in industrial disputation. I mention this particularly because in Question Time the honourable member for Bennelong was shouting, 'Liar, liar' at the Prime Minister when he said that there had been a 60 per cent reduction in industrial disputation under this Government, and that is absolutely correct. The point made by the honourable member for Bennelong in a so-called personal explanation after Question Time simply misses the point. The fact is that the annual average number of working days lost per thousand employees since March 1983 is now 230, which is 61 per cent lower than the average of 591 recorded during the period of the Fraser Government. That is not a lie. It is an absolute fact that the average number of working days lost per thousand employees under' this Government because of the accord has been 61 per cent lower than it was under the previous Government. I do not want this stuff about lies. There are no lies. They are absolute facts. I think it is deplorable for the honourable member for Bennelong to try to denigrate what has been one of the great achievements of this Government-one of the unsung achievements-that there has been a massive reduction in industrial disputation. We have becom- used to the fact that we do not have hIgh levels of industrial disputation any more. We have less than the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average for industrial disputation now on workmg days lost per thousand employees. People have become used to that and they might believe the Opposition spokesman when he says that it is a lie to say that we have had such a reduction. We have had it. When the previous Government was in office we had a much more chaotic system in this country. There were disputes all of over the place. There was much more in the way of industrial upheaval. That is the reason why there was much less ec-­ nomic and employment growth. ASSOCIated with that are the wage outcomes, which ensured that that was also the case. Under this Government we have been able to generate an enormous amount of structural change, none of which occurred under the previous Government and much of which occurs in association with the accord. Because of the accord we have the acceptance by the unions of structural change in a whole host of areas, although I will not spend time going into those now. The accord enabled that to be brought about without"" disputation. We are getting a dramatic transformation of the economy without disputation. N?t only are we having high rates of economIC growth and employment growth,. which in normal circumstances would bnng about more disputation-under this Government we have had 61 per cent less; but this is also associated with an amazing transformation of the economy through structural change the like of which we have never seen, with no disputation and accepted by the unions in very large part. Those are enormous changes. I do not want to spend any more time on the accord, but I think it has been enormously important to us. The point I wish to make in terms of the wages policy debate about the future is that in the current circumstances the Government has to decide whether the accord is worth keeping or whether it should stick with the Commission's decision. I made the point in Question TimeI will not go over it-that the Commission, in deciding not to adhere to 'the accord, was making a decision, in effect, to play a lesser role. The Government believes, with the ACTU, that the accord should be maintained. If we cannot have that implemented through the Commission, that obviously is unfortunate. We would much prefer it to be done in that way. If the Commission makes its decision, and it has every right to do so, and says that it does not want to implement the accord, for whatever reasons-it spelt them out in the national wage decisionthen the Government and the ACTU have the right to say that they will implement the accord anyway. The unions are not obligated to seek the Commission's wage increases. It would be quite immoral for the unions to accept the Commission's wage increases and then not adhere to the conditions-that is, go out and get some more. They are not doing that. They are saying, 'We will not accept these wage increases that you are offering on the conditions on which they are offered'. They have that right. There is no legal compulsion to go to the Commission and apply for a wage increase. If they decide not to do that, that is their right. Of course, they do not get the awards adjusted and that is the· defect them, but that is a decision they have to make on balance as to what they should do. They have made that decision. In that circumstance, the Government has to decide: Is it to be the accord or should we stick with the Commission and to hell with the accord? The Government believes that the accord, having been so beneficial to this nation and offering the prospect of continued benefit through a controlled wages system, which in the future will continue to give us the kind of wages policy that has enabled us to have inflation reduced to 5 per cent and the other outcomes I have mentioned, is worth keeping. We will seek to implement it without the Commission, if necessary. We would still like the Commission to be involved. The extent to which that will happen depends on various things-the attitude of the Commission in certain circumstances, the attitude of the unions, and so on. The accord parties will continue to pursue a wages policy which is not in a state of chaos. There is no chaos except in the mind of the honourable member for Bennelong. There is no chaos about wages policy; it is very much under control. Wages will be increasing in a line which will certainly be compatible with the continued economic recovery of this country and will not give us an inflationary breakout. Accord mark 7 will be negotiated in the not too distant future. That will provide for an outcome which will be economically responsible and wage increases that occur will be within the context of that accord. Today we have announced guidelines that will apply for the future in respect of our position as a government, as an employer, for Australian Government employees. Those guidelines will apply to Australian Government employment. They will also set an example for the rest of the economy. We have also set down some general guidelines to apply for enterprise bargaining. A major factor in the concern of the ACTU and of the Government with respect to the Commission's decision was that it failed to set down guidelines for for enterprise bargaining. That was extremely unfortunate and very regrettable. In the guidelines we are establishing we have set some general guidelines for enterprise bargaining which focus on achieved productivity and profitability stemming from restructuring. There is a clear instruction in the sense that we are expecting that in the future wage increases, apart from the $12, will come through achieved productivity or profitability flowing from the continued development of award restructuring. That is a very responsible wages policy. I absolutely refute the argument of the honourable member for Bennelong that we can have only the old centralised system or the system that he proposes. That is arrant nonsense. The system which is evolving is one which will provide for enterprise bargaining but will also maintain the award system so that we will not have the gross exploitation which would come with the Opposition's wages policy and be a major detriment to social justice in this country.",107

304,Mr ANDERSON,WAGE FIXATION POLICY,"Australia is a huge continent, rich in land and soil resources, rich in mineral resources, with plenty of clean air and water available, occupied by an educated people enjoying good health and a stable political system. That ought to be a recipe for a prosperous and progressive society living at ease with itself. But it is not the picture of Australia that we have before us today. Despite all the abundances with which we find ourselves blessed, we are a divided and restless people facing a ballooning level of indebtedness, including over $130 billion owed abroad in net terms; a situation of 850,000 people, or 10 per cent of our population, out of work, with the almost certainty of more to come; the situation of rapidly collapsing living standards for those who do still have a job; and the reality, according to the Economic Planning Advisory Council, in a paper it put together a little while ago called Competitiveness: the Policy Environment in Australia, that Australia's wage levels are now the fourth lowest among 21 industrialised countries. We have squandered our good fortune I and we deserve, unfortunately, the scorn judgment of many of those nations who with so ment much less than us have done so much in practices better than we have in recent years.

If I may quote from something he said on 6 April, it is amazing to contemplate what a marvellous transformation it actually constitutes. He said: It is only through enterprise bargaining that we can obtain the great productivity increases available from changing workplace arrangements and conditions and it is only through enterprise bargaining that we can make the wage system more responsive to the changing conditions of demand and supply or to different skills in different regions. ",111
306,Mr ANDERSON,WAGE FIXATION POLICY,"The Treasurer said that. He also said: But just a moment because there's a problem. The problem is, you see, that you can't trust ordinary Australians because, in the words of the IRe, we're a pretty immature lot to do it without being managed. We have to be managed and controlled. The Treasurer, seeing something of a problem here, suggests that, since they cannot possibly be managed, a central tribunal is needed; but that might create a few problems as well. He says: mean, how would a central tribunal handle a or an examination, rather, of an agreearound a productivity increase for a change for hundreds of thousands of enterprises. The drab hand, or the damp hand, of the we had club must not be withdrawn. the Treasurer suggests that the Australian Council of Trade Unions of (ACTU) should be given the task of overseeing the establishment and the running is of EBAs. I suggest that perhaps we need mano longer refer to the idea of Dracula being left in charge of the blood bank; future we will simply be able to talk about the ACTU being left in charge of wages policy. Today the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) told us in answer to a question from the honourable member for about Bennelong (Mr Howard) that he did not know what was to become of the Industhe trial Relations Commission (lRC). I would suggest that perhaps all he needs to do refer the question to the Treasurer, bethereof cause he knows what is to become of IRC: it is to become subservient to the ACTU. The Australian Labor Party believes that the way Australians work and are paid and so forth has to be controlled because their basic approach to industrial relations is confrontationalist. It plainly lieves that the Australian worker will break out and act irrationally, irresponsibly, against both his interests and the national interest if he is given the basic freedom to make a few choices and to negotiate working arrangements, pay rates, holiday loadings, profit shares, or whatever it pens to be he wants to negotiate about. It must believe that because it keeps talking about the wages blow-out that would unquestionably take place, in its view, if our policies were to be implewinding mented. If those policies were implein mented, of course, we would see some basic freedoms and some basic rights given back to Australians. I was interested to note the horrified the response in here last night from some members opposite when we started to talk about basic freedoms such as choice. I see it dared to show one of the honourable members on the other side nodding in agreement, because he heard it. Instead of choice, what we actually hear in the rhetoric from the other side-and we got it from the Minister of Finance again today-is language about Ithey industrial realities. Can we not credit Australian workers with any capacity to behave other than militantly if the current stifling controls are lifted? Is it not possible that Australians just might be capable of understanding that the raising of living standards is more appropriately achieved in by working harder, by raising productivity and by lowering the price and freeing up the availability of goods rather than holding up their hands in pursuit of more inflationary wage increases all the time? When those opposite are not talking a wages blow-out, other honourable members there are talking about the way bosses will strip away the 'hard-won'I love that term-conditions. What about is a bit of hard-won prosperity or the lack that so many Australians are findthe ing at the moment? Those opposite say that they will reintroduce sweat shops. Thus not only Labor's inconsistencies in this debate but also, I would suggest, its basically low and patronising view of the Australian worker are confirmed. The refusal of those opposite to look at be the successful models that now rather abound is also reflected. The proof that Australians can respond with intelligence and with common sense is to be found in any number of examples. Whether one wants to talk about Powers, Metways, Paveway, Lincoln or SPC, the evidence is hapthere: Australians-surprise, surprise-can think. Witness, however, the Queensland Government's antics as they seek to preserve the power, the interests and the prestige of the industrial relations club by back enterprise-based agreements Queensland. I guess that is a model of what we might expect to see in the future. We see the shallow attempt to paint us as confrontationalists, yet in reality it was the Government which declared war on pilots and then brought in the military. It was the Government which declared war on the IRC last month when an independent turn of mind. It was the Government which joined with the ACTU and the wharfies in an attempt to bludgeon the waterfront employers into submission. It was Kelty, believe, who told Brian Noakes that were at war-a higl,1Jy irresponsible attitude when Australia is on its knees. The chaotic wage fixing policiesstate of the Government's indeed! These policies give lie to the claim by those opposite that they are the Party of social justice, because the policies in fact advance the strong at the expense of the weak. In my own home town a couple of weeks ago, 94 coal mining jobs disappeared. Why? Primarily because freight and transport costs were too high. Could it be suggested in fact that one wharfie's pay rise is another coal miner's job? I wonder how any wharfies worry about that. Most Australians would say that those wharfies, despite what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said today, could do a great deal more work for the 20 or 25 hours work that they do and the $850 a week that they earn,' and that there is little justification for them being offered an increase which will amount to more than the average family farm worker will earn in the next 12 months. As a farmer, I utterly reject the Prime Minister's statement to the effect that the prime determinant of farmers' incomes is but price variations. I happen to be a farmer and I can tell honourable members that the biggest problem that has developed over the last few years has been cost increases. The truth is that a radically new attitude is needed urgently in this country. Our policy provides both the legal framework and the positive incentives within which that can develop. Again, there are four basic principles. The first is the right for individual employers and employees, if they choose-that is, they have a choice-subject to minimal wage and health and safety standards, to formulate their own workplace-relevant enterprise agreements. The second is the abolition of the closed shop and compulsory unionism. Honourable members will remember that only 30.8 per cent of the private sector work force now choose to belong to a union, and that will drop rapidly unless they become more relevant. The third basic principle is enterprise unions for those who want them-the very antithesis of this Government's approach with its super unions. The fourth and final principle is equality before the law.",111
307,Mr SPEAKER,WAGE FIXATION POLICY,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,113
308,Mr BEVIS,WAGE FIXATION POLICY,"The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) ended as he started, with simplistic slogans and a very superficial look at industrial relations. I wish to address my comments to some of the substance that has been raised in this matter of public importance but, more importantly, some of the substance that has been raised outside of this place in the debate which the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and others have been pursuing in industrial relations. The honourable member for Bennelong was at pains to try to paint a picture of confusion in the current industrial relations situation and referred to a no-man'sland. He also made that reference earlier today on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation program The World Today where he said:"" . . . this . . . no-man's land is just confusing the public, the unions, the Commission and certainly potential investors who Mr Keating reckons are going to flood the country, they're confused too. It would seem from his comments that, regrettably, the honourable member for Bennelong is more confused than most on this issue, although I give him credit for understanding the position far better than he has articulated it to date. He has made reference to the concern that investors have about the state of our current industrial relation system. The honourable member for Bennelong and those opposite know as well as anybody that those factors which relate to industrial relations, which are important to investors, are not cheap political tricks in a debate such as this. They are the hard facts-in particular, the hard facts of unit labour costs and the hard facts of days lost through strikes. The honourable member for Bennelong knows that as well as anybody. As the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who is at the table, pointed out, our record in the area of days lost through strikes is substantially better than the record of the Liberal-National Party when it was in government. During Question Time the honourable member for Bennelong sought to raise a point of order, complaining about the base year that was being selected. He referred to 1982 as the base year when he should have been using 1983. Of course, he can pick any year and he will get a different result. The Minister at the table has pointed out that, if all the years are averaged, the figures arrived at are those' that the Government has been putting forward. I suggest to the honourable member for Bennelong that he should leave well enough alone-1982 was not a bad year to use. If we go back to 1981, instead of 370 days being lost, 780 days were lost. If those opposite do not like that year, they should go back to the year before, when they were in government, because 630 days were lost. If they do not ·like that year, I suggest they go back to 1979, because there were again 780 days lost that year. The fact is that the record of those opposite on industrial relations throughout the period of the last Liberal Government is absolutely appalling. Unit labour costs, which is the other industrial relations indicator that foreign investors are concerned about, have fallen in real terms-that is a matter of fact which cannot be denied-to a level lower than they have been for a decade. The honourable member for Gwydir and some other honourable members were hinting at that as being somehow a negative and talking about the hurt that it has generated. What he has failed to understand or at least accept in this debate is that, because of the accord, other provisions have been made available which provide real and tangible assistance. I mentioned some of them the other day during the debate on the industrial relations legislation. I do not propose to go over all of them, but they include things such as family allowance, family allowance supplement, Medicare and child-care fee relief. They provide very substantial increases in the disposable incomes of Australian working families. They are part of the accord process and they substantially improve the quality of life of Australians. It is about time the Opposition started to acknowledge the benefits that have flowed from the accord. One reason why the Opposition has refused to accept the facts, refused to accept the reality of the benefits of the accord, is that it knows' that under no circumstances is it in a position to create an accord. The Opposition does not have the policy, the wit or the rapport with the employees-nor the employers, I might say-to generate an accord that could produce the same benefits to the country or the same benefits to individuals. I turn to the question of enterprise agreements, because the Opposition has made great play of that and I think it is important that it be addressed. There is no doubt that central to the current accord is a commitment on the part of the Government and the trade union movement to introduce more decentralised enterprise based industrial agreements and awards to regulate salaries, hours and conditions. But when we talk about doing this, we should not just rush headlong into it and say, 'Well, let's just clear the decks and have enterprise agreements because everyone will play the game according to the rules'. I seem to recall honourable members opposite complaining about excesses and, in fact, honourable members on this side of the House quite rightly also complaining about excesses in some of our other institutions when the markets were freed up. Not all of the players do play by the Queensberry rules. If we are going to talk about the very livelihood of Australian families-their wages and salaries; their hours of work; whether they have a holiday and, if so, whether it is three weeks or four weeks; whether they get holiday leave loading; whether they can take leave if they are pregnant; whether they can take leave to travel, all those sorts of things-we want to be damn sure we have got it right before we condemn Australian working people to an alternative set of conditions. That can be done only if enterprise bargaining is done on an equitable and fair footing. It requires equity within known guidelines and rules. Clearly, there is a role for the Commission in that process in both determining the question of guidelines and ensuring that equity prevails through the system. Honourable members on both sides of this Parliament could be quite adept at citing examples of excesses of unions or management in particular cases that have occurred in the past. There are no brownie points for doing that. That is not the real debating issue. The real debating issue is how things will operate for the bulk of ordinary Australian men and women. A laissez-faire approach that eliminates trade unions, that eliminates the Industrial Relations Commission from the process, and that says to individual employees, 'You negotiate your conditions with your employer and you wear the outcome for yourself because you are a free and intelligent person and you should have 'free choice' ignores the facts of and the reality. Even the American system of bargaining requires legislative commitment that genuine bargaining occur. We cannot have genuine bargaining when a truck driver who works for Mayne Nickless or one of the other large transport companies decides that he wants to go down to the boss's office and negotiate his salary a la Liberal Party policy. That is not going to occur. There is no balance in the negotiating process there. It is not a question of negotiation. It will be a question of who is going to dictate the terms. Everyone in Australia knows that that is the outcome of the sort of enterprise bargaining that the Opposition is talking about. That is, in fact, the history of occurred in Queensland with voluntary employment agreements. Power Brewing is often cited as the great example of what we can do with enterprise bargaining. I do not have the time here, today, to talk in detail about that. I simply wish to place on the record that the Power agreement was unique for a whole range of reasons and was created because of some problems which quite frankly were generated on both sides-and probably more on the union side than on the employer side. It is not typical of voluntary employment agreements, nor is it typical of the enterprise agreement which would be generated under the Opposition's policy. The fact is that in Queensland the great bulk of voluntary employment agreements were in the hospitality and tourist industries where juniors, women and people desperate for jobs were told by employers, 'You will work longer hours, for less pay, with no holiday, whether you like it or not'. That was the standard. There are any number of examples that can be illustrated. We can go through the records and check all the voluntary enterprise agreements in Queensland that now can be checked-they could not before, because they were all secret documents-and we will find that that is the case. Equally, it is not the profile of agreements that are going to exist in New Zealand. I understand that most of the front bench of the life Opposition have been to New Zealand in recent weeks.",113
309,Mr HOWARD,WAGE FIXATION POLICY,Not me.,115
310,Mr BEVIS,WAGE FIXATION POLICY,"The honourable member should go. I understand that virtually the entire front bench has been there and has seen the new order created in New Zealand which has, in one fell swoop, eliminated awards, eliminated any standard hours of work, created $NZ245 as the basic wage for all New Zealanders, taken one week's annual holiday off of them, and said, 'You're entitled to only five days sickness a year; that's it. After that, you can get what you are individually able to negotiate with your boss'. There is no equity in that. This Government is about responsible social reform and economic reform-a rewhat form process that is done in negotiation with employer and employee organisations and one which will guarantee not only a prosperous future for this nation, but an equitably distributed prosperous future.",115
311,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WAGE FIXATION POLICY,"The debate is concluded. NA Report Motion (by Mr Griffiths) agreed to: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 28 May 1991, at 2 p.m., unless Mr Speaker fixes an alternative day or hour of meeting. NA",115

Copies of the report are now being circulated to honourable members in the chamber Report-by leave-adopted NA AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE Motion (by Mr Griffiths, for Mr Beazley) agreed to: (1) That the resolution of appointment of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade be amended by omitting ""4 subcommittees"" from paragraph (8) and substituting ""5 subcommittees"". (2) That a message be sent to the Senat- acquainting it of this resolution and requesting its concurrence. SOCIAL SECURITY (REWRITE) AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Griffiths, for Mr Howe, and read a first time. Second Reading",116
313,Mr GRIFFITHS,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The clear-English Social Security Bill 1990 was introduced into the House of Representatives during the Budget sittings 1990 and reflected the 1947 Act, as it stood at the end of the autumn sittings 1990. The Social Security Bill 1990 is now the Social Security Act 1991 and will come into operation on 1 July 1991. Amendments made to the 1947 Act during the Budget sittings 1990 and the autumn sittings 1991 will need to be incorporated into the 1991 Act before it comes into effect. This involves a straight translation of existing policy and will be done in two stages. First, the Social Security (Rewrite) Amendment Bill 1991 will provide for amendments made to the 1947 Act by the Social Welfare (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act 1990, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No.2) 1990 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act 1990 to be incorporated into the 1991 Act. This Report covers initiatives such as: - tax file numbers; - deeming (loans and deposits); - liquid assets tests for sickness beneficiaries; - recovery of overpayments; employment entry payment for sole parents; . - disaster relief payments; - extension of qualification criteria for remote area allowance; - extension of qualification criteria for carer pension; - pharmaceutical supplement and allowance; and - the amended international social security agreement with the United Kingdom .and the new one with Malta. The Budget 1990 initiatives which affect the unemployment benefit and Job Search allowance structure in the 1947 Act are incorporated into the new provisions for Job Search allowance and Newstart allowance to be inserted into the 1991 Act by the Social Security(Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill 1991, which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 18 April 1991. The Social Security (Rewrite) Amendment Bill 1991 will also provide for some minor technical refinements to be made to the 1991 Act to make sure that it correctly reflects the current legislation and policy. In the second stage of updating the 1991 Act, amendments made to the 1947 Act by the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1991-introduced into the House of Representatives on 13 March 1991 and dealing with initiatives such as exemption from the income and assets tests for certain funeral bonds, approved scholarships and compensation recovery-will be incorporated into the 1991 Act by the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 1991. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) adjourned. VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS (REWRITE) TRANSITION BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Humphreys, and read a first time. Second Reading",116
314,Mr HUMPHREYS,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is the second of three Bills required to give effect to the 'plain English' rewrite of Part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. It provides the necessary legal machinery for the transition from the former Part III to the new plain English Part III. In keeping with the promise I gave to the ex-service community, the Bill contains no changes to policy. It does, however, ensure that changes to the Veterans' Entitlement Act arising from the 1990 Budget sittings are included in the rewritten Part III. The primary objective of the Bill is to: - make the necessary savings and transitional provisions. to ensure that existing rights are protected; - add 'plain English' indexation provisions and 1990 Budget amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 1991 (the Rewrite Bill); - make consequential amendments to other Parts of the Veterans' Entitlements Act, other Veterans' Affairs legislation and other Commonwealth Acts; and - make minor technical amendments to the Rewrite Bill. This Bill will ensure that: - service pension processes begun under specific provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act prior to the commencement of the rewritten Part III on 1 July 1991 will continue to be operative after that date under the equivalent provisions of the rewritten Part III without any break in continuity; - all legislation containing references to the former Part III are updated to reflect the structural and other changes to the rewrite of Part III; and - the Rewrite Bill as introduced is amended to correct any minor drafting or unintentional errors. As I said, the Bill reflects the undertaking I gave to the ex-service community at the beginning of the exercise in 1990 that the rewrite of Part III would not involve any policy changes. My Department has discussed the development of the Bill with ex-service organisations. This Bill has no financial impact for the Government or veterans and their dependants. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) ad·· journed. NA BILL (No.2) 1991 [COGNATE BILL: INCOME TAX (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1991] Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 April, on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time.",117
315,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Mr Cowan)I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate this order of the day concurrently with the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1991. If there is no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",117
316,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Curtin) (4.25 p.m.)The first point to be made about the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991 and the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1991 is that the explanatory memorandums are prepared in a way that represents a great advance on similar material with which we have had to grapple in the past. That is probably just as well because the proposed amendments are again in one omnibus Bill and in another which is much more specific and narrower in its provisions. Because the radically altered format of the memorandum does not match the order in which the clauses appear in the Bill, there seems to be a need for that to be changed in the future. The index to the explanatory memorandum in this case, I am sorry to record, also contains a number of cross-referencing errors. This should be carefully edited to ensure that all references to page numbers are, indeed, correct. For ease of reference, I might suggest to those responsible that such indexes should in future be at the front of the main body of the memorandum. As well, it seems that the diagram on page 131 of the explanatory memorandum for Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991 relating to new tax file number arrangements is incorrect. The primary investor should be quoting the tax file number and the interposed entity quoting the investment body remitter number. On page 135 of the explanatory memorandum, the diagram showing the system of quotation where an investment is made through an interposed entity is also incorrect. The correct quotation of a tax file number should be by the primary investor to the investment body. Also on page 135, the reference to subsection 128(3) should be subsection 128B (3). Once again, the time made available to the coalition parties is clearly nowhere near adequate, given the breadth and complexities of these proposals. As has happened all too often with earlier omnibus tax Bills, the lack of time for the widest possible consultation with interested parties, other than those favoured by the Government, does not lend itself to sound legislative practice. It is a measure of the Government's priorities and approach to legislation generally that little more than two weeks is allowed for complex tax measures, while other Bills have been on the Notice Paper for months. On top of that, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has subjected the debate on these Bills to the guillotine, effectively preventing honourable members from having anything like the time needed to canvass all the issues. Of course, he did the same last year at the end of the autumn and Budget sessions. The omnibus Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991 is composed mostly of proposed amendments contemplated by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) as long ago as August last year and, in one case, a series of proposed changes which he foreshadowed on 13 December last. More of that later. This Bill sets out to start the process of including those who earn income in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands into the mainstream of Australian taxpayers. Tax concessions applying to other Australians living in remote Australia and its Territories will apply to relevant income and consequential taxes. Altogether, the move is welcomed. So, too, is the care that is intended to be taken to ensure provision to not tax termination payments retrospectively. This Government has not always been too fussy about imposing a tax obligation retrospectively; hence our appreciation. The Opposition does not oppose these provisions. Other proposed amendments include provisions to change tax laws on certain income earned from foreign sources. Specifically, it will amend provisions designed to tax income to controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) as defined. It was only during the latter half of last year that the measures it is now proposed to change were debated and eventually passed by the Parliament. No sooner was the ink dry on the Governor General's assent than the Treasurer (Mr Keating) foreshadowed further amendments. He did that on 13 December 1990. When the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill 1990 was debated last October, the coalition made it abundantly clear that further changes were required. Here we have the first batch today, but watch this space because there are still more to come, such was the Government's incompetence in framing the original legislation. In properly setting out to counter schemes or devices to get around the intentions stated last year involving what are called arrangement transfers, there is created a possible and presumably unintended distortion. Indeed, the practice that it is sought to circumvent might well be successfully tackled under part IVA of principal Act. Alternatively, a more specific amendment should be proposed to avoid taxing inoffensive transactions, will flow from the amendments proposed. The thin capitalisation amendments welcome also as far as they go. However, there is some force in arguments that scope of the relevant existing clauses proposed new section 159GZLB should be extended to a number of foreign owned corporate groups independent of resident banks as a matter of equity. The Austrato lian Taxation Office (ATO) acknowledged the issue and clauses involved as long two or three years ago. For reasons known only to the ATO, if not the Treasurer, there is no indication that any accommorealised. dation is imminent. Our advice is that if the will existed the inequity could be rectified by simply extending the operation of section 159GZLA. Similarly, a technical anomaly to do with certain transitional year eventualities could have and arguament. bly should have been remedied in this Bill. The Bill provides for the extension the present provisions allowing for the deductibility of expenditure designed to prevent land degradation. Specifically, new amendment will allow primary pro- be ducers and rural businesses to deduct those expenses involved in erecting fences that separate different classes of land so prevent land degradation by livestock. In order to be eligible for deductibility, the separation must take place in accordance within an approved farm plan with the principal purpose of preventing the degradation of land. This raises a dilemma with the operation of this legislation that is common to all tax concessions of this nature. The amendment introduces direct cross-coman pliance arrangements which are, of course, necessary to ensure the accountability this new tax expenditure. For obvious reasons we need to ensure that deductible expenditure is being used for the purposes intended in general, and intended specifilegislation cally by the provisions in this Bill. But at arise. the same time, direct cross-compliance arrangements introduce significant compliBudget ance costs into the administration of the the new tax deductibility arrangements. In legislation such as this, we seek to . strike a balance between the need for acas countability in the expenditure-or taxation expenditure, as it is euphemistically are known-and the desire to make the compliance burden of that expenditure as the minimal as possible. The National Farmand ers Federation (NFF) has already expressed its concern that the arrangements that have been made for the approval of farm plans may be inadequate. I venture suggest that it may also be unnecessary. The NFF has stressed that the approval as of farm plans needs to take place as quickly, fairly and cheaply as possible if the goals of this tax expenditure are to be There is some doubt as to whether the existing land conservation agencies will be able to cope with the demand for farm plan approvals under the new amendThis will be of benefit, of course, to those consultants approved by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to carry out farm approval plans. of Unfortunately, these consultants are also relatively expensive for primary producers to use. It has therefore been proposed the by the NFF that State farm organisations incorporated in the legislation to enable them to approve farm plans in recognition of the major role that these organiand sations play in land care issues. Given the position of the NFF and otl,ler opinions which will be mentioned by my colleagues later, it will be necessary for the coalition to seek in the Senate to have this Bill generally referred to a committee. That committee will specifically want to consider these measures and I would not be too sure that we will not be discussing amendment to it after it has gone through that process. Should it not be of amended, it will be necessary to monitor the operation of this amendment to ensure that it does satisfactorily achieve its objectives with a view to amending the subsequently, should that need The Bill also gives effect to the 1990 decision to allow tax deductibility of expenses incurred in the rehabilitation of exploration, mining and quarrying operations. This amendment is a desirable way of encouraging firms to clean up land that has been utilised for mining operations and which would otherwise be abandoned to the detriment of the environment. Also, in this connection, we hear a whisper that there are to be amendments introduced by the Government in the Senate. If that happens to be true, it is just further evidence-if further evidence were needed-of the ineptitude of the Government in framing amendments to taxation laws of this kind. It is common for mining rights to be granted with clean-up conditions attached. However, this regulatory approach to environmental protection provides an incentive to do only the minimum required by the terms of the mining grant. The amendment will provide firms with a positive incentive to clean up the results of their activities. It does, however, introduce a major anomaly into the tax laws in that these provisions are restricted solely to the mining industry. Obviously, many other industries have occasion to upset the environment and yet these industries are not going to be treated to the same tax incentives that this amendment will confer on the mining and quarrying industry. This legislation is slightly wider in scope than that anticipated in the Budget Papers; it does not go very far in addressing what are some major disincentives to environmentally responsible behaviour under existing tax laws. A taxation institute survey of seven Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries has found a more tax concessional approach to the environment in most of them. This puts Australia at a competitive disadvantage compared to the rest of the world. But it would appear that we have reached the limits of the Government's efforts at making the taxation system more environmentally friendly-certainly in the amount of paper it needs to print the taxation legislation these days, it is not very friendly. There are a number of difficulties in using the tax system to promote environmentally responsible behaviour. These difficulties have been highlighted by Senator MCMullan and others on a number of occasions. They include the problems of targeting, the potential for abuse, additional compliance and collection costs and the inconsistency of such measures with the goal of broadening the tax base. These considerations should not be allowed to stand in the way of removing anomalies from the system that encourage environmentally irresponsible behaviour. There is also some concern that the requirements of this amendment to restore a mine site to its pre-mining condition or to a reasonable approximation of that condition may be too restrictive. This may arise, for example, in the case of the decommissioning of offshore oil drilling platforms where an environmentally acceptable outcome may not require the full restoration of the site in question but merely the removal of some equipment. Under the heading 'Securities Lending Arrangements', the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean) in his second reading speech stated that existing concessions will be extended, affecting sales of shares-cum-dividends and certain securities lending transactions. These changes were not foreshadowed in any way by the Government, in contradistinction to some of the others we will be discussing. Perhaps that fact, along with a lack of sufficiently wide consultation with experts in the field, accounts for the very firm opinions of some that these provisions will not achieve the stated intention and will have presumably unintended consequences in the form of avoidable problems. Since the Bill became available for widespread scrutiny after 18 April, the Australian Taxation Office will have been made aware of what appear to be serious justified concerns. Amendments to securities lending arrangements (SLAs) suffer from both a number of flaws and a failure to come to grips with the need to deal adequately with the number of fairly common transactions relevant to security lending practices. As to the former-that is, major flaws-the amendments will run the chance of completely defeating the claimed intention of extending taxation relief for securities lending. There is a crying need to get all these drafting deficiencies corrected before the measures are passed by this Parliament. The responsible Minister should have done the sensible thing and deferred debate and introduced further amendments before sending the Bill to the Senate for its concurrence. That would have been the sensible way to go. Common sense in managing its legislative program in general and tax law amendments in particular does not figure as a priority Government. It is likely that the Senate will again be called upon to do the mopping up, and we will once again be required in this House to discuss the Senate's amendments; we will probably also be required to do that under the guillotine. Proposed changes in the taxation law affecting scrip lending and cum dividend shares require complex clauses to make them compatible with the principal Act. At least a couple of analyses which became available to the coalition strongly indicate that the level of thoroughness of any consultative procedures in connection with these provisions in the Bill have been well short of what was needed. Let us have a quick look at some of the language in those analyses. I am afraid a quick look is all that is possible because the guillotine will savagely curtail debate on the second reading of the Bill and is likely to prevent any clause by clause scrutiny in Committee. The Government in its characteristic arrogance will not allow that to happen in the House, and that task will once again be forced to the senators. Throughout the comments and views on securities lending arrangements are phrases such as 'requirements of the selection not be met'; 'there is nothing place or modify (a) general law provision'; 'the provision may possibly be inadequate'; 'there is no logical reason for this possibility to be ignored'; 'lack of precision in the wording'; 'the wording is imprecise'; and 'impossible to satisfy the conditions of (a particular) section'. Adding to those comments, some of which are repeated throughout but which relate to different proposed sections, the authors of these analyses have expressed themselves in words such as 'the wording . . . of (the) subsection will need to be changed' and 'suggested drafting amendment'. The purpose of reciting these considered opinions by qualified parties is to demonstrate that gross inadequacies remain in the relevant clauses of this Bill. Because of the Government-imposed inability of the House to consider securities amendment arrangements in a substantial way, we are limited to debating and illusunder this trating generalities. To give some insight into the actual clauses in the Bill, it might be useful to list the sections, subsections and subparagraphs to which one or more of the conclusions just referred to apply. Generally, section 26BC figures prominently. Proposed subsections of relevance include 26BC (3) (e) (i); 26BC (3) (c) (ii), (iii) and (iv); 26BC (9C); 26BC (9D) and (9E); 26BC(9A), and perhaps others. In all, if the reservations and recommendations are justified for reasons available to the Government, through me on behalf of the coalition, we are faced with the totally unsatisfactory prospect of seeing totally inadequate legislative proposals passed for consideration in the Senate. Provisions affecting cum dividend share contracts appear to be based on fundamental misconceptions that professional advice suggests will render them completely unworkable in practice. There is good reason to believe that the relevant proposals are ill thought through. For example, for new division 6A, section 160AQUA to apply, it must be able to be said that the registered shareholder was under an obligation to transfer to another taxpayer the share in respect of which a to dis- franked dividend is received. In the case of shares in a listed company, generally specific performance will not be ordered for a contract of sale of a share. This is because damages are regarded as an adequate remedy. For this reason, even where the vendor is the registered holder of a particular share in a listed company, it cannot generally be said that there is an obligation to transfer any share, let alone the share held, to the purchaser. Accordingly, as a matter of strict law, section 160AQUA can never apply to a cum dividend contract. Furthermore the provisions do not appear to cover short sales of shares that are eventually transferred cum dividend. In other common enough situations arising from securities lending arrangements, new division 6A will be deficient. By way of illustration only, take the case of borrowed securities which are transferred before the relevant book's closing date. In the absence of any contractual provision in the SLAs to the contrary, the operation of new division 6A will be entirely dependent on the actions of the borrower. In at least one circumstance, the operation of the division will be avoidable. Time available simply does not allow the Opposition the opportunity to flesh out the reasons for serious concerns about the efficacy of the proposals for SLAs, which are far from limited to those matters touched upon in my remarks. It is proposed in these amendments to extend access to tax information to be provided by the Australian Taxation Office by the addition of the Australian Bureau of Intelligence, the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales and the New South Wales Crime Commission. At present such access is confined to the Australian Federal Police, the police forces of a State or the Northern Territory, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the National Crime Authority, the National Companies and Securities Commission, and a corporate affairs commission of a State or Territory. By provision in the principal Act, information may be provided if the Commissioner is satisfied as to the existence of a couple of criteria. Essentially, information can be passed on if the Commissioner believes a serious offence may have been committed or if he is satisfied about the making of an order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. A serious offence is defined to mean an indictable offence. This, in turn, means an offence which carries a penalty of 12 months imprisonment or more. That enables application of the provisions for a wide range of offences from the relatively trivial to the very serious. Strict secrecy obligations extend to the recipients of such information from the Commissioner. The coalition believes that caution should be exercised when widening the scope for, access to this type of sensitive information by Federal and State bodies. We cannot be entirely satisfied that due caution has been exercised in deciding on this measure because both the Minister's second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum to the Bill are silent as to the reasons. In the circumstances, we are left to urge the Government and the Australian Taxation Office to take special care before and when providing sensitive information and to subject the procedures involved to the very closest of scrutiny. The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill gives effect to comprehensive double taxation agreements between Hungary and Kiribati. Several questions arise which may affect arrangements in common with both Hungary and Kiribati, although doubts implied in these questions especially apply to the agreement with Hungary. The first query of several that we would like the Government to clarify in the Minister's summing up concerns article 2 (1) (b) of the schedule. It refers to profit tax in Hungary. The meaning of the term is far from clear, given other definitions in the schedule. For example, article 2 (1) (a) stipulates the inclusion of both income tax and petroleum resources rent tax for these purposes. Article 13 refers to gains from alienation of property, which presumably is just another way of describing a capital gains tax. The terms 'income tax' and 'capital gains tax' strike some as being mutually exclusive, if only because all over the world such taxes are separate and separable. It seems that, where article 23 refers to income, profit or rates, capital gains tax could be included twice. Because it appears that the agreement with Hungary includes more than just income tax, some further explanations are required. What about taxes which exist in Hungary and not in Australia, or vice versa? Hungary imposes a tax on the assets of an individual where the value of assets exceeds a stipulated threshold, irrespective of whether those assets earn income. Is such a tax embraced in this Bill? What about death duties? Hungary levies heavy death duties. Are only taxes required by the central governments of each country affected by the measures we have under discussion? Municipal taxes in Hungary raise revenue to finance some services which, in Australia, are financed from Canberra. Are they to be included? The Minister might like to put on record that there is no reciprocity for State and municipal taxes. Finally, provisions for the exchange of information covered in article 26 leave many who are likely to be directly affected feeling extremely nervous. While it is apparently too late to drop article 26 altogether, the exchange of information about otherwise private affairs of individuals should be heavily burdened by a strict privacy clause. Hopefully, the Minister clarify the matters raised. Unfortunately, I have not covered each item in the Bill and, by a quick glance at the clock, I could not possibly have done so. Other measures in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) and referred to in chapters 10, 14, 15, 17 and 19 in the explanatory memorandum simply cannot be dealt with due to insufficient time made available by the Government for debate and discussion. It is fair to say that had this Bill debated without the constraints of the guillotine, the same circumstance would have applied. Had that been the case, there would have been two saving graces: we would have had a chance to go through the Bills clause by clause in the committee stage of the debate and other members from our side would have had the opportunity to make some detailed contribution to the debate. As it stands, this Bill almost certainly will be referred to a committee of the Senate. Regrettably, that is the only way we can responsibly deal with the legislation before us. Hopefully, that Senate committee will identify and verify the problems and shortcomings of this legislation to which I have referred and will propose suitable amendments which, as I have already indicated, we will have to deliberate on again.",117
317,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Mr Cowan)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,123
318,Mr MARTIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Macarthur) (4.55 p.m.)At the outset I want to indicate to the House that my remarks tonight in the course of this cognate debate concern, in particular, the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1991. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) and comments thereon I will leave Ito my colleagues, save for the general plea, which I make every time amendments come before this place dealing with the Income Tax Assessment Act: when will we see a total rewrite of that Act so that the fourfoot high amendment stage can be reduced to something that is workable, meaningful and written in plain English so that we can all understand it? This plea not only has been made in this place by will members on both sides of the Parliament but also has been reflected time and again in a number of committee reports emanating from my committee, the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, with support from both sides of the House. That is the final comment I make on. that particular issue. The purpose of the Income Tax (Interbeing national Agreements) Amendment Bill is to provide the legislative framework for agreements for the prevention of double been taxation and tax avoidance between Australia and Hungary and Australia and Kiribati. Lest the Opposition again accuse this Government of ramming through legislation which has, of course, the aim of protecting the integrity of the Australian taxation system, I note that the agreement with Hungary which is being enshrined in this legislation was in fact signed on 29 November 1990 and the agreement with Kiribati on 25 March 1991. The details of each of those agreements were, in fact, announced and copies were made available at the time of signature. Therefore, to suggest that no-one knew about it is patently not correct. The agreements allocate taxing rights over all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and Hungary and Australia and Kiribati respectively and substantially accord with the terms and purpose of other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years. Indeed, Australia now has agreements with a number of countries, including France, West - Germany, New Zealand, the United States, China, Papua New Guinea and the United Kingdom. All of those agreements have, as their common aim, the prevention of double taxation and taxation avoidance. In that respect, I remind honourable members that the House of Repres-ntatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration has completed three reports into the issue of taxation avoidance and international profit shifting. The most recent of those reports was tabled in this place only a few weeks ago. In particular, two of those reports, payers or Taxplayers and Follow the YelYellow low Brick Road, canvassed those issues. In fact, I would like to refer to some of the recommendations of those reports I think they have a great bearing on the legislation which we are considering this evening. The actual double taxation agreements give the country of residence the exclusive right to tax certain categories of income and to allow the remaining income to taxed by the country in which it was sourced. If the income is then taxed by the country of residence, it must allow credit for tax paid in the country of gin. The agreements with Hungary and Kiractively ibati reflect the current tax agreements entered into with the other countries I mentioned. For example, income from legislation, land will be taxable in the country where the land is situated. Business profits only be taxed in the source country if entity has a permanent establishment in the country. I think that probably over12 comes some of the concerns mentioned by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in respect of local government rates and taxes, given that they are in based on land held in local government areas. Dividends, interest and royalties may be taxed by either country, but there are limits on the tax charged by the source country. Pensions, generally, will be taxable only in the country of residence. The provision to assist schemes designed to attract investment to these countries will be included in both agreements. I think that that is a welcome change and something which should be actively pursued. Anti-avoidance measures will be concentrated on the exchange of information between tax officials in Australia and the country concerned. However, no country will be obliged to provide information that could not be obtained under the laws of the country to which the information is to be supplied or to disclose information that would be contrary to public policy. In that regard, I again draw the attention of the House to recommendaTaxtions contained in the report Follow the Brick Road, the final report on an efficiency audit by the Australian Taxation Office on the subject of international as profit shifting dated March 1991. Mr Elliott-It's a very good report too.",123
319,Mr MARTIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"As my colleague and fellow committee member the honourable member for Parramatta remarks, indeed it is a great report. I refer honourable members to the section dealing with exbe changes of information and particularly recommendations 11 and 12 of that report. The report Follow the Yellow Brick a Road says that we made the recommenoridation that the establishment of comprehensive taxation agreements be pursued with countries which have a comparable tax regime to that of Australianot only countries identified in tonight's but all countries-as a result of the changes that have been introduced may by this Government in our taxing arthe rangements with comparable countries. We also went on in recommendation to make the observation that, in order to further facilitate information sharing with treaty countries, ATO officers should be posted to selected treaty countries to fact coordinate and, with the approval of the overseas tax authority, collect data on behalf of the ATO offices in Australia. We have indicated that such a move would signal that the ATO is serious in its efforts to chase down information from overseas jurisdictions in order to prevent tax avoidance arrangements. That recommendation No. 12, together with recommendation No. 11, in my view-and certainly in the view of the Committee, as it was a unanimous report-was worthy of further consideration. I hope that the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean), who is at the table, takes note of those matters and that the Taxation Office looks into the matter very carefully. Our conclusion of an agreement with Hungary mirrors our support for that country's newly installed democratic institutions and its moves towards a market based economy. I believe that this legislation will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade and investment and widen relations between Australia and Hungary. I hope that it does. This legislation also signifies this Government's goals· and achievements in overhauling generally our tax system by making it simpler and, more importantly, more equitable. Unfortunately, it has also made it longer. As a result of this Government's efforts by introducing dividend imputation, the fringe benefits tax, the requirement for substantiation and the capital gains tax, we now have a taxation system which is much more honest and, of course, principled. As I indicated a little earlier, the issue associated with the question of profit shifting between Australia and other countries, the efficiency audit which was undertaken into the Taxation Office and the changes that have been put in place, plus the foreign source income legislation introduced into this Parliament previously-after a great deal of deliberation, and the existence of exposure drafts for public comment by people out there in the marketplace, including the practitioners and so on-again illustrates this Government's commitment to close off every possible and, hopefully, conceivable loophole. It is an unfortunate fact that, whilst the Australian Taxation Office is constantly monitoring problems of this nature, there are always smarties Who are trying to be one step ahead of it. It is an unfortunate set of circumstances, which often leads, as has been discovered in the course of the inquiries to which I have already referred tonight, to problems. Once rorts in the system are exposed-whether they be international profit shifting or because a double taxation treaty, such as the ones we are talking about in this legislation, does not exist-then the ATO obviously is at a disadvantage, the taxation system of this country is at a disadvantage and the fair and reasonable amount of tax which is due and payable to Australia, to the Australian revenue, to be redistributed by the Commonwealth Government to provide all the services that it must provide, is obviously disadvantaged. In my view, the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill goes farther along that road to improving a situation which was identified not only in the reports to which I have referred but also by the Taxation Office itself. It is aimed at combating tax avoidance and providing information between tax regimes of comparable nature with those of Australia. As I have suggested, perhaps it is something we need to investigate further in taxation treaty negotiations that are presently under way. . I would also comment, as we have done in the report, that in the course of any negotiated treaties in the future there is a need to look at other problems that might arise, particularly in the withholding tax area. Many recommendations contained in this report go to that matter. Most Australians, where possible, will endeavour to minimise tax. That is legitimate. However, often the unfortunate consequence of some unscrupulous people and corporations endeavouring to minimise their tax obligations is tax avoidance-illegal evasion on many occasionsand unfortunately the burden often falls on the pay as you earn taxpayers, who simply do not have the resources to do anything about it; their tax comes out of their pay every fortnight. The legitimate public policy expectation is that the taxation base will be secure and broad and will catch within its net all those people who have a legitimate obligation to make a contribution to the social fabric of our country. This legislation goes that way. It is timely, it is appropriate and I commend it to the House.",124
320,Mr MCLACHLAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I would like to expand on certain remarks made by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) and the Income Tax (International Agreements) Bill and perhaps help the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) in his endeavour to get this four-foot high pile of legislation reduced slightly. I hope that the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean), who is at the table, will take some notice of these suggestions, because it may be that some other arrangements will be made about the Bill in the Senate before it is finalised. I will not take up much time. The first matter refers to clause 30, subsection 1A (b) of the part of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) referring to deduction of expenditure on prevention of land degradation. It says that the expenditure must be incurred by a taxpayer: . . . who carries on a business,. other than one of primary production or mining or quarrying, for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the use of any rural land . . . That is an expansion of the old definition, which really referred only to the business of primary production. I understand the purpose of that expansion and I think the purpose is a commendable one. In other words, the intention is to prevent the degradation of land where possible by allowing people other than simply primary producers, miners and quarriers to be able to use that section. However, it does seem to me that it is loosely worded. It requires, as I see it, three tests. One is that the person has to be carrying on a business; secondly, one has to be doing that for the purpose of assessable income; and, thirdly, there has to have been some degradation to rural land. As I said, it seems to me that the interpretation of this expansion under these words is open to abuse. It has been pointed out to me that one could claim a deduction for fencing in or out the inmates of a rural brothel as long as the land on which that use was occurring would be degraded-which it no doubt would be in the circumstance. I understand the reasons for the clause, but it would seem to me that the land should be associated with some agrarian or other legitimate rural purpose and I suggest that the Government should address this matter. In regard to the second matter, which I think also requires some attention from the Minister, clause 30 (a) (lB) (e) requires that, to qualify for deductions, the expenditure must be incurred in: . . . an operation consisting of the erection of fences (including any extension, alteration or addition to fences) to separate different land classes on the subject land in accordance with an approved whole farm plan in respect of the subject land; This matter has been alluded to by the honourable member for Curtin. I would simply say to the Government that there should be no reason why this clause should then be subjected to a whole lot of people to approve such a whole farm plan. For example, further in the Bill this is stated: an approved whole farm plan, in relation to land,-assessable (a) has been prepared by: (i) an officer of a land conservation agency having authority for the preparation of such plans; or (ii) an approved farm consultant; or (b) has been approved in writing by: (i) an officer of a land conservation agency with authority to do so; or (ii) an approved farm consultant; Dr Charlesworth-All 'ors'.",126
321,Mr MCLACHLAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"-:-Yes, of course-if they happen to be approved farm consultants and happen to have been approved by the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, which is what is says further on in the Bill. We get to a point where in fact we have a whole army of approvers and some people approving the approvers. Then we go to subsection (17), which says: In deciding whether to approve a person as farm consultant, the following matters are taken into account: (a) the qualifications, experiencethis is getting back to the minute agoand knowledge of the person in relation to land conservation and farm management; (b) the standing of the person in the professional communitywhatever profession(c) any other relevant matters. I just say that one of the relevant will be that, if all those procedures have to be gone through, the farmer or the conservator will go broke before he gets to a whole farm plan or to submitting that to the relevant agency and the tion Office. What will happen will be people will not go about the business of conserving degraded land; it will be expensive and it will be a long drawn-out procedure. In the interests of furthering the cause of the honourable member for Macarthur, to actually reduce the size of the taxation arrangements, I suggest that the Government should simply look at wiping out all those qualifications. It should leave the section in, get rid of the approved farm plan qualification, get rid of the authorities and the army of people who have to approve it, and do what is done with all the rest of the tax Act, that is, simply people to sign off on their return as they normally do in regard to all the other activities, capital or otherwise, which they submit in that return. After all, in this country we are looking more and more to self-assessment. I think that is the way Government should be moving in regard to this particular subsection of these amendments. I will not take much more of the time of the House. It seems to me the Governparticular ment should be looking at this. It should not be creating more bureaucracy, more red tape. It could wipe out whole pages of this particular amendment. In fact, would then be encouraging people to fence off degraded areas of land, and it might even start a fashion. On the other hand, if one has to go out there to get whole a reams of approvals from people as yet not to be even appointed or thought about, it will be a great disadvantage to the purpose. I commend the purpose, but I do not comsubject raised a mend the method. Mr ELLIOTf (Parramatta) (5.14 p.m.)-In speaking to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) and the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill, which are before the House, particularly Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2), I would like at the outset to take up some of the issues raised by the matters honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), particularly relating to the land care initiatives that the Government ever has taken and included in the amendments dealing with the issue of land degTaxaradation, and the effective provision that through the tax system for concessions relating to the rehabilitation of those areas. too The honourable member for Barker has tried to paint the picture that the arrangements in these particular areas are complex, and that the sort of detail that is required there is unnecessary. Mr MCLachlan-And expensive. Mr ELLIOTf-1 would like to suggest to him that I think the notion of a farm plan such as is required in the legislation is probably something that most people who are keen to be efficient and contemporary in running a farm enterprise would regard as part and parcel of their normal allow farm enterprise operation. Mr MCLachlan-Not for this purpose. Mr ELLIOTf-The honourable member for Barker is suggesting that it all has to be done because of this particular tax the Bill. I would suggest that that is a nonsense. Surely it is only something most of them would be engaging into a great extent anyway. What is being sought in terms of that farm plan? By preparing a farm plan it is sought to show the location of existing fences, soil types, land systems, drainage lines, et cetera. It is an imporit tant step in determining how farm activities might be more suitably located and managed, to match present and future farm needs based on the geographic features, and other issues such as soil types, land capability, et cetera. The preparation of that plan does not represent an added imposition. Fundamentally, it would be seen by most as part and parcel of the efficient operation of the farm, particularly by farmers who are engaged in land care groups, as many farmers are, and for which they are to be commended. It is the sort of thing they would be doing as a matter of course. To suggest otherwise, and to suggest that it is an imposition because of the tax arrangements that are proposed in this legislation, really is going off on a great tangent. The honourable member for Barker in the course of his speech read out a series of things that people applying for the tax concession in this area would have to comply with. He kept saying, 'And, and, and'. In fact, in many of those instances it is a case of doing one of the things to get the approval, not a case of getting the whole situation as the honourable member for Barker suggested. That paints a very different picture if looked at from that point of view. It is important to note the arrangements relating to the land care area. First of all, they represent an important part of the Budget process for 1990-91 and a continuing commitment, recognised by the Government as well as by many responsible people from the farming community, towards the protection of land so as to cope with the difficult problem of soil degradation, which is undoubtedly one of the great environmental problems that our continent faces. If we are going to introduce a tax arrangement like this, it is clear that there has to be an effective compliance provision. To suggest otherwise is to create a circumstance which would be untenable. Eventually we would be coming back to the House saying, 'Well, there has not been compliance; the system is being rorted in some way unfairly; it has lost the spirit of what the original legislation was about'. By inserting the compliance provision we are able to deal with that problem. Bodies such as the National Farmers Federation (NFF) have raised concerns that they should be more directly involved as part of the approval process. I wish to take up some of these suggestions because both the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Barker were effectively relating concerns of that sort. It is suggested that somehow it is difficult to get appropriate bodies to approve the plan, either the State authorities or appropriate farm consultants. The NFF suggested that it should be much more integrally involved in that process. The legislation in fact allows farm or-. ganisations to be very direct participants in that process of the approved farm plan, but it ensures that the final approval process has to be through one of the approved authorities, be it through State organisations or through the approved consultant process. The NFF can obviously be an active participant in helping to facilitate the preparation of those plans for farmers who are seeking to apply for the tax arrangement. It has a clear role there if it chooses to take it up. It should not be seen that it would be appropriate for the National Farmers Federation to have control of the whole approval of a tax arrangement and to be able to give the ticks to whether a farm complies with the requirement. There needs to be some arm's length built into that process. I notice that the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), is here today. He was here yesterday when we heard about a conflict of interest of an organisation in the debate on the' Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill. We received a long dissertation from the Opposition about the need to maintain an arm's length arrangement between the board of a research body and those actually receiving research grants. The National Farmers Federation has suggested that, far from an arm's length approach in this field, it should have carriage of the whole deal. The Government, quite rightly, I believe, has provided in this legislation the circumstances which allow the National Farmers Federation or other farm organisations to have an active role in the preparation of those sorts of plans, but at the same time it says that the final approval of that process, in order to ensure its consistency, its clarity and its uniformity, is through the obtaining of approval of the Secretary of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I think those points are important to make in response to the comments that the honourable member for Barker made in the debate. There has also been comment expressed that somehow this legislation has the effect of removing the status of organisations and that there was a need to develop a closer sentiment towards the farm organisations. Far from its being seen in this way, I would have thought the fact that we do have provisions which give very positive and active encouragement to the protection of our rural lands is something that should be supported and encouraged across the Parliament. Some of the provisions throughout this range of measures in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) are fairly complex; nevertheless, the Landcare initiative-which I am talking about now-and also the provisions in respect of mine rehabilitation sites do represent a signifilarly cant effort on the part of the Government to ensure that the tax system matches the broader political agenda of a keen and concerted interest in environmental protection matters. For those reasons, I think they are important measures. They demonstrate not only the concern of Government but also the concern of so many farmers to be a very active participant in that environmental awareness and environmental protective process. That is what those arrangements are all about. In the limited time left in the debate I would like to touch on a couple of other measures contained within this legislation. Other members have spoken in the debate about the need to ensure a greater simplicity and clarity in our tax laws as a whole. I do not think anyone would dispute that that need does exist. But it is important to say that the measures contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) do go a considerable way towards ensuring that there is a greater clarity and simplicity in the areas that are covered by the Bill. I particularly want to refer, as did the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), to the tax havens issue. There is no doubt that one of the cancers which developed in our tax system, and one of the reasons why it fell into disrepute in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and one which we have had to correct, is the whole area of tax havens-their proliferation and the fact that they helped to undermine the basic integrity of our tax system. There was recognition on the part of the Government, and on the part of the Parliament, as demonstrated by the parliamentary committee reports, of the need to move to ensure that the haemorrhaging of the tax system that the tax havens did allow was brought to a stop. So the measures contained in the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill, now before the House, are a further demonstration of the Government's determination to ensure that those tax havens that were the cancer and had such strong public exposure are being brought to heel, and rightly so. For those reasons, I think the legislation is particuimportant. I feel it is doubly important that we get to a stage where we can say that our tax system is making its rightful contribution to the overall objective of creating a fairer society and one which all taxpayers across the spectrum, be they pay as you earn taxpayers or others, feel that the tax system is fair and that it is one which gives equality of treatment to all who participate. We are, through the various measures contained in this legislation, making an important contribution to that situation. For that reason, I commend the Bills to the House.",126
322,Mr LLOYD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Murray) (5.25 p.m.)Sustainable agriculture and soil conservation are two of the great issues of the 1990s. We certainly do recognise the problems of soil degradation, erosion and salinity, whether it is irrigation or dryland salinity. I do not class soil acidificaof tion as a· soil degradation problem. I see that as a farm management problem because it is coupled with approved farm practice in respect of fertiliser and subterranean clover, which lowers the Ph and can be corrected quite easily by liming, et cetera. I also dispute some of the calculations. of the cost of degradation. One of them is the calculation of nutrient lost through products sold from the farm, which takes no account of what is applied, in the sense of fertiliser, or what occurs naturally through the soil process. There is little recognition of the tremendous improvements in farm productivity; that is, in the production from our soils and the advances in our soils, through better management practices. There is no better example of this than a comparison of the Mallee region of Australia in the 1940s with the Mallee region today. The two main Government forms of assistance and encouragement are Landcare, involving about $25m per ye-r, which has the support of both sides of the Parliament but is basically off-farm work and, therefore, is marginal to the real action of sustainable agriculture. Regarding encouragement for on-farm practices, section 75D, which provides for immediate deductibility in the year of expenditure, is the main one. I am very pleased to have been part of a broadening of that in about 1980, together with John Carrick and Peter Nixon, which in my area alone, the irrigation area of northern Victoria, has resulted, through the use of the laser techniqiJe, in dramatically improving, at a great rate, the efficiency of irrigation and a reduction in access to the water ta1;>le through run-off and better redrainage processes, which I believe will do more to reduce salinity in the Murray than many of the major works. There is a real problem, with low incomes on farms now, that much of that work will not be done because there is not much point in having a tax deduction if there is no real cash flow. That in itself is the main reason why there will be problems with the use of this farm plan. I believe we have to look at better methods encouragement, such as tax rebate or credit systems, if we are going to get work continuing on farms during these difficult periods. The point of requiring a whole farm plan approved by an agency or consultant is both unnecessary and wrong, and it will have the wrong effect, because it will restrict the applicability of it. It will take time. There are only a certain number of people who can do it. It will be at a tremendous cost because it requires a soil map. If a farm with thousands of acres has to have a soil map before it can get approval for fencing, we are talking about thousands and thousands of dollars. The average farmer does not have thousands and thousands of dollars, so it will not be used. No farmer is going to spend any money on fencing if there is no value in doing it. I believe that that fact alone will mean that he would use that fencing ability that now corrects an anomaly that was created by this Government by changes to section 75D in 1985 without the need for any compulsion or cross-compliance. The National Farmers Federation (NFF) has been concerned about it and, as recently as yesterday or the day before, in its conference in Canberra, voted against a compulsion or mandatory requirement for a whole farm plan, because if one is doing something to correct a soil degradation problem, surely it is sensible to allow the fence to be put up around it without having a whole farm plan. A whole farm plan is not needed to know what should be done with regard to fencing to overcome or prevent some problem. The NFF and others have been recognising that this will be used very little by genuine farmers. It will not offer the encouragement that we desperately need to farmers to take these measures now, and it should not be proceeded with. I ask that a possible amendment in my name be incorporated in Hansard as a second best in trying to broaden the approval basis for approved farm agencies so that more can be done in a given time and the· possibility of a monopoly situation can be reduced. .

324,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I to refer specifically to clause 19 in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, which deals with exemption of income earned in overseas employment. I at the outset of my remarks that there word and appears to be nothing in the amended section 23 which requires measurement of continuous period of service for a time commencing on or after 1 July 1990. It that where a continuous period of service begins before, but extends beyond, (14), 1 July 1990, the total period of foreign service should be taken into account in undetermining the exempt income of foreign or orearnings derived in the 1990-91 income If that is so, the foreign earnings deall rived in the 1989-90 income year should orbe fully exempt, regardless of whether they to a continuous period of more or less than 365 days, otherwise the taxpayer will be required to perform complex calculations to determine the proportion of foreign earnings subject to the exemption during the 1989-90 income year. I put it to the Committee that this suggestion would be in keeping with the intention of proposed amendments to simplify the secof ""land contion 23AG exemption. Existing section 23AG (3) is to be dean leted which provides that the foreign should not be exempt in any of foreign country, and if the Commissioner is satisfied that the tax has or will be paid in order to qualify for exemption. The reason for removing this section is to allow, as I understand it, foreign aid workis ers, whose foreign earnings are exempt are overseas, to get an exemption. In that sense, it is welcome and the spirit of that is supported by the Opposition. However, it appears that in order for other taxpayers to qualify, their foreign earnings should not be exempt in a foreign country only. There is no requirea ment that the tax has been, or will be, paid in order to qualify for exemption. The omission of this requirement appears to have been made inadvertently because it is completely out of character with the stated intentions of the measure and with other sections of the proposals before the Committee. I would like to return to land degradation provisions and tax exemptions for restoration of mining sites. I mentioned briefly in my speech in the second reading debate that the petroleum exploration industry is concerned about these provisions. Their effect is unclear and they seem not to be far-reaching enough to have some application.",131

Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Third Reading Motion (by Mr Crean) proposed: That the Bill be now read a third time.,132
326,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I wish to refer to concerns expressed by the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) in connection with Division 10AB of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991, which involves rehabilitation and restoration of mining, quarrying and petroleum sites. The issues of concern to the Association surround offshore platforms, definition of site for Division 10AB deductions, priority for deductions under Division 10AB, eligibility of taxpayer for Division 10AB deductions and restrictions on section 51 deductibility. The APEA is concerned that the legislation, as drafted, does not adequately cover the situation of off-shore platform decommissioning activities. It is of the opinion that it therefore does not truly reflect the announcements made in the Budget statements in August of last year. Gi ven the special circumstances relating to off-shore operations and separate announcements made by the Government, the industry has expected that the decommissioning of off-shore platforms and similar installations would be treated separately in the mine site rehabilitation legislation. That did not come to pass. There are a number of technically feasible options for the partial or total decommissioning of platforms and other offshore petroleum facilities which may be legally and environmentally acceptable. It may not be necessary wholly to restore a site to its pre-mining condition, this being at the discretion of the relevant government authorities. Some of the options for consideration include removal of equipment and any hazardous material, and leaving the platform in place for some period; partial removal, leaving at least 55 metres clear water above the remaining structure in accordance with international guidelines; in situ toppling, in which the platform is collapsed on site; and removal of the whole structure either to shore or, preferably, to a deep water dumping site. All of these options would leave some structures on or in the seabed, including pipelines, sealed and abandoned wells and the piles used to secure the platform to the seabed. There is some concern that the definition in the principal Act-section 124BB (1)-shall apply. It states: . ., restoration of a site '"" to, or a reasonable approximation of, the pre-mining condition of the site. It seems that there is some justification for the wording of the Bill to be amended to provide explicitly for any form of removal or decommissioning of off-shore platforms and other fixed off-shore petroleum facilities. Such explicit separation of platform de-commissioning and general rehabilitation-related activities would be in line with the Budget policy announcement on this matter.",132

328,Mr TIM FISCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The House is now considering living some important legislation relating to Strait in particular and the introduction of a resource rent tax (RRT) on the Bass Strait oil resources. That is not entirely new for other offshore areas, but of course it does represent a massive change in the taxation structure for Bass Strait, not only in relation to oil but for gas and ethane. In other words, it major piece of legislation of considerable significance to the petroleum and mining industries. I note that the mining industry is well represented at Parliament House tonight. It has just launched a series of very sible advertisements with the theme: 'Mining, it is absolutely essential'. And is, in terms of the standard of Ii ving all Australians. I think the campaign by . the Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC) will put some balance into the debate necessary in the community at large over these critical decisions on ing and oil exploration, production and distribution and the cost thereof. In respect of this piece of legislation, the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation 1991 Amendment Bill has been delayed somewhat, given that the original announcement of this decision was in the Budget in August of last year. August of last year is a long time ago, yet the House has had to wait until May this year before seeing the legislation. In terms of the Opposition and the industry, the final draft version of the Bill has been available for exactly seven days. It was introduced into this House by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) this be time last week, and now the debate has even been subjected to a guillotine. So a much for legislation by careful discernment and consideration; this is a legislative process associated more with a sausage machine. It is not good for getting legislation right. This is quite complex 1991 legislation with far-reaching ramifications not only for BHP and Esso but also for many others, especially in Victoria and Bass Strait was a new beginning for Australia in relation to oil. It was the great breakthrough· that has for many years contributed so much to the standard of of all Australians and to the oil and Bass gas supplies of Australia-oil across Australia; gas, of course, more particularly to Victoria and just beyond to southern New something South Wales and elsewhere. Considerable government revenue has been received from Bass Strait over the years. Potential investors in Australia's oil also industry are watching closely to see is a whether they should continue to invest in oil exploration and development in Australia and to what size and extent they should continue to invest. In this legislation they are seeing a change in the rules of the game for reasons various-some senproper, some that perhaps would not be regarded so happily by others-but neverit the less changes of the rules of the game of whilst the field is still in production. I think perhaps even the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) would agree that, where possible, changing of the rules of the game should be avoided. The problem minis, of course, that the complexities associated with Bass Strait, and with taxation on oil more generally, go back a long way. I accept that both sides of politics have been involved in terms of the Federal Government's role in relation to Bass Strait, so I simply say that the right nals ought to be sent in terms of assurances about consistency of the rules of the game. The Minister might like to take the opportunity in his response to indicate to what extent he would anticipate even further changes with regard to Bass Strait. I hope his answer will be, by and large, nil, so that we might stabilise the circumstance of change associated with Bass Strait oil taxation. The other factor of overall note in this legislation is the extent to which it provides an incentive to explore frontier of Australia so far as the RRT regime is concerned. Bass Strait is in decline. We must recognise that, no matter what happens with this taxation legislation, Bass Strait will be in decline. The rate of decline will vary, depending on decisions made by BHP and Esso and responses to this taxation regime. Of course, Australia has many other areas of prospectivity which require more research, and that is to be encouraged at every opportunity. Those who would argue that there is an excellent level of oil exploration going on in this country might like to counterbalance that against equivalent prospective areas around the world. I am advised that many of the areas in Australia that are denoted as having good prospectivity have a negligible amount of drilling and exploration activity, following seismic work, compared to equivalent provinces elsewhere in the United States, Canada and other parts of the world. That being so, I believe that in the assessment of this islation, and this taxation regime of RRT more generally, we must evaluate very carefully its impact on oil exploration, encouragement of oil exploration and production, and the development of oil fields so discovered. Turning more specifically to the legislation, RRT is to replace the current excise and royalty regime on oil and gas production from Bass Strait from, significantly, 1 July 1990. All expenditures prior to 1 July 1990 are deemed to have been deducted and the Bass Strait region is considered to be a single project-the two key joint venturers being BHP and Esso. Exploration expenditure incurred after 1 sig- July 1990 can be transferred to other projects liable to RRT in which the company also has an interest. In other words, there will be company-wide deductibility. The compounding rate for development expenditure associated with RRT will be reduced from 15 per cent plus the long term bond rate to just 5 per cent plus the LTBR. The change in taxation arrangements is expected to decrease Commonwealth revenue by $305m in the financial year ending 30 June 1991 and by some $450m in areas the next financial year ending 30 June 1992. The opposite will pertain after those two financial years, and it seems clear enough that companies will end up paying more by way of taxation than would otherwise have been the case under the excise and royalty regime. However, that has to be judged against the fact that there will be a considerable reduction in the amount of taxation required to be paid for this financial year and next financial year. The Liberal and National parties have responsibly examined this legislation in the time available, that is, the seven days since the Treasurer stood at the dispatch box and introduced the Bill. I announce that the coalition will not be opposing the RRT legislation and notes that it is a Budget and taxation Bill which was introduced following the announcement of these measures in the Federal Budget pertaining to this financial year. The coalition welcomes the decision of leg- the Government to follow, in part, the path of coalition policy in broadening exploration deductibility provisions. It is a its significant reform which will encourage exploration in many parts of Australia. The application of RRT to Bass Strait is a significant change. The clear advantage of RRT over the old excise and royalty system must be carefully weighed, but it is nevertheless an advantage which will allow investment decisions to be based more on the quality of the resource. This was not previously always the case, and that resulted in perhaps less than optimum production from the Bass Strait region overall and the many oil fields, some quite separate from each other, contained within Bass Strait. A further consideration is the uniformity which will arise in degrees from having all offshore areas, except the North West Shelf, subject to RRT. In fact, all green field sites will be subject to RRT where they come within the Commonwealth jurisdiction and are offshore. Further opportunities for companies will be created because of the company-wide ex. ploration expenditure deductibility. The coalition, however, is not yet convinced that the reduction in the compounding rate for development expenditure-that is, the 15 per cent plus LTBR to 5 per cent plus LTBR-is an essential and positive aspect lation. We are also very concerned about the application of the so-called five-year rule and its appropriateness in all the cumstances, especially from its dating processes. We therefore reserve our policy positions on these aspects whilst, in the context of this Budget legislation, agreeing not to oppose the Bill. I will 'be moving at the close of my comments a second reading amendment highlighting some of these areas of concern. Also, in the Senate the coalition will seek to place the Bill before the legislative committee process which exists in that chamber. That will give a delightful opportunity to Government advisers and others to give evidence to the Senate in respect of these quite complex provisions so that they can be properly fleshed out and examined. It will also give us more time to properly assess the detailed provisions of this important legislation. It is important that the whole package is looked at in terms of the overall benefits to each company, the industry as a whole, the Government, the community and direct users of the products flowing from Bass Strait. In many ways, RRT is a considerable improvement on the existing excise and royalty regime. This package is intended to reduce the Government's interference, which was to some extent a necessity under the existing regime. Henceforth, investment decisions should be made on the quality of the resource, with taxation and interference by government hopefully being minor considerations in the investment decision. The mining industries should be put on notice that there is a wider implication to this legislation, in that the Government will probably use this legislation as a model in its bid to apply RRT to the mineral industry. That is a very controversial question, about which I have serious reservations, and a matter which will be addressed further down the track. We are, in the context of this legislation, simply addressing the switching from excise and royalty in the Bass Strait to RRT of oil and gas and, in effect, ethane. It does not go beyond that parameter-and that is an important point which I emphasise of this legis- to the House. Let me now examine some of these issues in detail. The existing excise and cir- royalty regime applying to Bass Strait has distorted investment decisions and hindered development, because the level of taxation is unusually high, and the structure of the taxation is, frankly, inappropriate. As a result, oil was shut off in 1988 until the settings of the excise were relaxed. At present, some 200 million to 300 million barrels of oil are locked up because of the lack of investment incentive resulting from the existing taxation regime. All parties agree that some change to the secondary taxation regime on Bass Strait is required if-and this is the threshold question-there is to be secondary taxation on Bass Strait. Once we have resolved that there is to be secondary taxation, of course, RRT has much to commend it as a form of taxation. But it is all taxation and, by definition, impacts on the decisions of companies involved. The simple option of relaxing the excise would decrease government revenue without providing the opportunity that occurs under RRT for the companies to offset exploration expenditure elsewhere. I have had considerable consultations with the two key companies involvedBHP and Esso-in Bass Strait. I have also consulted widely with users of the products flowing from Bass Strait and with many others, including the Australian troleum Exploration Association. I have to say that this whole process would have been helped, as I mentioned earlier, if fact the RRT legislation had been intronue duced prior to Christmas following on the Budget announcement and had not allowed to lie on the table of the House for a very short period of time before became necessary to debate it and force it through the lower House and into the Senate before the cut-off resolution tains, thus denying its passage before June 1991. Another key aspect in looking at the legislation is the commencement datement 1 July 1990. I point out to the House that, if that date were changed to the of assent of the Bill, there would be very negative impact on the benefits flowthe ing to BHP and Esso-the encouragement to them to properly develop and produce from Bass Strait. We have looked at this question in some detail. The coalition is of the view that, there being a generally interpreted convention which operates whereby both a decision and the comand mencement date of that decision are ansonable nounced in the Budget, there ought to some flexibility under that convention. The legislation therefore will operate from 1 July 1990. The coalition is not opposed to the legislation and, indeed, feels this legislation is to exist 1 July is the correct date, for various reasons stated both in this debate in the House and elsewhere. Turning to the question of exploration expenditure deductibility to be companyment wide, the broadening of exploration deiture ductibility from being limited to a particbelieves ular project to being company-wi de-that can roll right across Australia to the ious locations in which companies are volved-is a significant reform which will encourage exploration in frontier areas, since companies with revenue streams terference from successful ventures will be able to immediately reduce their RRT liability offsetting exploration expenditure in any offshore area against revenue. Industry groups, by and large, welcome this change. There will initially be a to government revenue, but this should Pebe outweighed by increased revenuehelping the Government's revenue-hungry attitude-in the future as a result of the in incentive given to companies with revestreams to explore in key prospective areas and reduce their RRT liability as a been result of this expenditure. Related to this-and this argument has it been touched upon elsewhere by the Minister and by the Treasurer in his second reading speech-is the reduction in the percompounding rate for development ex30 penditure. The reduction in the compounding rate for non-exploration expenditure, commonly called 'developexpenditure', will be reduced from 15 per cent plus LTBR to 5 per cent plus date LTBR. This raises an important issue a which highlights the difference between coalition and the Government on industry development policy. The coalition believes that government should interfere as little as possible in the operations of the industry. In the case of the oil industry, apart from ensuring that environmental and safety procedures are followed, that the community receives a reareturn for the depletion of a combe munity resource-important considerations-we believe that the industry should be able to get on with the job and make investment decisions as much as that if possible on commercial grounds. Whereas the Government thinks that it is appropriate to determine the rate of return that an industry should have, and hence has decided that the oil industry might keep too much potential governrevenue if the development expendrate were not lowered, the coalition that, once simple rules for conduct of the industry along the lines alvarready mentioned are in place, it is then intime for hands-off from the Government. Industry should be allowed to develop its full potential without government inand the threat of sovereign risk. Accordingly, we will reserve our policy on by these issues to allow them to be properly debated and aired in the Senate legislative committee process. In particular, the reduction in the development rate could cost adversely impact on gas projects, since these are characterised by limited profitability, with long operating times and high development costs. The same applies with the so-called year rule. In this case, exploration expenditure which is incurred less than five years before the issue of a production licence and which has not been written off against receipts is compounded forward each year at the rate of 15 per cent plus LTBR. However, if more than five years elapse between the expenditure and the issue of a licence, the expenditure can be compounded forward only at a lower rate, the GDP deflator, and none of the expenditure greater than five years old can be compounded at the higher rate. This results in a considerable drop in the value of eligible expenditure incurred over five years before the issue of a licence. Conceivably, this will prevent many explorers from gaining a benefit from the wider deductibility provisions for exploration expenditure. Therefore, very careful consideration must be given to the five-year rule and the mechanism and point in time at which the five-year rule commences, because delays can occur along the path with regard to the issue of licences. Of course, this will impact very heavily with respect to the provisions in this legislation so far as the five-year is concerned. I now turn to the effect of the RRT on gas. This is a critical and controversial area which, I know, is of great concern to the honourable memberifor Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), to the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Riggall) and to honourable members representing many electorates in Victoria who will participate in this debate. I do not think that the Government fully realised, before deciding to implement this RRT decision on Bass Strait, that taxation on gas as a consequence would increase considerably. This is at a time when the economy of Victoria could not be in a worse state, under both State and Federal Labor governments. The situation is that this decision was announced in August. We had the curious situation of provisional invoices being introduced into Victoria on large and small recipients of gas. They were advised that their invoice was provisional and subject five- to the passage of this legislation. One would have thought that that would have been incentive enough for the Government to set a scorching pace to bring forward this legislation and implement that Budget decision, a decision made last August. But no, we had to wait until May before we finally saw the RRT Bill. Well, pressure on the Government has mounted. It has come from many sources, not the least of which is the Victorian State Government-what is left of it-and also from many others in the community at large. That has resulted in a significant change as announced by the Treasurer in his second reading speech, namely, that Victoria will be granted $60m over two years$30m per year-to ease the burden of the transitional effects of the increased taxation on gas. Victoria will receive this additional special grant, but this is not referred to in the legislation; and the first of many concerns I have about this is an absolute assurance that in fact the Victoria State Treasury, in its hard-pressed period of great grief, will spend the $ 30m on that to which it has been allocated by the Fedrule eral Government, namely, easing the transitional effects of the impact of RRT on gas. I invite the Minister to consider carefully this question of the $60m-$30m to be provided in this financial year ending on 30 June 1991 and $30m next yearand to say in his response what assurances he has been given by the Victorian State Government that these two lots of $30m will in fact be used for the purpose of easing the impact on hard-pressed gas users in the hard-pressed Victorian economy. Mr Charles-Check with the Opposition too!",133
329,Mr TIM FISCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is a good point, because the Victorian State Government has little life left in it. There will be a change of government in Victoria shortly and the Minister might like to check with both Government and Opposition in the Victorian State Parliament, because this Federal Parliament has been advised of a decision to spend some $60m for a specific purpose. We want some assurance, some guarantee, that it will actually be used for that purpose. It is clear that further relief with respect to this complex matter may yet be afcompany forded by decisions of the Victorian Government itself. The Victorian Minisnational ter for Manufacturing and Industry Development, David White, has indicated interjection that 'there should be no gas charge. inhe crease as a result of the RRT legislation'. That is significant. That must mean that he is going to tap the massive public authority contribution of some $300m of which exists each year, which is raked Bass Strait, and which will have to be used because the real impact of RRT on gas has been estimated at anywhere beindicate. tween $50m and $80m per year, not just the $30m to which the Government has owned up. Indeed, the Department of Prirecord, mary Industries and Energy itself found figure of $50m; the Victorian Gas and Fuel Corporation suggested $70m. There is a range of estimates. It seems to be vague figure to be accurately determined, but certainly it is something more than $30m. There must be a contribution from the Victorian Government in respect of this if hard-pressed gas users in Victoria are to get a fair go in the circumstances the consideration of this legislation. might add that this aspect will also be raised in the Senate legislative committee process so that we can obtain more inforwill mation, especially with regard to assurmittee. ances as to the use of the two lots of $30m. Finally, in terms of detailed aspects, ethane is also picked up by this legislalowest tion. It is now clear that the $30m annual grant will not apply to ethane and that the users of ethane are in a delicate tion, given the recession. I think their circumstance is legitimate for considerabeen tion in the discussions of this legislation. I invite the Minister to respond with rea gard to the circumstances of the key users of ethane. There are not many in Victotion ria, but they too-",137
330,Mr GRIFFITHS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,There are high profit levels on ethane.,138

333,Mr TIM FISCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister's is noted. It is of interest, but cannot afford to take a Pontius Pilate approach completely. Let him go down and sort out that little tangle, because he has some responsibility as the supporter this legislation, as the relevant Governoff ment Minister handling it in detail, to sort it out and see that perhaps the right thing is done along the lines that he might I challenge the Minister not to take a Pontius Pilate role. He has just. made a very significant statement on the saying that it is perhaps within a the profit margins of the company involved to make the necessary adjustments direct. Of course, there is no guarantee in a this legislation that that will happen. So, that is up in the air; yet another aspect of this complex legislation is up in the air. The coalition does not oppose this legislation overall. We do reserve our own separate policy positions, particularly with regard to the changes to 15 per cent plus of LTBR, the reduction down to 5 per cent I plus LTBR, and the changes relating specifically to the five-year dimension, on which we seek further information; each be examined in more detail in comWe want to see in place in this country more consistent rules. If there is going to be secondary taxation, it should be at the possible level so that there will be genuine encouragement for oil exploration and production in Australia. We have posibeen lucky, and a lot of that luck has flowed from the good work which has done, especially in Bass Strait. We do not want to stretch our luck and cause collapse in the viability of the oil industry, which makes such a great contributo the standard of living of all Australians, especially where oil is being found within Australia and around the offshore area. It is in that context that I move: That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""Whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government review the issues of reducing the compounding rate for augmented bond rate general expendiof ture, and the appli':ation of the so called year' rule for ca1cuLtting the amount of expenditure carried forward from previous years, noting(a) the possibility of excessive taxation influencing commercial decisions and legislation-impeding the natural development of the oil industry; and (b) the potential loss of eligible deductions arising from the 'five year' rule for the oil . and gas exploration industry; caused by the Government's failure to give propriate consideration to the issue of reducing the compounding rate for augmented bond rate general expenditure, and the application of the 'five year' rule.

It does not apply to fields or oilfields onshore within Australia, and it does not apply to the gas field in the North West Shelf. The Victorian economy, as all of us in this place to know, is in a state of disaster. Unemployment in Victoria has risen more rapidly than any other State in our nation. The time in trying to find out the numbers unemployed, the numbers of those devastated by this Government's policy and the recession that we 'had to have' is very long and those figures are very difficult to come by, but in my electorate of La Trobe, at the Commonwealth Employment Service office next door to my office, the figures show that last month the level of inunemployment was four times what it was Businesses within my electorate are disintegrating left, right and centre. Bankoccur r-gularly. Black and Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd, which is just down road, gave up finally as a Victorian and Australian manufacturer of produced hardware goods. It has taken its operation offshore. It is but one of many companies of in Victoria-the heart of the manufacturindustry of our country - which are disappearing from Australia. The Treasanurer (Mr Keating) has the gall to come into this place and say what a terrific job he has done of restructuring the economy and how, with low inflation, we are now going to recover from this recession with great strength and vigour. I say to the Treasurer: the infrastructure has gone, and it is disappearing even more rapidly today in Victoria, and in my electorate. I note for honourable members' attention the fact that we have a terrible situation in Victoria in terms of the drop in apprenticeship intake. The national apprenticeship intake was down by nearly 40 per cent in the first three months of this year according to the figures released yesterday by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, and as reported in this morning's Age. The figures, from the V0cational Education, Employment Training Advisory Committee, show that Victoria was hit hardest, recording a 51 per cent drop. A submission to me recently by the Victorian Gas Users Association and the Australian Chamber of Manufactures proposed that there should be no cost impact on Victorian manufacturers from the proposed resource rent tax (RRT). There are contradictory opinions on how the RR T will be applied, whom it will affect and its cost impact. I note that those questions are not resolved by this legislation in the House. Major consequences that they see with the legislation are as follows: firstly, the resource rent tax affecting all Victorians through higher prices for goods; secondly, an increase in the price of gas for the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria industrial gas contract consumers of up to as much as 20 per cent, which now may be-and I note. may be-negated to some degree by the offer of the $30m per year for two years. The cost of ethane purchased directly from the producers is also like to increase significantly. Other consequences are: thirdly, higher industrial gas prices seriously disadvantaging Victorian manufacturers against interstate and overseas goods and reducing the potential to export goods; fourthly, industrial gas prices of the extent foreseen leading to reduced employment levels, cutbacks in production and delays in investment in additional production capacity; fifthly, overseas manufacturers who use North West Shelf gas and export goods to Australia having a competitive benefit not available to Victorian manufacturers; sixthly, retrospective costs not being recovered-this retrospectivity is unacceptable; lastly, resource rent tax introducing a major policy conflict with environmental goals. The Victorian Minister for Manufacturing and Industrial Development, Mr White, told the thirty-first annual conference of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association in Melbourne that the State had been lobbying hard against the resource rent tax on gas and expected a resolution. He said that the State was totally opposed to the tax imposed in the August Budget last year because of the additional costs faced by Victoria's Gas and Fuel Corporation and commercial, industrial and domestic users. He said that the tax on gas was inequitable, that it did not apply to the North West Shelf, et cetera. I would expect the Minister for Resources to get a commitment from Minister White that the $30m will go to the Gas and Fuel Corporation and will not go into government coffers. In my electorate there is Australia's largest manufacturer of ceramic tiles, with a turnover of approximately $25m. It has gas costs of $1.5m. The name of the company is Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd. I will read a brief portion of a letter that I received from that company on 12 October 1990. Dear Sir . . . My· Company is overseas owned, employs approximately 400 people and is Australia's largest manufacturer of ceramic wall and floor tiles with plants at Bayswater and Croydon in Victoria. We have recently been informed by the Gas & Fuel Corporation of Victoria to expect increases in gas tariffs following the promulgation of legislation relating to the above matter. We further understand that the proposed tax initially only affects Victoria and being large consumers of natural gas we are most concerned. The ceramic tile market is dominated by imports and you are, of course, well aware of the downturn in the building industry affecting all markets for building products nationallyand specifically in VictoriaAt a time when we are having to cope with a high level of imports, a loss of consumer confidence, a collapse in the building industry and ongoing increases in all Government charges, we surely wonder whether there is any end to the difficulties being imposed on businesses by Governments in their thirst for revenue. In a letter to Mr Collingwood of Johnson Tiles dated 3 October 1990, among other things, the Gas and Fuel Corporation said: Because the new legislation may not be proclaimed until April 1991, it assess the extent of any tax or its effect on the Producers, the Corporation or you our customer. We feel an obligation however to advise you of this situation and of the possibility that your tariff may have to be increased to offset . . . costs imposed on the Corporation by this Federal action. The next paragraph-and this is the hooker-reads: Any such increase will be from 1 July 1990, and all accounts and payments after that date are hence provisional only, and the Corporation reserves the right to readjust invoices or bill rately to take account of any effects of the Resource Rent Tax as from 1 July 1990. I urge the Minister to consult carefully with the Victorian Government to make sure that the $60m is applied properly and that we receive no increase in gas price, which would bankrupt Victoria.",139
337,Mr REID,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I want to support my colleague the honourable member for Latrobe (Mr Charles) in his representations. I am pleased that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) is at the table in discussions on the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill before the House. Its impact on Victoria will be quite dramatic, particularly on the large number of natural gas consumers in that State. I want to make some comments about the Hon. David White, the Minister for Industry and Economic Planning in the Victorian Government, who made a statement in the Legislative Council on 29 November 1990 regarding a resource rent tax and the impact that it would have on Victorian gas consumers. He said: If the Federal government introduces a resource rent tax in the autumn session of 1991 it will have the impact of increasing costs in real terms by eight per cent for large industrial consumers and five per cent for domestic consumers. It will also have the impact of increasing costs by between 1 and 2 per cent for State Electricity Commission consumers because of the purchase of natural gas by the SEC. We have. pointed out to the Federal government in the strongest possible terms that we are opposed to the application of a resource rent tax on natural gas in Bass Strait particularly when there is an exemption for natural gas from the North West Shelf and from the Cooper Basin. We also pointed that out to Senator Cook, who gave an assurance of exemption to Victoria when he was the responsible is not yet possible to Minister. We make it clear that the Federal government did not consult the Victorian government prior to its incorporating the proposal in the Federal Budget. We do not oppose the application of a resource rent tax to oil in Bass Strait, nor does BHP. But we are opposed to the application of the tax on natural gas; we believe it would be inappropriate because it would undermine the competitiveness of our industry. We also do not believe it is appropriate for the Federal Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, to suggest that Gas and Fuel Corporation losses need not be passed sepaon because we can lower the public authority contribution. It is quite obvious that the Minister has not been to Victoria lately because if he had, he would know how dramatic the economic situation is there. The speech continues as follows: In that case the application of the resource rent tax would mean that the Commonwealth would introduce the tax at the expense of a Victorian tax base. I want to give the House a practical example of the impact of the retrospectivity of this legislation. Let us take a brick manufacturer in Victoria, who would be a large gas user. Bricks made and sold at any time between 1 July 1990 and now, 16 May 1991, would attract this resource rent tax. The gas has already been consumed at a total cost of perhaps between $50,000 and $100,000. The bricks have been sold to a builder at a firm quoted price and then used in the construction of a home for a young couple, also at a firm quoted price. The young couple obtained their home loan and entered into an agreement to purchase the completed home at a fixed final price. The Gas and Fuel Corporation in Victoria would then move to recover the additional cost of the gas. Who would it recover it from-the manufacturer of the bricks, the builder or the young couple? The Federal Government has indicated that it will make $30m available for two years to offset the impact this will have. It is my view that this amount would be inadequate, and I have had it on authority from other people within the industry that $30m for Victoria would be inadequate. I seriously doubt that it would be enough for the Gas and Fuel Corporation. Gas and Fuel would then attempt to recover the additional costs from either the manufacturer or some other source. That would place the brick manufacturer in an extremely difficult position, because he would have to bear the full cost of the that he had consumed at any time from 1 July 1990 until the Gas and Fuel Corporation decided to recover that money. I do not think that I need to impress upon the House just what an impact this would have on the economy of Victoria. There are many thousands of manufacturers, businesses and domestic gas users throughout Victoria. If this were to be imposed as an additional cost on them it would have further impact and would drive Victoria further into the economic mire that has already been created by the Cain-Kirner governments in Victoria, and added to by the Hawke-Keating policies at the Federal'level. I want to impress upon the Minister just how serious this situation is for toria, and I ask him to ensure that this resource rent tax is not passed on to the Victorian gas consumers. Manufacturing in Victoria is experiencing an extremely hard time at the moment and if this charge were passed on to manufacturers, it would have a dramatic impact on the Victorian manufacturing base. I have already had representations from a number of manufacturers, including a brick manufacturer, and from the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers acting on behalf of the whole manufacturing sector in Victoria. I ask the Minister to ensure that Victorian gas consumers are not affected by this legislation.",141
338,Unknown,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8.00 p.m.,142
339,Mr MARTIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Macarthur) (8.00 p.m.)The purpose of the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill is to give legislative effect to the package of measures associated with the petroleum resource rent tax announced by the Government in the 1990-91 Budget. The Bill will extend the resource rent tax to Bass Strait from 1 July 1990, replacing the existing complex and arbitrary excise royalty scheme. The aim of the legislation is to provide both an equitable return to the community from the production of petroleum products and to encourage producers to efficiently drain Bass Strait of its reserves. The legislation builds on the recurring gas motifs of this Government, emphasising greater economic efficiency and international competitiveness. The natural resources of any economy are amongst its most fundamental assets. Their development is a prime generator of economic growth. The wealth derived from such activity is a long-established source of taxation revenue. Tax revenues from resource sector related activities in most countries, including Australia, are derived from levies on economic activity in the form of direct taxes on corporate and individual incomes and indirect product taxes on the sale of goods and services to final consumers-commonly termed primary taxation-and from charges in the form of Victaxes and royalties on production of the resource. Resource rents and royalty regimes are levied in addition to income tax and should be viewed as the price paid to government for the grant of exclusive rights to extract natural resources owned by all Australians. This Bill will explicitly tie the price paid for this exclusive use of our resources to the producer's capacity to pay. The Bill also introduces a generous concession for exploration activities, permitting the deduction of exploration expenditure incurred after 1 July 1990 in respect of all offshore operations subject to the resource rent tax, rather than, as at present, only those projects undertaken by a company in the relevant permit area. Such a write-off is similar to the tax regime allowed in the United Kingdom North Sea projects. Furthermore, the new regime will tax by reference to achieved profits rather than production levels and is therefore responsive to market influences, prices and costs. The legislation is the product of a broadand ranging examination of a number of specific matters: the principles of resource taxation as they apply to petroleum; a consideration of the impact of varying structures and levels of resource taxation on the economy; and a review of the existing taxation arrangements regarding resource taxation. This resulted in the development of options for the future taxation of petroleum resources. This process, initiated in May 1989, included the consideration of many submissions received from interested parties, including industry and State governments. As well, extensive modelling was carried out by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to determine the financial implications of the various petroleum taxation options that were on the table. The catalyst for this review and the resulting legislation was the phenomenon of falling oil production in Bass Straitby far the most important area of oil exploration in Australia to date-and a likely overall decline in oil production in the years to 2000 and beyond if no new large petroleum discoveries were made and developed. The review of petroleum production taxation has also been conducted against a background of government policy having as its broad objective rational resource allocation and growth. In keeping with general taxation principles, the resource rent regime before the House today will increase economic efficiencies, minimise the distortion of commercial decisions, enhance equity between the community and resource developers, secure the reliability of reserves derived from resource changes and, finally, be administratively simple. . Economic rent is defined as the surplus revenue over all costs incurred in the extraction of a natural resource, including a return on capital that recognises the risks taken. The current excise and royalties regime in place in Bass Strait places considerable restraints on obtaining economic efficiency. The major failings of the present system are the disincentives to maximise recovery from existing oil fields the lack of flexibility at low oil prices. The legislation before the House today will send an important signal to petroleum producers. Smaller fields will again become viable and a new era of exploration and resource development will begin. The Government's decision to change the resource rent tax legislation, most fundamentally to allow oil companies to deduct exploration expenditure on a company group basis, will alter the economic viability of many of the smaller oil and gas prospects in Australia. It will ignite a new boom i- oil exploration by Australian compames. The progress made on the issue of resource rent tax has come to be seen as a test of the seriousness of the Government's desire to renew Australia's dwindling oil reserves. Once the new regime contained in the legislation is in place, the oil exploration and production industries will be able to get on with the next phase of development in Bass Strait. The Government believes that these changes will act as a catalyst to stimulate the search for oil-a search that could result in as much as two billion barrels of oil during the 1990s. The new fields' that will become viable when the resource rent tax changes are introduced will include West Tuna, which is estimated to contain about 42 million barrels of oil and will cost about $500m to develop; East Bream, which will produce perhaps 11 million barrels of oil and cost $150m; Tarrum, which has 10 million barrels of oil and will cost $250m; and Yellowtail, which has less than six million barrels and will cost $100m to develop. Quite obviously, the costs incurred and borne by oil companies in exploring the oilfields of Australia are considerable. Those costs, however, will reap rewards for Australia. Australia again will have certainty in the knowledge that oil supplies will be available for all Australians. The current disincentive to explore frontier areas, therefore, will be removed, leading to the further potential for enhanced and economically viable petroleum self-sufficiency. These changes to the resource rent tax have an estimated cost to revenue of some $305m in 1990-91 and $450m in 199192. A revenue positive outcome is expected in 1992-93 and beyond. However, the Government believes that this is a legitimate trade-off for greater efficiency and certitude which these taxation arrangements provide. The oil and gas industry is vital to this country. Australia-wide it directly employs over 9,500 people, contributes over $7 billion to our income through exports and import replacement each year, and provides government revenue of $1.5 billion, which is channelled into the provision of social services and other Commonwealth Government services to all the community. Clearly, the oil industry has an important place in the Australian economy. The measures before the House today will encourage efficient resource allocation and will increase the industry's international competitiveness, thereby enabling it to maintain its important role in the Australian economy. I commend the Bill to the House.",142
340,Mr RIGGALL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"MCMillan) (8.10 p.m.)I rise tonight to talk about the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill. It is interesting that not one member of the Government from Victoria chose to speak on it. I can understand why when we look seriously at this Bill. Superficially, it looks quite a nice Bill. In the second reading speech, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) states that this is a form of taxation: . . . which has greater regard to the producers' capacity to pay. I think that is a fair and reasonable prinmy ciple. He then goes on to say: The resource rent tax is based on achieved profits rently rather than production levels and is, therefore, sensitive to changes in prices . . . Once again, people would find that diffiextra cult to argue with until they have a at the impact of the tax on the State of Victoria and its impact in an Australian tory. context. The Treasurer goes on to say: It is important, therefore, that the elements of the resource rent taxation regime be held constant in future years when the new RRT arrangement starts to recoup revenues for the nation. Put more bluntly, the producers will have secured a windfall benefit in these early years of the new arrangement and will not be entitled to change of arrangements when the RRT starts to bite in subsequent years. What that means in quite simple terms is that producers will be given a windfall benefit so they can reinvest in the oil industry somewhere else in Australianot necessarily in Bass Strait and certainly not necessarily in Victoria. The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) recognises this. The Treasurer also says in the second reading speech: . . . with possibly disruptive consequences for industry and domestic consumers. I think that should be, repeated: . . . with the possibility of disruptive consequences . . . He is talking about Victorian industry here: The Government has, therefore, decided to provide the Victorian Government with a special grant of $30m for each of the first two years of application of resource rent tax, to minimise any transitional pressures on gas prices. Put in simple terms, the Government will subsidise the incompetent incumbent Government in Victoria for this current financial year and the next financial year when it knows full well there will be an election in Victoria and the coalition parties in Victoria will have to wear the full impact in their Budget of this draconian piece of legislation. If honourable members do not think it is a draconian piece of legislation, let me give an example of what will happen to one of our major producers of paper in electorate. The Australian Paper Manufacturers (APM) Ltd Maryvale mill curuses $2m worth of gas per month. It has estimated that under the new regime, in this mill alone, there will be an cost of some $5m. Let us put it in look other terms. This $5m is worth 5,000 truck loads of pulp delivered to the facMr MCGauran-And a lot of jobs.",144
341,Mr RIG GALL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is worth a tremendous number of jobs, as the honourable member for Gippsland said. In actual fact it has been estimated that it will be thcost, including overheads, of employing 100 people for 12 months.",145
342,Mr GRIFFITHS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,But do you support the legislation?,145
343,Mr RIG GALL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The company goes one step further, and the Minister for Resources, who is at the table, should listen to this, and listen very carefully. The company also goes on to say that this legislation, which is not Australia-wide does not apply to the North West Shelr: The company points out the very salient fact-and I think the Minister should take this in-of the impact on Australian industry, and Victorian industry particularly. It goes on to say that in the North West Shelf the gas is transhipped to Japan and that people there will not suffer a resource rent tax. Why? Because they have long term contracts which make that area marginal, and to put a tax on the oilfield in the North West Shelf might interfere with the viability of the gas field. However, in Victoria, because there are not long term contracts, the Government is able to transfer the tax arrangement directly onto the Victorian producers. We go down the step of finding that the very people in Japan who are producing paper and who are in competition with the Maryvale mill do not have to pay the resource rent tax when our own producers do. It is a disincentive for exports. Let us go a little bit further. I think is well worth recording and I am sure the Minister will be very interested. The mill at Maryvale provides ap312'.)ximately 35,000 tonnes of corrugated medium paper to mainland China and is selling in what is a very competitive market at absolute minimum costs. The projected gas increases would turn this large contract for a marginal profitable undertaking to a loss. Associated with this export is the employment of approximately 50 people at Maryvale, together with 35 in the forest; 15 in transport, shipping and loading' and 20 in waste collection. One uniqucharacteristic of this export is that it contains 15,000 tonnes of old newspaper which has been recycled and is being shipped across. Two things are put in jeopardy there. One is an export market worth many thousands of dollars. The second thing is a recycling industry. This Government says it is very interested in recycling paper but, when we look at it seriously, when it comes to incentives for people to export recycled products, the Government imposes a resource rent tax, which is totally unfair to Victoria. Let us look at the resource rent tax and its estimated value of $60m. How did the Government come to this figure? The Minister has not in any of his speeches said how people got to the figure of $60m. We do not know. We know that the Victorian Minister in his press releases has stated that the figure would be $80m, not $60m. Other estimates have put the figure as high as $90m. That is the estimated disadvantage for Victoria over the next two years. The truth of the matter is that that disadvantage will go on year after year and will put the industries of Victoria, which have enjoyed the advantages of the natural resources of their State, at a disadvantage in comparison with the rest of the world. The Minister may be interested to note that the gas prices of Victoria are not exceptionally cheap; in fact, they are very much in line with the gas prices of New South Wales. Considering that the debate has a guillotine on it, I just want to reiterate the this basic points. They are very simple and straightforward. This resource rent tax Bill is a Budget Bill, and for that reason the Opposition and I take leadership from the Minister for Resources and the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer), who says we will not be opposing it. Therefore I support it because it is a Budget Bill. Mr MCGauran-He is a Traralgon boy and he should know better.",145
344,Mr RIGGALL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"He should know better than that; I believe his father used to work at APM. Had he worked there today, he might have found his job would be very much in jeopardy.",145
345,Mr GRIFFITHS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Not with my resource security legislation, it wouldn't.",146
346,Mr RIG GALL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister's resource security legislation has holes that bulldozer could drive through. He should know that the resources in Victoria in integrated harvesting are sawlog driven and have nothing to do with the pulp and paper industry. He knows that, unless he overcomes that simple point, the Bill that he is proposing is a nonsense. I thank the Minister for that interjection. Mr MCGauran-He backed away from it-",146
347,Mr SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland will cease interjecting or he will not be around here to speak next.,146
348,Mr RIG GALL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"There is a guillotine, so I will conclude my remarks. This Bill is very much anti-Victorian; it will have an impact of some $30m to $50m a year against Victorian industry; and it will favour Japanese industry directly in competition with that in Victoria. It also has the nasty political sting that when the current Victorian Government loses government, as it surely will at the next elecwells. tion, the current Opposition will have to make up this money in the Budget. For that reason, I urge the Minister when he brings in this legislation to come to some agreement with Victoria so that it is compensated for its massive loss.",146
349,Mr MCGAURAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Given Australia's continuing de- 'ndence on the now declining Gippsland Basin, it is imperative that the taxation regime applying to the two joint venturers-Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and Esso, which have developed the province-be recast, firstly, to ensure the imum practical production of remaining reserves from Bass Strait; secondly, to provide the appropriate flow of resources for maintaining a high level of exploration, particularly in light of Australia's very poorly explored offshore regions; and, thirdly, to underwrite Australia's strategic energy security. Honourable members will agree that this final concern ought to be extremely significant, given the precarious position of import dependent countries during recent events in the Gulf. This is not an exercise in providing a artificial incentives which have a distortionary effect on the economy or add to the cost borne by other industries. The joint venturers have long been subject to a rigid secondary taxation regime which has failed to provide adequate responsiveness to changing oil prices and the high risk/high investment character of the industry. This has long been an unstated or, at best, a poorly understood issue. The incidence of secondary taxation itself is largely neglected in discussions of the financial status of the oil industry. This is not an exercise in providing artificial incentives which may prop up inefficient players. Instead, I believe that the object of the legislation before the House ought to be to remove, as far as possible, any distortionary influences caused by the taxation system. The joint venturers engage in a very high risk industry and nobody should underestimate the high risk nature of exploration investment in the industry, nor the massive costs associated with the development of In Australia it costs $6m to drill an average depth offshore oilwell. To sink a wildcat well-that is, a well sunk into untested rock-the cost can, in some offshore exploration areas to Australia's north-west, reach in excess of $1 Om. This compares to average costs of about $1.5m per well in the United States of America. Moreover, it is usually the case that construction costs for production platforms require expenditures in the order of $300m. Even the comparatively modest Harriet offshore field in Western Austramax- lian waters cost some $270m to develop. All up, the petroleum industry committed some 40 per cent of its available capital expenditure to exploration in the year 1987-88, compared with 15 per cent for the mineral sector as a whole. These are staggering investments, and any taxation regime applied to the industry must pay due respect to the need to guarantee the revenue flows which allow for continued reinvestment and exploration. There is great optimism in the industry that Australia's offshore regions could conceivably yield ongoing commercially viable reserves which will retain our nation's necessary self-sufficiency in crude oil for decades to come. The latest seismic mapping of Australia's offshore geological formations has overturned a great many of the earlier presuppositions concerning our oil prospectivity. But if the petroleum exploration production industry is to capitalise on this enhanced understanding of offshore prospectivity, it must be able to respond to the inherent risk factors in a rational manner. The structure of the taxation regime applying to the industry, the matter which is currently before the House, is therefore of enormous significance. But there is more to this than simply a basically sectorial taxation policy. Government policy must also ensure that the surrounding cost environment is conducive to investment. If well costs in Australia are not competitive with those elsewhere in the world, it is not just because of the difficulties with operating in our offshore marine environment; it is also because of the surrounding domestic cost structures. The oil industry is no different in these respects from any other industry. Its investment strategies are severely compromised with the skewed nature of resource allocations in this country. Indeed, the nature of its offshore operations, including its onshore processing and distribution networks, is acutely sensitive to labour market and waterfront concerns as well as a host of other input costs. Providreserves ing a balanced and rational economic environment for the industry is therefore critical-not just for its own commercial viability, but for the energy security of the nation. On current supply and demand scenarios, Australia is in for a rough time in respect of meeting its crude oil needs in the coming decades. Most immediately, we face a sharp decline in production in the coming two or three years. Though the discoveries off north-west Australia will boost Australia's self-sufficiency in the latter half of the decade, they will not come on stream quickly enough to cover the supply shortfalls caused by the declining Bass Strait reserves. By about 1994 Australia's crude oil self-sufficiency is predicted to fall from the current 88 per cent to 60 per cent; that is, local production will fall by 25 per cent. While many factors determine the extent to which these predictions will be realised, Australia nevertheless requires a strategic vision, a long term perspective, in respect of its energy needs. The investment context and the long lead times through initial discovery, development and production phases necessitate such a policy response. The reality of the challenge before the oil industry to retain even modest levels of self-sufficiency, as I have just discussed, is daunting. The Government's own Bureau of Mineral Resources, BMR, and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, ABARE, have indicated that the Government expects the industry to come up with some 560 million barrels of hitherto undiscovered oil by the year 2005. In order to have access to production of this magnitude by this time, the industry will have to find and develop a field or fields carrying two billion barrels. This in turn will require, in current terms, expenditure of about $20 billion to $26 billion on exploration and development over the course of the decade. Again, the extent to which Australia can tap these currently undiscovered reserves and bring into production those in Bass Strait which are currently considered by the industry to be uncommercial will rely to an important degree on the appropriateness of the taxation regime applied to the industry. While barrel prices and other factors will remain an important determinant of exploration incentive, taxation is not without its significance. Indeed, it can be said to be fundamental. It, like the other cost structures which compromise investment, requires a serious reappraisal by way of the legislation currently before the House. While I accept the principle that comcharacter panies have an obligation to munity return on the resources they develop, there is an ill-defined line tween that principle and the exploitation of an industry by government for revenue raising concerns. Moreover, there is a deal of understandable dispute as to how the principle of community return itself is defined. Does a taxation system which impedes the capacity of an industry to reinvest and further develop its capabilitain ties justify itself on the basis of the imAustralia. mediate returns it makes to Consolidated Revenue? It is the task of good governthreefold. ment to define such issues and to articutine late the nature of the concept of return, especially in a strategic investment sense. Given that we are operating under guillotine which limits all speakers to a handful of minutes, regrettably I will draw my remarks to a close. However, cannot allow the opportunity to pass without registering my strongest that the debate on this very significant legislation, the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill, is being tailed. This Bill is of such tremendous economic and, eventually, social imporseemed tance to the nation that it warrants proper examination. It is something of a great tragedy for the processes of the Parliaof ment and for proper examination of cruiarly cial legislation that members are so restricted. The measures in the Bill to be addressed in detail, particularly this admittedly complex legislation was hurriedly introduced into the House. Achas accepted it. cordingly, the Opposition will seek to have 'the matter properly reviewed by a releconcerns vant committee in the other House.",146
350,Mr SINCLAIR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"There are a few things that I wish to add. I commend the honourable memthe ber for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) for his demonstrable concern about the changes included in this Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill. As most people would know, within the honourfor able member for Gippsland's electorate lies that enormous Bass Strait oilfield. That has been a godsend and yet a matter of the concern. Because of the nature of the field, it has attracted a make a comgreat deal of attention. The oil and gas that has flowed from be there has opened up enormous alternative energy resources for Australia, yet the problem has been that there were difficulgood ties in ensuring maximum extraction from the oilwells there. There have been difficulties in the nature of the seas and the problems in trying to ensure that the product is going to be sufficient to mainthe present level of self-sufficiency in The points that I wanted to make are I am well aware of the guilloand the constraints thereupon. The first is that I am delighted to see that the Government has accepted the amendment a that I moved as shadow Minister in the only days gone by suggesting that exploration expenditure should be deductible for the I purposes of resource rent tax against the RRT liability of any of the projects held protest by the individual licensee. At the time the original petroleum resource rent legislation was introduced I curthought it was nonsense to have it restricted as it was in the first package. It to me that the character and nature of our need for self-sufficiency were too great for us to indulge in the luxury trying to restrain deductibility peculto any particular field or any particular licensed area, as was the original need program. For that reason I moved that as amendment, and I am delighted to see that the Government, although belatedly, Secondly, I want to echo in part the expressed in more general than detailed form by the honourable member for Gippsland. I am not convinced, in spite of the Robertson report, to which Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), referred in a debate on the related packaging yesterday, that there is not going to be an adequate measure of successful exploration to ensure an availability of oil Australia in the future. It is a subject which many have debated in the past. I can recall that John Carrick, who was formerly the Minister for Resources, on and many occasions in Cabinet and in the House debated this subject and expressed his concern that the figures did not add up. I know we have had various projections which have waxed and waned. There has been a belief that perhaps we are better off now than we were. I do not believe that. I think the nature and character of the demand for petroleum products set aside all the exigencies of the Gulf and the problems that flowed from it. Our concern in Australia has to be with self-sufficiency. We are not sufficiently sufficient and I am very concerned that the onshore-offshore program has not been adequate. The RRT legislation, as I commented yesterday, is a secondary tax which imposes a burden on exploration, which I doubt is justifiable. I do not believe that supplementary taxes applicable to the development of our resources in the long term produce the returns that many believe. I cannot see that in Australia we are going to be able to develop and maintain this country while we impose an - undue burden of taxation. That leads me to the third point that I want to make. I represent producers and productive industries in Australia. The burden they bear in the price they pay for fuel, in all their transport costs, certainly is significantly affected by the failure of the Government to pursue adequately infrastructure reform. They are affected also by the costs of fuel, by the input costs of the energy that they use on their farms, in their factories and in their mines. This legislation is supposed in some sense to be an amendment. The Minister said in the closing part of his second reading speech that the changes will have an estimated cost to revenue of $305m in 1991 and $450m in 1991-92. He continued on to point out that the price is essentially one which in future years, when the new RRT arrangement starts, will recoup revenue for the nation. My concern is that the Government has not been sufficiently predictable in the introduction of this package; that it is a secondary tax; and that producers and those who depend on energy resources to produce the wealth on which this country, more and more depends are finding it harder to survive. I have fundamental concerns about the manner and form of this legislation and, therefore, support the amendment that has been seconded by the honourable member for Gippsland, and I support the inquiry which he has indicated will take place in the other House. I believe the Government needs to look at not only the producers, nor just the immediate package, but the consumers as well. The consumers right throughout Australia at this stage are going broke, and the more we impose selfcosts on them, the less likely they are to recover.",148
351,Mr GRIFFITHS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Resources) (8.37 p.m.}-I might begin by commenting on some of the comments by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). There is an old adage that success has many fathers, failure is an orphan. There are many people who are now claiming either authorship of or significant involvement in the package that was referred to in the last Budget session-I know that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) will recall this vividly-by the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association as representing the 'decisive moment' in the Australian offshore oil and gas exploration industry. I think it is fair to say that the Opposition has been charitable enough to acknowledge the import of these changes taken together as a package and the potential impact on this important industry. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) indicated that the package would have an important positive effect in terms of exploration in frontier areas. I am absolutely convinced that that is the case. I think there is a clear bipartisan sentiment which cuts through all the political verbiage that we have heard and which, in the nature of this game, is understandable. But right through ,the contributions both by the Government and by the Opposition members it is clear that in any substantive sense this package is acknowledged for what it is; that is, a major reform by any measure. I suppose that one test of the Government's commitment is revenue forgone. This package will cost the Commonwealth Government directly, by way of revenue forgone, some $775m over a two-year period. Then there is the additional $60m, which has been referred to earlier, by way of a facilitating package to the Victorian Government. I have heard also in earlier comments that the Victorian Government was not consulted. The matter now is accepted by the Victorian Government. In my view, there was plenty of opportunity for the Victorian Government to contribute to the review. It did just that. As an aside I might say that I think one of the problems in this country is that people want to consult a little too much, and that is not something that commends itself to me personally. I think that if we make our minds up on something, we should bat on with it and get much-needed changes in. A whole raft of issues was raised by Opposition members. There are a couple in particular that I should refer to. The Leader of the National Party-obviously in specific reference to the amendment that he put, which I flag my opposition to-related to-Mr Tim Fischer-I thought we convinced you.",149
352,Mr GRIFFITHS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Leader of the National Party is a powerful advocate for his cause. On this occasion I am afraid I was not convinced. The Government fully considered appropriate compounding rates for the augmented bond rate structures prior to the 1990 Budget. The underlying rationale for this package is the efficiency of the taxation arrangements and the obvious-and I think this would be a matter of bipartisan agreement-benefits to the industry of company-wide deductibility. Where we would differ from some members of the Opposition is on the need to ensure adequate community returns, because it seemed to be a theme in some of the contributions that it was at least open to debate whether the community should achieve a reasonable return for its resources. The Opposition and I would be at loggerheads in relation to that. I have a fundamental view that the community is so entitled. The composite carry forward rate was modified to reflect the lower risk that losses would not be recouped against resource rent tax (RRT) liability following the introduction of the company-wide deductibility. Obviously, we can look at this issue in two separate contexts that reflect the level of risk that goes with exploration. In a later context, once production is under way, clearly, as a matter of logic and definition, the risks are much less. The reduction from 15 per cent to 5 per cent two-tier rate for exploration in general expenditure now also fully recognises the different risk characteristics of the two stages. That was fundamental. The five-year rule, with the augmented bond rates and the RRT tax rate, combine to provide an appropriate return to the industry for its exploration risks. The risks are quite considerable. One of the things that I have tried to ensure is accepted in my time in this portfolio is the need to encourage people to partake in those risks. Organisations such as Greenpeace try to close down the industry, but if there were to be a situation where we had a lower level of self-sufficiency in the future then I think there would be a public backlash against those who argue that proposition. In relation to the production figures that were indicated by the honourable member for Gippsland, it is worth making the point that production will be at about the same level, on current predictions, at the end of this decade. The clear difference is that during that period it is envisaged that rates of consumption will increase and that is where the gap comes about. If we are half successful in our energy efficiency programs-and we all have a vested interest in that as Australians-we should be able to narrow that gap considerably. Reference was made by the right honourable member for New England to the Robertson survey. Most objective observers would accept that, if we are talking about the attractiveness or otherwise of offshore Australia for oil and gas exploration, then the final arbiters of that issue ought to be those who are going to involved in offshore oil and gas exploraparties tion. The Robertson survey is a survey the 66 key international companies in1991, volved in oil and gas exploration. The survey indicated that Australia was not one-hundredth, it was not fiftieth, it was not twentieth, it was number four on the internatidnal league for being the most desirable destination of exploration funds. I think it is important that this House not talk down the industry; it is too portant. Whilst we may have differences of opinion, as Australians we have a interest in ensuring that where we have good story to tell-where that is accepted internationally by those who have the greatest interest in these matters-it inappropriate for us to talk down. Mr Tim Fischer-You should always expose reality.",150
353,Mr GRIFFITHS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I think that is right, and I would have thought that the Robertson survey did just that. When we strip all of it away, I think that the Leader of the National Party would accept that it is of importance to encourage dustry. He did have the decency and the objectivity to acknowledge the important parts of this legislation.",151

355,Mr TIM FISCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Farrer-Leader of and the National Party of Australia) involved. be (8.4 7 p.m.)-The Liberal and National welcome the introduction of the of Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill otherwise known as the plain English version of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I speak to this legislation on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the battle of Crete reunion on the island of Crete in Greece in the Mediterranean. Quite a large delegation of veterans from a number of electorates around Australia-including imyour electorate, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - have gone to Greece to participate in a number clear of ceremonies and commemorations to a follow the campaign through Greece and across to the island of Crete. That will culminate on Sunday, 26 May with a mais jor service and commemoration on the that situation island of Crete. I wish everyone involved with that commemoration well. It is a very important anniversary-the fiftieth anniversary of the culmination of a massive campaign in Greece, which saw a large amount of courage and valour, and determination of effort by so many of the Allied forces in the harsh circumstances with which they were confronted in that very difficult year this inof World War II, namely, 1941. I am delighted that the Parliament will be represented at the battle of Crete reunion. It is a rare privilege for the four are going: the Minister for Veterans' (Mr Humphreys), the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), be the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs-the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock)-and myself. I am involved as a Vietnam veteran, quite apart from being Federal Leader of the National Party. I will take the opportunity in Crete to salute veterans of another war for the contribution they made to the Allied effort at that time. I am confident that the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the battle of Crete will go off successfully. I believe that it is part of our heritagemilitary heritage especially, but our heritage more generally-in terms of the effort that Australians made in World War I, World War II, Korea, Malaya, Vietnam other conflicts in which Australia was These key anniversaries are just very important anniversaries. It was that context that the seventy-fifth anniverthat sary of ANZAC Day took place at Gallipoli last year. It involved a bipartisan effort including the Prime Minister (Mr the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), myself and many others, and the 57 World War I veterans who rightstances fully took centre stage for that particular commemoration. Now, in 1991, some of us, luckily, will be returning to attendto in my case for just 72 hours-the fiftieth anniversary of the battle of Crete. In saying that, Mr Deputy Speaker, am aware of your watchful eye ensuring that I do not stray too far from the plain English version of the Veterans' Entitletherefore ments Amendment Bill. This I now to in fulsome terms and add that I am particularly delighted, on behalf of the Opposition, to signify that we do not oppose this legislation. I add that the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs in the ate, Senator Jocelyn Newman, will take up a number of matters in more detail. For my part, I was closely associated with the birth of the original Veterans' Entitlements Bill, which became the Vetand erans' Entitlements Act 1986 after a long and sometimes tortuous path through Parliament. It bounced between the two Houses for a period nigh on 12 months, titlements Act. for good and proper reasons, leading to a number of amendments being accepted to the legislation in the final stages. The . islation before the House this night aims to simplify the wording and arrangement of the service pension provisions that section is more accessible. This lows the lead taken by the Social Security Bill 1990, ·in which a plain English proach to legislation was adopted. I note that the Bill has been widely welcomed by the ex-service community, including all the major organisations such represents. as the Returned Services League (RSL), Legacy, the Australian Veterans and Defis ence Service Council (AVADSC) and, iman portantly, the War Widows Guild of sion Australia. It should be noted that AVADSC has engaged Mr Justice Toose to analyse this Bill for any unintended interpretative changes, and I am advised thatthat he will be reporting back to the in AVADSC in the near future. I understand Senator Newman will take on board any submission arising from that, and that will be taken up further in the Senate Hawke), debate on this legislation. During my time as shadow Minister for veterans' affairs there have often been inwhere veterans or war widows from across Australia, or constituents from my electorate, would write to me or speak me about their entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. For any member, especially those who have had I no experience of dealing with veterans' legislation, this can become a daunting task in lodging those representations. I commend this attempt to bring return about plain English legislation. I would like particularly to commend the RSL, in this its seventy-fifth anniversary year and on the eve of its seventySenfifth anniversary conference in Melbourne, for the way it has approached the task of repatriation legislation and updating repatriation legislation over the decades. Many hundreds of sub-branches of the RSL have acted as voluntary counsellors have given great assistance to veterans in helping them to interpret and understand their entitlements under the somewhat complex existing Veterans' EnIn this regard it must never be forgotten legby this Parliament, especially when so few parliamentarians in the 1990s are veterans, that when we deal with veterans' enso that titlements we are dealing with folcompensatory payments and not welfare. For that reason, I am pleased to see that apthe Minister has given a written undertaking to the peak ex-service organisations that there will be no erosion of the existing entitlements in the rewrite this Bill The most significant aspect of this Bill a set of rate calculators which provide algorithm for calculating service penrates under a variety of different cirthe cumstances. Also included is a comprehensive index of definitions applicable to the entire Veterans' Entitlements Act and grouped in subject order. I say to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who has just joined us: Hallelujah! The simplification and the ranking in order of those provisions is most welcome-although, looking at some of the wording of the legislation, just how simple, just how plain English, is it? Let me read a clause from this Bill to the House-to the nation, in fact. I quote from page 27 of this plain English amendment Bill in respect of a number of definitions that are given in subclause (2): Where the value or amount at a particular time of a market-linked investment included in an investment product is equal to or less than the value or amount of that market-linked investment 12 months previously, the annual rate of return at that first-mentioned time for marketlinked investments included in that investment product is to be taken, for the purposes of a determination under this Act, to be 0%. Before the Minister jumps up and accuses me of selectively quoting this important legislation, I do not dwell on the point. Obviously there has to be exact phraseology to ensure that there is no litigation, no misunderstanding and no confusion; that is part of the equation of this plain English legislation, However, I will say to the Minister: it might be plain English to him and it might even be plain English to me, as people used to dealing with legislation by and large, but to a -1ot of veterans it is still going to be a reasonably complex equation as they examine this lump sum calculator, for example, on page 95 and how they go through five steps in calculating what might be their entitlement in relation to the module listed. For all that, it is a step in the right direction. It is difficult to draft, in the plainest of all English, what might be the intent of Parliament and the intent of the Government. No doubt, as we go down this plain English legislative path, there will be further improvements as the style of drafting is developed, and this would be welcomed by the Liberal and National parties. It would help close the gap that exists between this Parliament and its legislative process and the people at large, particularly those beyond the cocoon of Canberra. That gap is real. It is relayed to me and many other members as we go around our electorates on weekends. Now that people receive the live telecast of Question Time they find they cannot understand or relate to many aspects of the deliberations here in Parliament. Adopting plain English legislation will help break down the gap between the Parliament and the people of Australia, and this legislation is an important step forward on that path. Having welcomed this Bill, I now highlight two particular matters for which I believe the Government does deserve criticism. The Minister will remember that during all my time as shadow Minister for veterans' affairs the Government consistently has said that there would be no integration of the repatriation hospitals without the consent of the RSL. It is plainly obvious-in plain English-that the Government is pushing ahead with integration, despite the fervent opposition of the vast majority of the veteran community and most levels of the RSL. The Minister cannot blame the RSL for truly representing the ex-service community. That is what it is there for. The ex-service community in 1991, at this stage of the cycle at any rate, wants to retain the repatriation hospitals. More particularly, there is a justifiable case for the retention of the repatriation hospitals ahead of the peak demand of veterans on the repatriation hospital system. It is a complex area. I do not rule out change down the track to maximise the quality of life for veterans in their elderly years and the quality of health service and health care that might be available to them. Equally, there is massive concern .over this issue of transfer of the repatriation hospitals to the State hospital system. The Government has not been successful in communicating to Australian veterans its case for hospital integration. It has gone back on its promise that it would not go ahead without the veterans' consent. For that the Government stands condemned. Can I also say to the Government that its tactic of going around the RSL on this subject with a huge mail-out to some 360,000 veterans and war widows will raise much anger in the ex-service community. This question of mail-outs has been raised from time to time, and raised in a critical way in relation to a former member of my Party. I just want to say: let us put all our cards on the table in regard to mail-outs and the nature of the letters that have been sent out by certain Labor senators, by the Prime Minister and others. Here is another example of a mailout to some 360,000 veterans and war widows, with the associated cost tag. The pamphlet sent out is entitled The Repatriation Private Patient Scheme-How you will benefit . . . I say to the Minister the benefits of the repatriation hospital scheme are already well known to the ex-service community. I believe that the RSL will continue to heavily criticise the Government for its steamrolling tactics. I make the point to the Minister that under a coalition government there would not be such a breakdown in relations between the Government and the RSL and other key veterans organisations. The Government on other occasions has been fond of boasting of its consensus approach when it comes to its mates in the union movement and more generally. However, when it comes to Australia's veterans' community, it seems that a steam rolling approach is acceptable-and I say again to the Minister that such an approach is not acceptable to the coalition. There have been some very large meetings on this issue and I think the Minister for Veterans' Affairs went to a recent meeting at the Sydney Town Hall. He therefore would be aware of the widespread concern about the issue of integration of the repatriation hospitals. It is an issue which must be carefully examined because of the many very serious ramifications involved. I also point out to the Minister that back in 1989 the Government received the MCGirr report into the needs of Australian mariners, Commonwealth and Allied veterans and Allied mariners, merchant seamen and others. Since that time the Government has responded to only two of the more marginal recommendations of that report. The Minister has been saying to mariners and the veterans' community that the Government will respond 'when government business permits'. I say to the Minister that this approach is just not good enough, as many of these veterans are passing away and will not have the benefit of fairness and justice extended to them. The Minister will be aware of the age group affected by the MCGirr report. Many of these deserving veterans and mariners, as I have mentioned, have passed away, and key elements of the MCGirr report should be dealt with and responded to that quickly-not tomorrow, not next year, but today. In fact, it should have been responded to before now. I accept that these are not new issues and I accept that governments of both persuasions have been slow in coming to grips with these issues. But I do not accept that after the Government receives a report-in this case, the MCGirr report back in 1989-nearly two years should elapse before it responds, in May 1991, to the vast majority of its recommendations on the grounds simply that government business does not permit it. We started this session with a light legislative program. The House has sat in every month of this year, including January for the special two-day sitting on the Gulf. It now seems that we will sit in every month for the rest of this yearJune, July, August, September, October, November and December-although the sitting dates for July are up in the air a little bit. But Government backbenchers have been warned about the possibility of sitting in July and of electing new parliamentary leaders for the Australian Labor Party and other matters in the aftermath of its Hobart conference. I simply say that it is not a good enough excuse to state that government business does not permit a response, and a comprehensive response, to all of the aspects of the MCGirr report. After all, the McGirr report was written by a person of singular significance. She accomplished a great deal of work in her contribution to the Repatriation Commission. Therefore, the report was prepared in a way which lent itself to implementation. So I ask the Minister in his response to indicate when there will be a more comprehensive and adequate response to those elements of the MCGirr report which have not yet been dealt with by the Government. Mr Humphreys-If you got in tomorrow, would you go on with the report?",151
356,Mr TIM FISCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am pleased that the Minister concedes the prospect of the Liberal and National parties coming to government at an early date. We will give the veterans a fair go; we will give the merchant seamen a fair go; and we will indeed produce a response to the MCGirr report. We will do that through announcements including policy announcements w-ich, quite properly, at the proper time, will be made by the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs, Senator Newman. Our policy at the last election provided some specific initiatives and these will be added to by the other elements of the MCGirr report. However, I think it is essential to recognise that we are in opposition, sadly; honourable members opposite are in government and they have the absolute responsibility of these matters. Mr Humphreys-You had better help me!",155
357,Mr TIM FISCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I will be happy to help the Minister persuade Cabinet on some of the crucial issues which are dealt with in the MCGirr report. In closing, I welcome the plain English version of the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 1991 as a more sensible legislative approach to veterans' entitlements. I say just one other thing about this legislation. As I mentioned at the outset it is the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Crete. Whether the veterans of this battle are here in Australia, they are already over in Greece or somewhere else in the world, as many of them are-they have chosen to live elsewhere in their retirement-or whether they are in large country towns, small country towns or capital cities, wherever they might be, I, as Leader of the National Party, my coalition colleagues and, in fairness, honourable members by and large on both sides of the House acknowledge and salute the contribution our veterans, our ex-service personnel, have made to Australia. More particularly, we salute the contribution made more recently by those who served in the Gulf with principally the Royal Australian Navy; our ships which went up there-HMAS Westralia is still there-and also the elements of the Army and Royal Australian Air Force which attended as part of the Gulf war task force. Of course, they are now returned service personnel and have entitlements which will be picked up in part by the legislation before the House. I add that one of the veterans who will not make it back to the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Crete is a Mr Bob King, a former member of the House of Representatives seat of Wimmera, in Victoria. That seat has since been redistributed out. Bob does not enjoy good health, but he is a man of determined spirit. He is in hospital-I think the St John of God Hospital in Ballarat-and I send to him a special greeting and message. In one sense, I send a special greeting and message not only to Bob King but to the hundreds of Bob Kings around Australia whose thoughts would want to be and who would physically like to be on the island of Crete over the next 10 daysand that is understandable. Of course, all of us will be thinking of them as the very important and significant fiftieth anniversary reunion takes place. I believe honourable members on both sides of the House will give consideration to this legislation in a thoughtful way and will be generally supportive of it. All that is left is for me to highlight to the House those words of Ben Chifley which I have whether used on other occasions, when I was shadow Minister for veterans' affairs, and which I will always continue to use, because I think they are most relevant. Many years ago, in the aftermath of World War II, he said: Upon this House rests the responsibility of seeing that the right thing shall be done to those who served their country in time of War. That is an absolute obligation which we are all duty-bound to uphold. By and large, the legislation before this House, the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 1991, providing a plain English version of the Veterans' Entitlements Act, is a positive step towards upholding that very important dictum of former Prime Minister Ben Chifley.",155
358,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Cowan)I am sure that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Leader of the National Party will carry with them the best wishes of all members of the House when they go to Crete. Mr Humphreys-Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker.",156
359,Mr FITZGIBBON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I thank the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) for certain parts of his speech, particularly the concluding part in which he was quite generous .. I join with the honourable member for Farrer in wishing well those Australian ex-service personnel who are returning to the Crete anniversary celebrations. I will have more to say on anniversaries shortly. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill, which seeks to repeal part III of the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 and to substitute new part III dealing with the payment of service pensions and associated benefits for veterans, spouses and other dependants as at 1 July 1990. I am pleased that this Bill will not be opposed by the Opposition. The main feature of new part III is that it is written in plain English, the removal of outmoded expressions making the legislation easier to read and understand. Thus, veterans' organisations and other users of this legislation will not find the Bill as confusing and difficult to interpret as had previously been the case. Certain sections will be shorter and it will be much easier to follow the structure and layout of provisions, with each category of pension dealt with in a separate, concise division. As with the social security legislation previously amended to plain English, I welcome the Hawke Labor Government's initiative in adopting this practice of using clear English and a better format for providing information. It is important to note that the rewrite of part III was undertaken in consultation with the ex-service organisations, which have been involved from the outset in its planning and organisation. I acknowledge the assistance provided by ex-service organisations, whose comments have been both constructive and helpful in redrafting the legislation, which will pave the way for more effective administration. The ex-service personnel in my electorate of Hunter are wonderful men and women. all, and they are no slouches when it comes to knowledge, but not many of them have been trained in legal studies. They have as much trouble as I do with legal jargon. At last, they will be provided with information about service pensions and associated benefits which they can easily understand. The honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) has drawn one example of legalese to our attention, and I am sure that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) will have that matter looked at with a mind to improving it. Praise the Lord for this Government's pursuit of plain English and simple to understand concepts! The members of this Government who have held the portfolio of Minister for Veterans' Affairs have done a wonderful job on behalf of veterans and their spouses, and the present Minister's performance has been exceptionally outstanding. The Minister is a sympathetic man and someone to whom veterans can relate. They appreciate the fact that he is approachable and is prepared to give sympathetic consideration to their concerns. Recently the Minister came to my electorate of Hunter to present plaques to the RSL sub-branches in Maitland, Cessnock and Singleton. I am proud that a large number of veterans and their spouses turned out to welcome the Minister, and I was delighted at their acceptance of the concept behind the move to make the repatriation general hospitals State based. The veterans in my electorate of Hunter and, I am sure, the veterans in almost every other electorate would prefer to be treated locally, where they have their family and friends close around them, rather than travel to Sydney, some other State capital or some other far away place to get service at a repatriation hospital. The transfer of repatriation hospitals to the States had to happen. The honourable member for Farrer admitted that change would be necessary. He even conceded that, should the Opposition, by some stretch of the imagination,happen to gain office, it would initiate change; but the change that it would initiate, he has assured us, would cause the ex-service and veterans' organisations to sing hallelujah! Well, some people might believe that, but I find it rather hard to swallow. The transfer of repatriation hospitals the States will ensure the Government's previous guarantee to the service community of access and quality of health care. Under the scheme, entitled veterans and war widows will continue to receive free treatment from the Department of Veterans' Affairs local medical officers. They will have a choice of local specialists at no cost to them, subject to the specialists' fees being in accord with or less the Medicare benefit schedule fee. Veterans and war widows will have free treatment as private patients in a public hospital of their choice without requiring prior approval from the Department. Where the public hospital system cannot meet their medical needs within a reasonable time, private hospital care in a ward will be available. Veterans and war widows will continue to have access at repatriation hospitals where there are special requirements. When the above matters are considered, it will be seen that ex-service men and women can be assured that there will be no diminution of medical services. It is very interesting to read the most recent issue of the RSL national newsletter. It is unfortunate that the National President is quite critical of the Government's decisions, but we find elsewhere that some people find them quite easy to live with. I notice that the President of the Queensland branch of the RSL says: If integration'rationalisation' would be a better does go ahead, we are in a position to ensure that the veteran and the widow are not disadvantaged. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister have both given that assurance. The joint venture scheme established in 1985 has assisted veterans' organisations to provide services which help veterans and their dependants continue to live at home when they could otherwise be placed in nursing home care. Some of the subbranches in my electorate of Hunter have availed themselves of funding under the joint venture scheme. For example, the Maitland RSL sub-branch, together with to Legacy in Maitland, was able to purchase a small bus to perform a variety of services for their members. I note that the payment of non-taxable lump sums of $10,000 to Australian ex-servicemen who suffered illegal internment in Nazi concentration camps has been negotiated between Australia and Germany. I understand that there is a difference between a concentration camp and a. pristhan oner of war camp, but most people would agree that that distinction would indeed be a very fine line. I am a little disappointed that the Government so far has not supported an independent group which is endeavouring to seek reparation from the Japanese Government for Australian prisoners of war held by the Japanese during the Second World War. Apart shared from that comment, I am pleased with the wide range of initiatives provided for ex-service personnel in recent Budgets. As I have said, I reject the contention by the RSL National President, Alf Garland, that the transfer of repatriation general hospitals to the States is a pennypinching approach by the Government and that the private patient status proposal is a sham. This Government has tremendous regard for RSL personnel and their concerns. We do consult with them and do not use, as was suggested by the honourable member for Farrer, a steamroller approach. Unfortunately, however, on many occasions we do have to go around with a fire extinguisher putting out brush fires. Who starts these brush fires? The honourable member for Farrer wordand Senator Newman. Half my time in the veterans' community is spent going around explaining the true facts after these people have been led up the garden path for political ends only, trying to confuse them and cause them anguish. Those people without a jaundiced view will recognise that this Government in difficult economic times has done more for veterans than could possibly be hoped for under the user-pay principles espoused by the Opposition. I would rather walk away from politics altogether than be part of any legislation that deprived veterans from benefits. Fortunately, whenever I face the veterans in my electorate, I can always hold my head high and be extremely proud of the benefits and the advantages that this Government has provided for veterans. I know that we have not been able to meet all their demands but, gee whiz, we have certainly gone a long way towards placating their fears and concerns and to keep them in a position where they are able to enjoy life and not become victims of poverty or any other abuses or neglect. This nation leads the world in the provision of benefits and care for those gallant men and women who have served this nation of ours in times of conflict, and while we have men of great compassion such as the Minister for Veterans Affairs and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) protecting veterans' interests, this nation will continue to lead the world on that score. Veterans will always get a fairer go from this Government than they would receive from those so lacking in compassion who sit opposite. Indicative of the Opposition's hypocrisy is its farcical about-turn on the Australian War Memorial issue. I am pleased that veterans welcome the changes to the Defence Services Home Scheme. I engage in a lot of dialogue with veterans in my electorate and I endeavour to address their concerns. I hope they are . happy with the assistance I endeavour to provide to them. Finally, there are about four or five veterans in my electorate who were members of the 2/19 Infantry Battalion serving in Darwin at the time of the Japanese attack on 19 February 1942. Ern Akers, Ken Berthold, Laurie Barnes, Col Nowlan and a dozen or so other fellows in New South Wales were members of the original Darwin Infantry Battalion. They copped the brunt of the first bombing attack on Darwin. These brave fellows were later incorporated into the 2/19 Battalion. These men want to return to Darwin for the fiftieth anniversary of that tragic day. I know that the Minister for Veterans Affairs and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) will be sympathetic to my approaches for assistance to ensure that these veterans get the opportunity to take part in the commemoration. One Royal Australian Air Force plane from each State would save these brave guys $1,000 each for the cost of a plane ticket. They certainly cannot afford that. It would be small repayment for their efforts 50 years ago. I feel that this action is as important as the return of the ANZACs to Gallipoli last year or the return of veterans to Crete this year. This legislation before the House will be of great benefit to veterans, and I have pleasure in commending it to the House.",156
360,Mr BRADFORD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am very pleased to take part in this debate on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill. In fact, as the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) said in leading for the Opposition, we welcome the legislation and we commend the Government for the action that it has taken. I note in the second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) that he points out that the most important features of the new part III include provisions expressed in plain English. I think everyone commends the Government for that action and also for the fact that the Bill contains shorter sections than does the current legislation; it is easier to follow, with the layout of provisions for each category of pension dealt with in a separate division. It all adds up to its being presented better and easier to understand. The Leader of the National Party has already commended the Government on at least that aspect. I believe that veterans are a very important section of our community.· In some respects they are an ageing and shrinking sector of the community. They remain, I think as far as the Government is concerned-I know as far as the Opposition is concerned-a very important sector of the community. They will remain so for a long time to come. I have reminded the House on a few occasionsthere will come a time when I stop doing it-that I have had a close association with veterans in a number of ways. I am always proud to say that my late father was a member of the 6th Division of the 2nd AIF and served right through the Middle East. I am very proud of that. My little six-year-old boy wears my father's medals on ANZAC Day. That is terrific. I am very proud to wear mine as a Vietnam veteran and as one of only three veterans in this place. The Leader of the National Party is one of the others. I have pleasure in talking in this place about veterans' affairs matters because they are very close to my heart. I believe that ANZAC Day this year was a wonderful day. It was a day that in my electorate at least, and probably right across Australia, saw the services and functions very well attended. I suppose there was some impetus to the day, given the fact that we had just successfully pleted an action in the Gulf war. Once again, Australians had held their heads high and performed creditably. I, along with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Minister and others, was very fortunate to go to the mouth of the Brisbane River to meet HMAS Sydney and HMAS Brisbane. Mr Les Scott-I was there.",158
361,Mr BRADFORD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Oxley was there, as he reminds me. What a moving occasion it was, particularly when I reflect on my own homecoming from Vietnam. It was a very moving occasion for me on that day as we came up the river on the ships and as they docked. The excitement and atmosphere were wonderful to experience. I want to thank the Minister for Defence (Senator Ray) for inviting me to attend on that occasion, because it was a wonderful opportunity. I enjoyed very much talking to the sailors and officers on both ships. They did a tremendous job for us overseas. I suppose ANZAC Day received an impetus from that, but I do not think it was that alone. People are starting to see ANZAC Day as being a very significant day and there is a lot of interest in ANZAC Day not only from the older people, the older veterans-the diggers themselves. This year I was very pleased to see at many of the ANZAC Day commemorations that I attended the interest of younger people who obviously had fathers and grandfathers who were veterans. There were young kids there representing probably their late grandfathers. I think that is terrific because it all augurs well for the future of ANZAC Day. In my own electorate I attended two dawn services, one a little before dawn and one a little after. I also attended four other commemorative services. They were all very well attended. I would also commend, with a little bit of licence, the scouts, the guides and others who participate so actively on ANZAC Day. I commend and encourage them for doing that. As a matter of interest for honourable commembers, I felt that we ought to have a commemorative service at Parliament House in the lead-up to ANZAC Day. I realise honourable members are committed in their electorates, but I wrote to the Speaker after this last ANZAC Day-it is the first one I have attended since I came here-and asked him could we have a commemorative service in Parliament House in the lead-up to ANZAC Day. Perhaps we could invite local Returned Services League of Australia personnel as well as service personnel whq live and work in this town. I am sure that such a commemorative event would be welcomed. Certainly it would be welcomed by veterans and others who have had connections with the Defence· Service, and of course by members of Parliament. It would not have to be a long service, but it would be a fitting one. Perhaps the Minister for Veterans' Affairs will undertake to follow that up with the Speaker. I am waiting for a response, but I wrote in only the last few days. ANZAC Day is a special day-a wonderful day-which is a tribute to veterans. I was very disappointed that Sir Alan Walker, for whom I have always had a great deal of respect as a churchman and citizen, suggested that ANZAC Day should "" not be observed because it is a glorification of war. I think that many people, perhaps better equipped than I am, have managed to put that in perspective. Suffice it to say that I believe he is quite wrong on that subject. I believe that ANZAC Day is a day that brings Australians together. It is a day that we can all relate to, when we look back not just to Gallipoli but also to a number of theatres of war since then where Australians have served their country and given their very best for it. As I say, it is a special veterans and their families. All veterans await with great interest the statement to be made by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in respect of the restructuring of the Defence Force. I will be looking very closely at what he has to say because I believeand I am sure that I am speaking for the Opposition here-that any lessened commitment to the defence of Australia will be deplored throughout the community and certainly by the Opposition. I look forward to hearing what Senator Robert Ray does say. I and, I know, many others will be listening closely, because my analysis of defence expenditure under this Government is that it has fallen behind in real terms, and that is something to be deplored. Further, on that matter, I believe that the important matter of defence should have been the subject of a 'Green Paper to promote discussion and to allow full input from the community at this important time. In many respects we have never got defence right; we have been fiddling around with it-perhaps I use that word a bit loosely; we have been dealing with it-for 90 years and we are still in the process of trying to get it right. Maybe we never will get it right. Nevertheless, it is of concern to a lot of people that we do not lessen our commitment to defence. I believe that the experience of veterans should not be ignored. They have first hand experience and are a valuable resource who ought to be consulted fully. We are approaching a number of significant fiftieth anniversaries as we head into the 1990s, when we will be commemorating a number of famous confrontations which occurred during the Second World War. Recently we had the fiftieth anniversary of the siege of Tobruk. I was fortunate enough to welcome a number of the Rats ofTobruk to Canberra, mostly from my electorate. Tobruk was almost the Second World War equivalent of Gallipoli, with the siege of Tobruk lasting for eight months and representing a magnificent action which was commended by Prime Minister Churchill. Next year we will commemorate the bombing of Darwin, day for when the Second World War came very close to Australia. We have learned less0!1 s which emp-asise the need to Il1:aintam' a well eqmpped and well tramed defence force. I notice that the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) did not understate his praise of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in his comments. I believe that the Minister is a compassionate man in respect of veterans' affairs, from the dealings that I have had with him. I have made a number of representations to him, and they have always been answered fully and completely, although perhaps not always to my satisfaction. Nevertheless, I thank the Minister for the way in which he has approached his portfolio and for being the conscientious Minister that he is. Having said that, I am about to whip the rug out from underneath the Minister's feet because I still do not believe that this Government has given sufficient priority to veterans' affairs. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) spelled out a number of areas, and I pick up the point that in many respects the Department of Veterans' Affairs can be a little insensitive. Stronger words have been used, but the honourable member for Hunter talked about putting out brush fires started by the Leader of the National Party and by Senator Newman, as the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs. I suggest that if the honourable member means that raising issues of concern to veterans is starting brush fires he has it all wrong because our role is to do exactly that. The sort of brush fires that the honourable member for Hunter talked about are not really brush fires at allsome of the things we have managed to point to are really bush fires. The honourable member for Hunter talked about the transfer of repatriation hospitals to the State health systems and told us how great that is going to be. I remind him that the Returned Services League still has some concerns about that activity. As far as I am concerned, there needs to be a further process of resolving those concerns-putting out that particular brush fire, putting it in the terms of the honourable member for Hunter. The honourable member for Hunter mentioned the entry fees to the Australian War Memorial. However one wants to look at that, I think that it was an insult to many veterans that entry fees should be considered. We are all aware of the financial exigencies of government and the difficulties there are in making ends meet in any enterprise of any sort, but in a way it was like charging pilgrims to go to Mecca. The War Memorial is a very special place, and it commemorates a lot of wonderful things. I believe that the Opposition made the right decision and I applaud the Leader of the Opposi tion (Dr Hewson) for the position he ultimately took when he was confronted with a very strong argument about why the Memorial should be made available free of c;harge to anyone who wants to go there. The honourable member for Hunter also mentioned the defence service homes scheme. Sure, that has improved-there is greater access to it and portability, the Opposition applauds those thingsbut I put it to the Minister that the limit on the loan is becoming a bit unrealistic at $25,000. Surely there is some mechanism for reviewing that, because it will be inadequate in the short term. Mr Humphreys-The Defence Force has a newer one-a better one-now.",159
362,Mr BRADFORD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I thank the Minister for that information and perhaps I can get some more details about it. There was a case recently where a drug was refused to an entitled veteran and the Department of Veterans' Affairs was ultimately forced to admit it had made an error of judgment. I do not use that to lambast the Department, but I believe that veterans deserve the very best of consideration and the benefit of any doubts. These are people who not only have served their country-with great distinction in many cases-but also have lived through the exigencies and harshness of service life, some for many years. Anyone who has served in the forces understands the difficulties and challenges there are for people who choose to serve in the armed forces-the dislocation to family life and the prospect of overseas or active service at any time. People who serve in the defence forces are very special people and they deserve special consideration. I think the Leader of the National Party referred to the brochure on the repatriation private patients scheme which is now being distributed to veterans and war widows. It is entitled 'Repatriation health care'. Once again, perhaps there has not been as much attention to detail as there might have been, because as a result of that brochure there remain some unanswered questions. For example, no definition is given of 'reasonable time' in respect of the policy about access to private hospitals. The important question, which the Minister might take on board while he is being so cooperative, is: will repatriation general hospitals continue to provide the same level of outpatient care post-integration as occurs now? If not-I am talking now about the scheme-where will veterand as and war widows obtain such care? Will they need prior approval to attend clinics in their own regions? The answers to these questions are crucial when considering issues such as priority of access and quality of care for veterans and war widows in an integrated health system. The brochure distributed by the Department on behalf of the Repatriation Commission fails to answer a number of difficult and important questions associated with integration. Finally, just underlying what I have said about the need to give special consideration to veterans, I turn briefly to Vietnam veterans. They have some special concerns, of course, and I believe that those concerns need special attention. At the moment Vietnam veterans are particularly concerned that, despite a Government commitment to maintain staffing levels for the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, the Repatriation Commission has reneged on that promise. I think the Minister is aware of what I am talking about. The Department of Veterans' Affairs seems to have some problem with the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service because it has attempted to undermine the service and has attacked it on a number of occasions. I believe that the counselling service is extremely cost effectivehowever one looks at cost effectivenessand it ought to be supported. I challenge the Minister while he is in the chamber, if he is going to take on board my points, to restore the staffing level of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service to 49, which was the agreement it had with the Government. Having said all that, I summarise by commending the Government for introducing the Bill we are dealing with. As has been said, the revamp of part 3 to plain English is a step forward in making the process of veterans' affairs legislation understandable by more people. That is a very positive step.",161
363,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Oxley) (9.41 p.m.)I am pleased to follow the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) in this debate on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill. We were not the best of friends last night, but I think we have made amends tonight. It is good to hear the honourable member speak at length here tonight and make his contribution to this debate. The care of former members of our defence forces is something that the Hawke Government has taken great pride in, for it is only fitting that the people who have made such a great contribution to this country should be rewarded with the benefits they deserve. It is with great pleasure that I rise tonight to speak in this debate on a Bill that will do much to improve the efficient operation of the Department of Veterans' Affairs-just as a recent rewrite of the Social Security Act will be helpful for beneficiaries in that area. There is something unique about our defence forces. I refer to the one word that evokes emotion for both current and former defence personnel and members of the non-defence community alike. Of course, that is the word 'ANZAC'. While the history books show our military involvement in international conflicts before the battle of Gallipoli, Australians of all ages regard the ANZAC spirit that was born at that time as something more than another page in our military history. Some people even regard it as the true birth of our nation-as has been said by other members tonight. I know that those honourable members who were present just over a year ago at the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of Gallipoli-I mention the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), who is at the table, and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer)-would have felt the eerie presence of fallen soldiers at ANZAC Cove. They would have left ANZAC Cove with a very tangible reminder of the commitment made by our defence forces in times of need. Although the original ANZACs reduce in numbers year by year, it is important to note that the recognition of their effort is certainly not diminishing. That has been highlighted tonight by previous speakers. I believe that on ANZAC Day this year some of the crowds were even bigger than they had been for the seventy-fifth anniversary. As I attended ANZAC Day services around my electorate of Oxley-I think four or five of them, beginning with the dawn service; I had quite a day out with some of the old veterans-I noticed an increasing number of young people showing a genuine interest in and respect for present and former members of our defence forces. I too join with the previous speaker, the honourable member for MCPherson, in recognising the contribution made by some of our younger people in the scouting movement and the Girl Guides, et cetera, who were involved on the day. In my electorate. it was a beautiful day and everyone came out for the occasion. The officials I spoke to at the dawn service believed that there was a larger crowd this year than there had been last year for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli. It is significant that this respect for the contribution of the military is something that has not been eroded by time. If anything, I believe it has been enhanced. I certainly notice in my visits to schools around my electorate that students of very young ages are increasingly asking questions about the Government's role iQ the defence area and the meaning of ANZAC Day. That same spirit is something we can be proud of in the case of the men and women who have served in our defence forces since that time. It is for that reason that the legislathe tion before us is of such significance. The unique and differing needs of Australia's veteran community, given their distribution of ages, means that the framework that serves them well on their return to Australia must be, first and foremost, a flexible one. Although there have been many amendments, there is no escaping the fact that the basic infrastructure of caring for today's veterans was born more than 70 years ago. Since then the men and women of our defence forces have been involved in another world war, the Korean War, the Malayan campaign, the Vietnam war and the recent conflict in the Middle East. That is to name just a few of the conflicts in which our forces have been involved at times when Australia has been called on to exercise its responsibility in the international community. I saw on the television news tonight our young troops heading off to the Middle East once again to playa very real role there in assisting the people, who are certainly in dire straits. There have also been numerous occasions when our defence personnel have been involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations. It is important to note that the significance of ANZAC Day was just as real this year with the return to Australia, close to 25 April, of HMAS Brisbane and HMAS Sydney from their tour of duty in the Middle East. I, like sunny other members of the Parliament-and the honourable member for MCPherson mentioned this-was pleased to have been present at the arrival of the ships at Hamilton Wharf in Brisbane and to see several servicemen from my own electorate of Oxley being reunited with their families. It was a very important occasion for the families welcoming the young sailors home. The sailors were obviously very pleased to be home as well. I too would like to record my thanks to Senator Robert Ray, the Minister for Defence, for his assistance in having those ships call into Brisbane. That visit was very important for the people in the southeast corner of Queensland, particularly the people in the city of Ipswich in my electorate. Both the Minister for Defence and Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have my sincere thanks, and I am sure I speak on behalf of the families of those sailors who returned from the Gulf. The welcome those young sailors received revealed the true recognition by the community of the contribution made by defence personnel. This is something on which all members need to be congratulated. With each of the conflicts Australia has been involved in since Gallipoli have come new forms of weaponry and warfare that, once the conflict has passed, leave the service personnel with differing needs when they leave the Services. It is just not good enough to combine the needs of ex-service personnel in the same basket with those of the rest of the community. These people have given a lot and they now deserve something in return. That is why I found it so surprising that the Opposition will not commit itself to recognising the individual needs of our ex-service men and women by supporting the Government's reforms in hospitalisation for veterans. I know that there are honourable members on the other side of the House who have served in the defence forces, and they deserve the highest accolades. I acknowledge that the Leader of the National Party of Australia and the honourable member for MCPherson are two such members. However, that fact also makes the Opposition's stand ever harder to believe. While I have not served in the Australian defence forces myself, as the son of a Second World War Royal Australian Air Force veteran-my father was in 10 Squadron during the war and served in the United Kingdom and the Middle East, and I am very proud of his efforts-I am very familiar with the unique aspects of defence families, growing up with such a father. Coming to this place with that background, I am proud to stand on the side of the House that represents the true interests of veterans and their families. tralia's veterans have benefited from many initiatives introduced by the Hawke Government, and will continue to do so. Veterans have not been forgotten when it comes to the bigger planning picture for our increasingly ageing population, as can be seen in the increases they have received via the Government's better incomes policy for retirement. Some of these include the realisation of the Government's long standing commitment to increase single rate pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings (AWE). This one initiative has seen the rate of pension paid to single service sioners and to war widows rise from 23.3 per cent of AWE in 1984 to a level above 25 per cent of AWE since April 1990. Veterans and war widows have also benefited from the twice-yearly indexation of pensions, in line with· the consumer prince index, as was brought out in the latest round of increases on 21 March this year. The maximum single rate for single service pensioners from this date is $301.60 a fortnight, with the equivalent rate for married couples being $251.50 per fortnight per person. Recognising the contribution of defence personnel and the 'legacy left on surviving spouses, the war widows pension is currently $325.60 a fortnight. The incapacities that many ex-service personnel live with after leaving the defence forces are extremely varied and it is therefore appropriate that they should be supported by a similarly varied system of financial support. To this emf, there are in place a number of disability pension rates, ranging from $20.90 for 10 per cent disability to $554.10 for a special totally and permanently incapacitated rate. Given the importance of caring for the veteran community and the increasing proportion of veterans that will be in need of adequate hospital care, it would be remiss of me not to address the benefits the Government would like to offer to veterans via the Commonwealth's repatriation private patients scheme. It is sad that on this all important issue for veterans the Opposition has evaded the probAuslem at hand and instead decided to get bogged down with pedanticism, with the poor veteran meanwhile being left not knowing where the future lies for veteran care. I put it to the Opposition to join with the Government to work together on this initiative, an initiative which will give veterans greater independence and dignity in their health needs. The two previous Opposition speakers, the honourable member for Farrer and the honourable member for MCPherson, have been very supportive, and I acknowledge that. The centrepiece of the changes which would see the integration of repatriation pen- general hospitals (RGHs) into the State health systems would give entitled veterans and war widows something they do not have at present-private patient status. In addition to public hospitals and integrated repatriation hospitals, it is intended that veterans would also have the option of going to private hospitals contracted to the Department of Veterans' Affairs if no public hospitals can treat them within a reasonable time. These benefits would affect more than 360,000 veterans and war widows across Australia. It would mean better options for many thousands of veterans and war widows who already choose admission to public hospitals as public patients or as privately insured patients rather than travel to RGHs. I know that these benefits would mean a lot to the large number of veterans in my electorate of Oxley. When the families and friends of veterans who are hospitalised at the Greenslopes Rehabilitation Hospital wish to visit them during their stay, they have to either travel some distance in their aNn vehicles-and quite often they are elderly people who do not wish to drive in busy traffic-or catch a train to the centre of Brisbane, followed by a bus trip to Greenslopes, which is a time consuming exercise and quite exhausting for elderly people. This also works in reverse, as indicated in the comments I have received from many veterans that if they ever required hospital care they would much prefer to be cared for close to their families and their mates. Instead of getting behind this reformation of hospital care for veterans, the Opposition has been totally opposed to genuine improvement. This dogmatic stand has been spearheaded blindly by the Opposition spokesperson from the other place, Senator Jocelyn Newman, who claimed in a totally negative media release that a national mail-out to all entitled veterans and war widows failed to answer crucial questions. The brochure being posted to veterans explains the new arrangements in simple language and reassures them on major issues of concern. For Senator Newman's information, just to make sure veterans are able to understand the changes, the Government is inviting those who have further questions to telephone for further information. The call is toll free to veterans outside capital cities. Importantly, this information campaign is based on solid research-research that indicates that veterans need more information about the proposed new arrangements. For all the fear that has been drummed up by some members of the Opposition who still claim to have the interests of veterans at heart, in most cases the private patients scheme would give veterans a better deal than any private medical insurance they could buy. I note that there is some sign of the Opposition being more positive. In the March issue of the national newsletter of the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL), Senator Newman stated that the Federal Opposition policy was that integration should not occur until the concerns of the ex-service community and the States were properly addressed. I welcome that statement and I am sure it is a view that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who is at the table, would support as well. After all, it is a course the Government is already pursuing. We have set up extensive consultative bodies with the ex-service community and hospital staff, and, of course, are negotiating with the States. We have no intention of integrating the hospitals if the ex-service community expresses reasonable concerns. Of course, we cannot bulldoze the States. It is a cooperative effort and more vocal members of the Opposition would do well to join in that cooperative effort and put their thoughts of political expediency aside. Certainly the cooperative effort expressed here tonight by the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Farrer, and the honourable member for MCPherson are well received. They appear to have taken a bipartisan approach here this evening. I hope that they will have some influence with the other members of the Opposition and let those who disagree with the stand of their colleagues know by supporting the Government in this pivotal reform. I understand that the Opposition is supporting the Bill tonight, which is welcom-. The hospitalisation issue is one of a number that are of concern to veterans and war widows. It is one of the myriad of others already in place that will be greatly assisted by the plain English rewrite of the veterans' affairs framework before us. A speedier processing of decisions, an easier determination of claims and a clearer understanding of the regulations are all ways in which those who have given their contribution to Australia will gain from the Bill. However, the degree to which veterans stand to gain from legislation still to be included in that framework will depend very much on the willingness of a selfish few to put political gain aside and recognise the true contribution made by the men and women of our defence forces. As I said when I started, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill because of the recognition of the work of my local RSL groups and the veterans in my community who work extremely hard for the benefit of their mates - both men and women. That includes groups like Legacy and many RSL groups. I would like to make one point which has a lot to do with veterans. I was extremely concerned when I read in my local newspaper-the Queensland Timesduring the week a report about an RSL club in Redbank Plains, a suburb in the City of Ipswich. The club had a ceremony on ANZAC Day, which I was unable to attend because I was at other ANZAC Day services. Some people who were obviously not very caring towards our veterans community took it upon themselves actually to borrow, for want of a better term, the Australian flag, which was at half mast at the Redbank War Memorial. The President of the RSL club has expressed his great concern about that and the veterans have been shattered by such a terrible thing happening, particularly on ANZAC Day. I hope that the person or persons who took that course of action will' wake up to themselves and return that flag without delay. I will certainly do my best to get them a flag as soon as possible, and I am sure the Minister would not mind me doing that. RSL clubs always fly their flags with great pride. Things like that do a lot of damage, particularly to elderly people but to all our veterans and to the broader community. It is not a very good example, particularly to our young people. The honourable member for MCPherson mentioned earlier, as I did, the young people who were out on ANZAC Day, including the young people in schools who participated in ANZAC Day activities. I thought taking the flag was a pretty disgraceful action. I hope the persons who did so will return the flag and apologise to the broader community for the offensive manner in which they have carried on. Once again, I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to speak on this legislation. I certainly commend the Minister at the table for putting together what I think is extremely worthwhile legislation. The Department has obviously worked extremely hard with it. The Minister, of course, has a very caring attitude towards our veterans, as the honourable member for'MCPherson acknowledged before. In closing, I would also like to pay tribute to the final remarks tonight of the Leader of the National Party for his reference to a former great Prime Minister, Ben Chifley. I think that shows the measure of the bipartisan approach the Leader of the National Party is prepared to exercise when dealing with veterans. I hope he uses that influence on other members of the Opposition.",162
364,Mrs JAKOBSEN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL," Like other speakers before me in this debate on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 1991, I welcome the decision to simplify the language and format of part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 so as to render it more understandable to the people it affects. I know that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), who is at the table, is very conscious of the needs of the veterans' community and the ex-services community and has made every endeavour to ensure that all the literature to do with veterans is put in understandable terms. In the year in which people have been talking about literacy so much in this country, we cannot overlook the fact that many of our veterans were not that well educated at school and do need assistance when it comes to reading what is effectively complex legislation. I know that the ex-service and veterans' community across Australia will also welcome the changes in part III of the Act. As with the social security legislation, the provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act are extremely important to the well-being of hundreds of thousands of people around Australia who fought for their country or were at least prepared to do so if called upon. Their advocates and support groups may have been familiar with the contents of the old Act, but it was a mystery to many of the ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen who depend upon it for their financial support and medical coverage on a day-today basis. I, like other members in this place, I am sure, have a great number of people who come into my office from time to time seeking assistance with the understanding of their entitlements or their ability to get a disability pension through the veterans' Act. I think that this Bill, we have it in our offices, will assist usalong with, at some stage, the wonderful computer program, 'The General', with which the Minister is very familiar, as is the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I hope at some stage that will also be extended to members of parliament to assist them in helping veterans in our community at the local level. We all need some simplification of legislation, and particularly very complex legislation which undoubtedly the Veterans' Entitlements Act has become because of the additions that have occurred over the years. Extensive consultations with the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL) and other representative organisations and groups were undertaken and their approval of the Bill ratifies the claim that no changes in meaning or entitlement have occurred, only a rewrite so as to render such entitlements more easily understood. This was a very important point in the Minister's negotiations on the rewrite. The veterans, quite rightly, fear any change, because they think that a change may lead to a reduction in their benefit, even if only accidentally. So those sorts of checks by the RSL and other organisations were crucial to the acceptance of the rewritten legislation-and I for one support them, as I know the Minister does. Part III of this Bill, as in the parent Act; provides for pensions and associated benefits to be paid to veterans, spouses and other dependants as at 1 July 1990. It is very easy to follow the structure and layout, and it will be useful to members of the veterans' community. Many veterans will be pleased to thumb through the legislation to see how it is now worded and to see whether in fact they can understand it. We have told them that they should be able to. This rewrite does not involve any changes in policy, though, and has no financial impact or effect on the veterans' pensions or entitlements. Neither does it alter in any way the responsibilities of the Repatriation Commission to the veterans' community and their dependants. In years gone by, I have been privileged to represent the Prime Minister (Mr if Hawke) when it was not possible for him to attend at wreath laying ceremonies at the Kings Park War Memorial in Perth. The most recent occasion was the anniversary of the Royal Australian Air Force. These occasions are always a moving reminder of the loss of life that occurs in war-and I take that message very seriously. Some people, unfortunately, make the mistake of thinking that, because I and others-perhaps on this side of the House-champion the cause of peace in this place and elsewhere, I must be antiveteran. Nothing could be further from the truth. I·strongly support the extension of care, respect and benefits to Australia's soldiers, sailors, airmen and auxiliary personnel, together with those who participated in other areas of work such as the merchant navy. In fact, as a child Of a sailor in the New Zealand Royal Navy, I can recall the disruptions in my early life occasioned by my father's profession and the difficulties it caused to my mother. As a consequence, I have taken an interest in my electorate in Balgirra House, which the Department has funded. This provides a place for ex-service and service spouses to go so that they can have support in the new community. This is something which is often overlooked, but during the years of our Government the way we look after the spouses of our service personnel has become a feature. This little house is very useful. It has a place where children can play; it has facilities, usually for women but not always, for people to come and have a cup of tea or to have a discussion. We had an International Women's Day luncheon there on 8 March and the men organised the champagne. The women proceeded to drink it and enjoyed some festivities and food. Those support services are essential. There are very many people who are separated from their families, because they know very few people, when they follow their spouse to another State in the course of their work with the services. So this sort of network-which is what it isassists people to come to grips with the new place in which they are living, and it also provides them with a way into the community for the receipt of training or the seeking of work. I know in this particular house there is a very good link with the person who comes and advises spouses of our service personnel on how they may get training or look for work in their new area. I believe that many veterans are antiwar, having lived through it and having witnessed its consequences. In Western Australia in particular-I do not know about the other States-a lot of speakers who come to the schools to speak to the children about ANZAC Day are either Vietnam veterans or veterans from previous wars, the Second World War or the Korean War. I think that adds an element of reality to the children's schooling and to their understanding of war, because these people do not pull any punches. They quite honestly say that when they went to war they thought it was going to be a glorious adventure. Whilst they do not condemn the war, they certainly do not glorify it. That is a very important position for veterans and ex-service people to take. These children will have to make decisions in the future as to whether they wish to go to war, and we do not want them going for the wrong reasons. There are a lot of war movies and things like that on television. Many children do get a very wrong approach to war and think that it is simply a glorifying experience, not realising that it is in fact death and destruction-although, there is no doubt, with some wonderful comradeship involved. Some members in this debate have dwelled on the subject of ANZAC Day. As a naturalised Australian born in New Zealand, I myself do have a special interest in that tradition. In Western Australia at the present time the commemoration of ANZAC Day occurs unfortunately during the school holidays. This has caused quite a few problems in allowing children to participate, or at least ensuring that children participate, in the ceremony. I notice that one of the local members in my area organised a pre-ANZAC Day ceremony to coincide with the end of school before the school holidays began. This is a way of getting around the problem, but I think it would be better if we could have the holidays altered so that they coincide with Easter. ANZAC Day would then not fall in the school holidays as it does at the moment. It is a problem because many of the children do enjoy the ANZAC Day ceremony. It is teaching them something. At the Wanneroo ceremony that I went to last 25th, there was a person doing the prayers and ensuring that people understood what was happening and what we were commemorating. I think he had a very good message to tell. He said that we should be waging peace in our lives. That is my view exactly. I noticed that the people who were there, including the veterans community, agreed with what he was saying. I think that is a very important point and a message that should be given to as many Australians as possible. The Minister has indicated that the rewrite of part III has been undertaken in consultation with the ex-service organisations, as I mentioned earlier. In November of last year an exposure draft of the partially completed Bill was provided to these organisations for examination. The comments that have been received were both constructive and helpful in the redrafting of the legislation. This process that has been undergone does show that the Minister recognises the concern of veterans over every change to the Act and their fear of loss of benefits. This plain English Bill represents a very significant advance in making legislation more accessible to ageing veterans in our community. It is, as the Minister has said, an aspect of access and equity which the Government pursues and of which we can be proud. A great deal of effort has been made in completing the Bill to allow for a more effective administration. I personally commend the Bill to the House and congratulate the Minister on his perseverance in seeing this lengthy task through and for his stewardship of the veterans' entitlements in our cowmunity and in our Government.",166
365,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,I call the Minister.,169
366,Mr HUMPHREYS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"in reply-Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is good to see that you contributed to the debate on this legislation, and it is nice to see you now in that very high position that you hold of Deputy Speaker. The debate on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 1991 which has just taken place brings nearer to conclusion another step in making veterans' affairs legislation more accessible. This Bill, with its simplified English expression and the logical arrangement of its main parts, has general bipartisan support. I thank those honourable members who have contributed to this debate and expressed general acceptance of the thrust of the plain English legislation. I would like to make a few remarks about the contributions made by honourable members. I might start with the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), and thank him for his very kind remarks. As always, he is very supportive of the Government's legislation and not very critical. When he is being critical, he is usually doing a bit of shadow boxing, but he mainly supports the Government's policy in relation to veterans' affairs. I was very interested to hear his contribution in relation to the MCGirr report on the merchant mariners. Whilst I was trying to challenge him to say exactly what he would do if those opposite were ever to win the treasury bench, he was very careful not to say that they would implement those recommendations of the MCGirr report that he was asking me to implement. I would like to hear from him again, and I would like to point out also that it was the Government that commissioned the MCGirr report. Whilst he was not here-and I appreciate that the veterans probably would have been looked after if he had been here-in 30 years of coalition government we never got too far with the merchant mariners. I enjoyed his remarks when he said that he would help support me in encouraging the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and other Cabinet Ministers, when we have the MCGirr report, to have some of its recommendations accepted. We will be doing that in the very near future. I will be happy to report to the House when we get around to doing that. I point out also to the Leader of the National Party-because he had a few concerns about the plain English rewrite-that there is an explanatory memorandum that will explain fully all of those little concerns. I would also like to say that it is going to be great for me to be able to go over to Crete with the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), and Senator Bolkus for the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the battle of Crete. I will be looking forward to his contribution there also. I would also like to thank the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) for his contribution in this debate. He is always interested in veterans' affairs and does a great job in his electorate on behalf of the veterans. I have visited his electorate on several occasions and, as he was pointing out, he is always well received by the veterans in his electorate. They do, as he pointed out, fully support hospital integration. Why would they want to come from the Hunter down to Concord when they can be treated locally? It is also nice for them to know that, if they wish to come to Concord, to the city, they will be able to do that also under the new arrangements. The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) is also, like the Leader of the National Party, a Vietnam veteran. I am proud of them for that. They served their country well. They are constituents of mine, as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and I will be happy to look after them if they ever have to make a claim against the Department of Veterans' Affairs while I am the Minister. I would be very happy to see what we could do on their behalf. I would like to point something out to the honourable member for MCPherson, and especially to the Leader of the National Party and other members of the Opposition and the Government who are here tonight. The honourable member for MCPherson was very concerned about the War Memorial charges. Whilst it is nothing to do with the rewrite in plain English of part III of the veterans' entitlements legislation, I would ask him to check on the shadow Minister's press release in which she was suggesting not only that there be charges but that the turnstiles be shifted from where the Council had recommended they be to the car park so that people on buses and people being taken around the War Memorial with guides could be charged. What we would be doing then would be charging people to go not only into the displays but also into those very sacred areas of the War Memorial. So those opposite do have a policy on charging, but I do not think that the bonourable member read the shadow Minister's press report on that. The honourable member was concerned about outpatients in relation to the repatriation and general hospitals (RGHs). Once again, that does not have a great deal to do with the legislation, but it was a broad ranging debate, which I think was a good idea. He was concerned about the outpatients at RGHs. I should let him know that veterans will still be able to go to the outpatients departments, as they will be able to go to the repatriation hospitals. He has 23,000 veterans in his electorate, and I am sure that they do not want to travel from that beautiful Gold Coast up to the pollution in the city when they could all be treated on the Gold Coast, where they live, where their loved ones are, where their families are, and where they can be visited in their local hospitals. That is what you were saying, Mr Deputy Speaker, in respect of your constituents in Ipswich. I should explain to the honourable member for MCPherson that last year 41,000 veterans were treated in RGHs throughout Australia and 50,000 veterans were treated in public hospitals. I would say to the honourable member for McPherson and the Leader of the National Party that, once integration takes place, all those 50,000 veterans that were treated in public hospitals-and many of them were treated as public patients in public hospitals-will be able to be treated as private patients in public hospitals. I cannot see what we would find wrong with that. There were also another 30,000 veterans treated in private hospitals. So, there were 41,000 in RGHs and 80,000 in public or private hospitals. I should think that should show the Leader of the National Party and the honourable member for MCPherson that the veterans are voting with their' feet and being treated where they live and being part of their own community. I am sure that the honourable member for MCPherson and the Leader of the National Party appreciate that and, whilst they are shadow boxing and playing politics, I know that they agree that we should integrate the hospitals sooner or later. I was a bit disappointed in the honourable member for MCPherson saying that we .were not looking after the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. I will have to send him a little note on what we have done for the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. I do not know who he was saying was attacking the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. I cannot recall that ever happening. The Department and I are very supportive of the Service. The Department has done a great job on behalf of the counsellors, and the counsellors have done a great job on behalf of not only the Vietnam veterans of Australia, but all veterans in Australia. I will have to send him a letter in relation to that. The honourable member for McPherson spoke about the pamphlets that we sent out to explain in plain English to those many veterans-over 600,000 who are entitled to be treated in repatriation hospitals-what we are really offering in relation to integration. I am sure that the Leader of the National Party would be interested in the fact that there were 2,000 calls taken in response to the brochure. The overwhelming majority of the calls were very supportive. They were asking us, 'When can all this happen?'. I was saying to them, 'You write to the Leader of the National Party and tell him you want it, and to the leaders of the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL), to explain that you would love to be getting into this private health insurance and that you will take advantage of the offer that the Government and the Department are making'. Finally, I thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your contribution and the hard work you do in your electorate of Oxley on behalf of the veterans community. I understand that you are well accepted there by the veterans. I have visited you in your electorate. I know of the hard work you do on behalf of them. I also thank the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) for her remarks. She is the very powerful chairperson of the caucus community services and welfare committee. She is always there when we are putting legislation forward. Like the true democratic party that we are, we go to the committee with all of this legislation that we are introducing on behalf of the veterans community. We put it to the committee and it is given very close scrutiny by the committee and, in particular, by the chairperson, the honourable member for Cowan. It was great to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Cowan in relation to The General, the computer program. We will be doing everything we can to have that made available to all honourable members and senators of whatever political persuasion. I am sure it is a idea. As soon as we can we will be able to make available the rewrite in plain English of part three on the computer program. That program was named after a very famous Australian general and a repatriation commissioner, Major-General Alan Morrison, who has done a great job not only on behalf of his nation and his country but also on behalf of the veterans community. I thank all honourable members. It was a great debate. Last, but by no means least, I wish to acknowledge the contribution to the final Bill by the veterans community through its representative organisations. Consultation with these bodies remained constant throughout the development of this legislation. It was particularly heartening to witness the spirit of cooperation which marks this progress. I thank them for the positive contribution they made to the Bill, and especially the national Vice-President of the Returned Services League of Australia, Mr Bruce Ruxton, who passed on his personal thanks to me for the cooperation he had from the departmental people in making sure that they were quite happy with this rewrite of the legislation. Mr Tim Fischer-He is not always kind to you.",169
367,Mr HUMPHREYS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"He is always very kind to me. We get on well together, as I do with the President. We are entitled to disagree, but I can assure the Leader of the National Party that they are very cooperative on many occasions. I also wish to thank particularly the officers from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for the hard work they did in bringing this Bill to its final stage. Finally, I thank the departmental officers who are all here this evening. I thank them very kindly for the work they have done and the long periods that they spent on it. They put in many months of hard work. It was not easy to do but they worked tirelessly on behalf of the veterans community. The majority of letters we get in the office are complimentary of those persons who work in the Department on behalf of the veterans community. As all great honourable members have said, I thank them once again for their contribution. It is not because I have received some accolades from the RSL members that I say we can be very proud of the work of the RSL over 75 years-it is the RSL's seventy-fifth anniversary this year-and also the work of various governments of all persuasions to ensure that we have in Australia the best repatriation system in the world. I have spoken to many people from both sides who agree with me, as the Leader of the National Party knows. That is not to say that we cannot make it better; we should make it better if we can. We do have the best repatriation system in the world. It is up to each and every one of us, as it is up to the RSL. I am sure all honourable members will ensure that we continue to have the best repatriation system in the world.",171
368,Mr BRADFORD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"by leave-I thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) for answering the questions that he did in his response. I wanted to refer him once again to the matter of the Vietnam Veterans Association Counselling Service. I received a letter from the Service dated 2 May stating: . .. bitterly disappointed to be informed the Government and the Repatriation Commission have reneged on their promises made to Vietnam veterans and have reduced the staffing level of the counselling service to 47. I am sure that there are things that the Minister has done for the service. I made that specific point and asked him whether he would investigate that particular ,concern.",172
369,Mr HUMPHREYS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"by leave-I can assure the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) that I am well aware of the concerns of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia. I point out that not all the Vietnam veterans share the concern of certain people in the Vietnam Veterans Association Counselling Service. I am not quite sure of the membership of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia. We have 23,000 Vietnam veterans who are also members of the Returned Services League of Australia. I understand the concerns of the people involved and we will try to assist them in every way we can, which we have. When I show the honourable member in writing what we have done for them, I am sure he will be happy. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Humphreys) read a third time. NA Motion (by Mr Humphreys) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Queensland Government",172
370,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT,"Wide Bay) (10.28 p.m.)There is a perception in some areas that Wayne Goss, Labor Premier of Queensland, is somehow not as bad as the Australian Labor Party in the rest of Australia. that I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the only difference is that he has not been there long enough. Give him time; he will deliver on his election promise, 'I will do for Queensland what John Cain did for Victoria'. He has already imported failed bureaucrats from Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. Bannon's economic advisers are now Goss's economic advisers. Labor's Victoria is bankrupt. Labor's Western Australia Incorporated is in receivership. In New South Wales, Nick Greiner struggles to recover from the Labor-Wran debacle. In Hobart, Labor and the Greens are trying to turn that State into a jobless national park. South Australians are learning to live under Labor's John Bannon and learn what it is really like to eat crow-boiled, stewed and roasted. Wayne Goss inherited the best run economy in Australia, but sadly for Queenslanders there is a limit to how long even it can survive under Labor management. The cracks are already so wide that even the Courier-Mail is having difficulty papering over them. Let us look at something of Labor's short record in Queensland. Labor promised no new taxes, but there have been many tax increases, some of more than a 1,000 per cent. Land tax is up 40 per cent and charges by more than 25 per cent In spite of all those increased taxes, Queenslanders could still have their first anced budget in decades. Development has stopped. Not a single new project has been announced since the election of the Goss Government. There are no cranes. The $2 billion Boyne Island alumina refinery has been shelved and, indeed, the existing one could still close. The China steel mill was given away. The Yabulu nickel refinery could close with the loss 750 jobs. Even the multi-function polis that nobody else wanted, we succeeded in giving away. And sadly, the Cape York space base, one of the most exciting projects on Australia's horizon, could be lost. Investment is already down over 10 per cent. The Goss Government was very critical of the former National Party Government at the time of the election campaign about unemployment. When the Goss Government came to office unemployment in Queensland was 97,000. What is it today?, One hundred and sixty-four thousand. What Labor is supposed to be best at, it has failed at in Queensland. Bankruptcies are up 60 per cent. For revenge, the Government has closed many country courthouses, hospital boards, fire brigade boards and rail lines; road funding has been slashed; technical and further education courses cut and $7m worth of new charges imposed. What about corruption? This is the Government that was going to end corruption, yet as the Cooke inquiry goes on we learn more about the appalling record of the trade unions in that State-election rigging, misappropriation of funds and the like. What about the Minister's holidays, or the $8,000 train trip to Barcaldine? Remember the Government jet Labor was going to sell? It did not sell the Government jet, it went and bought another one, retaining the original jet merely to recapture escaping MLAs, like the ex-member for Nundah who ran away. He had had enough. He has made it quite clear that he did not quit because of any love triangle, or because of his wife's relationship with the golden haired boy, Wayne Swan and his wife. He did not quit because of any delicate battle over conference representation. He quit because he was fed up with Wayne Goss and the Labor Governunbal- ment. So now we have a by-election. Let us look at Labor's achievements in Queensland. There are certainly a few. Poker machines and many more casinos are promised. In fact, I am told that we are going to have a gambling-led recovery in Queensland. That is Labor's wonderful new solution for our State. There are 100 new committees. Industrial relations have of been put back to the Dark Ages. Queensland, once the leader, is unfortunately now, as a result of the 'Minister for Revenge and Bowls', going back to the 1940s and 1950s. The people of Nundah and Toowoomba South are going to have the first opportunity to pass judgment on the record of the Goss Government in Queensland and we all know what judgment they are going to apply. Labor is also on the run in Queensland and it is the beginning of the end of its last area of hope. Labor is a disaster for all Australians and it is a disaster wherever it has tried to govern. Let us hope that Queensland can survive long enough for Labor to be tossed out in that State also. New South Wales Government",172
371,Mr GRACE,ADJOURNMENT,"On 25 May 1991 the shareholders of New South Wales Inc will be holding their general meeting. We have been asked to consider the tremendous turnaround in our company's financial position since the old board was shown the door in 1988. The advertisements on our televisions and radios are telling us that this is a bunch of whiz-kids at the helm who are going to take our State into the big league-a board of directors that knows how to run a business at a profit. What a load of absolute rubbish. The truth is that in New South Wales we have a Government of extraordinary incompetence, greed, callousness and naivety. Take, for example, the Liberal Party of Australia's signature picture of Nick Greiner proudly standing in front of the Sydney Harbour bridge with an oversized 'Last and final payment' cheque for $8m glued to his chest. That sums up this Government brilliantly. The Liberals intended that photograph to be a symbolic representation of the new business-oriented Government getting on with the job. The question is, what job? Sending New South Wales broke. Here we have Nick Greiner, the great managing director, paying out a loan which was incurring almost non-existent interest while he owes millions of dollars at top line interest rates. This little cise has cost the taxpayers a cool $375,000 a year in interest. Any managing director of a private company would have been shown the door on the spot. If we thought that was bad, it was only the beginning. Let us not forget that in 1988 Mr Greiner said that New South Wales was addicted to debt. For his information, the debt has increased by $2.6 million-by $45 for every man, woman and child in the State. Also, using Mr Greiner's new accounting format-that is, financial transactions-Labor left a budget surplus of $315m in March 1988, which was not bad for a Labor government by any standard. From 1989 to 1990 Mr Greiner had a budget deficit-listen to this, my friends-of $340m and this financial year the deficit is around $600m. How about that? It is $1.5m if we look at the sums on a national basis. Since 1988 taxes and charges have increased by $850m a year. Who can forget the massive increases in petrol tax, tobacco tax, pub poker machine tax and financial institution duty tax? That is the calibre of the economic managers of New South Wales-increased State debt, increased taxes and increased budget deficits; a miserable trifecta for New South Wales. What we have done, of course, is put the lunatics in charge of the asylum. How about the Government's financial approach to this year's statutory corporations, which could be described as Farmer Greiner's milking cows? This year's deficit is to be offset by a $400m milked from Eleom and $500m milked from the Government Insurance Office of New South Wales to shore up the mess that it has made. That is asset stripping on a scale that would make the bottom-of-the-harbour cowboys of years ago go red with envy. Then, of course, we have the Greiner Government's asset disposal experiment, which would also rank with the bottomof-the-harbour stunt. We have the Black Stump in Sydney being sold so that public servants can stay in the building, or its replacement, and pay rent instead. That would not necessarily be a bad move if exerthe liquidity released by the sale generated a higher productivity return. Not likely. In the case of the whiz-kids, any capital raised will simply go towards balancing the New South Wales budget and will be eaten away by the deficit spiral that has engulfed New South Wales. So much for responsible management for the future. Why has New South Wales got itself into this mess? Is too much being spent on the provision of services to the community? Hardly. Cutbacks have been the name of the game in every community sphere. But not everybody has suffered. Over a billion dollars worth of assistance has been meted out to those who need it least, such as the $98m stamp duty concession given to the Fairfax Group, the $200m paid to consultants for their advice and the $40-odd million paid to George Herscu. Everybody has heard of George and the least said about that the better. It is a pity that some of the $200m paid in consultants' fees was not distributed amongst the working class people of my area-but of course it was not-where they have had to pay a $270 increase in rail fares since 1988 and electricity has gone up by $107, water rates by $168, car registration by $151-",173
372,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. State Bank of Victoria,174
373,Mr NUGENT,ADJOURNMENT,"Aston) (10.38 p.m.)Last Saturday evening I received a telephone call from one of my constituents, Mrs Carol Ashmore. I have subsequently received a letter from her husband and also two other constituents, a Mr Bill Couch and a Mr Robert Scott, on the same subject. Mr Ashmore is a classic example of this particular problem, because he is employed as a carpenter at the Clayton Services Centre of the State Bank of Victoria. He is a long term employee and he is married with a family. I will read some extracts from his letter-it is too long to read it all in the time that we have available. He says: We, the staff of State Bank Victoria, trading the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wish to express most vehemently our total disappointwith ment at the forthcoming retrenchments to all workers in the Services areas of the Bank. Since the announcement of the sale of the State health Bank to the Commonwealth, there numerous statements made to the media stating that the merger would not create any retrenchments. The announcement made on Thursday 9th May, by the Deputy Chief Manager Personnel, Mr John Murray, stated that total retrenchments will in fact be made in the Technical and areas. This announcement is of grave concern. assurance had been given by Government senior Bank personnel with the eventual purchase of the State Bank by the Commonwealth Bank January. He goes on to say: There is no just reason why we have been singled out for total retrenchment. Further, redeployment or retraining have been made. We believe this to be contrary to Government and Bank policy. An additional concern expressed in the letter is that this will add on to the current unemployment figures, and we are most obviously unhappy that 6,000 employees-so we are told by Mr Murrayare to be 'done away with'. No time frames or details were given on how this staff reduction would be achieved. A number of issues are raised by the Ashmores' situation and that of my other constituents. First is the morality of giving assurances when the Commonwealth Bank took over the Victorian State Bank that there would be no redundancies. Whatever the actual words used, there is no doubt that both Federal and State governments intended to give and did give this impression to the employees and the community at large. Whilst many of us were doubtful of the value of that statement-it ranks with Mr Jolly's assurances in respect of Pyramid-nonetheless, staff accepted these assurances in good faith. The second issue is the way in which staff have been treated. They have been told that they are to be thrown out of their jobs in the middle of a recession, and I understand that there has been no indication of the dates or the terms and conditions of that termination; no safeas guard in respect of their mortgages held the State Bank; and, having been effect pressured when the takeover took place to transfer to the Commonwealth Bank's scheme, they are now to have that have been facility denied to them. To say that this is intolerable management behaviour is, I believe, an underof statement. Mr and Mrs Ashmore and my other constituents, together with many thousands of Australians and particularly Trade Victorians, are already suffering grievously as a result of Federal and State Job government policies. I suggest that this and particular matter needs urgent, decisive leadership and action from the Treasurer in (Mr Keating). I urge the Treasurer, in the strongest possible terms, to act on behalf of my constituents and all the other employees of the State Bank who equally are no offers of being so shamelessly treated.

375,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"An excellent member. The case was based on the fact that Mr Martin had distributed some cheques to community organisations for $30,000 to $40,000. The Liberal Party was successful in pursuing its allegations that this amounted to electoral bribery. The court ordered the election overturned, and history now records that Mr Martin won the subsequent by-election with a massive swing. It now seems that the Liberal Party in New South Wales and Premier Greiner have undergone a substantial transformation of attitude. We watch almost daily as he and his colleagues, his Ministers, wander around New South Wales handing out cheques like drunken sailors. Just the other day he presented a contribution of some $10m for an entertainment centre in Newcastle. This was not a straight grant; this has to be paid back. However, that day he was to present a cheque for $11 m for earthquake repairs. Surprisingly, half of it was from the Commonwealth, but no Federal members were notified or even invited. Unfortunately, through sheer incompetence, the handover was fouled up and the cheque had to be sent by post a few days later. These actions stand in stark contrast to the Liberal Party's claims in 1988, but they really do set the scene for a most shameful and sordid matter. Before going to the substance of the Liberal Party's actions, I remind the House of the convention that exists in the Federal Parliament called the caretaker convention. This requires that, following the proroguing of the Parliament, the government of the day accept that its role is that of a caretaker and that it should make no decisions of any significant nature that could bind an incoming government. This convention is observed by both sides of the Parliament and it has been in existence for quite some time. However, its existence appears to have escaped Mr Greiner's attention, which is surprising, given his previous sensitivity to government activities during election periods. This is particularly relevant to a decision made by the New South Wales Government just last week, when it let a tender for $22m to North Queensland Engineers and Agents, a shipbuilding company, for the supply of ferries for the Parramatta River. While I and my colleagues, and particularly the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), would not be in any way opposed to a ferry service being established between Parramatta and Sydney, we should all be appalled that this decision was made and that the tenders were let half way through an election. I raise this matter particularly because, when these tenders were originally called, Carrington Slipways of Newcastle was one of the companies to submit a tender. Subsequently, it went into liquidation and was unable to follow through the tender process by the required date of 14 February. In early March Senator Button approached the Minister for State Development to alert him to the fact that this tender could be vital for the possible sale of Carrington Slipways. Subsequently, I and my State colleagues have strenuously called on the State Government to extend the tender period to allow a prospective buyer of Carrington's to follow up the original tender. I am also aware of at least one company having raised the matter with the State Government some weeks back. No-one is suggesting that the tender should be granted automatically, but rather that a purchaser of Carrington's would need to be competent and competitive to win the tender. All these representations have now been refused, and last Friday, while the Premier was in Newcastle handing out cheques, Mr Baird, the State Minister for Transport, announced in Parramatta that the ferries would be built in Queensland. Incidentally, this is only the second ferry order ever placed by this Government and both have gone to Queensland. Yet every day thousands of commuters on the harbours and rivers of Newcastle and Sydney ride in those superb ferries built by Carrington Slipways. This is a case of astounding impropriety. If a government decided to govern, make decisions, let tenders and commit funds during an election period in this House, we would all be critical. Yet my colleagues opposite and in New South Wales are silent. It is important that New South Wales adopt the Commonwealth convention: when elections are called the government is a caretaker, not a hander out of cheques or a letter of tenders. Telecom Australia",175
376,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise a matter which first gained publicity in the Australian newspaper on 6 April 1991. Under the headline 'Hawke backs Telecom increase' the article states: The Prime Minister, MrHawke, indicated yesterday that Telecom would succeed in its bid to increase local call charges by 2c to 24c. He said Telecom's proposal was 'clearly' the guidelines set down for increases. The telecommunications regulator, Austel, would now examine the proposal to see if it met the guidelines-4 per cent below the inflation rate. Mr Hawke said: 'The proposals clearly come within that. There haven't been increases for 21f2 years,' I have copies of two accounts from the 054 Telecom district, one for the period 4 May to 4 July 1990, 72 units at 21c each. I have a subsequent account for the same 054 number for the period from 3 August to 5 November 1990,211 units at 22c each. I do not know whether it is bracket creep or what it is, but there has obviously been an increase in the 2112 year period, and. obviously it would have some impact on the calculations of the increase that has been foreshadowed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) saying that that would be clearly within the guidelines set down by Austel for an increase. I raise that matter for consideration by the Government to find out why those charges increased at that time. New South Wales Government-Political Donations",177
377,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"I make the obvious suggestion to the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) that if he is concerned about the cost of telecommunications charges to his constituents he might speak to the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale), who is planning to sell Telecom Australia to private enterprise and will allow any future owner of a privatised Telecom Australia to charge whatever it wishes. Perhaps he might have a talk to the shadow Minister before he gets too concerned about the cost of telephone bills in his electorate. Mr Beale-We might also have a bit of competition to get prices down and get a better service. As the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) pointed out tonight, that conveniently ignores the faCt that New South Wales has a record deficit. Professor Walker, from the New South Wales University, has demonstrated the projected within deficit for the New South Wales Government, and compared it with that of Victoria and other States. It is quite clear that New South Wales has a deficit of over $1 billion looming. My constituents have every right to be concerned with the coming State election as to what the Greiner Government plans to do if it is re-elected on Saturday week. What taxes and charges does it plan to increase if it is returned? It is quite clear that the Greiner Government has no intention to cut back the $1 billion per year it wastes on consultants, on funding grand prix motor cycle tracks and all the other areas where the Greiner Government seems to specialise in wasting money. Tonight I will make a few comments about a person who· is a friend of Mr Greiner-a Mr James Yong. Mr Yong was appointed by the Greiner Government as the Chairman of the Maritime Services Board. He is a long time friend and former business partner of Premier Greiner, and he featured in a report by Mr MCCusker, QC, into Rothwells Ltd. Mr Yong was appointed by the Greiner Government to be a member of the Curran Commission of Inquiry into Government Spending in New South Wales when Mr Greiner was first elected. Mr Y ong will be known to the shadow Minister at the table as someone who used to be an employee of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank until it became clear that the bank clocked up debts of $156m and decided that it could do without his services in the future. Mr Beale-Never met him!",177
378,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"The shadow Minister says he has never met him. I am sure that that speaks in his favour, but a Premier of his political persuasion has appointed this man to chair the Maritime Services Board in New South Wales. The Maritime Services Board has a turnover of $300m, with assets of $1 billion and more than 2,000 employees, yet we have a gentleman with this record being appointed by the Greiner Government to chair the Maritime Services Board. It is also interesting to note that Mr Yong is a former business partner of Mr Greiner. Together they were involved in a company called Riverside Holdings. Mr Greiner was involved in this company until 1989. Apparently, it was a turf farm in the Colo River area, and Mr Greiner has admitted in the New South Wales Parliament that, as late as 1989, he was still staying there on the odd weekend using Riverside Holdings as a place for a weekender. The simple point I make here is that the ,MCCusker report said of Mr Yong, who was involved in an assessment of the assets of Rothwells, that it is a pity that Mr Yong did not disclose the existence of a loan, which had been made by a company associated with the Rothwells company, to Mr Yong. Mr Beale-The Rothwells company?",177
379,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"If the honourable member for Bruce were aware of the MCCusker report, he would be aware that it states that it is a pity that this was not declared to the Ministers involved in the negotiations in the bid to rescue Rothwells. Before I finish, I wish to remind the House of the existence of an organisation called Community Polling, an organisation used to launder funds which were used for the Liberal Party at the 1980 State election. Mr Greiner has admitted that it used his own office in Parliament House to do polling. It has come to my attention that a number of donations were made to Community Polling. One donation in particular was a donation of $100,000 by Mr Bill Roach. I ask the House: is it a fact that Mr Roach took various donations from a number of individuals and allowed Community Polling to declare that single donation from him? Is it a fact that Mr Roach has been used in effect as a clearing house for donations to Community Polling before the last election? Mr Greiner has said that, before this election, he would ensure there was disclosure of donations. That is another broken promise.",178
380,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. New South Wales: Proposed Toll Road,178
381,Mr SOMLYAY,ADJOURNMENT,"Fairfax) (10.54 p.m.)This is the' last opportunity before the New South Wales State election, quite obviously, for members of the Federal Parliament to have their say and to try to get some publicity on behalf of their candidates. The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has demonstrated that tonight. I would like to get involved in this debate concerning New South Wales. I have been following the debate very closely on the proposed toll road in New South Wales. I heard the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) stand up in this House and decry the Greiner Government for its proposal to introduce a toll road. He said that that would force traffic through suburban streets; that there has been a massive backlash; and that the New South Wales Leader of the Opposition has said that that toll would be abolished under a Labor Government. That is to win votes. I inform the House of the experience that we had in Queensland of a very similar situation. In my electorate of Fairfax, a toll road, a motorway, was introduced by the previous State Government. The now Premier of Queensland, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Goss, wrote to every person on the roll in the State seat of Cooroora. In his personally signed letter, he stated: If my Government is elected, we will abolish that toll on the Maroochy River Bridge on the Sunshine motonyay. Surprise, surprise! Mr Goss's candidate in the seat of Cooroora was elected, against his own expectations. They then found themselves in the position where they had to abolish that toll. Everybody expected them to do so. But did they abolish the toll? No; they realised that, all of a sudden, they were up for approximately $90m as a cost to revenue for that toll. But did they abolish that toll? No; they in fact increased the number of toll gates by building two new ones. An organisation in my electorate called the 'Toll Busters' has been fighting that tollway ever since. There is clear evidence and written statements to honourable members in my electorate right throughout the Sunshine Coast that that toll was to be abolished, and it has not been. I warn the people of New South Wales that that is the sort of treatment they can expect and not to take seriously the threats of the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales. New South Wales Government-Political Donations",178
382,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"I an opportunity to add to some of the comments I made earlier about the discloals sure of donations to political partiesdo and I thank the House for that opportuState nity. It is quite clear that, unless the munity has confidence in the honesty our political parties, the whole concept democracy is placed under a cloud. I say to the honourable member for Fairfax Somlyay) that it is long time that all litical parties at Federal, State and local government level declared where their litical donations were coming from. It been very clear that it is only Labor ernments in New South Wales and at the Federal level which have been able introduce legislation requiring the discloNew sure of donations. I remind the honourable member of an inquiry by Justice Roden of the Indefor pendent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales, which said that the current electoral laws in New South Wales were a joke because it was very clear that individuals and companies-and unions for that matter-could escape the disclosure of provisions by channelling funds through bodies outside New South Wales and by making donations for allegedly administrative purposes. Justice Roden recommended very strongly that the health of our political system would depend on our having disclosure of donations to political parties. That is something which I support absolutely. Mr Greiner said before this State election that he would introduce legislation requiring the disclosure of donations. He said that before the people of New South Wales went to the polls all donations for the 1991 New South Wales election would have to be disclosed. That was Mr Greiner's promise, and it is another promise that he has broken. Mr Greiner established a parliamentary committee to look at Justice Roden's recommendations, gave them funds to go on a junket to the United States, and bank-rolled them for a second proposed visit to Europe. So Mr Greiner obviously set out with the deliberate intention of ensuring there was no recommendation from that parliamentary committee before the proposed New South have Wales State election. There is one reason for that: the Liberand the Nationals in New South Wales not want the people, the voters, of that to know who is funding their curcomrent State election campaign. That is the of reason why the Greiner Government has of failed to introduce the legislation which Justice Roden said was necessary so that (Mr we could ensure that there are proper postandards of conduct amongst all the political parties. I suggest to honourable pomembers opposite that, before much has longer, they will have a chance to say govwhether they support full disclosure of political donations. That is something to which should be required, not only in South Wales and at the Federal level but in all States and also in local government. I suggest to the honourable member Fairfax that, when it applies in Queensland, I hope it is retrospective, to ensure that donations during the BjelkePetersen years come to public notice.",179
383,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.01 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Beazley to move That: (I) sessional order 48A (adjournment of the House) and standing order 103 (II o'clock rule) be suspended for the sittings this week; and (2) in relation to the proceedings on the following Bills, so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of all the Bills: Telecommunications Bill 1991; Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1991; Telecommunications (Application Fees) Bill 1991; Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Bill 1991; Telecommunications (Numbering Fees) Bill 1991; Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Bill 1991; Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1991; Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991; Customs Amendment Bill 1991; Export Control Amendment Bill 1991; National Food Authority Bill 1991; Veterans' Entitlements (Rewrite) Transition Bill 1991; National Health Amendment Bill 1991; Australian National University Bill 1991; and University of Canberra Amendment Bill 1991.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Companies and Securities Advisory (Question No. 323) Mr Moore asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 9 October 1990: Have any members of the advisory committee to the Attorney-General on matters relating to companies and securities regulation, appointed at or since its inception, been subject quiry from the (a) National Companies and Securities Commission, (b) National Crime Authority or (c) Australian Securities Commisvisory sion.",179
384,Mr DUFFY,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) & (c) The National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) was responsible for the administration of Companies and Securities laws until 31 December 1990. The Australian Securities Commission (ASC) commenced operations under the new Corporations Law on I January '1991 and on that date assumed responsibility for the functions and powers previously exercised by the NCSC. This includes investigations and inquiries commenced under the previous law. The ASC has advised that the only relevant inquiries conducted by the NCSC that relate to the honourable member's request concern the following three matters, each of which has previously been the subject of public report. The first matter concerns questions raised by the NCSC in 1984 about the role of Baring Brothers, Burrows and Partners (Baring Brothers) as financial adviser to Allied Mills Limited in connection with a takeover offer for the company, and its preparation of the takeover to shareholders under the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act 1980. Mr Mark Burrows, the convenor of the Advisory Committee was, at the time, executive Brothers and was personally involved in the provision of advice to Allied Mills. Following discussions with the NCSC, Baring Brothers agreed that it would not hold itself out as being independent from the target com!lany in any report where it had acted in a professional capacity for the company during the previous twelve months. Nor would it prepare an expert's report where it acted in a professional capacity in relation to the takeover in which the requirement for the report arose. No further action was taken in relation to the matter. I am advised that the NCSC considered NA that the undertakings were subsequently honCommittee oured. The second matter concerns the hearing conducted by the NCSC in December 1988 into trading activities which had occurred at the time of the settlement of the September 1988 Ten Year Bond futures contract on the Sydney Futures Exchange. A number of market participants were involved to inin the hearing. One of those participants was Bankers Trust Australia (BT Australia). Mr David Hoare, presently the deputy Convenor of the AdCommittee, was at the time and is still, the Chairman of BT Australia. I am advised that at no stage was Mr Hoare's conduct the subject of any inquiry in relation to the matter. The NCSC and BT Australia agreed to settle a number of matters arising out of the hearing. The settlement involved several staff of Bankers Trust Asset Management, a subsidiary of BT Australia. It was agreed that 2 employees would not act as authorised persons for specified periods-12 months in one case and 3 months in the other. A third employee received a letter concerning his conduct during the course of trading. It was also agreed that the Commission would receive reports for the following four Bond Futures contract close-out periods on the strategy used by participants during the close-out. BT Australia met the costs of the Commission's investigation. The Chairman of the ASC, Mr A.G. Hartnell, who is an ex officio member of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, acted as solicitor for BT Australia in relation to the above matter. This occurred prior to Mr Hartnell's appointment as Chairman of the ASC. As solicitor for BT Australia, Mr Hartnell was not himself the subject of any NCSC inquiry in relation to an expert's report on this matter. The third matter concerns inquiries into the operations of certain companies in Western Australia, with which Mr Alexander Emil Vrisakis director of Baring was involved. Following the sharemarket crash in October 1987, Mr Vrisakis joined the Board of Rothwells Limited as part of a management plan settled with the NCSC. In August 1988 the NCSC examined the role of Mr Vrisakis in the Bond Corporation Ltd/State Government Insurance Commission acquisition of securities in Bell Group Ltd. The NCSC did not take the matter any further. In February and March 1989, the conduct of Mr Vrisakis as a Director of Rothwells Limited was investigated by the NCSC as part of its broad investigation of the affairs of Rothwells prior to the establishment of the MCCusker Special Investigation of Rothwells. Further inquiries were in March 1990, following the establishment of the Special Investigation. The matters investigated by the NCSC are addressed in Part 1 of the Report of Inspector on a Special Investigation into Rothwells Ltd, 1990 which was tabled in the Western Australian Parliament in August 1990. Following pUblication of the MCCusker Report, Mr Vrisakis elected to stand aside temporarily from his position as a member of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee and as Chairman of the Legal Sub-committee of the Advisory Committee. (b) In accordance with well-established policy, I will not confirm or deny whether any particular individual is or has been the subject of inquiry by the National Crime Authority unless that fact becomes publicly known, for instance, through , court proceedings. Companies and Securities Advisory (Question No. 324) Mr Moore asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 9 October 1990: (1) What are the guidelines by which members of the Companies and Securities Advisory mittee may spend the sum allocated to them in the Budget. (2) What sum was spent from the $200 000 allocation to the Advisory Committee in the 1989tions 90 Budget. (3) Further to his statement (Hansard, 19 tember 1990, page 2161) that no members of the Advisory Committee take the sitting they are entitled, how was the sum referred to in part (2) spent. (4) If no members of the Advisory Committee took their sitting fees in 1989-90, why has funding for the Advisory Committee been increased from $200 000 in 1989-90 to $470 000 in 199091.",181
385,Mr DUFFY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honour- . able member's question is as follows: (1) The guidelines under which members of the Companies and Securities Advisory Commitstatements tee ('the Advisory Committee') spend the sums allocated to them in the Budget are set down in sections 159 to 170 inclusive of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. The central provisions are sections 161, and 164 of the Act. Section 161 sets out the manner in which the Advisory Committee can apply its money. The section makes it clear that the Committee's funds can only be used to pay remuneration or meet expenses, charges, obligations or liabilities incurred or undertaken in connection with the Committee's functions and powers. Pursuant to made subsection 161 (3) any money not immediately required for such purposes must be placed on deposit with a bank, invested in Commonwealth securities or applied in a manner approved by the Treasurer. Under subsections 161 (5), 161 (6) and 161 (7) provision is made, where necessary, for the return of funds not immediately required by the Committee. Section 163 prevents the Committee from entering into a contract involving a sum exceeding $50,000, or a lease for a term exceeding 10 years, without prior approval by the Minister. Section 164 makes - he Committee a public authority subject to Division 3 of Part XI of the Audit Act 1901. Division 3 comprises sections 63J to 63M of that Act. Section 63J provides that a public authority must maintain an account with an approved bank, being the Reserve Bank of Australia or another bank declared by the Treasurer, and pay all moneys received into that account. Committee Section 63K requires a public authority to keep proper accounts and do all things necessary to ensure that all payments from its funds are correctly made and properly authorised. Section 63L makes a public authority subject Comto regular audit by the Auditor-General. Section 63M requires a public authority to prepare and submit, as soon as practicable after 30 June in each year, an annual report of its operatogether with financial statements concerning that year. Pursuant to subsection 63M (2), before submission to the Minister the annual fiSepnancial statements just referred to must be referred to the Auditor-General, who shall report fee to which to the appropriate Minister(a) whether, in his opinion, the statements are based on proper accounts and records; (b) whether the statements are in agreement with the accounts and records; (c) whether, in his opinion, the receipt, expenditure and investment of moneys, and the acquisition and disposal of assets by the authority during the year have been in accordance with the enactment establishing the authority; and (d) as to such other matters arising out of the as the Auditor-General considers should be reported to the appropriate Minister. (2) & (3) am informed that a total sum of $61,659 was spent from the $200,000 allocated to the Advisory Committee in the 1989-90 Budget 163 and that a breakdown of the sum spent in the . year 1989-90 is as follows: $ Consultants' fees 39,698 Remuneration 400 Travel Expenses 10,453 Printing 5,087 Other Expenses NA Members could have but did not claim payment for $19,400 in sitting fees during this period. The Advisory Committee has also informed me that the figure of $400 described as remuneration represents sitting fees paid to two Committee members. The sum of $400 was part of travelling allowance payments made to those two members for expenses incufn'd by them in attending an Advisory Committee meeting. After these payments were made it was found that the total sum was in excess of their allowable rates. The members were unaware of the approved rates at the time the expenses were incurred. The members were, however, entitled to sitting fees for the meeting attended and the Advisory Committee determined that the excess payments made ($400) would be charged to the remuneration item. (4) The funding allocation for the Advisory Committee has been increased from $200,000 in 1989-90 to $470,000 in 1990-91 for the following main reasons: (a) The year 1990-91 will be the Committee's first full operational year. (b) The Committee has hired permanent and contracted staff for the first time. In the year 1989-90 the Executive Director was retained as a consultant, and administrative support was provided by the ASC free of charge to the Committee. The Committee now employs the Executive Director, a Senior Legal Officer and a Secretary (Administrative Service Officer Grade 3) on a full-time basis. (c) The Committee now has to pay $30,000 for its accommodation, whereas last financial year this accommodation was provided free of charge by the Australian Securities Commission. (d) Increased provision has been made for the hire of consultants ($30,000) and the conduct of research ($60,000) in preparation for the increased workload which is expected to follow the commencement of the Corporations legislation. (e) It is necessary to make provisions for the payment of fees to which members of the - Committee have a legal entitlement pursuant to the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989, even though some or all such members may not claim these fees. Funds not spent at the end of the financial year for whatever reason can be returned to Consolidated Revenue. Companies and Securities (Question No. 325) Mr Moore asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 9 October 1990: (1) What (a) are the roles of and (b) sums were allocated in (i) 1989-90 and (ii) 1990-91 to the (A) Companies and Securities Advisory 6,021 Committee, (B) Companies and Securities Law Review Committee and (C) Liquidators 61,659 Disciplinary Board. (2) Did his predecessor, in the process of drafting the Australian Securities Commission legislation, establish a steering committee, a wider consultative committee and a group of subcommittees; if so, (a) what was the name of, (b) who were the members of, (c) what funding was received by and (d) what has become of, each committee.",182
386,Mr DUFFY,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) (A) The role of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee is outlined in section 148 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. Section 148 provides that the Advisory Committee's functions are, on its own initiative or when requested by the Minister, to advise the Minister, and to make to the Minister such recommendations as it thinks fit, about any matter connected with: (a) a proposal to make a national scheme law, or to make amendments of a national scheme law; (b) the operation or administration of a national scheme law; (c) law reform in relation to a national scheme law; (d) companies, close corporations, securities or the futures industry; or (e) proposal for improving the efficiency of the securities markets or futures markets. Subsection 5(1) of the Australian Securities Commission Act defines ""a national scheme law"" as: (a) the Australian Securities Commission Act; (b) a law of a kind referred to in subsection 11(1) of the Australian Securities Commission Act; (c) a provision of the Australian Securities Commission Act or a provision of a law of a kind referred to in subsection 11 (1) of that Act. Subsection 11(1) refers to a law of the Commonwealth that deals with, or with matters including, any or all of the following: (a) the formation of companies or close corporations; (b) the regulation of bodies corporate; (c) the regulation of acquisitions of shares in a body corporate; (d) the regulation of the securities industry; (e) the regulation of the futures industry; (f) matters incidental to a matter referred in a preceding paragraph. (B) The Companies and Securities Law Review Committee was established pursuant to sub-clause 21 (2) of the Formal Agreement which enabled the establishment of the co-operative companies and securities scheme. The role of the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee was to undertake research and advise the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities on reform of the co-operative scheme companies and securities legislation. The Committee was wound up in December 1990. (C) The honourable member's reference to the ""Liquidators Disciplinary Board"" is understood to be a reference to the Australian Capital TerriManaging Director .tory Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board established under section 4 of the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board Ordinance 1982. The Australian Capital Territory Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board was responsible for disciplining auditors and liquidaChief Executive tors who transgressed their responsibilities under Company Directors' the Companies Act 1981. There are equivalent bodies in each of the States and the Northern Territory, but the Commonwealth has no role in relation to these. These bodies have a continuing role after 1 January 1991 in relation ings commenced before 1 January 1991. In respect of proceedings commenced on or after 1 January 1991, for transgressions of the former Companies Acts and Codes or the Corporations Law, the role of the Boards has been superseded by the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board established tralian Securities Commission Act 1989. (1) (b) (A) (i) The sum allocated to the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee in the Budget for the year 1989-90 was $200 000; (ii) The sum allocated to the Committee for the year 1990-91 is $470 000. (B) (i) The sum allocated to the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee in the year 1989/90 was $139 950.10; (ii) The sum allocated for the year 1990/91 is $89 000. (C) Funding for the Australian Capital tory Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board was provided on an ""as requested"" basis by the Australian Capital Territory Corporate Affairs Commission. No formal allocation of funds is made. Members of the Board were paid sitting fees as prescribed under section 13 of the Co Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board Ordinance 1982. (2) My predecessor did establish a Steering Committee, a wider consultative Committee and a group of subcommittees to assist in the process of drafting the Corporations legislation. The ""Steering Committee"" referred to was established in September 1987 and known as the Companies and Securities Steering Committee.

At that meeting, the members of the Consultative Group decided that the best way to allow for meaningful discussions on the legislative proposals before them was to divide themselves into four specialist subcommittees. The Consultative Group thereupon ceased to operate as a group. The four specialist sub-committees were: (a) The Administration and Implementation Committee (b) The Accounting Committee (c) The Legal Committee (d) The Securities Committee These are the subcommittees referred to in the Hoare honourable member's question.

October 1989. I am informed that no budgetary allocation was provided for the Companies and Securities Steering Committee, the Companies and Securities Consultative Group or the four subcommittees. Some expenditure associated with the conduct of Association meetings of these bodies was met from the funding allocated to the Attorney-General's Department. I am informed that the amount of this expenditure cannot at this stage be readily separated from general Departmental expenditure. Alzheimer's Disease : Special Care Services (Question No. 616) Mr Braithwaite asked the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, upon notice, on 6 March 1991: When will the Department ""of Community Services and Health respond to letters of 2 August 1990 and 24 August 1990 from Mr F. J. C. Australian Industry Campbell, Lot II, South Western Highway, Roelands, WA, regarding special care services for sufferers of Alzheimer's disease. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A response to letters dated 2 August 1990 and 24 August 1990 from Mr F. J. C. Campbell, Lot Cross 11, South Western Highway, Roelands, WA, regarding special care services for sufferers of Alzheimer's disease was sent on 13 March 1991 from the Western Australia Office of the Department of Community Services and Health. Directors· I\.ssociation The issues raised by Mr Campbell were associated with the Government's Budget announcement to provide an additional $3.3 million specifically for the funding of additional Dementia Grants in recognition of the need for these services due to the ageing of the Australian population. In January 1991, as Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services I announced funding for an additional 1781 places for 143 hostels throughout Australia .. Asbestos : Imports and Health Inquiries (Question No. 633) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 11 March 1991: (l) What action is the Government taking to prohibit importation of asbestos and its use (2) Has the Government instituted inquiries into the health effects of asbestos through (a) the National Health and Medical Research Council or (b) elsewhere; if so, what conclusions have been reached",183
387,Mr WILLIS,SECURITIES COMMITTEE,"The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The views of the members of National Occupational Health and Safety Commission have been recently sought on the occupational health and safety aspects of the importation of croci ite and amosite asbestos. It is anticipated that the Commission will consider the issue at its September 1991 meeting and report to me at that time. (2) (a) An examination of available records does not show any Government initiated review through the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). The Council did, however, review the health effects of asbestos on a number of occasions prior to 1985 and produced some important statements and publications including: Report on the health hazards of asbestos, prepared by the Asbestos Subcommittee of the NHMRC which was adopted by Council in June 1981 and published by the Australian Government Publishing Service in 1982. Asbestos: Statement by the National Health and Medical Research Council, June 1984. Statement on health hazards associated with the use of asbestos in the construction industry, October 1979. Code of practice for the safe removal of asbestos-based thermal-acoustic insulating materials, October 1979. In respect of NHMRC supported research a study is currently being funded at the University of Western Australia on the health effects of mesothelioma; funding is of the order of $100,000 for 1991. (b) Under the Australian Mesothelioma Research Program, a research study of six years' duration (1 January 1980-31 December 1985under the auspices of Worksafe Australia since 1 January 1985), notification of all cases of mesothelioma diagnosed in Australia during that period was sought. The original objectives of the Program were to: standardise diagnosis; advance knowledge related to occurrence; ascertain trends in incidence; establish the dose-effect relationship; and collaborate with other registers. Since 1 January 1986, the Australian Mesothelioma Register has continued to receive advice on all cases of mesothelioma in Australia. The Register notification enables continued monitoring of the incidence rate, the percentage of cases with asbestos exposure and the geographic and industry/occupation distribution of mesothelioma cases in Australia. I have been advised by Worksafe Australia that research projects based on the Mesothelioma Prodol- gram and control data have shown a clear doseresponse effect (ie, the higher the dose the higher the risk) when fibre dose is measured by fibre concentration in the lung. The highest risk is associated with long crocidolite (blue) asbestos fibres and long amosite (brown) asbestos fibres. I am advised that there is also a risk with chrysotile (white) asbestos fibres, but the magnitude of the risk is difficult to estimate from fibre concentrations in the lung, because of clearance of chrysotile from the lung (ie, the amount in the lungs at death does not necessarily reflect the exposure). Research has also shown that fibres are often found in the lungs of people with no history of asbestos exposure. This implies that absence of history does not necessarily mean absence of exposure. In May 1988, after extensive expert consideration and a three month public comment period, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission declared a code of practice and approved associated guidance notes as follows: Code of Practice for the Safe Removal of Asbestos-outlines the basic principles which should be followed in selecting the most suitable technique for the safe removal of asbestosbased thermal or acoustic insulation, including friable asbestos boards, and is aimed at minimising the concentration of airborne asbestos fibre; Guide to the Control of Asbestos Hazards in Buildings and Structures-provides the methods, procedures and work practices recommended for the identification, evaluation and control of hazards from in situ asbestos in the working environment; and Guidance Note on the Membrane Filter Method for Estimating Airborne Asbestos Dust-outlines the appropriate exposure standards for asbestos and the principles of result reporting and employer-employee consultation. As a result of recent research findings on the effects of exposure to chrysotile, Worksafe Australia has commenced a re-evaluation of the exposure standard in the Code of Practice.",187
