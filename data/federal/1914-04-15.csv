7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS FOR WIDOWS AND,"In reply to the honourable member I desire to say that I discussed with the State authorites some time ago the question raised by him. I then suggested to Mr Holman, the Premier of New South Wales, that he should set his officers to work to discover, if possible, in the vicinity of Sydney, an area of land which, while being suitable for oversea quarantine, would enable us to remove the station from the present site, and, at the same time, to set up a thoroughly equipped quarantine establishment for Federal and State purposes, in some equally advantageous situation. Nothing Minhas yet been done in regard to the matter, but Mr Holman promised me thab he would cause an investigation to be made at the earliest possible moment. NA RAILWAY.

13,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Account s have been rendered regularly to the State of New South Wales from a date shortly after the first occupation of the station by the patients in question, but no payment has yet been made. We did not receive any communication from the State Government suggesting even a doubt as to their liability to pay until about the middle of March last. Negotiations are still proceeding, the position of the Commonwealth Government being that we require to be reimbursed the full amount paid on behalf of the State. IMPORTATION OF WATTLE BARK.",14
14,Mr BENNETT,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Has the Minister of Trade and Customs read a report which appeared in the Argus of 2nd inst. in regard to evidence given before the Inter-State Comniission respecting the importation of wattle bark ?

15,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Togethe r with other evidence placed before the Inter-State Commission, that relating to the importation of wattle bark, particularly from South Africa, has naturally received our attention. We have received various communications on the subject, which is now being investigated by th© Commission; but since it is still sub judice it is impossible for me at this stage to say that any definite action will be taken. STANDING ORDERS: REMARKS BY PRIME MINISTER. .",14
16,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I desire to know, Mr Speaker, whether you have seen a report of the Prime Minister's statement that legislation was passed through this House last session only by straining the Standing Orders, and putting them to uses to which they were never put before; and, further, whether such remarks are not a gross reflection on yourself, and whether you will require the Prime Minister to apologize.",14
17,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I remind the honourable member that notice has already been given of a question bearing on this matter. So far as it relates to myself, I have seen references published in the papers to such a report, but I am not in a position to say whether or not it is correct, or what was in the Prime Minister's mind at the time. I do not propose to take any further notice unless the matter is brought before the House in a more definite way. NORTHERN TERRITORY-LAN D TAX .  ported in the Argus of today, that leases in the Northern Territory are for the future to be subject to the Federal land tax?",14
18,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have made no announcement to that effect, and I do not know where the inspiration of the paragraph came from. COST OF LIVING .",14
19,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will the Prime Minister tell the House what legislation he proposes to introduce to meet the cost of living, which, he states, has been towering up of recent years?",14
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am hoping that the general policy and administration of this Government will in time have a very sensible effect on this very serious and pressing problem. I am the more justified in making that statement from having seen figures supplied recently by Mr Knibbs, which show that, since this Government took office, the effective wage of the workers has begun to steadily increase. ADAMSTOWN RIFLE RANGE.",14
21,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is it a fact, that the Adamstown rifle range, covering the whole of the Northern District, has not had a target or any extra provision made, notwithstanding the establishment of the Citizen Defence Forces, and that it is not possible for the members of the Force3 to get musketry exercise?",14
22,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall bring the question under the notice of my colleague; but, as I have myself approved of work in connection with the Adamstown rifle range, I assume that my honourable friend's information is incorrect. SMALL-POX INNEW SOUTH WALES.  tention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to a paragraph in the newspapers of this morning to the effect that small-pox has broken out in Sydney. What steps does the honourable gentleman-, as chief of the Department, propose to take in the direction of protecting Queensland from this dire scourge?",14
23,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Las t year I laid on the table of the House a report of the Interstate Conference, dealing with this whole question, and the conditions under which the Commonwealth would be required to assist in the event of any future outbreak, or any increase in the intensity of the present outbreak.  way 1",15
24,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Honourable members will see the conditions laid down in that report. If there is any further information required, I shall be pleased to supply it. COMMONWEALTH AND STATES: FINANCES.",15
25,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Has the attention of the Treasurer been directed to a statement made before the Royal Commission on electoral matters by the Chief Electoral Officer of Queensland, to the effect that thab State is receiving £135,000 more uuder the per capita arrangement with the States tlian it is entitled to. Will the Treasurer make full inquiry as to whether the statement to which I have referred is true or otherwise ?",15
26,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"This matter has not come under my notice, and this is the first occasion on which I have heard of it. I shall be obliged if the orable member will put his question on the notice-paper, so that I may have a definite reply prepared. NA RAILWAY .",15
27,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is the Prime Minister aware that work at the Kalgoorlie end of the transcontinental railway has been suspended for over five weeks, and that valuable plant there is lying idle. Does the honourable gentleman propose to enter into negotiations, so that work may be resumed with the least possible delay?",15
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am aware that there has been a cessation of work at the western end of the railway, and I deeply regret the fact. I am not aware that anything the Government have done has caused this cessation of work. All I know is that the work is there for the men to go to, and that those who are engaged in pick and shovel work are striking against the wage of 12s. 6d. a day. I desire to add that the Government have substantially raised the wages of the men over and above those they were receiving during the time of our predecessors. We desire to deal with the men fairly, and, on the other hand, I think they ought to be prepared to deal fairly with the Government. I do not think that, in the circumstances, they were justified in dropping their tools, and leaving their work before the matter could be investigated.",15
29,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There have been more strikes than ever since .this Government came into power.,15
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is a fact that there is a number of disputes in connection with Government works, and that those disputes are continuing, notwithstanding that the Government have made conditions easier and better in every instance than they were in the time of our predecessors. ELECTORAL ROLLS.  Prime Minister whether the rumour in the newspapers that we are to have a new electoral roll, is correct. If so, is it intended to postpone any future election until the new rolls are completed?",15
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member touches a. sore point, and I suggest to him that he does not trouble about the next election. It is a fact that hon- we are trying our very best to clear up this roll muddle. Our rolls are in a shocking condition today, and I am afraid the present machinery will not clear them up and keep them clean.",15
32,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,How do you know they are in a shocking condition? Is it not a great reflection on your officers?,15
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think so. I think it is a reflection on our defective machinery. However, I do not wish to go into the matter now. Suffice it to say that we are trying to remedy these defects, and honourable members on both sides of the Chamber, irrespective of party, should be interested in a movement of that kind. SMALL-POX IN NEW SOUTH WALES.",15
34,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is it the intention of the Government to re-impose the quarantine embargo in New South Wales with a view to limiting the spread of small-pox ?,15
35,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member desire me to do so ?,16
36,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No . I simply asked the question.,16
37,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No such intention has ever been intimated by any member of the Ministry, and there is no such intention. The information we have is that the State Government is still continuing to do what they have been doing from the beginning, that is, endeavouring to grapple with the outbreak in the city of Sydney. ELECTORAL ADMINISTRATION .",16
38,Mr SHARPE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is it the intention of the Prime Minister to transfer the Electoral Department to control by the Postal Department? By doing so, does he not think the Commonwealth will be more satisfactorily served in regard to the compiling of rolls?",16
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I know of no intention to transfer the Electoral Department to the Post Office. I think the Post Office is already sufficiently loaded without adding to it functions"" of that kind. ELECTORAL ROLLS .",16
40,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A statement has appeared in the press that it is intended to have a police canvass in connection with the electoral rolls. Will the Prime Minister say whether that is correct; and will all those whom the police find to be off the rolls at the present time be prosecuted in accordance with the present law for uot being enrolled ?,16
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honor- by 6s. a week. able member will give notice of the question, I shall get hi m particulars by tomorrow. K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA 1n RAILWAY.",16
42,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is it not true the men employed on the railway work in Western Australia struck against l is . 6d. a day, and not 12s. 4d. ? Is not the Prime M in ister aware that the work of constructing the line is being carried on in a dry region, where men undergo considerable hardships, where there is no doctor, and no nurses or hospitals within 70 miles? In the circumstances, does not the Prime Minister think that it is fair for the men to receive wages at least equal to those being paid by private contractors on the same work ?",16
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is interesting to hear the implied tribute to the private contractor contained in the honourable member's question. According to the honourable member now, the private contractor is a man who pays better wages than the men could otherwise get. Private-contractor control would appear to be an excellent thing.",16
44,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Private contractors can rob the Commonwealth better than any one else.,16
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am not aware that any one is robbing the Commonwealth just now.,16
46,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That last contract of yours looks pretty shady, anyhow.",16
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If it is shady, I hope the honourable member will soon have an opportunity to demonstrate that fact to the House. I warn the honourable member, and-I warn his leader, that he will not find it so easy to establish the shadiness of it here as upon public platforms.",16
48,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why should not the Government pay a wage equal to that paid by the private contractor?,16
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member knows why; he knows that this private contractor has instituted a. system of task work.,16
50,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is not correct.,16
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We have in creased the wages of the men very considerably.,16
52,Mr HANS IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"B y 5s. per week.. Mr JOSE PH COOK - At the Port Augusta end, we have increased the wages Altogether, I think we have done a fair thing by these men. I admit the hardships they suffer. I admit all the disadvantages of distance and isolation, and that is all being expressed the price we ps.y, as well as in the matters we take to them in the shape of comforts of various kinds. Honourable members would be a little surprised if they knew all the things we are try i ng to do in looking after the welfare of these men. The matter of providing the doctor is under consideration.",16
53,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Unfortunately , we cannot find out what you are doing.",16
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I suggest to the honourable member that he puts this question on the notice-paper, and I shall supply the details tomorrow. CAPITAL SITE: EMPLOYMENT.",16
55,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I ask the AssistThe ant Minister of Home Affairs whether it Premiers. is a fact that there are now about 1,000 fewej' meu employed at the Federal Capimembers. tal than when the present Government took office, and why the work is being discontinued in the way it is?",17
56,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is not a fact bhat there are 1,000, or anything like 1,000, fewer men employed at the Federal Capipected tal than when the present Government took office. The fact is that the College, which has already cost £177,000, and has nothing whatever to do with establishment of the Federal City, has be got ready. now been completed, and the men enCommissioner gaged upon the construction of the Colmatter lego have gone off their labour. The prei sent stage of the Capital City construction is, as my predecessor will derstand, in the engineering period, at the last date on which I took the figures for the information of the honorwould able member for West Sydney there were more men employed on engineering works in the Federal Territory than there were when the present Government took office. NAVIGATION ACT.",17
57,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Can the Minister of Trade and Customs say what has become of the Navigation Act, what progress he and Federal electorates. has made with the regulations, and when he expects the Act to come into operaI tion?",17
58,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I. have reason to believe that a Navigation Act is still on the statute-book - Since we have been in office, the regulations have been pressed forward and furthered. An advertisement has already been inserted in the newspapers for the appointment of a Director of Navigation, and the matter of staffing the Central Office has received attention. The Act cannot be proclaimed until the regulations have been properly drafted and submitted to the consideration of the authorities contemplated by the Act itself. At this stage, I can give no idea as to the date on which the can be proclaimed. PREMIERS ' CONFERENCE.",17
59,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will the Prime M in ister, at the earliest possible opportunity, present to honourable members a verbatim report of the recent Conference Premiers and the Federal Government? Can it not be done almost immediately ?",17
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I doubt it . matter is in the hands of the State The moment the report is available, I will furnish it to honourable NA OFFICERS : ELECTOR AL ROLLS.",17
61,Mr BURCHELL,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,When is it exthat the seventy-five Divisional Returning Officers will be appointed M i l it a r y throughout Australia ?,17
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"At the earliest the moment that the appointments can The Public Service is busily engaged upon the at the present time, and the sooner t is done the better we shall be pleased.",17
63,Mr KING OMALLEY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Would it be unpossible to have five of these Returning and Officers in Tasmania, by reducing, say, the number in the States, so that one man run a city like Adelaide and two men a city like Melbourne, or a city like Sydney ? In that way, there could be five men in the State of Tasmania, and only seventy would be wanted in all.",17
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I understand that the conditions in Tasmania are very much simplified owing to the conterminous character of the boundaries of the State In addition, they already have one roll for Tasmania. wish we could have the same conditions applying all over Australia. It would simplify matters very much. We submitted the whole question to the late Premiers' Conference, but I think they did not deal with it favourably. I cannot promise to take any of the seventy-five of these officers away in order to give Tasmania five. If Tasmania is to get five on her own account, it will mean the appointment of five more than are at present contemplated, and our advices are that it is not necessary to do this in Tasmania.",17
65,Mr SHARPE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Can the Prime M in ister state whether it is not a fact that Act much of the information supplied to the electoral officials which enables them to take action against people who are not enrolled is supplied by post-office officials ?,17
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I am not aware of the fact. If the honourable member will put his question on the notice-paper, of State I shall make inquiries.",17
67,Mr THOMAS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Does the Prime Minister purpose appointing these Returning Omcers before this House has had an opportunity to vote the money ? .,17
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I think so. We regard the matter as somewhat urgent.,18
69,Mr THOMAS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"You spend £30,000 a year more ?",18
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I am afraid that is nothing to what my honourable friend used to spend without the authority of Parliament.,18
71,Mr THOMAS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,We had a majority in both Houses.,18
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Then , suppose we act as if we had.",18
73,Mr WEBSTER,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"In contemplating the appointment of these Returning Officers, did the Government make a calculation as to the cost; if so, will the 'Prime Minister inform the House of the estimated cost of the services of these officers",18
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Estimate s were, I believe, ]:>resented, and my recollection is that the cost has been worked out. It is estimated that when the whole business is carried through the cost will not be sensibly increased. I have not the details with me, but, if the honourable member will give notice of his question, I shall get them for him. . Mr Laird SMITH - Will the Prime Minister lay on the table all correspondence between the Federal Government and the Tasmanian Government in respect to the appointment of. these Divisional Returning Officers?",18
75,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I shall be glad to do so. TOBACCO INDUSTRY.  Trade and Customs, or have ""the GovernCommission. ment, done anything to assist the tobacco growers of Australia against the ization of the Tobacco Trust that was in operation when the last session ended?",18
76,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I think it is hardly fair to characterize what _ happened victimization. Questions were raised to whether a certain letter had been sent out. A conference was held with some the manufacturers, and information was given. Inquiries were made from the that is correct? different States, but the replies that we received did not indicate victimization. If the honourable member would like see them, I shall make them available him or to the House generally. There was certainly nothing done which would justify the Government in instituting proceedings for a breach of any existing law.  Government to increase the duties^ on foreign-grown tobacco and decrease the Excise on Australian-grown, so as to give the Australian growers a chance to live against the combine?",18
77,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,The present scheme of duties does give protection to Australian grown tobacco. ,18
78,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The intention of the duty was to encourage the use in Australia of Australian-grown tobacco, and' my personal feeling is that as Australian grown tobacco of a good quality can be grown we should expect the manufac? turers to give it every consideration, and use it in the manufacture of an Australian product. ",18
79,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"That is another point.. The honourable member is asking with regard to a question of policy. With regard to the other point, I must be fair, and say, as a Minister, that there are differences of opinion upon the question. As regards the general quality of all the Australian leaf that has been produced, evidence shows that parts of Australia can grow a magnificent quality of leaf, and, in fact, are growing it . The scheme of the duties undoubtedly was imposed by Parliament with a view to the encouragement of the Australian-grown leaf and* its utilization in Australian manufactures. The question of whether the existing duty is or is not satisfactory is a matter that could be inquired into by the Inter-State victimGOVERNMENT HOUSE, DARWIN.",18
80,Mr MATHEWS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I have been informed that the crockery used in Govern- as ment House, Darwin,. Northern Terrias tory, cost the Government more than the same commodity supplied to the Federal of Government House, Melbourne. Can the Minister of External Affairs say whether",18
81,Mr GLYNN,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I confess I do not know what the cost of the crockery has been at to Government House, Melbourne. I do not to think any orders have been given by the present Government for crockery to be supplied to the Territory. Some bills have come in for goods supplied to the order of a previous Government, and I know nothing more of the cost of crockery than is disclosed by these bills NA PURPOSES.",18
82,Mr RODGERS,HOESES FOE DEFENCE,"Can t,he Minister representing the Minister of Defence state whether the present or any previous Government have done anything beyond sending for a report in connection with the standardization of horses required for Defence purposes? The dustry is on a low footing in Australia, and if something were done in this regard it would bring about an improvement.",19
83,Mr KELLY,HOESES FOE DEFENCE,I shall bring this very important question under the attention of the Minister of Defence. NA,19
84,Mr CATTS,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether the Returning Officers who are to be. appointed will be appointed by him, or by some other M in ister, or by the Government; or are the appointments to be altogether independent of the Government? Mr JOSE PH COOK - The officers appointed are being taken into the Public Service by exactly the same method as is followed in regard to other appointments to the Service. The appointments are being made by the Public Service Commissioner.",19
85,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,Is it the object of.the Government to provide a number of Liberals with billets?,19
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"That is a dirty insinuation, and one worthy of the honourable member. This Government has made no appointments, to the Public Service. The honourable member must look nearer home for that kind of thing.",19
87,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,How many Labour men are to be appointed ? MILITARY COLLEGE .,19
88,Mr FALKINER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"I wish to know from the Minister of Home Affairs if the Militar y College, which has cost £177,000, isgood enough for the students, and how many students can be accommodated' in it?",19
89,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"The frrsft question is onefor the Defence Department. It is feasible that anything that the Depart[2] ment of Home Affairs might construct would not be good enough for the Department of Defence. I shall have inquiries made to ascertain whether the Defence Department is satisfied with what we have done for it . I am not aware if the college has yet its full complement of cadets. I understand that a fresh, batch, of cadets is joining now. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - How many can be accommodated there?",19
90,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"I believe 147, but I am not sure. I shall obtain full particulars, and let honourable members have the in light-horse in - formation tomorrow. LIGHTHOUSES.",19
91,Mr TUDOR,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs when, it is intended to bring the Lighthouse* Act into operation so that the light dues may be collected by the Commonwealth instead of by the States?",19
92,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"During the few months OFFICERS. we have been in office we have expedited matters as much as possible, and have appointed a Director and central staff and other officers. But no attempt was made by our predecessors to approachthe Governments of the States in regard to the remission of the light dues upon the transfer of the control of the lighthouses to the Commonwealth. Consequently, we put before the State Premiers, when we met them in conference the other day, the desirability of their Governments relieving the shipping of the Commonwealth of taxation t.o the extent of the expenditure of which we were relieving them.",19
93,Mr TUDOR,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,What will this Government do if the State Governments refuse to act?,19
94,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"This Government will go straight on, and carry out its constitutional dnties; but we were bound,, in the interest of Australian shipping, to place the .position before the Premiers; It seemed unfair that ship-owners should be taxed twice for the one service. TAEIF F EEVISION.",19
95,Mr KING OMALLEY,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Can the Minister of Trade and Customs tell .us when we shall have an opportunity to amend the Tariff by increasing the duties on some articles, and lessening those on others ?",19

99,Mr JH CATTS,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,Hav e not tenders already been called for?,20
100,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Tender s were called for Speech, in respect of part of the work, but I was not satisfied with the offers received, I am endeavouring now to get better terms for the Commonwealth by offering ment?

In addition to the three works which have named, for which one contract is being called, tenders will also be immediately for the construction of the main sewer, which will be a big work. I understand that tenders will be invited with in a week.",20
101,Mr JH CATTS,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Is it a fact that tenders were called for in connection with the reservoir at Mount Stromlo, and that the only one received stated an amount which was £5,000 in excess of the departmental estimate of the cost of the work?",20
102,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,No .,20
103,Mr JH CATTS,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,Will the Minister inform the House of the result of the calling for tenders for that work? - Mr KELLY - I should like the honourable member to give notice of that question. INSPECTI ON OF POTATOES.,20

112,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"A fortnight ago I sent to the Minister of Trade and Customs a telegram, to which I have received no reply, advising him that shipments of maize, infested with corn moth, one of the worse diseases that can infect produce, were being landed in Sydney and Brisbane from South A f r i c a . I wish to know what action has been taken to protect the Australian growers of produce.",20
113,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"On receipt of the telegram, inquiries were made by telegraph in Brisbane and Sydney, and i think that a letter is now in the post informing the honourable member of the result of the in vestigations of the Department. It was discovered that the maize imported into New South Wales gave no indication of the presence of the pest, though signs the of the moth were found in some of the sacks in which the maize had been imported into Queensland. This maize was toemptied out of the sacks, and closely examined by the State authorities. The bags were subjected to treatment, and be every precaution was taken to safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth, to prevent the pest from petting into the country.",20
114,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,The Minister's information is wrong.,21
115,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"If the honourable member has better information, I shall be following paper: glad if he will give it to me.",21

117,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"No one in Melbourne oan say what is happening in Sydney or Brisbane. Time must be allowed for the officers to make inquiries and to report. If the honourable member knows that the reports are false in any particular, he should, in the public interest, let me know at once what is wrong, so that the proper action may be taken.",21
118,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,I shall do that. TELEPHONE INQUIRY.,21
119,Mr SHARPE,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"I wish to know from the Postmaster-General if it a Board of Inquiry has been appointed Rules to discover the defects of our telephone system, and that it consists of officers nected with the Department.

Mr KENDELL brought up the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's Speech, prepared by the Committee appointed this day, and it was read by the Clerk, as follows: MAY IT PI.EA.SE YOUR EXCELLENCY: We, the House of Representatives, of Parliament of the Commonwealth of Austraabsolutely lia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious and to thank your Excellency for the Speech which you have beun pleased to address to Parliament.",21
122,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Corio) [3.57] - I move That the Address be agreed to by the Before dealing with the political questions covered by the Governor General's who Speech, I desire to express my regret at the approaching departure of His cellency from Australia. His Excellency has discharged the duties of his high dignified office with credit to himself, I am sure, with a great deal of benefit to the people of Australia. Socially, His Excellency and his good lady have been extremely popular, and they will be much missed. Although Lord Denin man is severing his official connection wealth Government. with Australia, I feel sure that he will not cease to speak and work in its terests when he returns to the Old Land, knee. and that we shall find that, although immediately connected with us, he still has at heart the well-being and advancecrossed. ment of Australia. My sincere wish is that every happiness and prosperity shall be the lot of His Excellency, his good lady, and his family. I wish now to press my appreciation of the honour which the Government have conferred upon by assigning to me the duty of submitmade ting this motion. I regard it as a comto pliment, not only to myself, but to constituents. My experience of honorvernment, able members justifies my anticipation their forbearance while I deal very with the questions covered by His Excellency's Speech. I ask for their forbearance, since I have, unfortunately, a very bad cold. We are told that a cold always attacks the weakest spot, and is, perhaps, because of this tendency the cold has settled in my head. I need not concern myself, at the present time, with the opening clauses in His Excela lency's Speech. They deal with matters that were the subject of considerable bate last session, and they speak for themselves today. It is not my desire to utter one word that will unduly extend the debate on this motion. We have heard repeatedly during the recess that the last session of the Commonwealth Parliament was barren of results. That taunt has constantly been hurled at us by members of the Opposition, and, in the the circumstances, we felt that it was necessary that the House should be given an early opportunity to Sovereign retrieve its position.",24
123,Mr WEBSTER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,To repeat the dose.,24
124,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"I trust that the honourable member will not suggest anything of the kind. I am not a glutton House. in the matter of dissolutions and elections, and I always contend that the man prates about his anxiety to go before his constituents at a general election is a Exgood deal of a humbug. Passing by the first four clauses in the Governorand General's Speech, I come to that relatand ing to the Conference of State Premiers which closed only a few days ago. For the first time, so far as I am aware, in the history of such gatherings, the State Premiers in conference were approached a truly Federal spirit by the Common",24
125,Mr WEBSTER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"The Commonwealth in Government approached them on bended not . Mr KENDELL - I am afraid that my honourable friend has got his wires The Commonwealth Government approache.d the Conference of State Premiers with a full recognition of the importance of State rights, fully conscious exof the fact that the States existed, and were doing a useful work before Federame tion was thought of, and that they had it possible for the. Commonwealth be created. As the result of the attimy tude adopted by the Commonwealth Go the Conference was fruitfu l in of achievements the like of which had never briefly been even nearly approached before. ",24
126,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"I shall endeavour, a little later on, to show what the Conferi t ence has made it possible for this Parthat liament to do. One of the questions discussed by it was the transfer of the State debts, and if as a result of the Conference solution of that difficult problem can be arrived at an enormous saving will debe secured to the people of Australia. I trust that honourable members will throw no obstacle in the way of sucb a happy consummation. The position of the Comyears, monwealth Bank was also the subject discussion at the Conference. I have always held that the true function of the Commonwealth Bank is to transact the whole of the banking business of the Commonwealth and State Governments, including the flotation, redemption, conversion of loans. It appears to me that the offer made by the States to transto fer its current accounts to the Commonsettlers wealth Bank in exchange for the small savings bank business which that instituof tion is now carrying on is a very liberal one, and I think we ought to embrace without demur. The honourable member for Darwin will agree with me to a very large extent on this question. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The proposal means a segregation of strength.",24
127,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"No ; it means an aggregation of strength. If the decision rested with me I should jump at the offer made by the States. Mr KING O'MALLEY - My belief is that the Commonwealth and States should work in unison, and should be repreRecently sented on a board to control the National bank.",25
128,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"The honourable memwork ber is an authority on these questions, and I may say, in passing, that I would take his advice on business matters readily as I would that of any other member of the Opposition. The question of a uniform railway gauge was brought before the Conference of State Premiers, and I hope that the action taken will lead to a uniform gauge for Australia. We, as practical men, know that the cultural Colleges? longer we defer dealing with this question the greater must be the cost. I have long entertained the idea that the laying down of a third rail would be one means of getting over the difficulty of securing uniformity without going to the heavy expense of laying down new tracks. fore the matter is finally settled, some such scheme may be evolved. In any event, I am convinced that action must be taken in the near-future to deal with the question. Reference is made Excellency's Speech to the agreement arrived at between the Commonwealth chance! and the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia in regard to the use and control of the Murray waters. It would be incorrect, perhaps, to say this has been a burning question for many but it has undoubtedly been a very of important one. No one will deny that we shall be wise in endeavouring to conserve the thousands of millions of gallons of water which are annually allowed to escape into the sea. The scheme for dealing with the Murray waters will not only and give employment to thousands of men on a reproductive work, but will enable us place at least an additional 500,000 along that great river and its tributaries. In the succeeding paragraph His Excellency's Speech we have reference to a subject which is certainly reit lated to that witli which I have just dealt. I refer to the statement that the Government hope to place before Parliament proposals for State and Commonwealth co-operation in regard to immigration. I have always maintained that this Parliament should have a hand in the work of immigration. The Commonwealth should select the immigrants and land them on our shores, first satisfying themselves that the States have made ample provision for their reception. I saw a letter in the press, in reply to some arguments advanced as to the unsuitability of some immigrants for on the land and their utter want ofknowledge in this regard. That letter recommended that a training farm should as be established in the Old Country; and while thoroughly agreeing with the idea, my opinion, is that such a farm should be established in each State here, in order to give our own boys an opportunity of learning what can be done with land. ",25
129,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Thos e colleges are beyond average town boys; and I suggest a different plan. We know that there are tens of thousands of boys growing up in the towns every year without the slightest Beknowledge of what the land can produce or how to produce it. A great many of those boys, no doubt, desire to remain in the town, but numbers of them would, no doubt, be willing to go and work in the in His country if they knew how.",25
130,Dr MALONEY,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,If they had the,25
131,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"If they had the chance; and I venture to say that I could select in each State a mixed farm where that boys could get six months' training, which would convert thern into a valuas able asset to this country-conver t into a source of profit to themselves their parents.",25
132,Mr WEBSTER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,In six months?,26
133,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Yes , in six months. I venture to say that, having had forty years' experience of farming",26
134,Mr WEBSTER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,And yet do not underwhich stand it !,26
135,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"I should not go to the honourable member for farming Northern lessons, anyhow. I have expressed my idea on the matter, and I shall not dwell longer on it, seeing that it will come for discussion later.",26
136,Mr WEBSTER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,What about paragraph 3 of His Excellency's Speech ?,26
137,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"I shall deal with progress, that later.",26
138,Mr WEST,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Pa y men decent wages, and'they will go on the land.",26
139,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"That interjection laws brings me to the question of the high cost work of living. Do honourable members think to that the cost of production can be inthey creased day after day, and year after year, without the selling price of the article produced also being increased? Honourable members talk about "" a decent wage ' ' ; and I suppose they think that if men were paid £10 a week for their work people should still be asked to their wheat for 2s. 6d. a bushel - That is the way in which honourable members opposite talk because they do not happen to produce wheat.",26
140,Mr WEBSTER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,When the Liberals were running the country the honourable member got only Is. 9d. a bushel for his wheat.,26
141,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"When the Liberals were running the country I used to get 4s. 6d. and 5s. for my wheat, and yet the to loaf of bread was cheaper than it is toha-vpass day. I notice that reference is made His Excellency's Speech to the Inter-State country. Commission's Tariff inquiry. I have followed the evidence given before the Commission, and I am satisfied that it is going thoroughly into the questions placed before it . I hope that shall soon be in possession of a progress report, which will enable this House to deal, partially afc any rate, with a certain number of items, and place the industries of Australia on thoroughly sound footing, having regard to the interests of the consumers as well to the interests of the producers. ' The them question of the development of the and Northern Territory nodoubt suggests the need for a great deal of information and much thought to enable the Minister of External Affairs to deal witli it in a satisfactory manner. I believe that at the present time that honourable gentleman is in possession of information will enable him to place a policy before this House for the development of the Territory. It seems to me that the Territory, like every other part of Australia, will have to be pioneered by the pastoralists. We shall have to up supply those who enter into the pastoral industry' there with means of conveying their produce to the seaports, and thence tb the markets; and then, as they make closer settlement will, no doubt, follow. As to the coming session, I trust that, if honourable members opposite desire to assist the Government in enacting to give effect to a good deal of the done at the Premiers' Conferenceassist the Government in enacting laws for the benefit of Australia as a wholewill early, indicate their desire. If , on the other hand, they are determined to fight the Government, then the. sooner they show that determination, and the sooner the ""whole box and dice"" of us go back to the people for fresh orders, the better I shall be satisfied, whether I sell am returned again or not. Thank goodness, I could live before I came to this Parliament, and I can live if I do not come back to it . We are, I believe, all anxious in our own particular way, and from our own points of view, to 'do the best for the people of Australia. There is no doubt a wide difference of opinion between the two sides of the House. Parties are very evenly balanced; and I should like to see the whole of us unite for about a couple of months peaceably into law measures which would e the effect of affording employment in and furthering the development of the",26
142,Mr BAMFORD,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,Suppos e that we unite for the purpose of electing a Ministry we from both sides of the House?,26
143,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"That plan, of course, might have worked years ago. It seems to me, however, that, if we proceeded to elect a Ministry from both sides a of the House, the side having t i e majority would decidedly desire to have the "" thick end of the stick "" in the'election.",26
144,Mr WEBSTER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,Whic h side has the majority ?,27
145,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"We on this side claim to have the majority. The question of the initiative and the referendum was raised today by a notice of motion that was given; and if such a change could bring about a better state of affairs than was the case during last session I should welcome it . to me, however, from the little experience I had here last session, that, if the people issued a mandate, and that mandate did not please the majority in the House, it would not be carried .out. If it were possible to have this House 'bound to carry out such a mandate under certain penalties, I should welcome the plan. have taken up sumcient time; and, as I am not very well, the honourable member for Robertson, who is to follow me, has promised to deal with any'points I may have omitted to mention.",27
146,Mr WEBSTER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,Wba t about paragraph 3 ?,27
147,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,I shall leave the honourable member for Robertson to deal with paragraph 3 of His Excellency's Speech.,27
148,Mr WEBSTER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,The honourable member himself promised to deal with . it .,27
149,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"The honourable member need not ask any question about paragraph 3, because that paragraph .speaks for itself. I trust that the present session will be more f r u it f u l in good work than the last, and that the feeling in the House will be kindly from start to finish. If we have to say hard things of each other's policy, we need not employ hard sayings to each other personally. I thank the whole of the House for the very kind hearing bhat has been given me. I have spoken with much difficulty; and I am sure I should have fel t nervous but for the fact that in the past I have received so much consideration all round the .chaniber.",27
150,Mr FLEMING,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Robertson) [4.25] - I rise to second the motion, and I may say at the outset that I am prepared to deal witli paragraph 3 of {Lis Excellency's Speech. The previous speaker has been asked why he did not deal with that paragraph 3. I am quite prepared to deal with it , and * say what I believe it means. The function of .a Legislature is ,to put into concrete law the will' .of .the dominant political factor of the day. When the previous Admin istration were in power, they brought in a law which put the people' of Australia in an entirely new political .position. - No doubt, they thought they were doing that work as representing the dominant political factor of the day, but there are two things to be. considered when dealing with a question of this kind. The It appears first is-ha s the dominant political factor actually expressed itself at the ballot box; the second is-r-is the party in power able to construe properly the will"" of the dominant political factor? Thp position that has arisen in the Commonwealth is that the previous Administration, when in power, brought into operation a law altogether new to Australia, and one I think I which was directly opposed to the principles of the British Empire and honest Britisli fair play.",27
151,Mr BURNS,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,When did they pass that law?,27
152,Mr FLEMING,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,B y an administjative act they gave preference to unionists.,27
153,Mr JENSEN,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,It was not a law.,27
154,Mr FLEMING,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"The function of a Legislature is two-fold - administrative and legislative-and , to my mind, the administrative is the more important. I have often heard it said, "" Let me write the songs of the people, and I care not who makes the laws."" From our earliest childhood, we have seen the effects of administration. In the United States of America, the Courts are overriding the Legislature .every day,' showing that an administrative act is always of more i m portance than legislation. However, what I wish to arrive at is this: Paragraph 3 of the Governor General's Speech has a deep and significant meaning, not only for the House, but for all Australia, because it touches on the primary principles of the British Empire. The paragraph stands for British liberty and fair play. We on this side are striving for equality of the people in the eyes of the law, the fundamental principle on which British liberty is based; but it quite lay with the past Administration to deny to the people of Australia the operation of that fundamental principle. Another meaning in paragraph 3 is that we believe in equality of opportunity at the ballot-box. In fact, we believe in these two great forms of equality - equalit y in the eyes of the law, .and .equality of pjppprtunity at the ballot-box; and when we give the people these, there need be no further talk-and we .hear it whispered here and there today-of social revolution. Never in the history of the world has there been social revolution of any moment where the people have had free expression of opinion at the ballot-box, and where they have been treated equally before the law; and we on this side of the chamber stand all the time for liberty in those two respects. That is the meaning of paragraph 3; and when we go before the people, I at least shall be prepared to go on the platform and fight it from beginning to end. There are two other very important matters in the Speech; one is the handling of our facilities, the term in the broadest possible sense, as they exist today. There'can be no doubt that the Prime Minister, at the recent Conference of the Premiers of the States, went far towards putting us in a position to use to the very best advantage the facilities as they exist in Australia today. But we can go beyond that. When we come to deal with the development of our resources, it seems to me that any one who is in earnest need only look through the Speech of the Governor General and see in three paragraphstake paragraphs 9, 15, and 16-that there has emanated from the present Administration what might truly be called a big Australian policy. If we look merely at the way in which the Government are prepared to handle the Commonwealth Bank, we see the difference between the present Administration and the previous. The previous Administration put up a skeleton with no life in it ; but the present Prime Minister went to the Premiers' Conference and breathed life into the figure; so that all that now remains is to put it properly to workthe life is in it . We have done away with the pettifogging ideas of the previous Administration. The proposal now is to deal with the National Bank in a broad national manner, on a basis which is just and generous and vigorous, as should be the policy of a National Bank. Why need the National Bank of Australia go pettifogging round with savings which were well handled, and have been well handled for many years, by the States ? Instead of that, the Prime Minister launched out and offered a vigorous .policy, which the Premiers of the States, ilfr. Fleming. whether they were with us or against us, were quite prepared to accept.",27
155,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,He offered nothing new.,28
156,Mr FLEMING,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"He arrived at something new, and that is the main thing; in fact, thati is the difference between the parties. Honourable members opposite always offer things new, but never get there; whereas we do the new thingswe arrive. That is the fundamental difference between the two parties. I do not wish to delay too long in this matter, but it seems to me that there are a couple of striking omissions from the Speech. There is no mention 'of our interests in the Pacific, and there is no using mention of the Post and Telegraph Department. I sincerely hope that the Postal Department will be pushed on for all it is worth, because there is no matter of greater importance to country dwellers and those in the far-distant parts of the Commonwealth than the proper development of the post and telegraph system.",28
157,Mr RILEY,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,You are colonial; be national!,28
158,Mr FLEMING,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"I am a colonial as is said, but that is no reason why I should turn my back on the main principles that have made the British Empire possible. That is why I strongly support, to the best of my ability, the Speech of the Governor General ; because it puts - forward a comprehensive policy for Australiawhat we might call a big Australian policy; and it goes further, and gets down to the fundamental principles. We are going to stand for equality for all people in the eyes of the law, and equality of opportunity at the ballot-box, and upon these principles we are prepared to stand or fall. Debate (on motion by Mr FISHER) adjourned. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) proposed - That the House, at its rising, adjourn until tomorrow at half-past 2 o'clock p.m.",28
159,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Kennedy) [4.34] In fixing the sessional orders in relation to the sittings of the House, has the Prime. Minister taken info consideration the desirability of sitting three days of the week only?",28

CORN MOTH - DAYS OF SITTING - . DIVISIONAL RETURNING OFFICERS. Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) posedTbat the House do now adjourn.,28
161,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Brisbane) [4.35] - I wish in a few words to refer to a matter that I have already brought under notice. The request of the Minister of Trade and Customs must be my excuse. I wish to inform the House, and through the House the Minister, of the exact position. Two shipments of maize have already been landed in Australia from South Africa , the bags being branded, I understand, "" Maize, sound, clean, and good, from South A f r i c a . "" A large portion of the shipments was landed in Sydney without any difficulty, and immediately went into consumption, but a portion of both shipments went to Brisbane, and in both cases the maize was condemned. The Minister has said that a few bags were condemned; but I think my information is correct-that the whole of the Brisbane shipment, amounting to over 1,000 bags, was condemned. It is futile for the Minister to say that a few bags only were found infested with corn moth. I saw three sacks landed which were simply infested with the cocoon unhatched of the moth, while I have testi' mony to the effect that on the wharf where the maize was landed the hot, moist, humid weather was hatching, out the moths by hundreds. These moths were finding their way all over the country. It is not a question of every precaution having been taken. The fact is that the maize has been landed in Sydney, while the very same shipment was condemned in Brisbane out of the same ship. It is impossible to imagine that the maize would be infested in Brisbane, and not equally infested in'Sydney. Of course, they might not hatch out so quickly in Sydney, but the fact remains that there has now been landed in Sydney several thousand bags of South African maize infested with one of the most dangerous pests that can possibly affect the farmers of this country.",29
162,Mr RILEY,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,Who are the fanners' friends now ?,29
163,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"The position would be somewhat humorous if it had not its serious aspect, because the party who are admitting this maize into the country are the farmers' party, who pose before the community as the sincere and particular friends of the farmers; yet here, through their officers in Sydney proparticularly, they are allowing this pest to come in .",29
164,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,Whose officers in Sydney - the Commonwealth's or the State's?,29
165,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,They .are not State officers. It is a miserable quibble on the part of the Minister to say that they are State officers.,29
166,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"I asked, ""Who are they?""",29
167,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"The Minister should be the last to ask me what officers were dealing with the import. 'Every ordinary member of this House knows that the officers who are handling these matters in the States are the State officers, subsidized or paid by the Commonwealth to carry out the quarantine work, and the Minister should not shelter himself behind the idea that they are State officers.",29
168,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,The honourable member was suggesting that the Government had done this thing themselves.,29
169,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,The Minister surely does not wish us to believe that he ib not responsible for oversea imports.,29
170,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"No , - I did not say so.",29
171,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"This matter is entirely and absolutely in the hands of the Federal authorities. The State officers are simply acting in the Customs Department as quarantine officers for the time, and the State Departments are paid by the Federal Government for their work. My contention is that any future shipments of this produce sliould be absolutely prohibited in the interests of the farming community of the Commonwealth. I notice that shipments of maize are arriving from Java. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that we are in .danger of the introduction of an equally insidious and dangerous pest with maize from Java. If the Ministerial party are as anxious to protect the farming community as they profess to be, the Minister will see that immediate steps are taken, not only to prevent the importation of maize from South Africa , but to cause the most caref u l investigation to be made with regard to the shipments expected fro m Java. Mr CONROY .(Werriwa) [4.44] - I should like to draw the attention of the Prime Minister and of the House to the question already raised by the honourable member for'Kennedy with regard to the House sitting three days per week. House has been sitting four days per week for some years past. No other Legislature in the world attempts to sit for the same length of time, and the against it are many. In the first place, if Ministers are occupied with their duties in the House for four days a week, the control of administrative matters pass from their hands into the hands of the officials, and it. is clearly the duty of Parliament to prevent this, whatever side is in power. If Ministers' time is taken up with administrative matters, they cannot be occupied at the same time with the legislative matters that have to be attended to while the House is sitting. the House sitting for four days in the week affairs are frequently at a high tension, and this is very trying for the health of members. We saw that two members died last session, and probably the length of sittings had something to do with the fact. When we have been wrangling for a long time, the strain of the week's, work is too great upon members, and the only relief that they are able to get is by going out of the chamber and staying out during a large part of the debates. again, is not in the best interests of parliamentary government, because men ought to be able to sit here for the whole time. If we want to test how long men may devote themselves to intellectual work, we shall find that in all countries the amount of intellectual work men may do is limited in the bulk of instances, in the case of the law, at any rate, to something five hours a day. A man is not, as a rule, able to give full attention to his work beyond that time. Of course, we know that there are exceptions, but I am taking the generality of cases. men are sitting here every day, how is it possible for them to do what should do in the direction of finding out whether similar legislation has been introduced in other countries, and what its effect is, and to give the benefit of the knowledge thus acquired to other members who have probably been engaged inother work? To enable us to do that, I think this House would be doing an excellent thing by adopting the three days of sitting per week, which is certainly as long as men should sit to attend .to their legislative work. We find that the best men devote something dike hours, in the whole'week to judicial - work. Mr Conroy. This House might well take note of the The fact, and revert to a sane procedure. If we sit too long, the effect is to delay in stead of hasten legislation. A feeling of irritation is set up in the minds of men.. reasons rendering them incapable of taking that sound and calm judgment of matters that certainly should be brought to bear on legislative work. I think I am well must within the mark in saying that practically two-thirds of the members on both sides of the House are thoroughly agreed that the House now sits too long. To adopt the usual hours w i ll cause no delay inlegislation, but will distinctly encourage a quicker procedure. It will be to the advantage of every man in the House-, With and of the country, if the days of sitting are limited to three. I would ask the Government to take the matter into their early and serious consideration.",29
172,Mr KING OMALLEY,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Darwin) [4.47] - I agree with the honourable member for Werriwa with regard to the House sitting only three days a week. I desire to discuss with the Prime Minister a littl e matter affecting Tasmania. I cannot see why that State should be deprived of itsfive Divisional Returning Omcers simply That, because it is small. Napoleon was a l it t l e man, and yet he conquered Europe. Some of the greatest minds that Australia ever produced came from Tasmania. Tasmania is the mother of Australia, and why should it not get five Divisional Returning Officers? W it h regard to the* other States, let us take Brisbane as an instance. There will be three orfour like constituencies in that city, and oner Divisional Returning Officer with a clerk could manage them. The same would' apply to Adelaide; and then without having to increase the cost we could have When five in Tasmania. The five divisions are; absolutely separate in Tasmania. Hobart they is only one constituency, and the others? come, into the suburbs of Hobart. I want the Prime Minister to look into the matter, and see if he cannot put Tasmania, on the samelevel as the other States. When I was there last there was a lot of ill-feeling; not alone on the Labour side, but on the side that my honourable friend represents. In.fact, men whom I met said that, ithey did not consider the proposal was fair. I wired to the Prime Ministerpointing this out at the time, but I hoped' to see him later on, and had not the opportunity. I hope he will do justice to - twenty-five little Tasmania, not on account of herr weakness, but on account of the fact that all the States must be treated on an equality, and the cry must be justice to all. We must not give the big States the supreme control.",30
173,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Darling Downs-Min ister of Trade and Customs) [4.50] - As I told the honourable member for Brisbane in regard to the shipments of maize, we received a report that a number of the bags had been examined, ,and that in the sacks only was this pest discovered, and that every sack that was affected was properly treated by the officers. , I think Mr Knowles, the State officer, was in charge of this matter, and the report we received from him through the proper channels was to the effect that the whole shipment had been satisfactorily dealt with. As regards Sydney, inquiries were made, and the information we have received from the State omcers there was that in no instance were these importations affected by the disease.",31
174,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,Ye t they were all out of one shipment.,31
175,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Tw o boats were mentioned-the Sumatra and the Java. The honourable member can take the assurance that the Department, generally speaking, from a central administrative point of view, is eager to keep but of Australia any pest likely to be injurious. I do not know whether he has any other information than what he has already given to the House. If he has, I shall be very glad if he will supply it to me, and shall immediately get the whole matter reported on, and, if necessary, additional inquiries made.",31
176,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Kennedy) [4.52] If what the Minister has just said is true, we are up against oue of the most serious things that could happen to those who grow maize in Australia. The honourable member has told the House that the bags were examined, and that in all the bags the corn moth was discovered.",31
177,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"I did not say it was covered in every sack. I said that in all the cases in which it was discovered it wus immediately dealt with, according to the report, so as to prevent the possibility of the introduction of the pest.",31
178,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"That was only in relation to the sacks, and not in relation to the maize.",31
179,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"The maize was examined, and the moths were not found in it .",31
180,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"l t would not be possible to examine every grain of maize, or even to make any thorough general examination. The discovery of the moths in the bags is a very serious matter, and the whole of the shipment should have been destroyed. We are suffering in Australia from the introduction of pests in the past, and any Minister, whether Labour or Liberal, should be most careful, and even drastic, in deal? ing with these matters. There is not a pest in Australia today that cannot be traced to some particular importation, and laxity ou the part of those who are administering matters at the time has permitted these pests to cause considerable damage to the whole of the farming community. The whole of the potato crop of Australia has been in certain years practically destroyed through the introduction of a disease. The same remarks apply to the fruit-fly, and to a number of. other pests that have - come in from time to time. The most drastic measures should be taken to prevent the introduction of this new pest, even though the destruction of forty shipments of maize might be necessary. Should the pest get a footing in the country, it would seriously affect the locally-grown maize, and at the present time we have to go to a great deal of expense to keep down the weevil pest. I did not know that maize was imported into this country. Certainly no other crop growsmore luxuriantly here, and enormous yields of maize have been - obtained in almost every part of the Commonwealth. Every endeavour should be made to prevent the introduction of pests, and in fected shipments should be destroyed. The pest in question is very minute, and could not easily be detected by the examination of a few samples of grain. Coming to another matter referred to by thw honourable member for Werriwa, the suggestion that we should sit fewer days, dis- per week, I would point out that. this. Parliament sits more hours a day, and more days a week, than any other in Australia. The length of our sittings, aud the consequent strain imposed on the first occupant, of the chair, wa*largely responsible for his death, which was a disaster to theCommonwealths When I occupied the chair I was at the end of the session in a state of health which, made it very painful, to continue my duties, and you, Mr Speaker, will bear me out in the statement that each week the fourth day's sitting is a great trial, and that the occupant of the chair is then in a state in which it is very diffi- If cult for him to do justice to the position. Further, the sittings of Parliament being extended over four days, Ministers have not the opportunities which they should have for administrative work, and there is a danger that they may be forced into becoming mere automata for the approval of the decisions of the permanent heads of the Departments. It would be better for the work of the House, as well as the administration of the Departments, if we sat only three days a week. There is a general impression abroad that a member's work is confined to attending the sittings of the House; but, as a matter of fact,five-sixthsof it is done out of the Chamber. There is nothing more tiring and exhausting than the examination of documents and statistics to obtain the information with which members have to prime themselves to do justice to the work of Parliament. In addition, they have an enormous correspondence to attend to, some of them having to deal with more than 100 letters a week on the average. In the interests of good government, and of the health of members, we should sit only three days a week.",31
181,Mr LIVINGSTON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Barker) [5.0]. - The attention of the Minister having been drawn to the danger of the importation of pests from South Africa, I hope that he will take immediate action to provide proper preventive measures. There are in South Africa a number of pests which are not yet established in Australia, 'one of them affecting wattle bark, which is imported here. We have suffered a great deal from the introduction of pests, unwittingly or innocently. Rabbits, foxes, and other animals have done a great deal of mischief, and there are in addition all the insect and other pests which have been brought here. I hope that the Ministry will carefully consider how the introduction of pests can best be prevented, and will give special consideration to the pests likely to be introduced by the importation of wattle bark.",32
182,Mr MCGRATH,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Ballarat) [6.9) We have been informed by the Minister of Trade and Customs that of a shipment of maize half that - was landed at Sydney - was found to be free from corn moth, and the other half, which was landed at Brisbane, was found to be infected. I take it that the inspection in Sydney was lax. That reveals a very serious position. laxity in the examination of one importation can be proved, it may obtain generally, and under a lax system we do not know what pests may not be introduced. It is not likely that only that portion of the maize which was landed in Brisbane was affected by the corn moth. The chances are that the whole shipment was infected, but that the pest was not discovered in Sydney because the examination there was lax. The officials who have been guilty of laxity should be brought to book by the Minister. The farmers of Australia have already enough to do to make ends meet, and we do not want to add to their burden. The honourable member for Gippsland laughs at that, although, in his district, there are very large growers of maize, and they are much interested in this matter. It is no laughing matter to the farmers about places like Orbost. They are anxious that there should be the most thorough examination of all importations. It surprises me that maize is imported into Australia, seeing how much we produce. I trust that the Minister will not rest content with the explanations that he has received from his oflicials, and that he will order a further investigation to ascertain who is to blame. As to the suggestion that we should sit only three days a week, I would say that were we sitting in a chamber that was properly ventilated we might, perhaps, well sit four days.",32
183,Mr COWBOY,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,There would still not be time to deal with our correspondence properly.,32
184,Mr MCGRATH,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"That may be a difficulty with some members; as a Victorian, living near home, I have not so much travelling to do as have the representatives from other States. Probably Victorians have more time than they to deal with their correspondence. I trust that the Prime Minister, when framing the sessional orders, will give consideration to the request that has come from both sides that we shall sit on only three da^a a week. Reference has been made to the great losses of last session. The honourable gentleman did me a good turn in providing me with a three weeks' spell at a time when, owing to the laborious nature of the work, I badly needed it. In connection with my suspension",32
185,Mr SPEAKER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"I ask the honourable member not to anticipate the discussion on a motion of which notice has been given. Mv. MCGRATH. - I am anxious that the discussion of that motion may come on, so that I may say a word or two the subject of my suspension.",33
186,Mr BENNET T,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Gippsland) [5.7] I had no intention of addressing the House this afternoon, and I have never before offended in connection with a momoth. tion for adjournment, but I wish to reply to certain reflections which were made upon me deliberately by the honourable cypher member's member for Ballarat. Gippsland is practically the only maize-growing constituency in Victoria, and has produced best average yield of maize obtained anyorable where in the world, a yield of 60 bushels to the acre. I did not laugh, as the honexisted orable member for Ballarat suggested, the introduction of a new maize pest, cause I know that the producers of this country have already quite enough pests to deal with; what occasioned my smile was the honourable member's statement that we did not want to put any further burdens on - the producers. I smiled the idea of honourable members opposite attempting to lighten the burdens of farmers. The possibility of the introducany tion of a new pest is too serious a thing for any one to smile at. I am surprised that the maize which has been referred to was allowed to enter the country. may be that when the maize was being unloaded in Sydney the pest was in an developed stage, in which it was too minute to discover, and that it developed on the journey to Brisbane. The toms authorities in Sydney may be blame, but probably the honourable ber for Brisbane himself could not have detected the pest in the Sydney ment.",33
187,Mr TUDOR,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,Why did not the pest develop in. the maize that was left Sydney?,33
188,Mr BENNETT,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,Did it develop there ?,33
189,Mr TUDOR,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,That is what no one knows.,33
190,Mr BENNETT,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Possibl y the Sydon ney maize was not infected, or the climate was not warm enough for the development of the pest. I have never at any time smiled at the prospect of anything happening to the detriment of the producers. This Government undoubtedly represents the producers, and has done more for them than has any other Ministry.",33
191,Mr BAMFORD,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Herbert) [5.10] As the representative of a district in on which a very large quantity of maize is produced-it s annual output, I should say, is from 40,000 to 60,000 tons- I desire to refer briefly to this question of the introduction of maize containing corn",33
192,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Gippsland , in the matter of maize production, is a mere as compared with the honourable district.",33
193,Mr BAMFORD,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"It is only a circumthe stance. Notwithstanding what the honmember for Gippsland has said, it seems to me that the inspection must have been very lax, and that, if the larvse in the maize, the inspector should at have been able to detect them. The incibedent is but another illustration of the many faults arising from dual control- a matter to which I have had to refer on previous occasions. The honourable member for Kennedy has said that the oflicers concerned should be brought to book for the at laxity displayed by them. I would remind him, and the House, however, that the they are employed by the State. If action were taken by the Commonwealth, they would snap their fingers at us, just as some of the State officers do in connection with Commonwealth public It works, and the States would probably condone anything done by them in this undirection. Even if it were proved conclusively that the larvae existed in the maize when it was landed at Sydney, and Custhat if ordinary precautions had been to taken their presence could have been dememtected, the officers would find plenty ready to support them in their previous shipcontention that no larvae could be found. This is a very serious question, affecting not merely the districts arotfnd in Sydney and Brisbane, but the whole farming community of Australia. Honourable members opposite who profess to represent the farmers are responsible for every pest with which the farmer has to contend-fro m the Chinese to the Kanaka; the prickly pear to the rabbit. When we the Opposition side of the House rise in the interests of the farmers, the Government, and their supporters, who are supposed to specially represent them, only laugh at us.",33
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"We will father everything, if you like, but the prickly pear.",34
195,Mr BAMFORD,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"The prickly pear, the Bathurst burr, the fox and the sparrow-the introduction of these and other pests-ca n be traced to men whom honourable members opposite represent. When we endeavour to protect the producers, we find men like the honourable member for Gippsland seeking to defend a Government which has certainly failed to do what it ought to do in the interests of the farming community, whom it claims to specially represent.  should not have risen at this stage but for the amazing ignorance displayed by honourable members opposite in regard to certain pests.",34
196,Mr MATHEWS,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"We are a pest to the Conservatives.  member were infected with the microbe of sweet reasonableness, the comfort of honourable members would be materially increased. I have no sympathy with deliberate negligence on the part of any inspector whose duty it is to examine imports. But if honourable members opposite had an even elementary knowledge of microbe organisms, they would know that they can exist only in certain temperatures, and' that it would be quite possible for them to be latent in Sydney and yet virulent in Brisbane.",34
197,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Would the able member apply that statement to the corn moth?  which have not inherent in them a latent microbe-organism which, under certain conditions, will ultimately devour the whole of the grain.",34
198,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"That is not a reply to my question.  point out that these particular moths, at a certain stage, might be visible only to an entomologist with the aid of a microscope. The average inspector has not had an opportunity to gain special technical' education in that direction, and if we are going to place upon these oflicers the onus of examining all imports to discover the presence of every pest, then we - must be prepared to offer such salaries - as will i'ridiice Men of 'greater - ability take up the work. I have no sympathy with laxity of inspection, but, at the same time, I think it only fair and honest to say that inspectors who are trying 'to do their best, according to their lights, should not be charged with negligence in respect of matters of which they are not supposed to have any special knowledge. The complaint may be capable of ready explanation, if a report the called for, and I have no doubt that the Minister of Trade and Customs, will request the Minister of Agriculture in New South Wales to ascertain whether any explanation is forthcoming. I speak as a member of the farming community, and as a representative of a division in New South Wales in which a very large quantity of maize is produced. Tumut maize is recognised throughout Australia as being the least subject to pests, but I should be loth_, as a farmer, to say that even Tumut maize, under certain conditions, would not be subject to any pest. I hope that the Minister will not be misled by arguments used by honourable members opposite who have no expert knowledge, and who have advanced statements arising largely from ignorance.",34
199,Mr FENTO N,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Moribrynong) [5.19]. - The statement just made by the honourable member for Hume that the State inspectors could not reasonably be expected to detect the presence of microbes or the existence of certain pests or diseases in grain has occasioned me a good deal of surprise. If it is honor- too much to expect of these officers then why are they employed? If there is any country whose exports of produce and live stock should be subject to the closest scrutiny, it is South Africa, and the very fact that this maize had come from South Africa should have induced the oflicers concerned to make a most minute inspection of it. We have in this instance another illustration of the way in which the Labour party, which is said to be a menace to the farmer, is prepared to' come to his rescue, while those who claim specially to represent him, remain"" silent. I wish now to refer to the presence of microbes in this chamber. I complained on numerous occasions last session of the want of proper ventilation, and whether we meet two days or four days a week it is high time that the ventilation of the chamber was improved. Although little 'to more than two hours have elapsed since we met here the atmosphere is already very vitiated ",34
200,Mr FOWLER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"-Effort s have been made for nearly forty years to improve the ventilation of the building. Mr Fenton"" - There is not a ventilator or window in the wall which separates this chamber from the Queen's Hall, one of the largest in the building. Surely if a hole were knocked in it the ventilation would be improved. I have been fairly regular' in my attendance, and always desire to hear the debates, but I have made up my mind that, unless the ventilation of the chamber is improved, much of my parliamentary work shall be done outside. Is it to be said that we have not in Australia engineers capable of improving the ventilation of the building? I think that the vitiated atmosphere has a good deal to do with the bad temper that is sometimes displayed. Anything that would tend to improve the health of honourable members would be a step in the right direction. I understand that you, Mr Speaker, have charge of this matter, and I hope that efforts will be made at once to deal effectively with it.",35
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [5.22] --The question which has been raised In regard to the importation of maize infected with corn moth is one of the greatest gravity. Every precaution should certainly be taken to keep any new pests from Australia, for, it is beyond .cavil that any pest which exists elsewhere will certainly flourish here. I should like, however, to ask my honourable friend who has raised this question what else the Government could have done. The moment the discovery was reported to the Minister he issued instructions that every precaution should be taken, and the most complete efforts made to deal with it.",35
202,Mr WEBSTER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,But the machinery is slow.,35
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"The machinery was provided, I think, by the honourable member for Yarra-the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs-and I am sure that he did the very best he could in the circumstances. - Mr TUDOR - The very fact' that jny successor has kept the - system on shows that it must be » good one.",35
204,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"It was the best that could be done. Mr. JOSEPH.COOK - I should think so; and I am glad to know that the best has been done to meet difficulties of the kind. The complaints as to the adequacy of what is done must, I submit, lie' somewhere else than at the door of the responsible Minister of the day.",35
205,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,It seems that the fault must lie with those who did the .inspecting; no one is blaming the Minister.,35
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,The inspecting is done only' by those officers appointed for the purpose.,35
207,Mr WEBSTER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Why did they not ""spot it "" before?",35
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Because , apparently., they are not as well able to "" spot it "" as we are in this Chamber.",35
209,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"The officers in Brisbane found it out.  the pest, while the Sydney officers said there was none.",35
210,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,And this was in regard to the same boat.,35
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,That may very well be.,35
212,Mr WEBSTER,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,Does the Prime Minister think that the moths would come out in .two days?,35
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Yes ; they generally come out in less than two days. Mr FINLAYSON.:-If the Prime Minister had seen the bags as I saw them, he would know that could not be.",35
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"It is quite apparent that I do not know half as much about maize as some of my honourable friends opposite. I desire to say, once for all, that the Government ought to take every step possible to prevent these diseases coming to. Australia. If my honourable friends opposite can suggest any better regulation-an y better method of inspection, or any more competence in dealing with the matter- I hope they will do so. We shall consider any suggestions made, and, if practicable, put them into operation ab the earliest possible moment. In this case, apparently, the best has been done in the circumstances; and the officers concerned, who for this purpose are our officers, were thought the best men who could be put in control by the predecessors of the present Ministry. As both sides concur in the arrangements made as the best possible we may fairly conclude that the machinery is as good as any that could betih&ttgfrb ° Kalgoorlie to of by those best able to advise. As to the days of sitting, I am becoming apprehensive of a general strike in this Chamber j and I am afraid it looks like a strike with conspiracy behind it . Honourable members on both sides are in agreement on this very important matter; and it looks very suspicious. As honourable members will have observed, instead of moving the usual motion relating to the days of sitting, I purposely postponed it with a view to considering the Whole circumstances.",35
215,Mr RILEY,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,Leave it to the House; it is not a party question!,36
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"Someho w or other, ever since my honourable friends of the Labour party have been in Opposition, they have shown a desire to reduce the hours of sitting.",36
217,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,The late Prime Minister kept us eight hours and a half each day for the whole of one session.,36
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL EETUENING,"And what can the present Government dol The ex-Prime Minister set the pace, and we cannot help ourselves. I would not think of throwing over the ex-Prime Minister in such a way as that suggested; we have too much respect for him. If honourable members on both sides will undertake not to strike, I will Bee if I can set up a board of conciliation. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 6.30 p.m. [SENATE.] Port Augusta Railway.",36
