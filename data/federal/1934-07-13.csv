1,Mr MARR,Unknown,"On the 28th June, the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) asked to be supplied with figures showing the number of appeals made Figures from the Deputy Commissioners for Repatriation to the head-quarters of the Repatriation Commission for each year of the nine years ended June, 1933, and for the eleven months of the present financial 1928-1929*.. year, together with the results of those 1930-1931 . . appeals. The honourable member also 1931-1932 . . asked to be supplied with similar particu1933-1934 . . lars with respect to appeals made to the Repatriation Entitlement Tribunal. It 1029. is most difficult to obtain absolutely accurate particulars in regard to the number of appeals, but I have been supplied with figures that are as nearly as possible accurate. There has never been any time limit for the receipt of applications for acceptsions ance of war damage in respect of ex-soldiers. As time goes on, acceptances lessen, because obvious war disablement manifested itself or became incapacitating to the degree where medical treatment and pension were necessary,, fairly after discharge. It is now customary for ex-soldiers to ascribe to the war all nesses, including those associated with their advancing years, and their applicaness tion for the departmental acceptance that view is understandable, if not approexample, priate, especially as no financial cost them is entailed. The particulars desired by ths honourable member are given in the following tables:Number Number Year. Submitted.

INVALIDAND OLD-AGE PENSIONS BILL .",10
2,Mr M AKIN,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister whether there is any special significance in the fact that on the notice-paper for today the Invalid and Old-age PenBill, to which consideration was"" given yesterday, appears at the bottom of the list of major items of legislation? Is it to be assumed that the Government wishes to prevent honourable members from expressing their views with respect to, and from voting upon, the amendment that soon I moved to this measure?",10
3,Mr LYONS,Unknown,"Las t night, in reply to a question by the Deputy Leader of the illOpposition, I promised that the Cotton Bounty Bill would be the first busiproceeded with today. Certain of urgent matters must be disposed of as early as possible. The Electoral Bill, for should be passed in time to be to of use in connection with the forthcoming elections. In regard to the position on the notice paper of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill, I would point out that some time ago the Government-made the public announcement that it would not continue to administer the provisions of the act which it was the purpose of the amending measure to repeal, and that it would ask Parliament to pass the necessary legislation to repeal those provisions as early as possible. It was hoped that action along those lines would be - taken promptly. Other matters having now been imported into the question, the repeal of those provisions will be delayed. The Government does not consider that it is necessary to proceed with this measure at the present juncture, but it will again be brought forward at a later date when more urgent matters have been disposed of.",10
4,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"Seeing that the revenues of the Commonwealth are buoyant, and that further remissions of taxation are proposed, will the Prime Minister issue a regulation suspending, the claims upon properties of deceased pensioners under the property provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act?",11
5,Mr LYONS,Unknown,"Althoug h it is not the practice to make statements of policy in replying to questions, I may inform the honourable member that the bill now before Parliament, was designed to repeal a particular section which empowers the department to demand contributions from the relatives of pensioners. Whether this bill is discussed any further by the House is a matter for the Government to decide; but whether it is proceeded with or not, the provision sought to be repealed will not be implemented. Effect will be given to the provision of the bill 'by administrative' notion.",11
6,Mr WARD,Unknown,"In view of the apparent decision of the Government not to proceed any further with the discussion of the amendment of the Invalid and Old age Pensions Act until after the elections, if a United Australia party governmentis returned, will k continue to make demands on relatives?",11
7,Mr LYONS,Unknown,There has been no decision not to proceed with the bill. The position is simply that more urgent matters have been given precedence. The honourable member need not fear .that any return to the old conditions will be made by the present Government. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .,11
8,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"Las t night, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, I took exception to the intention of the Government to adjourn over next week. The Prime Minister then intimated that I had been advised by the Minister for Health of the intentions of the Government. Tn making a denial of that statement, I recalled a conversation in which the Minister for Health suggested that he might be given leave to introduce a certain measure, and to proceed with the motion for its second reading-wit h which I agreed. My memory has since been refreshed by a conversation that I have had with the honourable gentleman, and in fairness to him I wish now to say that, lie did advise me of the intentions of the Government upon an occasion antecedent to that to which I have referred. I had honestly forgotten the incident, and express regret for my denial of the Prime Minister's statement. TARIF F BOARD REPORTS. COTTON LINT AND YARNS-SHEE T GLASS: TRADE AGREEMENT WITH BELGIUM:DRY BATTERIES.",11
9,Mr WHITE,Unknown,I lay on the table the following report:Tariff Board-Repor t and recommendation - Cotto n L in t and Yarns. and move That the paper be printed. I take this opportunity to elaborate a reply that I have given to the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn). There are 52 reports of the Tariff Board which await the consideration of the Government. As many as can be dealt with during the life of this Parliament will be tabled and discussed.. Question resolved in the affirmative.,11
10,Mr NOCK,Unknown,"Will the Ministei endeavour to include in the list of Tariff Board reports which will he dealt with before this Parliament is dissolved, the report of that body on dry batteries and plate glass?",11
11,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"There is no Tariff Board's report on plate glass, although there is one on sheet glass. Negotiations have been proceeding between representatives of the British and Belgian Governments with a view to reaching finality in this matter. It is hoped that an agreement will be reached soon so that the export of barley and meat from Australia to Belgium will not be prejudiced. The Tariff Board's report on dry batteries is only one of a number of reports furnished by the board. As many of such reports as possible will be tabled and discussed during the life of this Parliament; but as the Customs Bill prescribes that tariff resolutions will lapse unless passed within six months of their being tabled, it is not wise to table resolutions which cannot be discussed.",11
12,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"As there seems to be something ominous in the statement that the negotiations with Belgium will probably be decided at an early date, can the Minister say whether, before any administrative action is taken which may interfere with the protection afforded to the Australian glass industry, this House will have an opportunity to discuss it?",12
13,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Yes , the Tariff Board report on that industry is in the hands of the Government, but as the right honourable gentleman knows, Belgium has made certain requests in respect to the quota basis. The House will be given full opportunity to discuss the matter.",12
14,Mr NAIRN,Unknown,"Is the delay in the presentation of Tariff Board reports due to the fact that under the amending legislation recently passed, tariff resolutions based on such reports must be ratified within six months?",12
15,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"I said that that was one of the reasons which would prevent them from being tabled. There will not be time in the life of the present Parliament to discuss every Tariff Board report, but I can assure the honourable member that within the next few months all of the reports of the Tariff Board will be tabled. NA ROLLS.  the Interior advise honourable members of the earliest date upon which the electoral rolls will be available?  be given with respect to any of the rolls, but as each roll is printed it will be distributed. The rolls for the far-distant divisions will be printed before those for city and suburban divisions. The whole of the rolls for New South Wales should be completed in about seven weeks' time. The roils for the smaller States will probably be printed at an earlier date. TASMANIA. TJSLKJM-IONIO COMMUNICATIO N WITH MAINLAN D.",12
16,Mr BELL,PREPARATION OF ELECTORAL,"Tender s closed last March for the supply of submarine cable to provide telephonic communication between Tasmania and the mainland.. Can the Postmaster-General indicate which route has been chosen, and when tenders for this work will be accepted?",12
17,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,PREPARATION OF ELECTORAL," For some little time the representatives of overseas companies which have submitted tenders have been in Australia. As the House will appreciate, these tenders are exceedingly involved and very important. Those factors have necessitated the separation of items, and a great deal of investigation, and many cables have passed between Australia and the principals in London. I am informed, however, that the details are now approaching completion, and that the recommendation for the acceptance of a tender will be made at any time. I announced earlier that the route will be via King Island. GARDEN ISLAND. APPBBNTICES.",12
18,Mr WARD,PREPARATION OF ELECTORAL,"Some time ago applications were invited from those who desired to become apprenticed to trades on Garden Island, and a fee of 5s. was demanded from each applicant. Hundreds of applications were received, but few of the applicants succeeded in obtaining employment. In view of the fact that the whole of the applicants were unemployed, will the department refund to those who were unsuccessful the fee of 5s.?",12
19,Mr FRANCIS,PREPARATION OF ELECTORAL,"I shall see if the request of the honourable member may be acceded to. NA AGREEMENT.  reference to the remarks made by the Honourable R. W. D. Weaver in the New South Wales Parliament regarding the ratification of the proposed amending River Murray Waters agreement, I submit to the House a statement showing the dates on which the various communications regarding this matter were forwarded and received. The original draft amending agreement, prepared by the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor, was forwarded to the three State Premiers on the 28th April, 1934, but it was not until the 4th July that a reply was received from the Premier of New South Wales, suggesting certain alterations of the draft. These suggestions, together with the comments of the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor thereon, were forwarded to the Governments concerned on the 7th July. The Governments of Victoria and South Australia, on the 10th July, telegraphed their concurrence in the proposals contained in the Prime Minister's letter of the 7th July. Yesterday, the 12th July, a telephone message was received from the. State authorities of New South Wales stating that the Government of that State desired that one of the alterations originally suggested by that State should stand, and that in other aspects the proposals contained in the Prime Minister's letter of the 7th July were acceptable. It is understood that the official confirmation of this advice will be received by telegram today. The alteration desired by the Government of New South Wales is acceptable to the other governments, and the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor is proceeding with the engrossment of the amending agreement. The State authorities have not been in direct communication with the Commonwealth Crown .Solicitor. There has been no delay so far ; as the Commonwealth is concerned, but 'On the other hand, the Commonwealth has taken every action possible to obtain -.finality. The statement to which I have referred is as follows:A p r i l 8th, 1934-Draf t amending agreement (prepared by the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor) forwarded to the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia for consideration. June 6th, 1934 - Concurrenc e of South Australian Government received. June 12th, 1934 - Be-draf t of clause 30 of the principal agreement forwarded to the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.

July 4th, 1934 - Suggeste d amendment to the re-draft of clause 30 of the principal agreement received from the Government of ^outh Australia. July 7th, 1934 - Suggeste d amendments to the draft amending agreement together with the comments of the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor regarding the alterations proposed by the Government of New South Wales, forwarded to the Premiers of New South Wales. Victoria and South Australia for consideration. July 10th, 1934 - Concurrenc e of the Victorian and South Australian Governments in the proposals contained in the Prime Minister's letter of 7th July, 1934, received. July 12th, 1934 - Telephon e message received from the State authorities, Sydney, that the Government of that State desired an alteration of the re-draft of clause 30 of the principal agreement, otherwise the latest proposals were agreed to. (The alteration desired by the Government of New South Wales is acceptable to the other three governments.)",12
20,Mr GIBSON,RIVER MURRAY WATERS,"Is any increased expenditure involved in the alteration of the River Murray Waters Agreement by the inclusion of the Yarrawonga weir in the works to be undertaken f  creased expenditure the alteration will mean a considerably decreased expenditure on the original scheme, notwithstanding the inclusion of the Yarrawonga weir.",13
21,Mr CAMERON,RIVER MURRAY WATERS,"Can the Minister say when work on the barrage to be constructed near the Murray mouth will be commenced, and the number of men likely to be employed?  which I have already referred must i»j ratified by this Parliament before work can be commenced. It is expected that it will be ratified during this session, in which case there will be nothing to prevent the work at the mouth of the river from being proceeded with almost immediately. The survey work has already bees carried out. As in the case of the locks higher up the river, between 300 and 400 men will be employed.",13
22,Mr MAKIN,RIVER MURRAY WATERS,Will the work to be undertaken in South Australia be done by contract or departmentally?  tion is that it will be carried out under the direction of the Works Department of South Australia. DEPORTATIONS.,14
23,Mr JENNINGS,RIVER MURRAY WATERS,"Wi n the Minister for the Interior state what is the number of deportations under the Immigration Restriction Act and other acts since this Government has been in office?'  unable to reply to the honourable memoer off-hand, but I shall have the information tabled at the next sitting of the House.",14
24,Mr ROSEVEAR,RIVER MURRAY WATERS,"Will the Minister, when framing his reply to the question of the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Jennings) regarding the number of deportations which have taken place during the last two and a half years, state clearly the nature of the offences and the number of persons deported under each heading?  possible to compile the figures in a way which will comply with the honourable member's request. AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO CROP.",14
25,Mr RIORDAN,RIVER MURRAY WATERS,"I ask the Prime Minister whether any arrangement has been made between the Government and the tobacco manufacturers for the purchase of next season's Australian tobacco crop. If so, what quantity of tobacco leaf have the manufacturers undertaken to purchase? If no arrangements have been made, will the Government endeavour to enter into an agreement similar to that which operated when the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) was Minister for Trade and Customs?",14
26,Mr WHITE,RIVER MURRAY WATERS,"In reply to a question yesterday, I gave figures, and last week I made a statement on this subject. The Government has been in communication with the manufacturers, who have undertaken to buy the whole of this season's crop of bright mahogany leaf and higher grades, and also their ordinary usings of other varieties. As the tobacco crop for the whole of the Commonwealth this year will be about 2,500,000 lb., and the Australian consumption approximately 4,000,000 lb. it will be seen that a considerable quantity of last year's carry-over will be used, and that there should be little difficulty in disposing of all usable leaf this year. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",14
27,Mr GREGORY,RIVER MURRAY WATERS,"Las t week I published a statement in regard to the public debt of Australia which was based on figures which I extracted from the March Quarterly Summary of Australian Statistics. I erroneously added figures relating to the short-term debt to those dealing with the public debt, thus exaggerating the amount of the public debt. I have no desire to be charged with having done that intentionally, particularly as the public debt is already so large that it does not require to be inflated artificially. I had no intention of making a wrong statement wilfully, antf I shall take every opportunity to correct the statement wherever I know that it has been published. WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF.",14
28,Mr NOCK,RIVER MURRAY WATERS,"Tw o days ago I asked for information regarding the distribution of wheat relief money, and received an assurance from the Minister that he would endeavour to secure the information if I placed my question on the notice paper. I did so, and, in reply, received an answer, which included the following statement:The Commonwealth Government has not been advised of the amounts actually paid out to the wheat-growers by the States. Will the Minister continue to seek the information which I desire, so that I may know how much of the money granted for the relief of wheat-growers has reached them hy the 1st July ?",14
29,Mr STEWART,RIVER MURRAY WATERS,"Step s have already been taken to secure the information, which will be conveyed to the honourable member as soon as it is to hand. NA COASTAL TRADE.",15
30,Mr BEASLEY,VESSEL FOR AUSTRALIAN,"Has the attention the Minister been drawn to a statement in the Melbourne Herald that £500,000 is to be spent by Mcllwraith, MCEacharn Limited, in the purchase of a new motor ship of 10,000 tons for the Australian coastal trade? The newspaper report states that the new ship will be built England, and will trade with Queensland as far north as Cairns.. In view of the deplorable conditions existing in the tralian shipbuilding and associated indusaction tries, as pointed out to the Minister gency ? recently by a deputation, and the inability of men engaged in that trade to obtain other work, is the Prime Minister prein pared to urge on the company mentioned the advisability of having the vessel in Australia, particularly as it will in Australian waters?

Further, has he noticed a statement by Mr. Angliss that the levy will kill the Australian meat export trade with Britain?

40,Mr MCNICOLL,OCEANOGRAPHICAL AND LAND,"Will Cabinet, in preparing the budget, consider the advisability of removing from the Defence Department estimates the' figures relating to oceanographical and land surveys, and placing them under some other department, in view of the fact that this much needed work is being undertaken for civil, rather than defence, purposes?",16

Massage recommending appropriation reported. In committee (Consideration of Governor General's message): Motion (by Mr WHITE) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to provide for the payment of bounty on the production of raw cotton, and for other purposes. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr White and Mr Guy do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill brought up by Mr WHITE , and read a first time. SECOND READING.",16
46,Mr WHITE,REDEMPTIO N OF WESTERN,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.8] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the culmination of all previous cotton bounty acts. Briefly it provides for the following important matters :1. The repeal of the Cotton Industries Bounty Act 1930-32, which provides for a bounty on the total production of seed cotton until the end of the 1936 cotton season. The repeal of this act will become effective immediately after the conclusion of the current 1934 crop. 2. The provision, instead of the present bounty on seed cotton produced, of a bounty on raw cotton to the extent of each year's annual requirements of the Australian users of raw cotton plus 20 per cent. 3. The payment of bounty on the approved quantity of raw cotton on a sliding scale basis according to weekly fluctuations in the world's price of raw cotton :as sold on the Liverpool market, subject -.to the rate of bounty not exceeding a - certain maximum amount per lb. 4. An increase of the stipulated rates of bounty to such extent as the depreciation of Australian currency in relation to currency of the United Kingdom becomes less than at present, if such change in currency relationships causes a reduction in the net return of Australian raw cotton. In other respects the various clauses in the bill are similar to the provisions of the present Cotton Industries Bounty Act. Before explaining to honourable members, the nature and purpose of the proposed legislation, I think it desirable to outline very briefly the history of the cotton industry in Australia, showing the various main steps taken by previous governments to assist it. This explanation should create a proper perspective and assist the House in considering the present hill and related measures that wiii have to be dealt with before Parliament dissolves. Cotton-growing was first commenced in Australia in 1860, when 14 acres were planted in Queensland. Tn ten years the area increased to 14,000 a.nres. This rapid advance was, of course, due to the civil war in America, which interfered greatly with production in that country, which is usually equivalent to about 60 per cent, of the total world Mr White. output. Upon the re-appearance of American cotton on the European market after the civil war, the Queensland industry suffered a rapid decline, because practically the whole of its product had to be exported in competition with raw cotton produced by very cheap labour. The next serious attempt to develop the cotton industry in Australia was made in 1920, under a guaranteed price system, inaugurated by the Queensland Government. For three years an average price of 5^d. per lb. was guaranteed. The loss on realization from the export sales then necessary cost the Queensland Government £78,929. However, the area under cultivation in those three years rose from 166 acres to approximately 35,000 acres, and much new land settlement aud employment resulted. In 1922 the Queensland Government asked the Commonwealth to assist the industry, and the Tariff Board recommended a continuance of the system of guaranteed prices for a further four years. Finally the Commonwealth agreed with all the States except Tasmania that it would share equally with the States in any loss arising from the following guaranteed prices:1924- 5d. per lb. regardless of length of staple. 1925- Up to 5d. per lb. according to length of staple. 1926- Up to 4^d. per lb. according to length of staple. As there was practically no local outlet for Australian raw cotton at this time, most of the product had to be exported, and the loss borne by the Commonwealth during the years 1924 to 1926 amounted to £170,900. In addition the Commonwealth Government provided £2,044 to assist in cotton research work. During this period more growers entered the industry and the acreage and the production of cotton increased considerably; but practical experience in several States showed that Queensland was apparently the State best suited climatically for the growing of seed cotton. In view of the increasing losses and other difficulties associated with the industry, the Queensland Government in 1925 urged the Commonwealth to take over the whole responsibility for rendering assistance. It was claimed that the development of new industries was essentially a Commonwealth 'matter, meriting tariff and/or bounty assistance. The Queensland cotton growers asked for a bounty of 2d. per lb. on seed cotton. Early in 1926 the Tariff Board recommended a bounty of 2d. per lb. for six years, this rate to diminish at the end of that period by i d . per lb. each year to Id . for the tenth year. Concurrently the Tariff Board recommended a bounty of 6d. per lb. on cotton yarn manufactured in Australia, provided that at least 50 per cent, of Australian raw cotton was used in its manufacture. The Bruce-Page Government gave the matter very serious consideration and arrived at the conclusion that the policy hitherto adopted of assisting the cotton growing industry on a purely export basis was fundamentally unsound, in view of the higher production costs in Australia as compared with thoseforeign countries in which cotton is produced. In practically all those countries, the industry is largely couducted by native growers with the assistance of native labour, and even iuAmerica, picking or harvesting, by far the most expensive item in production costs, is almost invariably carried at very low cost by negroes or Mexicans. The Bruce-Page Government, therefore, propounded the policy of developing the Australian cotton industry primarily on a home consumption basis, by deciding to create, within Australia, a market for locally produced raw cotton. It introduced, for ,the first time, protection on the manufacture of cotton yarns. Small customs duties were imposed on cotton yarns, n.e.i., which comprise soft cotton yams required for the knitting trade, used mainly in the manufacture of such articles as hosiery and underwear. At the same time a bounty of one-third of a penny per count, per lb. was granted on all cotton yarns up to countNo. 49, provided not less than 50 per cent, of the raw cotton used in the manufacture of those yarns was produced in Australia. Furthermore, a bounty of l^d. per lb. was granted for five years on all seed cotton produced in Australia. This rate of bounty may seem to have been id. per lb. less than the amount recommended by the Tariff Board, but the higher price at which the growers were able to sell their raw cotton to yarn manufacturers by virtue of the customs duties imposed on yarns was equivalent to slightly more than i d . per lb. of seed cotton, and consequently the Tariff Board's degree of assistance was actually granted to the industry. The Cotton Bounty Act 1926 appropriated £180,000 per annum for five years for the purpose of these bounties on seed cotton and cotton yarn. During the years 1927 to 1929 inclusive, whilst the 1926 bounty act was in full operation, the cotton-growers secured an average net return of 4.6d. per lb., which was only one-tenth of Id. per lb. more than the 4-}d. per pound reported by the Tariff Board to be the price necessary to enable efficient growers to earn a reasonable living. During part of this period a fair proportion of the Australian production of raw cotton had to be exported, and the area harvested was little more than half that of the later years of the previous period of guaranteed prices. In 1930 the Scullin Government decided to extend the scope of protection so as further to increase the Australian market for raw cotton. Prior to that year, as J out have already said, there had been a customs duty and a bounty on cotton yarns for the knitting trade, and there were also consequential protective duties on certain knitted cotton goods. [Quorum formed.] The Scullin Government imposed additional protective duties onfinishedcotton goods of various kinds, cancelled the 1926 Bounty Act nearly two years before its term had expired, and secured the approval of Parliament to the Cotton Industries Bounty Act of 1930. This latest act provided for the extension of the bounties on seed cotton and cotton yarn to September, 1936, and the appropriation was £260,000 per annum. The act extended the then existing rates of bounty for one year past the normal term of the 1926 act, and then reduced each bounty progressively by one-sixth of the full rate each year, so that both bounties would expire by the 30th September 1936. At the same time, the Government undertook to increase the customs protection on cotton yarns and manufactured cotton goods from time to .time, as might be found necessary to maintain a reasonable price to the growers for their seed cotton. It should be stated that in 1926 and 1929 the Tariff Board issued extremely favourable reports concerning the prospects of the cotton industry and its value to Australia. In 1929 it recommended the continuance for another four years of the full seed cotton bounty of l i d . per lb. and also an increase from one-third E enny to i d . per count per Ib. in the ounty on cotton yarns. Nevertheless the government of the day decided not to increase the cotton yarn bounty, and endeavoured to introduce gradually diminishing bounties in the hope of doing without them at the end of a term of years. The next important stage in the fiscal history of this industry was when the Lyons Government, in February, 1932, withdrew the special additional Gd. per lb. duty on cotton yarns which had been imposed by the .Scullin Government, in 1931, contrary to a recommendation of the Tariff Board. Two months later, the rapidly increasing production pointed to the probability of the yarn bounty imposing a burden on the budget of £120,000 per annum or even more. Furthermore, it was seen that the profits of certain manufacturers of cotton yarn, which had been quite moderate in the earlier days of the bounty, were likely to advance much beyond the prescribed limit of 10 per cent. Accordingly the position was fully discussed by the Minister with all the manufacturers and with the general manager of the Queensland Cotton Board. It was mutually agreed that the cotton yarn bounty be abolished as from the 1st July, 1932, and that equivalent protective duties be imposed on yarns sufficiently prior to that date to maintain adequate protection for the industry. At the same time the manufacturers made agreements with the Cotton Board for the purchase of their requirements of raw cotton from that season's crop at satisfactory prices. That the withdrawal of the extra 6d. per pound duty on cotton yarn in February, 1932, did not. injure the industry is abundantly proved by the statistics showing the production of yarn. These figures are contained in the following table of production each year since Mr White. the Commonwealth accepted the responsibility of establishing the industry:lb. 1926-27 1,055,05 0 1927-28 1,104,74 4 1928-29 1,416,00 7 192930 1,999,28 7 193031 3,000,03 0 193132 5,841,25 0 193233 4,465,730 193334* 2,590,04 0 * Hint six months only. It will be noted that the production for 1931/32 was 5,841,256 lb. which included a very large quantity of yarn produced in order to take advantage.of the bounty which expired on the last day of that financial year. The important point is that the production for 1932-33 was 4,465,730 lb., or practically 50 per cent, greater than the production for 1930-31, when the Scullin Government was in office. I further draw the attention of the House to the production of over 2,500,000 lb. during the first half of 1933-34, which clearly proves that the protection afforded by the Lyons Government has not injured the industry in any way; indeed, cotton yarn production has thrived during the last three years. Further proof is afforded by the import statistics. During the six months ended the 31st December, 1933, the imports of cotton yarns, n.e.i - the only protected cotton yarns-were under 66,630 lb., as against an Australian production of 2,590,040 lb. Since July, 1932, there has been a bounty on the production of seed cotton only, which it is now proposed to convert to a bounty on raw cotton up to the extent of the requirements of Australian users, plus 20 per cent. This brings me to the present bill, and the reasons for its introduction. In May, 1932, the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs (Sir Henry Gullett) referred to the Tariff Board for investigation the increased duties which were imposed on cotton yams in return for the abolition of the yarn bounty. Since that date the board has made a prolonged and exhaustive investigation into the whole industry. One or two additional references were added to its task, and I think it has been the most lengthy inquiry the board has hitherto undertaken. As the result of these investigations the board furnished a report in November, 1933, on cotton lint-i.e. . raw cotton-and cotton yarns. Broadly speaking, it found that the industry has reached an unbalanced state in the following respects: First, the area planted to seed cotton in Queensland is capable of producing, under normal climatic conditions, approximately twice as much raw cotton as would be required for the manufacture of yarns, which have, so far, been protected in Australia. Secondly, the productive capacity of the cotton-yarn mills, on the economic working basis of two shifts a day, is about three times as much as the extent of the present protected market for cotton yarns. These circumstances, the Tariff Board states, are undesirable inasmuch as(o) The Commonwealth is paying bounty on the production of seed cotton, whereas a considerable proportion of the resultant raw cotton-abou t one-half-ha s to be exported from Australia. (6)»The overhead costs of the cotton yarn factories are unduly high because they are only working at substantially less than half capacity. The board is of the opinion that the time has arrived in the evolutionary development of the Australian cotton industry as a whole, when the scope of protection should be increased, with the double object of creating a larger market within Australia for the growers' product, and enabling the existing cotton-spinning plants to operate at somewhere near full capacity. At the same time the board is opposed to a continuance of the present high duties on cotton yarns n.e.i., which, on a typical yarn, viz.: No. 16, are 5d. peT lb., plus 35 per cent. British preferential tariff, or 8d. per lb., plus 55 per cent, general tariff. At ruling prices for British cotton yarns, the present, composite duty is about 9d. per lb. The board considers that the extension of the scope of protection at the rates now applicable to cotton yarns n.e.i. would impose too heavy a cost on the community, and would necessitate excessive additional customs duties on the manufactured cotton goods-tweeds , &c - for which the newly-protected yarns would be required. Furthermore, the board has drawn attention to the fact that previous cotton policies have necessitated very high prcrtection when world's prices are low, thus making a large part of the protection unnecessary when world's cotton prices are high, a factor which might conceivably be taken advantage of by the manufacturers. The board is strongly of opinion that some system is necessary whereby the two industries of cotton growing and yarn manufacture should have a clear line of demarcation as to the protection necessary, whilst concurrently making Australian raw cotton 'available to the manufacturers at all times at an exact relationship with world's raw cotton prices. In order to achieve these results the board has recommended that Australian raw cotton should be supplied at all times to the spinners at the Australian equivalent of the world's parity, grade for grade and staple for staple. In other words, the prices should be equal to the standard Liverpool prices plus exchange, freight, and landing charges to Australia, but excluding any customs duty. In order to give the Australian growers of seed cotton a reasonable return for their produce the board has recommended that a sliding scale rate of bounty for raw cotton be provided, based upon a focal point of Liverpool middling spot raw cotton at 6d. per lb. Whilst the Liverpool price is 6d. per lb., the board recommends that the Australian bounty be 3-Jtd. per lb. and that this bounty should fall by onehundredth part of a penny for every similar increase of the Liverpool price above 6d. per lb. Conversely, for every reduction of the Liverpool price below 6d. of one-hundredth of a penny per lb., the Australian bounty should rise by a similar amount, with the exception that no further increase of bounty should take place when the Liverpool price falls below 4fd. per lb. The board also considers that steps should be taken to prevent an unwise and undue increase in the production of raw cotton in Australia beyond the approximate requirements of the local manufacturers. In order to achieve this result, the board has recommended that bounty be payable only on the requirements of the manufacturers, as estimated in advance by the Minister, plus 20 per cent, of that quantity for the purpose of providing against reductions of the Grop from climatic and other causes. Under such a plan, the cotton growers would have to accept the responsibility for limiting the production of raw cotton to the manufacturers' requirements plus 20 per cent. Otherwise, no bounty will be payable on the excess duction. At the present time, bounty is paid on all the cotton grown in Australia, even if more than half of the crop is exported, so there is a complete loss to the Commonwealth. Then again the Tariff Board has found that the limited range of cottons grown in Queensland does not sufficiently meet all the varied requirements of the manufacturers, and that the growers cannot altogether be expected to meet all those requirements. The board, therefore, proposes that manufacturers shall first submit orders to the Queensland Cotton Board for the particular types of cotton they require at the prices ruling from time to time for equivalent, foreign cotton plus freight, charges and exchange to Australia. If the Cotton Board cannot or will not supply at the ruling prices the particular raw cotton ordered, the manufacturers will be allowed to import their raw cotton. Steps will be taken to prevent any misuse of such importations by the manufacturers, and it is proposed to appoint a board composed almost entirely of representatives of the growers and users of cotton to handle such matters, and to advise the Minister thereon. Nothing in the new policy will affect the right of the cotton-growers to bounty on a quantity of raw cotton represented by the manufacturers' estimated requirements plus 20 per cent. Reverting to the bounty of Z\d. per recommended by the Tariff Board when the Liverpool price is 6d. per lb., the Government has very carefully considered the net return to the cotton-growers thereunder. It is found from the calculations made by the Tariff Board that, as a rule, the return to the growers would probably be not more than 3£d. per lb. with such a bounty. Seeing that the last investigation by the Tariff Board of the cost of growing seed cotton was made late in .1925, and that a price of 4£d. per lb. Mr White. under conditions of very strict efficiency was then recommended as necessary, and that the savings in production costs since then clearly do not justify such a low return as 3$d. per lb., the Government has decided to grant higher rates of bounty, as will be seen from clause 9 of the bill. The rate of bounty on raw pro- cotton when the Liverpool price is 6d. per lb. is, therefore, 5-id. per lb. for the first year, 4^d. per lb. for the second year, and 4^d. per lb. for the next three years. . These rates will, of course, be subject to deductions, if any, made under the Financial Emergency Act from time to time. Whilst the financial emergency deduction continues at 20 per cent., the rare for the first year will result in a net return on seed cotton of approximately 3.4d. per lb., which is expected to be the average return for the current season under the present seed cotton bounty. The reduction of - Jd. per lb. of raw cotton in the rate of bounty for tha second year of the bill, and the further reduction of i d . per lb. for the next three years is considered justifiable in view of the present tendency in Queensland to grow new varieties of seed cotton, including large boiled, which have a higher percentage of raw cotton content than the Durango variety hitherto grown almost exclusively. In view of the higher lint percentage varieties of seed cotton now about to be grown on a large scale, the lower rates of bounty should not affect the average financial return to the growers. It is important to note that with the present Liverpool price of 6fd. per lb. for raw cotton, the relevant bounty of 4£d. per lb. for the first year, which is subject to the 20 per cent, financial emergency deduction, is equivalent to only 48 per cent, lb. of the landed duty-free cost of foreign cotton without exchange. This measure of protection compares very favourably with that afforded to certain other primary and secondary products, and the ad valorem equivalent of 48 per cent., will be lower in the following years if world's prices probably rise, as, no doubt, they will. Honourable members will, naturally, expect to know the approximate cost of the new bounty on raw cotton. If Liverpool cotton remains at the focal point of 6d. per ]b. assumed by the Tariff Board, the bounty will be 54d. per lb. This bounty, less the financial emergency deduction of 20 per cent., would cost £131,000 for the 15,000 bales of raw cotton estimated to cover the manufacturers' requirements next year, and the additional 20 per cent, already referred to. I think honourable members will agree that this provides a much better basis than formerly. Seeing that the present unrestricted bounty on the production of seed cotton for next year has been estimated to result in a cost of £115,000, it is evident that the additional cost of the new bounty on the basis of a Liverpool price of 6d. per lb. is only £.16,000. I would point out again that the new bounty on raw cotton depends upon the Liverpool price. Actually that price is now 6^d. per lb. . If this price should continue for a full twelve months, the Australian bounty would bo 3d. less than the pivotalfigure-based on Liverpool at 6d - of 5-Jd., that is, 44d. per lb., which would involve a total payment of £112.500 on 55,000 bales or virtually the same, as the estimated seed cotton bounty which the Government has been asked to provide in the current year's estimates. The outlook for future world raw cotton prices is, on the whole, rather bright, in view of the exceptionally drastic reduction of acreage which is being effected in the principal producing country, America, under President Roosevelt's administration. Two years ago the area under cotton in the United States of America was 41,000,000 acres. area has been deliberately curtailed under the agricultural adjustment legislation passed by Congress to 29,000,000 acres. The result, so far, has heen that the world's price of raw cotton has increased from under 5d. per lb. .to 6fd. per lb. Seeing that the Liverpool spot price averaged approximately 10d. per lb. for twenty years before the war, there, seems to be some justification for expecting further advances beyond the present 6fd. If this should happen, the bounty rates under the bill, and therefore the total expenditure, will become progressively less. [Quorum formed.] I want to emphasize that the new policy advocated by the Tariff Board, adopted by the Government, will rosult reduced costs to users of certain cotton goods. By paying a bounty on raw cotton, so that the manufacturers will obtain either Australian or imported cotton at Australian import parity, the production costs of co.tton yarns n.e.i. will be correspondingly reduced, and the consuming public will at least avoid the cumulative added costs resulting from manufacturers', wholesale, and retail margins. Coincident with the new bounty policy, the present duties on cotton yarns n.e.i. will be reduced as from the 1st April, 1935, and the reductions of duty will be equivalent to 4d. per lb., which must be passed on to the users of yarn, and ultimately to the consumers of hosiery, underwear, and many other cotton products. The increased scope of protection on cotton yarns proposed by the Tariff Board in order .to enable the spinning mills to operate under economic conditions will necessitate average protective duties being imposed upon yarns now admitted free or at nominal rates of duty. These rates of duty will, of course, increase somewhat the cost of such yarns to the manufacturers of the cotton goods affected, and in some cases these goods will require a consequential increase of existing tariff protection. Nevertheless, the lower costs of knitting trade yarns, that is, cotton yarns n.e.i. which will be made possible under the new policy will substantially more than outweigh the extra cost of the additional yarns which it is proposed to protect for That the purpose of enlarging the cotton yarn industry, and hence the Australian market for locally-grown raw cotton. The Government is taking precautions to ensure that the lower costs of knitting trade yarns from the 1st April next will be passed on .to consumers, and it will also watch very carefully, from the point of view of the public, the effect of the moderate increase of duty which will be imposed upon other cotton yarns in pursuance of the general stabilization policy now being submitted for .the approval of Parliament. I commend the bill to this House, believing that it will meet with the and approval of all parties. The Governin ment's policy in this regard will create more employment in the factories, and will increase the more profitable tralian market for the benefit of cotton growers in Queensland, who have now reached a stage where half their product from the present area of 70,000 acres would have to be exported indefinitely without the measures now proposed the Government. Cotton is of prime importance to the nation in time of war, owing to its iiidispeusability in regard to the manufacture of certain high explosives, as well as various forms of military clothing and equipment. Australia cannot afford to be without a healthy cotton industry as one form of security against supplies being cut off in the event of international complications arising affecting our security. With a vigorous and sound cotton industry as a nucleus, Australia will have trained sufficient experts who will have acquired adequate technical knowledge to enable her to make very rapid expansion in ithis industry in time of war to meet some of the essential requirements of defence. Moreover, during my recent visit to Queensland, I was impressed with the imperative need for more settlement in the sparsely-developed, strategic portions of this vital part of Australia. In considering the cotton industry, one must, of course, pay due regard to economic aspects. But nationa] considerations go beyond even the question of economics, and where more settlement is required in Queensland, or in any other State, I feel that necessary industries should be encouraged, provided always that the additional cost is not beyond our capacity a* a nation. In conclusion, I submit to honourable members that the Government's cotton stabilization policy, having regard to all the circumstances, should result in a safe and sound expansion of the industry at a definitely moderate degree of cost to the people, and that, this attempt at consolidation should clear up some of the legacies which have accumulated through experiment and mistakes in the past. Debate (on motion by Mr Foams) adjourned. Mr Whilr, WAR SERVICE HMS (SOUTH AusAUSTRALIA) AGREEMENT BIL L 1934. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the Sth July by (vide page 27S), on motion by Mr. FRANCISThat the bill be now read a second time.",16
47,Mr MAKIN,REDEMPTIO N OF WESTERN,"Hindmarsh) [11.44] This bill deals with the agreement which was arrived at between the Commonwealth Government and the State bank authorities in South Australia in 1922 for the administration of certain provisions dealing with war service homes matters. ' Some years ago the Commonwealth Government appointed the State Bank of South Australia as its agent, under the War Service Homes Act. The obligation upon the State Bank was to receive and deal with applications rind to collect payments of principal and interest in respect, of the capital cost of war service homes, such moneys to be repaid to the Commonwealth authorities; but, owing to an oversight, there was no provision in the agreement arrived at between the two contracting parties in respect, of arrears of payments, and when certain purchasers failed to meet, their commitments, the State Bank was compelled to make a full reimbursement to the Commonwealth. I understand that that oversight has placed on the State Bank a considersiderable liability which was never intended under the agreement. The remarkable thing about the agreement is that it did not actually receive the ratification of this Parliament. This amending legislation makes provision for a departure from what has been the practice since 1922, and the administration of the war service homes in South Australia will in future be undertaken, not by the State Bank, but by a separate branch of the Commonwealth department. I doubt whether that is a desirable provision, because no body in South Australia is more expert in dealing with housing conditions there than is the State Bank, which has a staff of technical housing experts. I should like some additional information from the Minister (Mr Francis) before' I would be prepared to accept his statement that a saving will be made by transferring this activity from the State Bank to a Gommonwealth department. One would think that the setting up of a new authority would be expensive, and that a substantial saving would be made by allowing the present practice to continue. I should like to know the amount of arrears which are outstanding and have been paid by the State Bank in full to the Commonwealth authorities, how many homes are likely to be affected by this amending legislation, and the cost of administration by the State Bank authorities. That, information is essential to enable us to ascertain to what extent the statement of the Minister that a saving will be effected under this provision can be substantiated. I wish to pay a. compliment to those who have undertaken certain features of war service homes administration in South. Australia. Mr Holland, the Commonwealth Director of Works in that State, is a most capable, efficient and courteous gentleman, and, in the course  missioner of War Service Homes, has' also extended to me every courtesy, and every case that I have presented to the central administration has received his sympathetic consideration. All possible leniency should be extended to the occupants of war service homes who, through no fault of their own, are out of employment, and unable to meet their commitments to the department. Many of. them are considerably in arrears, and the department feels that, in a number of instances, where the liability on the occupant is too great, he should be released from his contract. If it is right that the primary producers who have suffered during the depression should be assisted by this Government under the proposed rural rehabilitation scheme, it is also right that the purchasers of war service homes who, through lack of employment, are unable to meet their commitments, should receive the same consideration from the Government. Most of the occupants who are in arrears are returned soldiers, and the act should be amended to permit of the writing off of arrears in necessitous cases. Complaints have been made in this House with respect to certain evictions from war service homes which have taken place in other States, and I state emphatically that, at this stage of the depression, when many people lack sufficient food, no person should be dispossessed of his home unless there is proof of deliberate vandalism. One of the first responsibilities of this Government is to ensure that people are adequately housed and fed, and no person who has made a reasonable effort to meet his commitments should be evicted from his home. Mr FBA>:CIS - I rise to a point of order. As this bill is to ratify an agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of South Australia. I submit that the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) is not in order in making a complete survey of the activities of the War Service Homes Commission.",23
48,Mr SPEAKER,REDEMPTIO N OF WESTERN,"Hon. G. H. Mackay). - As an ex-speaker of this House the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) will realise that under the Standing Orders certain restrictions are imposed upon honourable members. While it is practically impossible to avoid an occasional reference to matters other than those contained in the bill its principle should not be departed from. Mr MAKIN"" - I agree with you, sir, and with the opinion expressed by the Minister (Mr Francis). I have no desire to discuss subjects other than those covered by the bill. I was expressing an opinion which, I think, has the general support of all honourable members, and emphasizing the fact that it is essential that every consideration should be shown to the occupants of war service homes, particularly at present, when conditions are abnormal. I trust that the Minister will give the information I have sought with respect to the transfer of the control of war service homes in South Australia from the State Bank to the Commonwealth, and also justify the statement, that a saving will be effected by such a transfer. In conclusion, I should like to say that the State bank authorities in South Australia have carried on the work on behalf of the Commonwealth in an. excellent manner, aiid I am sure that the Minister will agree with me when I say that that institution has been of considerable assistance to the Commonwealth.",24
49,Mr FRANCIS,REDEMPTIO N OF WESTERN,"Moreton-Minister Administering War Service Homes) [12.2] - I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) that the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth Government,when the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister, and the South Australian Government, when Sir Henry Barwell was Premier, was not ratified by Parliament. At that time the financial and economic problems with which we have since been confronted could not be foreseen, and we would be acting unjustly to South Australian if the present arrangement were allowed to continue. This problem has existed since the agreement was first entered into, and for the past eight years the South Australian Government has been agitating for some variation of the conditions. Governments have come and gone and it has fallen to the lot of this administration to make a change. When negotiations first began between Mr Butler, the Premier of South Australia, and myself, as Minister administering War Service Homes, 1 informed Mr Butler that when the agreement was drawn up in 1923 the conditions we have experienced during recent years could not, of course, be foreseen and that we. knew that for financial reasons it was practictally impossible for the South Australian Government to adhere to the agreement. I therefore readily agreed, on behalf of the Government, that the arrears of interest due to the Commonwealth and which amount to approximately £6S,000 should be met by the Commonwealth. The actual amount has not yet been determined, but officers of the Commonwealth Auditor-General's Department and of the South Australian Audit Department are conducting an investigation to ascertain the exact figure. When the war service homes scheme was first launched it was not anticipated that such extensive concessions should have to be made to the occupants of war service homes. It, is pleasing to record that purchasers of these homes have stood up to their obligations in a remarkable manner, and that prior to the depression the arrears of repayments on an expenditure of £22,000,000 amounted to only 1 per cent. The honourable member for Hindmarsh asked how it was expected to effect a saving by the proposed transfer. Under the present, system of paying South Australia on a 10 per cent, basis, the cost to the Commonwealth has been £11,664, whereas it is anticipated that under the proposed agreement, similar functions will be performed in that State at a cost of £7,450, showing an. estimated saving of over £4,000. The number of homes to be transferred is being investigated, but at present the figure is given as 4,100. Some have said that the South Australian Government asked that some members of the South Australian State Bank staff should be taken over by the War Service Homes Commission. I discussed the subject in Melbourne with the Premier of South Australia, Mr Butler, and in a subsequent discussion between the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), Mr Butler and myself, Mr Butler intimated most definitely that it, was not desired that the commission should take over any of the staff as it. was anticipated that there would be no difficulty in absorbing them in other departments. The Under Treasurer for South Australia made a promise that the staff would be absorbed, and that in any case it was not desired that it should bo taken over by the commission. It has been brought under my notice that some persons have said that objections have been raised to the proposed transfer of control from South Australia to the Commonwealth; but I have had careful inquiries made as to how.returned soldier occupanls of war service homes regard the proposed transfer, and have been told that no objection has been offered. I should like to assure the occupants of war service homes in South Australia that if the proposed agreement is ratified they will receive the same sympathetic treatment from the War Service Homes Cornmission as they have had from the State Bank. Recently the occupants of war service homes in Victoria requested the commission to assume control of the homes, in that State, particularly because the Victorian State Savings Bank was unable to grant the same liberal conditions as are granted by the commission, nnd that has been done. I should like, however, to express my - appreciation of the way in which the war service homes work, in that State, has been administered by the Savings Bank. At the last annual meeting of the Tasmanian Branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia, a resolution was passed asking the Commonwealth to take over the war service homes in that State, because the occupants were dissatisfied with the present administration, and their request has been complied with. The annual report of that branch of the league contains a paragraph expressing its appreciation of the fact that a change has been made. Some years ago the occupants of war service homes in Western Australia suggested that theirhomes should he taken over, and at the last meeting of the Loan Council, held in Melbourne, I discussed the subject with the Premier, Mr. Collier, and an arrangement was made to reduce the payments being made by the Western Australian Government. The Commonwealth Government appreciates very much the way in which the State Bank of South Australia has administered war service homes matters in that State; at times minor difficulties have arisen, but they have been ultimately overcome. Generally speaking, the arrangement between the Commonwealth Government and the South Australian Government has been entirely satisfactory and a change is now being made because for financial reasons South Australia cannot be expected to continue on the present basis. [Quorum formed]. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and reported from committee without amendment or debate; report adopted. Bill-by leave-rea d :i third time. NA SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 11th July (vide page 416) on motion by Mr. CASEVThat the bill be now read a second time.",25
50,Mr FORDE,WHEAT GROWERS RELIE FBILL,"Capricornia) [12.15] It is seldom that I am able unreservedly to support a bill brought up by this Government, but this is one of those rare occasions. As Tasmania produces very little wheat, a provision was inserted in the Wheat Growers Relief Act last year for a rebate of the flour tax due from that State. The flour tax liability of Tasmania was calculated at £7,500 a month, and this amount was granted to the State by the Commonwealth under section 12 of the act. The present bill provides for the grant of an additional £8,000 to Tasmania to make up the deficit that has occurred. As to the iniquitous flour tax, a great deal might be said, but honourable members on this side of the chamber expressed their feelings strongly on that subject last year when they pointed out that the tax would fall most heavily upon the poor people who proportionately ate more bread than people with larger means and a greater variety of food. However, I shall not go into that subject at this stage. I support the bill.",26
51,Mr BEASLEY,WHEAT GROWERS RELIE FBILL,"West Sydney) [12.16] - I listened to the speech of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) in moving the second reading, but I could not quite understand his explanation of the procedure which necessitated this rebate to Tasmania. I understood the honourable gentleman to say that monthly payments of £7,500 a month had been made to the Tasmanian Government for six months, whereas the amount actually due was another £8,000. Apparently the Commonwealth Government used the Tasmanian Government as an agent for distributing this money. I should like the honourable gentleman to elaborate his explanation.  wish to know whether the Government, in dealing with these transactions, has 1934. paid due recognition to the provision in the principal act that the money derived from this taxation was to be paid only to necessitous farmers. I take it that as Tasmania has made a claim for this money it will ultimately be paid to necessitous farmers.",26
52,Mr HUTCHIN,WHEAT GROWERS RELIE FBILL,"Denison) [12.18]. - The introduction of this measure was necessary because of the special circumstances of Tasmania, which produces very little wheat, and only wheat of a special type. In 1932-33 the Tasmanian wheat crop amounted to 275,000 bushels. Tasmania appreciated the considerate treatment extended to it by the Commonwealth Government in this matter, though the treatment was, of course, based on strict equity. The attitude of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) today will also be appreciated. That honourable gentleman on this occasion has shown definite sympathy with Tasmania's peculiar situation. It is pleasing to know that the officials of the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Treasuries were able to work in a most harmonious manner in dealing with this subject. That is not always the case when Commonwealth and State departments have to work together. I support the bill because it will conclude in a business-like way the transactions regarding the rebate of flour tax to mania.",27
53,Mr CASEY,WHEAT GROWERS RELIE FBILL,"Corio-Assistant Treasurer) [12.20] - I wish to explain for the benefit, particularly, of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), the procedure adopted in the making of rebates of flour taxes to Tasmania. The Commonwealth Taxation Department collected the flour tax in Tasmania as in other parts of the Commonwealth. Section 12 of the act, provided that £7,500 a month should be refunded to Tasmania during the currency of the act in order to off-set the amount of flour tax collected in that State. The figure, £7,500, was arrived at by calculating - Tasmania's consumption of flour on the basis of the proportion that the State's population bears to the whole population of Australia. The calculation proved to be remarkably accurate. The Tasmanian Parliament, after the passage of the. Wheat Growers Relief Act through this Parliament, passed an act in which it uudertook to refund to those who paid flour tax on flour consumed in Tasmania the sum of £4 5s. a ton. The reason why it is now necessary to make a refund of an additional £8,000 to Tasmania may be briefly explained in this way: At the end of the period of the collection of flour tax there was, in other parts of Australia, flour in hand which necessitated the Commonwealth Government, under the terms of the act, making refunds to the holders of it at the rate of £4 5s. a ton. When the original act was passed no account was taken of the fact that, on the termination of the period during which the legislation would operate, there would be in Tasmania no flour upon which the Commonwealth Government would be called, upon to make refunds'; but there would be flour in that State on which the Tasmanian Government would have to make a refund at the rate of £4 5s. a ton. It may be said that in making this additional £8,000 available to Tasmania, we are merely doing something that we should have had to do had section 12 not been in the act.",27
54,Mr BEASLEY,WHEAT GROWERS RELIE FBILL,"I take it that the position is that the flour-millers paid the tax to the Commonwealth Government; the Commonwealth Government paid the Tas- tax to the State Government, and the State Government paid the money back to the millers?",27
55,Mr CASEY,WHEAT GROWERS RELIE FBILL,"That is so. I point out that no flour exported from Tasmania to the mainland will receive any advantage from this refund to Tasmania, although flour imported from the mainland for consumption in Tasmania will be treated in the same way as flour milled in Tasmania for consumption within the State. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Tho bill.",27
56,Mr NOCK,WHEAT GROWERS RELIE FBILL,"Riverina) [12.23] - Will the amount of refund to Tasmania, namely, the £7,500 per month for six months that has already been paid, and the £8,000 that will be paid if this bill is passed, be approximately the aggregate amount of flour tax collected in Tasmania?",27
57,Mr CASEY,WHEAT GROWERS RELIE FBILL,Yes . Bill agreed to and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. NA SECOND BEADING. Debate resumed from the 11th July (vidn page 418) on motion by Mr. CASEYTliat the bill be now read a second time.,27
58,Mr SCULLIN,LAN D TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yarra) [12.25] - This bill, as the Assistant Treasurer (Mr. Casey) has pointed out, is intended to meet a specific case, and I am in sympathy with its object; but I wish to utter a word of warning about it. Federal land tax is imposed on Crown leaseholds in such a way as to make it really a tax only upon the leaseholders personal interest in the estate. This tax has been imposed for many years, and it is quite as equitable as the tax upon freehold property. The tax is calculated by capitalizing the difference between the rental value of the laud and the amount of rent actually paid by the lessee. Consequent upon the financialemergency legislation, a reduction of per cent, was made in the rent of Crown leases in New South Wales. The immediate and automatic effect of that reduction was to increase the amount of federal land tax that the lessees were called upon to pay. That was neither intended noi desired. The existing law works in this way: the difference between what is deemed to be the actual rental value of the land and the rent that is charged is capitalized, and that capitalization is taken to be the leaseholders' estate in the land. It is upon that amount that federal land tax is imposed. A reduction of ""the rent increases the leaseholders' estate, and so increases the amount of his land taxation. As it was the intention of the Government of New South Wales to give the leaseholders a measure of relief by reducing their rents by 22-J per cent., it is not desired that the Commonwealth Government should now take back a part of that relief by increasing the land taxation. The purpose of this bill is to avoid that result. It would be possible, of course, to meet the case in another way. If the valuers recognized the depreciated valuation of the land, and decreased the value of it on the assumption that it was freehold property, the same effect could be achieved. The procedure BILL would be to assume that such a property 1934. was freehold, to make a valuation of it, and then calculate the economic value of the land as freehold. The capitalization that I have already referred to would then be calculated, and the tax imposed thereon. If that procedure were followed, relief could be given to the leaseholders, but it would take a long while, and involve the revaluation of the whole of the Crown leaseholds. Although the object of this bill is to meet a specific case, its provisions will have a general application, and herein lies the danger. A general provision will open the door so wide that, if, in the future, a State government dominated by landed interests desired to do so, it could deliberately, and without proper justification, reduce Crown rents, and so automatically reduce Commonwealth laifd tax revenue. - That would have the effect of giving to a State government power to interfere with the land tax collections of the Commonwealth. The position could be met by limiting the application of this bill to the specific instances with which it is meant to deal. Should another emergency arise, in the future it could be dealt with by a special amendment similar to this. Mr BEASLEY [12.31] - I should like to know from the Minister whether it would be possible under the bill as it now stands for a State government, influenced by the big land-holders, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) suggested, to defeat the purpose of the Commonwealth Land Tax by reducing rents to an unwarrantable degree?",28
59,Mr CASEY,LAN D TAX ASSESSMENT,That could happen.,28
60,Mr SCULLIN,LAN D TAX ASSESSMENT,"The purpose of the Land Tax Act is to give the Commonwealth the right to tax the leasehold estates of lessees, and if the rent be reduced the value of the leasehold estate is increased, and the Commonwealth should be entitled to tax it.",28
61,Mr BEASLEY,LAN D TAX ASSESSMENT,"The Leader of the Opposition said that a possible alternative to the present bill would be a. general Writing down of land values, and those of us who have watched events over the last few years have come to the conclusion that such a procedure is now inevitable. The honourable member said that it would probably take years to make such a comprehensive survey of the position, and it is admitted that by orthodox methods the process would be slow and the necessary relief would be deferred. This principle has been accepted now even by those who, a few years ago, were strongly opposed to anything of the kind. No matter to whai extent existing contractual obligations may be interfered with, inflated capital values will have to be written down, and very quickly too, if the country is to be restored to its proper level.  - I take it that the object of the bill is to protect the lessee against having to pay increased Commonwealth land tax because the State government has reduced his rent. In the ordinary course of events the lessee pays Commonwealth, land tax on the difference between the capital amount on which he pays rent, and the official value of the property, so that if the State government reduces his rent, there is a wider margin upon which he is taxed. This bill is designed to ensure that the lessee shall receive the benefit of any reduction of rent granted to him.",28
62,Mr CASEY,LAN D TAX ASSESSMENT,"Corio-Assistant Treasurer [12.35] - i recognise the merit of the suggestion put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin), and when the bill is in committee I shall introduce an amendment designed to meet his objection. The effect of the amendment will be to restrict the benefits of this measure to those present leaseholders in New South Wales whose rents have been reduced. The honourable member for West Sydradical ney (Mr Beasley) opened up the someCommonwealth what wider field of economic planning which he must himself realise is not directly touched upon by this bill, the object of which is to preserve leaseholders of New South Wales the benefit of the reduction of 22£ per cent, in rents made by the State government eighteen months ago. Unfortunately, according to the formula upon Commonwealth tax is assessed, the Commonwealth Government, and not the lessees, would have received the greater part of the benefit accruing from the repoint. duced rent. It is to remedy that position that the amending bill has been introduced. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2Suction twenty-eight of the Principal Act is amended by adding at the end of paragraph (aa) of sub-section (3.) the following proviso:Provided further that where, by any State Act, provision is made for a percentage reduction in annual rents reserved in leases of Crown lands, the annual rents reserved in those leases shall be deemed to be the annual rents payable prior to the percentage reduction.",29
63,Mr CASEY,LAN D TAX ASSESSMENT,"Corio-Assistant Treasurer) [12.42] - I move That the word "" is "", Kne 6, be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words "" has, prior to the commencement of this proviso, been "". full The proviso will then read as follows:Provided further that where, by any State Act provision has, prior to the commencement of this proviso, been made for a percentage reduction in annual rents reserved in leases of Crown lands, the annual rents reserved in those leases shall be deemed to be the annual rents payable prior to the percentage reduction. This amendment meets the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition in his second-reading speech. It will confine the benefits of the bill to those leases in respect of which reductions have already been made, and will preclude the possibility of a future government making reductions of rents without the Government being able to step in and levy inoreased land tax.",29
64,Mr BEASLEY,LAN D TAX ASSESSMENT,Will this measure to the apply only to New South Wales?,29
65,Mr CASEY,LAN D TAX ASSESSMENT,"The State of New South Wales has not been mentioned, but only in that State have rent reductions which the of this kind been made.",29

68,Mr FORDE,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Capricornia) [2.16] As this is a non-contentious measure signed to give legal effect to the intention of Parliament when it passed the Flour Tax Assessment Act, I shall not oppose it. Members of the Opposition were strongly opposed to the flour tax on the ground that it was most unjust and would press heavily upon the poorer sections of the people, because they eat more bread than others, who, being in more affluent circumstances, are able to vary their diet. It was pointed out at the time by the right honourable the Leader of the Oppositry tion (Mr Scullin) that while the Labour party stood for the relief of the wheatin growers, it was definitely opposed to the imposition of this most unfair tax. Leader urged, in an amendment which he moved to the budget proposals, the wheat-growers could be assisted more effectively by grants from the Conthe solidated Revenue, and that the marketport the bill. ing of wheat and other primary products, upon which the prosperity of this country depends, should be placed on proper basis under Commonwealth and State legislation. A federal Labour gorecognize vernment had already introduced the necessary legislation for the establishment of a Commonwealth compulsory wheat pool whioh, it was intended,"" should in conjunction with State pools. Under that scheme the growers would have power to fix a price for wheat for home consumption which would have assured for them a fair return for the labour and capital which they had invested in industry. The State governments could have fixed the price of flour and thus prevented the exploitation of consumers. By this means the consumers and producers would have been protected from the fluctuations of the overseas markets and from manipulation of the home market by profiteers. But as this is not the time for a lengthy discussion upon the principle of the flour tax, I do not intend to carry the debate further. I merely wish to make it clear that the Labour party in this House has always been 1934. definitely opposed to the flour tax.",30
69,Mr JENNINGS,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"South Sydney) [2.19] - I feel sure that honourable members generally will agree with the principle of this very short but important bill, the purpose of which is to repeal the flour tax imposed last year. 1. have always debeen opposed to the tax because of its effect on the price of bread. But if one studies the prices ruling in Sydney since the operation of the flour tax, one must, I think, admit that there has not. been the general increase of the price of bread that was anticipated. Nevertheless, it has, I think, been clearly demonstrated that there is a good deal in the contention of those honourable members who believe that the price of bread is affected by the ramifications of the wheat indusfrom the time the grain is sold to the miller until it reaches the consumer the form of bread. I mention this because it is a inatter of great importMy ance to the people generally. All sections of the public await with interest that the report of the Wheat Commission, which, it is hoped, will be presented to Government at an early date. I sup a offer no objection to the bill. I merely express the hope that the Government will the difficulties which have confronted honourable members' during the last three or four years in discussions relating to the wheat industry, and I trust work that Parliament will not be dissolved before a measure, designed to give perhad manent relief to*- wheat-growers, is brought down, so that the difficulties of our growers will not be made the football of party politics. The Government the has given the House a definite promise that such action will be taken. I hope that the promise will be fulfilled, following receipt of the report of the Wheat Commission, and that a bill to stabilize the wheat industry will be presented to this House at an early date. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time and reported from committee without amendment or debate. Report adopted, and bill-by leaveroad a third time. ELECTORALBILL 1934 SECOND READING . Debate resumed from the 12th July (vide page 496), on motion of Mr . PERKINS Tliat the bill be now rend a second time.",30
70,Mr BAKER,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Oxley) [2.23] - At the outset I protest against the lack of time afforded to honourable members for the consideration of this very important measure. There are 219 sections in the Commonwealth Electoral this measure to amend tains sixteen clauses. If honourable members wish to understand the f u l implications of the bill, and to decide whether or not they shall submit amenddecision ments, it is necessary for them to study closely the principal act as well as this amending bill. The second reading was moved by the Minister for the Interior  as the House sat until 11.30 last niaht and met again at 10.30 this morning, obviously those honourable members who wish to discuss the measure at the secondfor reading stage have not had sufficient time to examine the bill. As we are within two months of a general election, we are entitled to have reasonable time for the. scrutiny of all measures that are brought down for our consideration, especially bill of this nature making a number of amendments of the Electoral Act which will apply to the election. Some years ago the act contained a provision that no alteration could^ be made to the nomination' form within three months prior to' an election. If that were sidered desirable, how much .more imporand tant it is that the same conditions should apply to amendments of the act itself.. The Minister mentioned the four or fivemain provisions of the bill. The most important amendment is contained in clause 7, and relates to inmatesof institutions, the effect of the alteration being to require that their names be placed upon the roll for the electoral division in which they were livin g p r i o r to admission to such public institutions.",31
71,Mr GABIJ,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,It is a most dangerous proposal.,31
72,Mr BAKER,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"It is so regarded in Queensland. Under the recent redistribution proposals for that State, which have been adopted by both Houses of this Parliament, the Dunwich institution,, comprising about 1,000 electors, has been taken fro m the division of Oxley and transferred to the division of Moreton. That institution, which is known as the island subdivision, has always given a majority of several hundreds of votes to a Labour candidate. It s transference to the division of Moreton. it is 'believed, makes possible the defeat at the next elecAct, and tion of the present member for Moreton it conand ' Assistant Minister (Mr Francis). That being so, wo are entitled to suspect l that the threatened rejection of a member of the Government influenced Cabinet's to pass this bill, which, as I have shown, provides for the enrolment of inmates of public institutions for the subdivision in which they lived formerly. Honourable memibers on this side are opposed to this provision in the bill. We believe that inmates of such institutions should not be disturbed. In some cases they have been in those institutions ten, twenty, or more years, and they have lost all contact with their former places of residence. Some of them tend little plots of land, and now have all their interests in their new home. They are certainly entitled to have their names a retained on the roll for the division in which the institution is situated. Subclause 2 of clause 7, which deals with this matter, provides that the officer in charge of each institution shall, when required by the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State, furnish within a specified contime a list showing the name, age, sex, address of each inmate immediately prior to admission. Upon receipt of this information, each inmate w i ll have his name .placed on the roll for the division in which he resided previously, irrespective of whether or not he or she had lived there one week, one month, or_ ten years. It may have been only a week, yet under this proposed view section, the inmate will be forced to become an elector for a division in which, perhaps, he or she has no interest whatever.",31
73,Mr STEWART,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,Does not that condition obtain in Queensland today?,32
74,Mr BAKER,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"M a n y years ago anti-Labour government in Queensland passed a measure containing this prosent vision, and. it has not ye't been repealed. I. hope that it will be repealed in near future. These persons will be - entitled to vote only under the provisions relating to the postal vote and the absent vote, and the Minister has not given the House any information as to the methods that are to be adopted. He has not explained whether there will be siding officers at the institutions, whether they will have rolls for every federal division, and how the inmates are to know for what division they are enrolled that the boundaries have been altered or the name of the division changed. Usually a person who visits a polling booth to obtain a postal vote is asked to state the name of the division for which he or she is enrolled.",32
75,Mr HUGHES,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,How are the inmates find out whether they are enrolled or not?,32
76,Mr BAKER,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) has stressed the point that I am that these people are not even to be required to make a claim for enrolment. Some of them may have forgotten their former addresses, which they supplied upon entering the institution twenty years or more ago. That would apply particularly to those who are i failing health or whose mentality has become impaired. Even those who remember the places from which they came will not in the majority of cases know for what divisions they are supposed to be enrolled. No suggestion has been made as to what steps are to be taken to meet that contingency. But even posing that that difficulty is overcome some arrangement that w i ll enable the inmates of these institutions to learn the names of the divisions for which they are enrolled, there is the further drawback that, on account of their having been absent from those divisions for a considerable number of years, they will know nothing of the candidates who are standing for election. It would be possible for an inmate of an institution in Queensland to be enrolled for a division in Western Australia oiSouth Australia, and vice versa. Honourable members are an expected to be conversant with the political position and to know who reprethe different divisions, yet in the majority of cases they would fail to surtbe vive a test on the matter, and certainly would not know the names of all the candidates who stood for election. Even if the inmates of institutions were able to to overcome that trouble they would not know what political parties were represented by the different candidates. This preis a most unwise and unfair provision. In support of it , the Minister not only mentioned its inclusion in the Queensland act, but also pointed out that the act of now Western Australia disqualifies from enrolment and from voting at an election, persons who are wholly dependent upon relief from the State, or any charitable institution subsidized by the State, except patients who are under treatment for accident or disease in a hospital. Surely it cannot be argued that we are doing to something that is worthwhile because a State is so unfair as to deprive some of its citizens of the right to vote! We are trying to avoid such reactionary legislation. The act as it stands is as fair as it making, can be made in this respect. The next important provision is that which deals with incorrect enrolments. Under clause 9, persons whose names have been placed upon rolls when they are not entitled to enrolment, or in conn sequence of false statements, may be disfranchised. I consider that the House is entitled to a full explanation as to the exact meaning of that provision. We do not, wislr to run the risk of persons who are working away from their ordinary places of residence being told that they cannot become enrolled for that division. supI t may be found that they are not enrolled by for either division; that their usual place of residence will not be recognized because they have left it, and that the place in which they are working will not be recognized on the ground that they are residing in it only temporarily. With an involved and intricate measure of this nature it is necessary to make exhaustive comparisons with the act. Honourable members on this side have not been given sufficient time to assure themselves that no ulterior motive underlies certain alterations; consequently, the onus is on the Minister to make a full explanation of every proposal. Members of the Labour party are quite prepared to support the clause that is postal vote. designed to tighten up the postal voting provisions. I, personally, however, do not believe that it will be of very great value at elections. I necessity for making provision to punish persons who either influence or attempt to influence the votes of electors, particube larly those who vote by post. But it must be obvious that such an offence can detected only in isolated instances. There is no doubt that the practice is extensively indulged in. While I support this clause, because it is a step in the right direction, I contend that it is of very little and that, the Government should make a more determined effort to tighten up the postal voting provisions. Unquestionfor ably, there have been, in the past, there will be in the future, abuses those provisions. So obvious did they become some years ago that, this national parliament abolished postal voting, and the provision was not re-enacted several years. Proof of abuse may most readily be obtained by comparing the figures in relation to postal votes with those cast in the ordinary way in the same division. Por example, in many electorates, Labour members secure an overwhelming majority of the ordinary votes polled, but are in a minority on postal votes. If there is a swing to either one party or the other, that swing should be reflected in the postal votes and absent votes to as great an extent as in the nary votes. Yet, at election after elechave tion, at booth after booth, a check-up the figures shows the Labour candidate to have a majority of thou'sands of ordimade nary votes and a minority of postal votes. Air. Baker.",32
77,Mr STEWART,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,What is the use of speaking in general terms! Can the honourable member cite a specific case?,33
78,Mr BAKER,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I shall cite a specific case directly. The only explanation of the anomaly is that abuse has been practised in connection with postal voting. If anything, the swing in favour of Labour candidates should be slightly more pronounced in the case of postal votes than in the case of ordinary votes, because, with so many persons on relief work and rations, it is to be expected that the Labour voters will comprise the majority of the inmates of hospitals, and being least able to bear the cost of medical attention they are most likely to need a",33
79,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,It does not follow that because a man is a labourer he necesrealize the sarily votes Labour.,33
80,Mr BAKER,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"The Labour party gets the intelligent vote, whether the elector a labourer, a mechanic, or a professional man. It is the person who, no be matter what his avocation may be, is not interested in politics, is too tired to think for himself, and, consequently, adopts the arguments advanced by the anti-Labour press, who votes for honorvalue, able members opposite. We are quite satisfied to obtain the votes of those who are interested in politics, and who know what and for whom they are voting. and The Minister for Commerce (Mr. of Stewart) asked me to cite a case in support of my statement that the swingover in ordinary voting is not reflected in the postal votes. At the last federal for election I had a majority over the Nationalist candidate of 5,500 votes. The Lang candidate polled 1,000 votes. If his preferences had been counted, and had followed the trend shown by the votes cast for a candidate of the same party in the Brisbane division, my majority over the Nationalist candidate would have been the 6,500. Yet, notwithstanding these facts, my deficiency on the postal votes was in the ratio of 2 to 1. In what way can that be explained? Surely it is not contended ordithat members of the Government party a monopoly over the votes polled by of those who are sick! Mrs Service, a Nationalist party organizer, who was a justice of the peace on the recommendation of the Moore Government, not knowing my identity, boasted to me of the way in which the Nationalist party had captured nearly all the postal votes at the Brisbane Hospital. The Nationalist organization had sufficient funds to employ canvassers, whereas the Labour party had not, and the result was that most of the postal votes were cast in favour of Nationalist candidates. The whole story is already incorporated in Hansard. In my opinion, the postal voting provisions of the act should be tightened up more than is suggested in this bill. If the Government will not go so far as to-repeal those provisions altogether, it should arrange for either electoral officials or police officers to collect the votes of persons in hospitals. I do not suggest that that system be applied to huge electorates like Kalgoorlie or the Northern Territory. Electors in those divisions could vote either as postal voters or as absent voters. Another proposal to which little exception can be taken is that each elector must vote for the full number of candidates for the Senate in the order of his preference. If we are to have preferential voting, all the candidates should be voted for. At present that is necessary only when the number of candidates does not exceed twice the number nominated plus one. At the 1928 election the Labour party lost two senators owing to the death of one of the candidates between nomination day and polling day. Although the ballot papers clearly showed' that a majority of the electors of Victoria desired the return of three Labour senators, the High Court ruled that 11,000 votes cast in favour of Labour candidates were not to be counted, because there was a break in the numerical order of preference. One figure was missing, and because of that technicality two Nationalist candidates were elected instead of the Labour candidates whom the majority of the electors desired. The Government now proposes to alter the section upon which the High Court arrived at its decision. W it h that alteration I agree; but I wonder whether the Government's action is prompted by n belief that the law of averages will operate, and that the next time similar circumstances arise it will not be the Labour party which w i ll be the loser. Special provision has been made in the bill for the prevention of disorderly behaviour at election meetings. I do not object to the passing of legislation to prevent disturbances at election meetings, but I wonder whether this provision has been included because the Government fears the wrath of the electors.",33
81,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,The new provision simply makes for orderly meetings.,34
82,Mr BAKER,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"In most, if not all, of the States, there is legislation to deal with persons who cause disturbances at election meetings, and the only reason that I can see for this provision is that the Government, fearfu l that its record has aroused the ire of the electors, wishes to intimidate its opponents. There are other matters with which I should like to deal, but probably I shall have an opportunity to do so on some other occasion. In the meantime, I ask the Minister to give us some further in formation regarding the proposed new section which provides that electors may be struck off the roll, and also with regard to the enrolment of inmates of institutions, the manner in which their votes shall be recorded, and the granting of assistance to them at election time.  ter for the Interior) [2.52] - by leave I promised to make a statement regarding proposed new section 4 1 A of the act, which provides that persons living in institutions shall be enrolled for the electorates in which they formerly resided. I assure the House that no ulterior motive actuated the Government in introducing this clause. As a matter of fact, a member on the other side of the chamber asked that this provision be made.",34
83,Mr GANDER,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Who was he?  the House today. I shall supply the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin; with his name. In addition, some of the old folk living in-institutions have asked for this provision, claiming that they have no interest whatever in the new electorates in which they reside. Apparently, the House does not wish the inclusion of this clause, and consequently the Government is willin g that it be negatived in committee.",34
84,Mr HUGHES,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"North Sydney) [2.55]. - The Minister's statement that the Government does not desire to proceed with proposed new section 41A makes it unnecessary to comment on the subject with which it deals. This measure has been introduced with the objects of simplifying the machinery for the conduct of elections and ensuring the correctness of the rolls. No doubt the machinery must be as perfect as human effort can make it, but, after all, the primary object of an election is to ascertain the will of the people. It is, therefore, vital that we should not do anything whereby a person entitled to be enrolled might be disfranchised. In the more closely congested areas, there is, normally, a turnover of from 40 per cent, to 50 per cent.; on this occasion the position will be worse because of the redistribution. Electors are notorious for failing to take any interest in the rolls until the last moment. On this occasion many of the rolls will be entirely new, because of the radical changes which have taken place in the boundaries of some electorates. Tn the limited time that will be available to them, electors will not be able to scrutinize the new rolls which must be printed because of the redistribution, and it is inevitable that even on polling day numbers of electors will be uncertain of their enrolment, or of the"" electorate in which they are entitled to vote. I suggest, therefore, that wider discretionary powers be given to the presiding officers, so that, in cases in which they are satisfied that persons claiming votes are entitled to them, they may permit them to vote upon signing the necessary declarations. North Sydney is a quasi-city electorate, and I expect that there will be 10,000 new electors on the roll, in addition to the normal turnover from other electorates, and the enrolment of those who, since the last election, have reached the age entitling them to a vote. Efforts are being made to purify the rolls; but it may happen that in purifying them, persons entitled to vote will be excluded, in which case the appeal to the country will be robbed of much of its value. If an appeal is to be made to Caesar, we should ensure that Caesar's voice will be heard. On many occasions I have had to deal with the complaints of persons who have been struck off the roll. I am perfectly sure that 35 per Bill 1934. cent, of the electors do not know the name of the division for which they are enrolled at the present time, or at any rate on what roll they will be included for the next election. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to this inatter and will take appropriate steps to overcome the difficulty. As for the other amendments proposed in the bill, I believe that they are wise. [ shall refrain from commenting upon section 41 because the Minister has announced that it is proposed to withdraw the provision amending it. Whether the withdrawal is wise or not, I do not know. All that I ask is that the people of this country, whether inmates of institutions or not, shall not, in consequence of this crusade for the purification of the rolls, find themselves unable to vote. That is the matter which mostly concerns me. The law provides that everybody must vote, and we make it easy for people to record their votes even by providing facilities for postal and absent voting. Any fraud, or attempt to evade or defeat the provisions of the statute must be dealt with, but in the main, people only desire to exercise their right to record a vote, t ask the Minister to see that discretionary powers are given on this occasion, when the rolls are being hurriedly printed and submitted to the people too late to make wholesale alterations, and when hundreds of thousands of people are being placed in new electorates, so that everybody will be able to record a vote.  A suggestion for amendment of the electoral law which is not proposed at the present stage, but which I ask the Government to consider seriously, relates to the method of voting for the Senate. The system in vogue at the present time results in full representation being given to a party or parties polling possibly only 51 per cent, or 52 per cent, of the total votes cast in the States concerned, while another party or other parties, having a total of, perhaps, 48 per cent, or 49 per cent., are given no representation whatever. In view of the fact that three senators are elected on each occasion, it would be possible, if the proportional representation system were adoptedfor the Senate, to ensure that any large party would have at least one representative. When a political tidal wave came along one section might have two representaplus tives out of three, hut three. A politically strong which suffered from an adverse political swing would obtain a sufficient number of votes to entitle it to one in each State instead of having no repreClark sentation whatever. Without going into is elaborate details the difference between the method of calculating the voting for the arguments the Senate under the proportional repreagainst sentation scheme and under the present system may be illustrated by the followRepresentatives ing analogy: If an honourable member went into a shop for the purpose of buyit ing an article, such as a hat, costing, 25s., and tendered £2 he would expect to receive the hat and 15s. change. He would be astonished if the shopkeeper provided him with the hat, gave him back his £2, and informed him that he could make a further purchase with the money. If he then decided to buy a pair swing. of boots costing 25s., he would not expect to receive mort, than the boots and change. Imagine his absolute astonishreturned. ment if again the full amount tendered were returned to him ! That is precisely what happens under our present system of voting for the Senate. A certain ber of votes is handed over what, to preserve the metaphor, we might term the political counter, let us say, for the purpose of securing reprereasonably sentation, but upon obtaining that repreper sentation to the extent of the first none of these votes is expended; all Labour may be employed again with full strength for the purpose of securing a second unit of representation, and again the process of the votes. may be repeated for the third time, with the result that the purchasing power of what we might term the electoral token may be employed three times in successtituting sion. Under proportional voting, howthe ever, all voters are treated in precisely the same way as a normal shopkeeper treats his customers. A certain sum is adjourned. definitely accepted for the sale of some article, and only the change back. That is precisely the position which obtains in connection with the proportional representation system, and if it were applied the number of votes required to provide the quota for the election of, let us say, senator No . 1, would be definitely expended and only the survotes over and above that quota never would be available for making a further party purchase. I suggest that this system would be a more suitable one to apply to Senate elections than that at present seat in operation. I know that the Haresystem in operation in Tasmania open to criticism for various reasons, but I do not think that any of that can be used it with respect to .seats in a legislative body, such as the House of or the State House of Assembly, could be used when one adopts for the purposes of a Senate election. say, I think the system is admirably applicable to Senate elections, and would give a certain degree of stability which, today, does not obtain. To-day, no matter how strong an in* dividual senator's personality may be, or how great his capacity and popularity, he is entirely at the mercy of a political Under proportional representation, a really strong man on the opposithe tion side would almost certainly be Even if he were returned alone for a. particular State, I believe that the system would give a stability to the representation in the. Senate which is entirely numlacking at the present time. Moreover, it would more accurately reflect the opinions of the voters as a whole than does the present method. Nobody can contend that if , say, 52 cent, of the electors vote against seat, Labour, and 48 per cent, vote on the side, or vice versa, justice is done if the whole of the eighteen seats go ro the side which obtains 52 per cent, I ask the Minister to give consideration to my suggestion, and I hope that the time will come when the electoral law will be amended by subproportional representation for Senate in place of the existing system. Debate (on motion by Mr ROSEVEAH) is handed INCOMETAXASSESSMENTBIL L 1934. SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 5th July (vide page 277), on motion by Mr CASEYThat the bill be now read a second time.",35
85,Mr SCULLIN,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Yarra) [3.12] - I do not propose to discuss the bill at any length at this stage, because it is essentially a measure for the committee stage. There would be nothing irregular in a general debate on this bill on the various principles governing income taxation, but we have discussed them frequently in the past, and it would be better to fine ourselves to the specific proposals in the measure. In framing taxation legislation two ideals should be kept in mind-equit y and simplicity. It is difficult to realise both. The more we try to secure equity, the less we obtain simplicity, particularly in regard to company taxation. Our old friend section 21 has been discussed in every session since we have had an income tax. The report of the royal commission covers a large field of investigation, and goes thoroughly into the matter of simplifying the methods of imposing income taxation. It is a very valuable report, and honourable members will be well repaid by reading it. The main object of the inquiry was to simplify the system, and make it less vexatious both to the department and the taxpayers, and, to some extent, the commission has succeeded in attaining that object. While it seems to taxpayers that the department acts severely in administering the law, even this Parliament may be criticized for its severity in this regard. It must be remembered, of course, that when the Parliament imposes a tax of this kind, it must strive to see that everybody pays his just dues; otherwise the rates have to be increased, and some taxpayers have to pay more than their share to make up for those who evade taxation. Some times it is difficult to avoid evasion, ticularly by holding companies. I believe that some companieshave been formed deliberately for the purpose of evading taxation. This bill does not propose either to increase or decrease the amount of tax collected. It is not a taxing measure, although incidence may be such as to decrease taxation in some cases and increase it in others. For instance, the bringing about of a uniform exemption will result in some reduction of the revenue, hut, on the other hand, the rebates proposed to be made on the current rate of company tax, as it will work out at present, will cause some increase of the revenue. I do not know how far one alteration will balance the other, but there will not be a great deal of difference. Some of the clauses need careful examination, but my experience of taxation measures is that the details are best concon- sidered during the committee stage. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and committed - pro forma. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.",37
86,Mr LYONS,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.17] - I move That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, the 24th instant, at 3 p.m. The budget will be submitted on that day, and following upon its presentation we shall resume the discussion of the electoral redistribution proposals.",37
87,Mr SCULLIN,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Yarra) [3.18] - The Government, no doubt, has its own reasons for adjourning over next week, but one would like to have an indication of the nature of the business to be dealt, with when we resume on the 24th instant. When is it proposed .to dissolve Parliament? The House is entitled to know where it stands in that regard. We have been informed by the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) that when we resume on the 24th the budget will be presented. I do not know what interval will elapse between the budget speech and the dis-cussion of the proposals arising out of it. We should like some information as to the number of measures that are likely to be brought down. The parPrime Minister is probably unable to indicate their exact nature, but honourable members would be glad to know ahead how many measures are to he submitted during the limited period available prior to the elections. By the time we have discussed the budget the end of the its month will have been reached, and then we shall be within a month or five weeks of the date suggested for the elections.",37
88,Mr GABB,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Angas) [3.19] - I also hope that the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) will give the House some idea as to whether members will find it worthwhile to return to Canberra on the 24th instant. If the Government merely intends to present the budget, throw it on the table of the House, and scamper away to the elections, it will be hardly worthwhile for some members to travel from distant States to Canberra; but, if definite business will be transacted for a week or two our presence here will be necessary.",37
89,Mr LYONS,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.20] - The Governrates ment's intention is to submit the budgettime on. Tuesday, the 24th July. The House will then be asked to proceed with the business now on the notice-paper. That, as well as the measures arising out of the budget, we hope to dispose of before the session terminates. The legislation consequent upon the budget will probably be included in one omnibus bill, as has been done on previous occasions, but it may not be possible to cover all these matters by the one measure - Honourable members may rest assured - that there will be plenty of business to occupy the three weeks which will bo available before the Mouse finally adjourns on the 10th were circulated:August. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA COLLECTION BILL 1934. SECOND READING.",38
90,Mr STEWART,COLONIAL LIGHT DUES,"Parramatta-Minister for Commerce) [3.21] - I move That the hill - be now read a second time. This measure is designed to bring the collection of light dues in Australia on vessels which pass certain lighthouses in the Leeward and Bahama Islands into conformity with the present charges made by the British Board of Trade. Honourable members will recall that in 1932 we passed a Colonial Light Dues Collection Act to enable us to collect, on behalf of the British Government, light dues from vessels which secured benefits from twelve lighthouses and one light buoy which the British Government had provided in the West Indies. Our legislation at that time made a specific charge in conformity with the charges then being collected from all vessels 'by the British Government in other dominions and Great Britain itself. Since then certain reductions have been made, and it is now desired that the dues we collect from vessels which call at Australia after passing those lighthouses shall be in conformity with the reduced charges now operating elsewhere. All this bill proposes to do is to enable the Collector of Customs to collect the' reduced charges, aud to conform to any alterations of the that may be made from time to by the British Board of Trade. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time and reported from committee without amendment or debate; report adopted. .Bill-h y leave-rea d a third time. House adjourned at 3.25 p.m. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. The following answers to questions COMMONWEALTH BANK.",38

97,Mr LATHAM,COLONIAL LIGHT DUES,"The information is being obtained, and a reply will be furnished as soon as possible, in reply to a question asked by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) in regard to sitting days of judges. OIL FUEL FROM COAL.",39
98,Mr JAMES,COLONIAL LIGHT DUES,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is it a fact that since the successful trials of coal oil in farm tractors at the New South Wales Government Agricultural College at Hawkesbury by Lyon Brothers, the of! companies have reduced the price of farm tractor fuel by 2d. per gallon, while increasing the price of motor spirit by 3d. per gallon in New South Wales? 2. What steps has he taken to f u l f il the promises made by him and Senator MCLachlan at Cessnock in March last, viz.:{n.) that they would try to get the controllers of the hydrogenation process to start the erection of a plant on the coal-fields within twelve months; and (ft) that if the New South W'ales Government committee investigating the process of Lyon Brothers reported favourably on the yields of oil obtained, they"" would give Lyon Brothers the same encouragement as given to overseas operators? 3 What encouragement, if any, has been RELATIVES - riven to the. hydrogenation group, or to Lyon Brothers, to establish this industry, and relieve unemployment on the South Maitland coalfields ?",39
99,Mr LYONS,COLONIAL LIGHT DUES,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. I am aware that certain fluctuations have occurred in the prices of tractor fuel and motor spirit in New South Wales, but from the information at my disposal I would not in any way associate these price variations with the trials of coal oil which were carried out at the Hawkesbury Agricultural College by If , in the Lyon Brothers. 2. (a) I gave a certain undertaking to representatives of the mining industry whom I. met at Cessnock on the 23rd March, 1934, the nature of which I outlined, together with details of action which had been taken subsequently, in the course of a reply which I made in the House on the 11th July, to a question asked by the honourable member. (6) In the course of its report on the Lyon Brothers' process the committee appointed by the Government of New South Wales said, inter alia. "" The plant used was an experimental one and quite inadequate for proving commercial possibilities."" The committee also went on to say that the costs of production as set out by Messrs. Lyon Brothers were estimates based on figures obtained from English practice, and that the committee was not in a position to subscribe to those figures. The committee also stressed the necessity ot markets being found for all the products if the proposition is to be a commercial success. Therefore it ^vpuld appear that the report of the committee was inconclusive from the point of view of indicating the merits of the proposition. 3. See reply to 2.",39
