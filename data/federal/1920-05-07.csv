1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. SALE OF COAL.",19
2,Mr TTJDOK,Unknown,"Yesterday , the Minister for the JTavy promised, to supply me with information concerning the procedure to be followed by the householder who wishes to buy coal under the regulations just issued by the Coal .Board. Many householders have not been able to buy .a pound of coal during the last seven or eight months, and with winter approaching rapidly the position is serious for them. Householders generally wish to know what they must do to obtain coal. Will there be a set form'of application fOT it?",19
3,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"All that the householder has to dp is to order the coal from a merchant in the ordinary way. A form of certificate has been adopted, which the merchant will ask the customer to sign before the coal is delivered. In signing that certificate, the customer will be making a declaration that he has not received coal .contrary to the regulations. The object of this procedure is to make our supply of coal go round as far as it will. JTo one is to get more than 10 cwt, I hope that we may dispense with all these restrictions before very long.",19
4,Mr FENTON,Unknown,For what period is the 10 .cwt. to suffice? - Sir JOSEPH COOK - For four weeks. I hope that by the end of that time the restrictions may be removed altogether. MERCANTIL E MARINE . VISIT OF THE PKINCE OF WALES.,19
5,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I draw the attention of the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) to the fact that the Shandon, which has just arrived, would be a very suitable ship for the mercantile marine to use in. taking part in the reception which is to be given to the Prince of Wales. Will the honourable gentleman consider the suggestion?",20
6,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I shall inquire into the matter. We should be glad to do anything we can on the occasion of the Prince's visit to show our appreciaing tion of the mercantile marine. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.,20
7,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta-Min ister for the Navy) [11.4] - I movet Tbat the House, at its rising, adjourn Tuesday next, at 3 p.m.",20
8,Mr RILEY,Unknown,What is the need for meeting on Tuesday? The business that we have been doing this week has not Prime Minister. been urgent. What is the urgent business that the Government wishes us to deal with?,20
9,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am amazed at the honourable member's question. I am afraid that he shares the popular notion that, unless something sensational and striking to the imaginationis takof ing place, useful work is no't being done. The business put through this week of the utmost consequence to the people of this country.",20
10,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Especiall y the Supus plementary Estimates, covering expendithat ture of some years ago!",20
11,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes ; they had to be passed, and it was time they were passed. I am surprised at the suggestion that measures for replenishing the coffers of the Old-age and War Pensions Funds, and similar measures, are of no account. Tha't will not be the opinion of the pensioners themselves. Question resolved in the affirmative. AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS' REPATRIATION BILL .",20
12,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Why has the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Bill been placed fourth on the list of Government measures? A little while ago the Opposition, was told that it was holding up this* measure.",20
13,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"A dead-lookhaa arisen regarding the Bill, and delay is necessary to enable us to take counsel with the Leader of the Senate in the hope of finding a via media by which, the tremendous crisis that overhangs the two Houses may be removed. WOOL POOL.",20
14,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,"In view of the statement in the press that the voting regardthe Wool Pool was against continuance, and as it is a natural assumptioni that if all interested could have been polled, instead of the small vote that was taken, there would have been a much larger majority against continuance, will the Government announce as soon as posuntil sible what it intends to do in the matter ?",20
15,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I shall bring the question under the notice of the NA CONSUMPTION.,20
16,Mr FENTON,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"As the prospects for the coming harvest are exceedingly bad, I ask if the Government has taken action to provide that an ample supply of wheat last season and of the previous season shall be retained in Australia, so that 1 was our own people may not be short?",20
17,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"I think that there is enough wheat in Australia, to see through for the present, and I hope before the existing stocks have been consumed much more will be available. WHEA T POOLS. D l STBIBUTION OF MONEYS .",20
18,Mr GREGORY,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"A few days ago I asked whether, in consideration of the severe drought that is prevailing, the Government, if it cannot finalize the accounts of the A and B Wheat Pools, will not at least distribute whatever moneys are in hand in connection with those pools ?",20
19,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"I cannot give a definite answer to the question. My honourable colleague has the matter in hand, and is endeavouring to make a tribution at the earliest moment. CONTINUANCE OE WHEAT POOL. Prime",20
20,Mr SPEAKER,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"I have received the honourable member for Echuca (Mr. Hill ) an intimation that he desires move the adjournment of the House discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The continuance of the Wheat Pool for this season under existing conditions."" Five honourable members having risen ratify in their places. Question proposed.",21
21,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,I have not had notice of this.,21
22,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"Echuca) [11.11] - I take this action reluctantly, but my patience and that of the members of the Country party and of the growers of wheat throughout the Commonwealth is about exhausted. I have tried hy every means in my power to obtain a satisfactory answer from the Prime Minister to quesafter tions on this subject, and have been to do so. On two occasions I have placed questions on the notice-paper. day I askedWhen will the House he given an opportunity to discuss the question of the continuation .the Wheat Pool? To which the reply wasAs soon as the state of public business mits of this being done. There is no more pressing public business at this moment than a solution culty regarding the Wheat Pool. I have on more than one occasion approached the Prime Minister regarding it, and when he was last approached by - bers of the Australian Wheat Board, who had carried a resolution in favour of continuation of the Pool for this year under existing conditions-and I am I speaking now' only of the continuance the Pool for this year, not of a compulsory Pool for succeeding years-the right honbeen orable gentleman said that, owing to manner in which the Pool had been critihe cised, he did not propose to continue for another year. It seemed to me that he suggested that I was one of those had criticised the Pool unfairly. I criticised the administration of the but not the creation of ""the Pool. conception of the Pool was good, but disadministration has been very bad, and, in some instances, scandalous. To my mind, the greatest offender was the Minister, and I shall instance just one act of his-the sale of 1,000,000 tons from of wheat made by him without any to authority at all, in the early part of to July, 1919. I do not wish to be vindictive, but I wish to clear myself and the - growers of the country of the charge of having unfairly criticised the administration of the Pool.",21
23,Mr RODGERS,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,Did not the Board the bill?,21
24,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"The sale was made without any authority, and under conditions of which the Board knew nothing until some time later. On the 24th June last, a cable message was received from the Prime Minister stating that it might be possible to sell 500,000 tons of wheat, and asking what was the lowest price the Board would he prepared to accept. The ' Board was. hurriedly called together, and, consultation, decided to cable to the unable Prime Minister that 5s. should be the irreducible minimum at which wheat Yestershould be sold. But it was also understood that the message should intimate to the Prime Minister .that, although of that minimum had been fixed, he should get a better price, and he was left to do that. The next information we received perwas that the Prime Minister had sold "" 500,000 tons of wheat at 5s. 6d. per bushel. That was all right; he had of the diffiauthority to do that.",21
25,Mr STEWART,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,The Board would not have mentioned such a low price as 5s. per bushel had it known the state of the the mem? world's market at that time.,21
26,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"Unfortunately , we did the not know, and had no means of ascertaining, the state of the world's market. will admit, in justice to the Prime Minof ister, that he had been in Great Britain for at least fifteen months and had not able to sell a single bushel of wheat, the even although during part of that time had authority to sell at 4s. 9d. But it the wheat market was advancing, damage was being caused to our stocks by weevils who and mice, storage charges were mounthave ing up, and we were compelled to ask Pool, for a better price. The next thing we The heard was that the Prime Minister had the sold 1,000,000 tons of wheat at 5s. 6d. per bushel, and had given an option over a further 500,000 tons of Avheat at the same, price, making 1,500,000 tons in all, of which 1,000,000 tons was sold without the authority of the Australian Wheat Board. That option was , exercised by the British Government very shortly afterwards. This was a verysatisfactory arrangement to the British Government-it meant, "" heads the British Government wins, and tails the Australian Wheat Board loses."" However things happened, the British Government stood to win in regard to that option, for the simple reason that, if the price of wheat advanced, the Imperial Government would exercise its option, but, if wheatdeclined, the option would not be exercised. That 500,000 tons of wheat was tied up for the period for which the option was given-given , I may remark, without any payment, a thing which no business man would do. The Prime Minister has frequently stated that he obtained for our wheat 6d. per bushel more than was asked by the Australian Wheat Board. Tbat statement is not correct. Within twelve days after the Prime Minister had sold the additional 1,000,000 tons of wheat without authority, the Argentine market appreciated 2s. per bushel, and within three weeks a further Is., making a total advance of 3s. per bushel. The Prime Minister should have been better advised than to make this sale. A London agency has been established, and it would, always be at the disposal of the Prime Minister for the purpose of finding out the latest information regarding the state of the crops and the markets of other countries. That agency should have been consulted, but I understand that the Prime Minister made the sale of 1,500,000 bushels without consulting the agency at all. The - House will be interested to hear the sums of money that have been paid to the London agency for work done in connection with what were supposed to be f.o.b. sales, but which were conceded to he c.i.f. sales. From the inception of the scheme, on the 31st December, 1916, the firms of John Darling and Son, James Bell and Company, Louis Dreyfus and Company, and Dalgety and Company received, in commission, at 3/10ths per cent., a sum of £61,928, and, at $ per cent., £129,298, making a total commission paid to 30th November, 1919, of £191,226. These commissions were quite apart from the handling charges and commission for work done at this end. The Prime Minister had no right to commit the growers to a sale of over 1,000,000 tons of wheat, involving an amount of £10,000,000, without consulting the Australian Wheat Board. I come now to the aftermath of the sale. We were left so short of wheat that in November last, when the Egyptian Government offered 94s. per quarter c.i.f. for wheat, and £32 per ton for flour c.i.f., it was deemed inadvisable to part w:th so much foodstuffs pending a knowledge of what the coming harvest would be. I made a statement at that time that an offer to buy wheat and flour at prices equivalent to 30s. per bushel had been received. That statement was questioned, and I therefore wrote to .the manager of the Australian Wheat Board to ascertain exactly what the position was. I received the following letter:The following is the telegram regarding the - Egyptian inquiry .forwheat and flour:Egyptian Government want offer 90,000 tons wheat and flour-wheat preferredabout equal monthly shipments seven months, indicate wheat, 94s.; flour, £32 c.i.f. These prices of 94s. per quarter for wheat and £32 for flour, are c.i.f. The wheat wouia be worth l is . 9d. per bushel c.i.f., and if Commonwealth Government freights were available at £6 5s. per ton, equal to nearly 8s. Cd. f.o.b. The pre-war freights from Australia to the United Kingdom and the Continent averaged about 9d. per bushel. Yet the Commonwealth Government steamers were apparently asking for £6 5s. per ton, equal to 3s. 4d. per bushel, for freight from here to Egypt. The letter continues The flour, at £32 per ton' c.i.f., would give a return of about 10s. l$d. per bushel f.o.b. We will he able to continue selling the flour to the Egyptian Government, but we will be unable to supply the wheat. In the first place, we do not have it to spare, and, secondly, if we had the spare wheat, we would require the Commonwealth Government line for flour, and we would have to pay a rate of freight which would reduce wheat values below 8s. Cd. I draw the attention of the House to the statement, In the first place we do not < f have wheat to spare."" W3iat was the' reason? Simply that the Prime Minister sold 1,000,000 tons of wheat without authority at 5s. 6d. per .bushel, and we are left today .absolutely stranded.  joicing throughout the farming areas when the sale was announced.",21
27,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,I do not care what the rejoicing Was.,23
28,Mr STEWART,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,That was because the farmers did not know the facts.,23
29,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,I hope the Department will make 'an official statement about this.,23
30,Mr HULL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,I . shall welcome any official statement that the Department can give.,23
31,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,The honourable member does not want an official statement. He has not had the courtesy to inform the Government that he intended to move this motion.,23
32,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"The Government do not deserve any courtesyi because of the way in which the Prime Minister has treated the growers. He has been approached in a gentlemanly way. by a representative of the growers, and he has not deigned to give them any reply. He has acted in an absolutely autocratic manner, and I rise today to nrotest against his action. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear ; it v is time somebody protested. Sir JOSEPH Cook - Lou d and unanimous cheers from the Labour party.",23
33,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"I shall quote to the House a circular distributed by the National Federation during the election, and entitled, "" Facts,"" biit which contained more lies than any other circular which the Federation issued.",23
34,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"The honourable member ought to read his own speeches, in Victoria.",23
35,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"The honourable member does not like the truth. These "" Facts "" were distributed by the National Federation, and I can only characterize them as worthy of that body. The pamphlet showed that the London parity for wheat was 2s. 9d. f.o.b"". in November, 1918, and basing their calculations on that assumption, they proceeded to show that the splendid sales made by the Prime Minister had resulted in placing an additional £10.000,000 in the pockets of the grower. TJnfortunatelv. I have lost the pamphlet,"" and am speaking from memory. On the 16th December the Australian Wheat Board met, and a statement was placed on the table, dealing with the purchase of 2,200,000 bushels made by the British GovernmentThis figure of 2,200,000 bushels represents a sum of £522,500, at 4s. 0d. per bushel, or based on the existing overseas value of, say, Ss. per bushel, £S80,000. That is to say, although the Prime Minister tried to hoodwink the farmers into the belief that he had put money into their pockets by selling wheat at 5s. 6d. while it was worth only 2s. 9d., the Australian Wheat Board officials say it was worth 8s.",23
36,Mr FLEMING,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,Would it not be only fair to bring up this matter when the Prime Minister is here to answer?,23
37,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"I wish the Prime Minister were here. My friends on the Labour side stress the high cost of living, and I agree with them; but the producers accept no responsibility in this regard. Our primary products are, and have been, cheap; and during the war period wheat for flour never cost the Australian, consumer more than 4s. 9d. I can well remember that when wheat was sold at 5s. at country stations the price of the 4-lb. loaf was 5d.; and yet, during the later war period, - with wheat at only 4s. 9d., bread was sold in the country at lOd. At present, the various State Governments have enough wheat at 7s. Sd. to last to the end of the year; and they have made an excellent deal. Without ""giving away "" anything, I say that the price of 7s. 8d. per bushel, although it might seem to be high, would not have been paid if certain gentlemen had had their way.",23
38,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,Who are they?,23
39,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,I do not like to say too much about the matter.,23
40,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,You ought to say.,23
41,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"Then I will. I do not like to say these things, but the Prime Minister fought against that price. I shall not say anything more in the matter at the present time; hut, if the Prime Minister chooses to deny or explain, I shall take an opportunity to tell the whole story. Last week, when I was coming from Bendigo, I saw large trains of the finest wheat that could be produced in the world going away at 5s. 6d. per bushel, while today the price of wheat in America, f.o.b., is at least 16s. 6d., and in the Argentine at least 13s. 4£d. These are the prices at which wheat in those 'countries is being sold; and I should say it could not be landed here, in view of the high freights and the adverse rate of exchange, at anything under 22s. or 23s. I think the information I have given to the House justifies me and the party to which I belong in criticising the Prime Minister. I have given, only one instance in which that honourable gentleman has done things he should not have done, and has taken into his hands the sole responsibility for disposing of, at least, £10,000,000 worth of wheat without any authority whatever. There is continued silence o:n the part of the Prime Minister in regard to the ""Wheat Pool for the coming year. I unhesitatingly say that the Pool as conceived was a good thing, but that the administration, particularly from the political side, has been bad. I desire to make my position clear in regard to the Victorian Pool. For the officials who are working with the Board I have the highest regard; and when the Pools are settled up I believe that the Victorian Pool will compare more than favourably with any other.",23
42,Mr RODGERS,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,What do you suggest as the future policy in. regard to the Pool?,24
43,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"We ought to know at the earliest possible moment what the Prime Minister intends 'to do. He promised a guarantee, and he gave a guarantee, of 5s. per bushel for wheat, grown in Australia and delivered at country stations for the last year and for the coming year. The honourable gentleman takes every credit to himself for having given that guarantee; but it was given too late for last season - jus t before the harvest-to induce anybody to grow any more that year. Further, it was too late to induce anybody to fallow last year for this year. Had it been given earlier, as it should have beeu, the chances are that a very much larger increase would have been seen this year; at any rate, it was given too late to influence the area sown last year, or the quantity likely to be produced this year. It is absolutely impossible to deal with this year's harvest without a Poolthat is, if we are going to have any harvest, in view of the unprecedentedly bad conditions in the northern parts of Victoria and the wheat belt generally. It is absolutely necessary for the Government to take such steps as will create confidence amongst the growers, who wish to know what is going to happen in the future. They ought to know how the guarantee of os. is to be made operative unless we have a Pool, and how the wheat is to be got away unless shipping is available. We recognise the troubles in regard to freight, and that the farmers will have to face almost insurmountable difficulties in getting back to the private system from the pooling system. In view of the fact that the Prime Minister guarantees 5s. for this year, and that freights are altogether abnormal, we should have, at the earliest .possible moment, an intimation from him as to what he is going to do. On behalf of the wheat-growers of Australia, I appeal for early and favourable information. There is absolutely no risk to the Government in connection, with the guarantee, and this the Prime Minister knew full well when he gave it;; as a matter of fact, any man in the street would have given the guarantee, so that no credit is attached to the honourable gentleman. When there was some risk, however, the Government refused to face it. It has been shown that the production of wheat in Australia decreased during the war period by 4,500,000 acres, Victoria alone showing a decrease of 1,500,000 acres; and this because of the absence of a guarantee to the growers of the cost of production.",24
44,Mr RODGERS,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"Wannon) [11.40] Under cover of this motion, the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) voices his anxiety that the wheat-growers of Australia shall know exactly what the proposals are for the handling of the future harvest, and he uses the opportunity to make one of his characteristic attacks on the Prime Minister in his absence.",24
45,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"I rise to a point of order. The honourable member describes my remarks as "" one "" of my "" characteristic attacks"" on the Prime Minister. I ask honourable members to point out when I have ever made an unwarranted attack on the Prime Minister. .",24
46,Mr SPEAKER,WHEA T FOR LOCAL, I must ask the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) to continue his speech without any personal reference to other honourable members.,25
47,Mr RODGERS,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"I shall put the matter in another way. Throughout his election campaign, the honourable member for Echuca, whenever he addressed a-body of farmers, let fall not one generous word with regard to the attitude of the Prime Minister so far as the wheat-growers or other producers in the country are concerned.",25
48,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,What generous words fell from any members of the Country party about the Prime Minister?,25
49,Mr RODGERS,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"I claim to be personally quite as much interested in the wheat-growers as is the honourable member for Echuca, and I hope that I can present a case to counteract views that have been laid before the House this morning. The honourable member for Echuca charges the Prime Minister with being personally responsible for a loss of millions of money to the wheat-growers; but we are all wise after the event. The honourable member for Echuca, himself, is party to an agreement under which today Australian growers are losing 4s. a bushel.",25
50,Mr HILT,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,-Prov e it.,25
51,Mr RODGERS,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,The honourable member is a member of the Board,25
52,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,The sale was made without the approval of the Board; it was a fortnight or more before we knew the conditions of sale.,25
53,Mr RODGEES,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"The honourable member and I are talking of two totally different matters. I am referring to the sale approved by the Board of wheat for home consumption at 7s. 8d., when the world's parity is at least 12s. 6d.",25
54,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,As k the Prime Minister what it would have been sold at if he had had his way.,25
55,Mr RODGERS,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"Her e is a contract *or a specific quantity of 500,000 tons, and then for another 500,000 tons, made hy the Prime Minister at a time when it was almost impossible to sell wheat. But when the worid requires wheat, the honourable member for Echuca takes part in selling it at 7s. 8d. per bushel, although the world's parity is at least 12s. 6d. at any port. The honourable member himself is _in exactly the same position as that into which he is trying to put' the Prime Min-. ister in regard to the previous sale.",25
56,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"I am not; one contract is for the sale in Australia, and the other for sale to the world.",25
57,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,I am told that the Prime Minister did no such thing as block the sale referred to.,25
58,Mr RODGERS,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,I propose to leave the Prime Minister to deal with the statements made by the honourable member for Echuca.,25
59,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,There is no truth in the statement that the Prime Minister blocked that sale.,25
60,Mr RODGERS,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"Howeve r that may be, it is for the Prime Minister to deal with the matter. But it shows the unwisdom of criticising, in the light of present prices, a contract made many months ago. Honourable members will recall the negotiations and the pressure brought to bear to sell Australian wheat prior to that stage, and they will remember that no market could be secured. Then came the announcement of the sale at 5s. 6d. per bushel. In the light of the information afforded to me as a wheat-grower, I , personally, considered it at the time an excellent sale; it was a tremendous relief to the country. What are the proposals in connection with the handling and sale of our coming harvest? There was one for the compulsory establishment of a wheat pool among the farmers themselves. Every grower was to be compelled to place his wheat into a pool, and the commodity was to be controlled and sold under a compulsory pooling system.",25
61,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,We asked that the farmers should be given a chance to voluntarily place their wheat into a pool.,25
62,Mr RODGERS,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"It was to be ""voluntarily"" put into a compulsory pool. To-day's debate should convince the hard-headed farmer that the sooner he gets rid of all pools, so far as his wheat is concerned, the better. Honourable members continually interjecting,",25
63,Mr SPEAKER,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,".Will the honourable member please resume his seat? I ask honourable members to observe the Standing Orders. It is almost impossible for an honourable member to make a speech, at present, without being continually interrupted, even to the extent of several speeches being conducted simultaneously. Ordi-nary debate is impossible under those conditions, and I ask honourable members, therefore, to observe the rules governing procedure in this Chamber, and to allow honourable members who may be addressing the Chair the opportunity to do so without such constant and persistent interruption.",25
64,Mr RODGERS,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"I was hopeful this morning that the discussion, would have been concentrated upon the best methods for handling our wheat in future. The debate has degenerated, however, into a rancorous attack upon the Prime Minister.",26
65,Mr GABB,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"The honourable member's speech itself began in that strain. Other honourable members interjecting,",26
66,Mr SPEAKER,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"Order ! I have made an appeal to honourable members, and I must now utter the warning that if occasion again arises it may he necessary for me to take more drastic steps to enforce order in debate. I shall he compelled to name honourable members if they continue to disregard' the direction of the Chair.",26
67,Mr RODGERS,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"Every wheat-grower today recognises the value of the pooling system during the war period. It was, first of all, an absolute necessity, the benefits derived from which cannot be exaggerated. There is not a more independent body of men in the world than the Australian farmers. Their very environment, the very necessity for carving out their own career, makes them so. Australian farmers are not the men to be forced into a compulsory pool and subjected to a uniform set of conditions. The custom of the wheat-grower in the old-established districts was to sell a tion of his grain, to store a section, and, sometimes privately, to ship a section. It was his endeavour to meet the market at different points, and always, of course, most advantageously to himself. In the older-settled areas, where farmers were in better circumstances than in the newer Mallee areas, for example, the practice which I have indicated was common. They built their own barns for storage.",26
68,Mr STEWART,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"The general policy, so far as I have known it, was to sell pay your debts as quickly as you could.",26
69,Mr RODGERS,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"The honourable member has spent most of his time as a wheat grower in the newer provinces. Conditions in the Mallee are not as stable, probably, as in the older districts. The farmer is a type of individual who wants to manage hi3 own affairs. The sooner we can wind up the war organization which controlled our ivhcat the better. In this chamber today a member of the Board himself, the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , has indicted another member of the Board concerning sales and conditions. The honourable member concerned must surely feel some responsibility in the matter of the price which the Australian farmer is getting today and will be getting for the whole of this year. I refer to the fact of sales being made at 7s. Sd. for home consumption when wheat today is worth 16s. per bushel, and when, at the seaboard, it is worth 12s. 6d. f.o.b - whic h is the world's parity. The honourable member must accept a share of responsibility for the basis of sale being fixed at 7s. 8d. per bushel. I do not intend to enter into a political controversy concerning whether what was done was right or wrong; but I emphasize that the honourable member for Echuca has charged the Prime Minister concerning the circumstances of a sale made under war conditions when, at the same time, he himself is a party to a sale of Australian wheat at 7s. Sd. for home consumption when the world's parity is 12s. 6d. It all clearly shows that it is better to let the farmer manage his own business.",26
70,Mr CONSIDINE,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"Th "" honourable member is trying to show that the farmers do not know their own business.",26
71,Mr RODGERS,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"But they do; and I secam not trying to show the contrary. The farmers want to get back to pre-war conditions, and to manage their own affairs. It has been said that the decline in production of wheat is due to failure on the part of the Prime Minister, or of this Government, to make generous provision for wheat-growing. The States are primarily interested in this matter. Policy in regard to stimulation of wheat-growing is a State matter. The Minister for Agriculture in Victoria is taking a lively interest in the project, and is conducting a and ""gr-w more wheat"" campaign. If one enters into conversation with any farmer and asks why he has steadily reduced his area of wheat under cultivation, aud has taken on stock-raising, his answer invariably would be, "" I saw millions of tons of wheat being piled up in Australia and subjected to the ravages of mice and weevil; and I saw no ships coming to transport our wheat to the other side of the world. Nobody could say when we were likely to sell our produce. I had no option, therefore, but to go in for more. stock and less wheat. It appeared to be the only safe course."" It was the uncertainty concerning the future which led the farmer into raising more stock at the expense of wheat-growing. It is unfair to say that the Prime Minister, or this Government, is responsible for the diminunition of our wheat-growing areas; for that is not so. It is ungenerous to try to heap the responsibility on the shoulders of one man. I hope, nevertheless, that the Prime Minister will afford this House a very early opportunity to discuss and the whole business. The basis on which we are to handle our coming harvest ought to be known now, and the sooner it is made known the better for everybody. The Commonwealth has joined with State Governments in giving a guarantee covering next harvest;- but the farmers can well relieve all the Governments concerned from responsibility in connection with that guarantee. They can sell the whole of their wheat and get the whole of their money at once. I consider that at the pace at which shipbuilding is now proceeding it would be wise to terminate the Wheat Pool, so that farmers may return to the old methods and manage their own business.",26

I have called the House to order more than once this morning/ I have now called upon the honourable member for Werriwa to address the Chair, but he has not secured an opportunity to utter one word owing to the chorus of interjections passing from one side to the other of the chamber. I hope this practice will cease, and it is my duty to insure that it does, for it will be impossible to carry on debate with anything like decency if the present disorderly proceedings are allowed to continue .",27
78,Mr LAZZARINI,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"The point I wish to emphasize at the outset is that, in my view, the real object of the motion is not so much to discuss whether the Wheat Pool shall continue as that the Government should declare immediately what is going to happen. If the Pool is continued, the farmer will have no option but to put his product into it. It is the"" unbusiness-like method by which the Pool has been managed, at least for the past settle two years, which has made the farmer sick and tired of the whole concern. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr. ""Rodgers) gave a reason why farmers are refusing to go in for more wheat, and are preferring to raise stock. He holds that it is because they have looked upon the enormous accumulation of wheat, with no market available, and with no immediate prospect of getting their money. That may hold good of farmers in the honourable member's neighbourhood, but the explanation given me throughout my electorate, and in other wheat-growing parts where I have Tesided in recent years, is that the farmer has become heartily tired and discouraged. His wheat has been commandeered and sold at a price which did not compensate him for his labour and outlay. Wheatgrowing, in fact, has not paid, and farmers have been forced to get out. The Government should now allow the grower to know exactly where he stands, and as quickly as possible. If the Pool is to be ' continued, there should be some guarantee that it will be managed efficiently, and that the farmer shall have a far larger share of control and management. Nationalist members of this Parliament, representing constituencies in my State,, have said that - the farmer must share the responsibility. That is ridiculous, seeing that his wheat has been taken from him. ""We know that the tralian farmer has lost considerable sums connection with sales which ought have brought more money into his pocket. His wheat was sold at a lower price than could have been obtained, and he suffered grievous loss from the mismanagement of the Pool through the ravages that were permitted to be made ""in the wheat stacks by mice, Avcevi], aud other vermin. "" Mr Riley - You cannot blame the GoAustralian vernment for that.",27
79,Mr LAZZARINI,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"The Royal ComArgentine mission held in New South Wales absoCanadian lutely proved that, as proper attention was not given to the wheat stacks outset, the management of the Pool was responsible for these losses. For a long time now Ave have heard Wheat Pool was mismanaged. the parrot-like cry of "" more production."" To my mind, many honourable members on the Government side Avho are screechcost ing out these words as if they had learnt - them by heart, aru doing their level best to prevent more production. If Ave men to engage in the risky business of wheat-growing, Ave must make it worth their while to produce more; but when we take the fanner's wheat from him and give him only 4s. 9d. per bushel for i while Ave sell it for 10s. or 12s. per bushel, it is no wonder he gets .sick of the ness. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) has pointed out that the farmer could not get the price at which his wheat was sold because of the scarcity of shipping during the war. do not propose to deal with toJapanese day's prices. I shall compare the price the Australian farmer received for his wheat with that which Avas paid for Avheat from Argentine, the United States of America, and Canada, at the same time that his wheat sold in the same place and under the persons same conditions. The Australian farmer was told that it Avas his particular to grow more wheat to feed the allied mismanagement inevitable. nations, and heeding the cry, proceeded to produce as much wheat as possible; and had the people of the allied nations, and particularly Great Britain, been able to purchase their bread at a cheap price because the wheat from Australia was sold at a low figure, I could not (any objection; but the fact remains the bread made in England from AusAvheat was sold at the same price in as Avas obtained for bread made from to Argentine, Canadian, and American Avheat. Whereas the Australian farmer Avas paid 4s. 9d. per bushel, the Argentine fanner Avas paid 7s. 9d. per bushel at the elevator in the interior. Furthermore, the Argentine farmer, who spent nothing in* the Avar, neither money nor blood, was paid in cash; AA'hereas the farmer did not get more than 2s. 6d. in the first case, and the balance in driblets of 3d. and 6d. per bushel. The farmer made no sacrifice. The farmer Avas paid 9s. 2d. per bushel. I believe the American farmer at the received 9s. 6d. per bushel. There is another Avay in which the The farmers, as Avell as the rest of the community, contribute taxation towards the of the maintenance of expensive commercial agencies throughout the world which are supposed to protect the busiwish ness and commercial interests of this country, and advise us as to certain happenings in other parts of the world, information as to which might be commercially beneficial to primary producers, t among others. But, in this instance, the information furnished by these agencies busiwas used to rob the primary producers - for the benefit of other persons in the community, the parasitical middlemen who do no useful service in any country. In this case, the Wheat Board received I information as to the failure of the rice crop, but, instead of disposing of the farmers' wheat at a price at which they might derive some benefit, they withheld the information until the AA'heat had got into the hands of one or tAvo private individuals, and then allowed Avas the news to go out so that those might make a profit. The manner in which the Wheat Pool duty was first established made bungling and It was proved before the Royal Commission that, with the exception of one occasion, on which he kept a register of seed wheat sold to the farmers, Mr Harris, the gentleman appointed to manage the Pool raise in New South Wales, knew nothing about that Avheat. Two gentlemen in my electorate - on e a miller with forty-five years' experience in the milling industry, and the other an accountant with, twenty-five years' experience on the accountancy side of the milling business, and the financial manager of a large mill in the south of New South Wales--submitte d applications for positions on ""the State Wheat Board, one as a wheat expert and the other as an accountant. In answer to their applications they were* offered a salary of 12s. 6d. per day. It seems to me that, from the inception, there was a deep-laid plan to have inefficiency in the management of the Pool, so that bungling might occur and certain things could be done. I honestly believe that this was the deep-laid scheme conceived by certain gentlemen who were controlling the matter.",28
80,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"That is "" EO T.""",29
81,Mr LAZZARINI,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"The honourable member may think so, hut the evidence proves that it is not, and it is about time the present Government cleared up these matters which are causing so much agitationamong the primary producers, and came forward with a definite policy. If it is their policy to abandon the Pool, let them tell the farmers as early as possible. If , on the other hand, they propose to maintain the Wheat Pool, then let them also come forward with their information as early as possible, so that the farmers may know what to expect in the future. If the Government intend to continue the Wheat Pool, I urge them to give an absolute guarantee that its management will be thorough and efficient. Above all, I hope that they will give the farmers a majority in the control of the Pool. In this way only will satisfaction be given to the primary producers.  matter has not been sprung upon the House. In February last, I came across from Western Australia to attend a conference of representatives of wheat growers of all the States, which endeavoured to outline a future policy for the Australian wheat-growers. The policy which we drew up was afterwards presented to the Prime Minister, who commended us for what we had done; but we desired to have a voluntary compulsory Pool. As, apparently, that clear definition is rather vague to some honourable members, let me explain that, by a referendum of the wheat-growers of Australia, which the Prime Minister promised to assist in obtaining, it was desired to know whether they wished the continuance of the Wheat Pool in a compulsory form, or its abandonment altogether. It is known that a guarantee has been named for next year's wheat; but, as it is also suggested that the Pool should be abandoned this year, the position would be that we would have a gurantee with an abandoned Pool-that is to say, no machinery to control it. If , as a result of the referendum, with! which the Prime Minister is sympathetic, the growers agree to the continuance of the Pool, it is only reasonable that it should continue in order to carry on the principle. The conception of the Pool, in the first instance, and under war conditions, was a most excellent idea. I believe that all the wheat-growers, as well as the other people of Australia, recognised that it was necessary; in fact, that it was the only possible method to adopt. Of course, we have been rather unfortunate in the management of the Pool. As a big grower of wheat, I have had occasion to follow its operations, and the least I can say is that the management of the Pool has been most unfortunate. Nearly all the middlemen who had been in control of wheat in pre-war days were given the agency in London to manage at that end and advise us at this end. Similar control was given here. It was a case of "" setting the geese to watch the oats."" When we approached the Prime Minister asking hint to continue the Pool in a compulsory form, he saidThe stone which the builders rejected Is become the head of the corner. Our objection was not to the principle of the Pool, but to its management. Any good thing may 'be mismanaged. It took a tremendous lot of agitation from the farmers of Australia to get representation on the Board. Since there has been representation of the farmers on that Board, everything connected with it has been, infinitely more satisfactory.",29
82,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was not responsible for the non-representation of farmers.  orable gentleman mentions that matter, I must say that it was most difficult shift the Prime Minister so as to obtain representation. '",29
83,Mr GROOM,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"Not at all; the Prime Minister was in favour of it from the very beginning.  able members to realise the position the wheat-growers of Australia. They have been as patriotic as have any other section of the community. They readily submitted to war conditions without plaint, as to the price obtained for their wheat, feeling that the best was being done for them. But let me tell the House what the "" best"" was fot Australia comrecognise pared with the best .for other wheat-growlian ing countries. I think that I have menrest tioned on a former occasion that, for the four years ending September last, in dribs and drabs, and under the most adequate system of handling wheat, the Australian grower received 3s. 8d. bushel. In America, in Tespect of the same period, the wheat-growers received 8s. Yd. per bushel; in England, 9s. 6d. bushel; Norway, 18s. lOd. per bushel; Holland, 13s. 5^d. per bushel; Italy, 183. l d . per bushel; 'Prance and Spain, 16s. 6d. per bushel; and Portugal, 26s. 9d. per bushel. The wheat-growers of Australia, despite the extra cost of price. living, received the mere pittance of 3s. 8d. per bushel. Do honourable members marvel at people giving up wheat growing and devoting themselves to sheep-farming or some other branch of primary industry? Without any desire to introduce acriascertain mony or to attach blame to any one, complain that there has been a want of statesmanship. We were told that we were under a national obligation to duce more and more wheat. The Prime of our business.

As it is, in. these other tries, which received the full price, stimulus has been given to agricultural tect the food of our people. to pursuits, which have been made so attractive that they are in a better position than before the war, whereas we have reduced by 4,000,000 acres the area under wheat. In 1916, we had 12,000,000 acres under wheat in Australia, but last year we had only 8,000,000 acres sown. cannot be said to be to the advanof tage of the country. We seem to be as unfortunate today as in other times. We continue to make bad deals. These deals, however, have not been under the comcontrol of the farmers. We recognise that the principle of the Pool is excellent. As the result of the war, many things have been made known to us. We that in the pooling of Austrawheat, the finest in the world-the of the, world cannot do without it for mixing purposes-w e shall, by so combining, bring more wealth to the Cominmonwealth. The principle is excellent, but we do not want, on adopting it , to put per the goose to watch the oats. We want the producers to amalgamate, and so to control their wheat that they may get the per best markets for it. The States have been very clever; they have once more got in ahead of us. They have bought up all the wheat they want for the year, so that the farmers today are supplying the people of Australia at less than half I would ask the House to be very kind to the farmers. They are supplying wheat to the people today at much less than half the world's price. We want to take a referendum of the farmers to how many are willing to pool I their wheat, so that we may pay a man with brains, ajid having no interest other than the service of his country, to repreprosent us in our sales and management We shall have our London agent, and buying in Australia. If the desire to do that, why should this object 1 Have we no right to seek emancipate ourselves when others will not concern themselves very much about their our emancipation? In the policythat we submitted to the Prime Minister we proposed that the Government should be represented on the Pool to insure that counthere should be no over-exporting of a wheat. In this policy we desire to proI f the Government give a guarantee-and we can do without it, I think-the y should have, representation to see that the money so advanced is protected by the security of the wheat. These matters have not been overlooked by us; we have not considered them in a selfish light. Our only desire is to place ourselves abreast of the most modern nations. The farmers in my own State, for instance, have decided to put £250,000 out of their wheat returns into a scheme for bulk handling. Instead of paying 6d. per bushel to put the. wheat into bags we are going to put the money into silos and elevators, so that we may efficiently handle our produce. We feel that this country cannot be great unless we adopt modern methods, and thus secure the fullest advantages in respect of the products we work so hard to raise.

101,Mr ANSTEY,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"Bourke) [12.41] - It has been suggested that, as I know nothing about wheat, I might say a few words on the .present occasion, and as I have not heard any of the arguments used during the debate, therefore I am quite unbiased. But one or two thoughts have occurred to me, and it seems desirable that I should give expression to Prime them. I notice from the daily press that in the United States of America there is an anticipated shortage of wheat of anything from 400,000,000 to 700,000,000 bushels, and in Europe a shortage of about 300,000,000 bushels. Apparently, too, the area under cultivation throughout the world has declined by about 12,000,000 acres, and we have Seen informed that if the season here does not turn out .satisfactorily we shall soon be paying about f l per bushel for our wheat, and. Is. per 2-lb. loaf of bread. Looked at in this light, the prospects for the farming community generally are, to say the least, brilliant. Evidently our farmers feel that they have some grounds for complaint in connection with the wheat deal referred to in this debate. They believe that they did not get - enough for their produce. If they think that, they should, of course, complain, because, after all, that is the general principle upon which life turns. The Government, on the contrary, declare that they have done their very best, and the other day the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) said that the Government had done all that could be expected of them. I am not out to placate the farmers. There are very few in my constituency. It has been said that the Government got the highest price possible in connection with a particular wheat deal, but there are one or two facts which may come out now that the war is over. Whenever during the war I endeavoured to make any statement as to what I thought was going on, I exposed myself to the risk of six months' imprisonment. Happily, I I avoided that disagreeable experience, because I carefully abstained from saying what was in my mind. Nevertheless, it is a fact that certain operations of the British Government during the war will come to light some day, and then, perhaps, we shall have an opportunity of saying some of the things that might have been said with advantage during the war. It is a fact that the British Government, all through the war did find ships to take our men away. And it is a fact that they were not able to taJke much of our wheat. We were then a militant nation; we were taking our part in the war. We were sacrificing our blood in the fight for all those principles of Democracy and liberty about which we have talked and thought so much of late years. Britain during the war could get wheat out of the Argentine, but the Argentine would not sell unless she could get gold. England had no. gold to export, quantity of wheat. and if she had, there was the submarine menace. i Sir JOSEPH COOK - You did not get much when you were in England.",33
102,Mr ANSTEY,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"I enjoyed all the good things of life whilst there. I the best time of my life, but I am going to tell anybody about it. While was hers I was a Democrat, but when away I was a patriot. Self-preservation demanded that I should show my patriothighest ism as did other men, and if I had better patriot I would probably have ceived more money. The British Governmost ment would not send ships to Australia take our wheat away, but they sent vessels to the Argentine, although that country would not supply wheat unless it was for in gold. Great Britain could not send gold out of the United Kingdom because of the submarine menace. How were they to get Argentine wheat to supply Great Britain? It is easily explained. In the dead of night vessels of war visited bourne and Sydney and lifted Australian gold which they carried to Buenos Ayres, where it was used for purchasing wheat grown in the Argentine. That was the method adopted to purchase that wheat. Our wheat was lying rotting, but Ausfar tralian gold was being used to purchase wheat at two and a half dollars a bushel, while some of our wheat was being at 5s. or 5s. 6d. I was absolutely hibited from making such statements durAustralia ing the war period, and if I had made them, although they are true, I would have been prosecuted. In any case, are now permitted to express those, truths which we were not permitted to express during the war. As to the farmers, else can they do but support the Governthese ment ?

If the honourable member for what Echuca had been in Great Britain when events Avere transpiring he would today have seen that the Prime Minister did they his best. I was in England when he effected one sale, and secured for the Australian producers a little more per bushel than any one in England thought it possible to do. The speech made by the honourable member for Echuca, in which he discussion. wanted, was simplyus should have told what the farmers a bitter review of the - Sir JOSEPH COOK - No fought a bigger battle than the Prime Minister on that occasion.",34
104,Mr FLEMING,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"I quite agree with that. I was on the spot when Mr Hughes put up a tremendous fight in the interests of the farmers of this country, and it is most ungrateful, to say the least of it , for the head of the Farmers and Producers Association in this State to make what is nothing short of a political attack on the Prime Minister.",35
105,Mr HILL,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,I have not said anything that is not true.,35
106,Mr FLEMING,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"The honourable member may think it true, but it is grossly unfair. It is possible to make statements which may be true today concerning events which happened a few years ago, but in view of what has transpired the events are not seen in their true perspective.",35
107,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,It would be teresting to hear the Prime Minister in reply.,35
108,Mr FLEMING,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,He will be able to answer the accusations most effectively. From honourable members on both sides of the chamber there have been complaints in connection with this question. .One is that the farmer receives too little and another is that the price of bread is too high. We cannot have it both ways.,35
109,Mr RILEY,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,There has been too much gambling with wheat scrip.,35
110,Mr FLEMING,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"If there has been gambling in the scrip there has not been any speculation in wheat. It is possible to gamble in scrip but. not in wheat itself. It is all nonsense to advocate an increased price for grain and at the same time agitate for a decrease in the price of bread. I was a member of the Prices Adjustment Board before I lef t for the other side of the world, and it was proved conclusively before that tribunal-in consequence of information received from the leading millers and bakers-no t only in one centre, but in all the large capitalsthat it cost just as much to sell bread as it did to handle the wheat through all the various processes u n t i l it was converted into bread. In other words, it cost as much to grow wheat, m ill it into flour, and make the bread as it did to deliver bread.",35
111,Mr STEWART,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,It should not.,35
112,Mr FLEMING,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"Undoubtedl y system is wrong, but what is the use of man ever making bitter and uncalled-for attacks concerning what has been done in the pasfc instead of endeavouring to improve the handling methods? This bitterness between sections is not likely to assist the primary producer, and instead of indulging in recriminations, we should see how the waste between the producer and the consumer can be eliminated. Any one who cares to peruse the records of the Prices Adjustment Board will receive food for thought, and realise that there is much more to be done than attacking each other in this chamber. The f u t u r e of the wheat position in Australia is a doubtful one. It has been said that a number of producers are relinquishing wheat-growing and engaging in grazing. There are many reasons for that. There is uncertainty in the minds of farmers concerning the future outlook of wheat on account of the transport trouble, and the fact that wheat has been allowed - as the in - honourable member for Wannon (Mr . Rodgers) said-to be destroyed by mice and weevil. During the war period wheat was stored under conditions which are not likely to arise again, and the farmers should be made to clearly understand that the dangers which arose in such an unlooked-for way, and which were responsible for the destruction of such a large quantity of grain, are not likely to occur again. The position has been placed before the producers, but is it any wonder that they became disgusted ? Labour conditions have made it more .difficult for a farmer to grow wheat, and it is an easier, simpler, and more pleasing proposition to raise sheep. I have tried both, and, taking year in and year-out, over a period of twenty 'years, I have no hesitation in saying that men who have been stock-raising have done better than the man who has been growing wheat. There are some exceptions, but, generally speaking, the grazier is more favourably situated. The supporters of the pooling system now seem to be in favour of - a system of co-operation. There was an attempt by Australian farmers to create a co-operative movement in connection with the handling of our primary products, but they began in the wrong way, because they expected to be financed by "" Y a n k e e "" capitalists. The producers of this country would be ill advised if they allowed their primary prothe ducts to get under the control of those big financial institutions in America. There is nothing that would do more to destroy the prospects of the primary producers of the Commonwealth than to allow their products to he within, the grip of huge financial concerns in the United States.",35
113,Mr STEWART,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,Can the member prove that?,36
114,Mr FLEMING,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,- I was there when negotiations were in progress. It is easy to make comparisons between the price received' for American and Australian .grain; but it suited the American interests to see their farmers received the highest price.  today.,36
115,Mr FLEMING,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"Undoubtedly , but - owing to their geographical position; and it is likely that they will continue to do so for some time. So long as present conditions continue with the markets of the world dislocated, and the transport problem serious, the Australian parity is likely to be considerably below that of other countries more favourably situated. It is impossible to apply a proper standard just now, unless we ascertain the average price obtaining throughout the world, and allow the difference between' that and the cost of transporting the grain to the principal consuming centres. If we peruse the figures, we can easily see what is a reasonable price for Australian wheat. It is easy for honourable members to make extravagant statements concerning the price Australian producers are receiving, and that which others are being paid. If they go into the matter in a calm and business-like way, and give the farmers encouragement by a system of fair play, we will have a better opportunity of in creasing our production. There is really no possibility of additional areas being placed under cultivation when there is such a lack of confidence in certain directions, and the farmer and his produce are being made a political question. As the honourable member for ""Wakefield (Mr . Richard ' Foster) said, "" the farmer should be the basis of national greatness,"" and u n t i l we realise that that is so, and allow the present discord to cease, we are really doing more harm than good. We have very little prospect of meeting the enormous liabilities the war has thrown upon us by deprecating the work of others, as has been done in this Chamber today. The speeches of the honourable member for Wakefield and the honourable member for Swan will do a great deal to relieve the doubt and discord which has been created, largely owing to the fact that the people are beginning to lose f a it h , not honourable only in the country, but in its representatives.

Is it a fact that a large number of telephone offices in the country districts in New South Wales are closed at 6 p.m. and extra fees are charged to re-open the same after that hour? 2. As between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. is a most convenient hour for country folks for telephone calls, would it not be possible to arrange to have the lines and offices open for service between those hours without charging extra fees.",36
118,Mr WISE,WHEA T FOR LOCAL,"The.answer s to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. Yes, as throughout the Commonwealth. 2. The Department could not expect officers, particularly non-official postmasters or telephone office-keepers, to give their services free after ordinary office hours, and the opening of all the offices from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. would entail considerable expense for extra assistance or overtime. The inatter, however, is being considered. NA STEAMERS.",36

120,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF COMMONWEALT H," The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The five steamers. Belatta, Bundarra, Bethanga, Birriwa, and Birringa, were sold on the following terms:-Te n per cent, on delivery Pacific Coast; 20 per cent, on arrival Atlantic or Gulf port, or CO days after deliveryj whichever first; 25 per cent, four months after second payment; 25 per cent, eight months after second payment; 20 per cent, twelve months after second payment; buyers to give mortgage over the ships and pay interest at 6 per cent.; also to insure the vessels for an amount of 25 per cent, in of the Commonwealth's interest in them; buyers to have the option of paying cash for each vessel, such option to be declared by a given date. 2.

What is causing the delay in providing telephones to new subscribers who made application and deposited the necessary fee some considerable time ago?",37
122,Mr WISE,SALE OF COMMONWEALT H,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Funds were recently made available to this Department by the Treasurer, and a considerable portion of the amount granted w i ll be spent on the telephone service in New South Wales. Owing, however, to the ""difficulty in securing equipment and material, which have to be purchased abroad, it will be some time before the situation can be relieved to any extent. 2. This matter is under consideration. 3. The delay has been caused by the inability of the Department to obtain the funds necessary to purchase equipment and material. It is not the usual practice of the Department to accept the rental fee fro m intending subscribers in cases where it can be seen that delay in providing service w i ll take place.

126,Mr MARR,COMMONWEALTH CLOTHING,"for Mr MARRS) asked the Prime Minister, upon notice 1. Whether, considering the deplorab> state and condition of the dairy herds and other stock in New South Wales caused by the drought, he will consider the question of arranging the necessary shipping to cany from Adelaide some 35,000 tons of fodder, which has been bought and paid for, and is now lying there awaiting shipment to Sydney? 2. Observing that certain ships of Messrs. J. and A . Brown, of Newcastle, New South Wales, are prepared to proceed to Adelaide to ship this fodder, w i ll he arrange for such ships to be diverted accordingly?",37
127,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CLOTHING," The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The Inter-State vessels that were under requisition are being handed back to their owners on completion of current trips; the majority having already been released. The owners advise that they have already fixed the Baricon to lift 500 tons of chaff sailing today from Adelaide, and the Tarcoola 500 tons, and the Kooyong 550 tons, both of the latter sailing from Adelaide on Saturday, 8th instant. In addition, I am advised that further - vessels will be fixed as they become available. In addition to these ships, the s.s. Yarra is loading chaff at Port Pirie for Sydney and Newcastle, and the overseas steamer Woodarra is also loading a quantity of this cargo there for New South Wales. 2. I have no knowledge of Messrs. J. and A. Brown being prepared to send ships to Adelaide for fodder. There was only one vessel belonging to . this firm under requisition. Messrs. J. and A. Brown have been offered the release of that ship on. the same conditions as other owners, but they have not so far accepted the offer. If they accepted release, they could employ the vessel to whatever Australian ports they chose to run. COMMONWEALTH LIVING WAGE.",38

129,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CLOTHING," The living wage for married officers twenty-one years of age and upwards, and unmarried officers twenty-five years and upwards, has recently been fixed by the Arbitration Court at £3 10s. per week, and this rate will operate from 26th April, 1920.

130,Mr MARR,COMMONWEALTH CLOTHING,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the attention of the Government has been directed to the statement made at the executive meeting of the Australian Federal Capital League in Sydney, that Mr Ryan, the member for Essendon in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, had declared that both parties in that House would be unanimous in Mr supporting any effort to move the Federal Capital from Melbourne? 2. Would he ascertain whether this opinion correctly represents the views of the State Ministers ?",38
131,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CLOTHING," I have not seen the statement referred to by the honourable member, but in any case, do not think it calls for any action. ANZAC HAND - WEAVI NG INDUSTRY.",38
132,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH CLOTHING,"for Dr MALONEY) asked the Prime Minister, upon noticeWill the Government arrange so that returned soldiers working at the ANZAC handweaving industry who reside in Victoria will have an equal chance to make good as their fellow soldiers have in New South Wales in the same industry?",38
133,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH CLOTHING," The hand-weaving industry in New South Wales, is conducted by the Red Cross Society; in Victoria, by a Trust representative of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia.

For what specific purpose was gold exported to each country? 5. Why is this information suppressed in the Commonwealth Statistician's report? 6. Under whose authority was the Commonwealth Statistician acting in suppressing this information? 7.

AUDIT BILL . SECOND READING.",39
137,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,ParramattaMinister for the Navy and Acting surer) [2.25] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is another of those little Bills,39
138,Mr TUDOR,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"You have not yet introment duced a Bil l which you have not called "" a little one.""",39
139,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"They are little Bills, but they are important, none less. This is one of those amending meathe sures which go far to relieve the clogged wheels»of the departmental machinery that have been going round Tather heavily for some years past. The sooner we can get them moving with a little more swiftpreviously entailed. ness, safety, and efficiency, the better. The Bill amends the Audit Act, which was passed in the early days of Federation, and which has been amended from time to time. It embodies further posals for emendations arising out of reof cent experiences, recent reports of Royal Commissions, and the necessities of our present situation.",39
140,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,Doe 3 it cover the recommendations of the Federal Capital Royal Commission of three years ago?,39
141,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,I do not rethe member what that particular recommenthe dation was.,39
142,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,To define more exactlv the Auditor-General's powers.,39
143,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"Yes , it so, and it does it also in obedience to a 1917similar recommendation from the Defence Royal Commission. It more clearly defines the Auditor-General's powers, gives him greater discretion as to their use, and removes from him the directional sections of the present Audit Act "" crib, cabin, and confine"" him, and, in my judgment, make his audit the much more cumbersome and less efficient. We relieve him of all the sections which fetter him now, and say to him, as one should say to any auditor: "" Conduct your own audit in your own way, so long that as you take care that the moneys which the you audit have been voted by Parliament, and see that they are being spent a constitutional manner."" Those are the only two limitations we propose to \ place upon him, ceasing henceforth from giving him directions as to the manner in which he shall conduct his audit. The provisions of the Bill are undoubtedly Treain the direction of economy and efficiency. Some of them aim merely at regularizing certain practices which have been adopted for some twelve months past. One of these relates to the payof wages in the Public Service. The Audit Act requires that every person in the Service shall give an individual receipt for his wages- a pure waste the of time. We now make it possible for paymasters themselves to give a binding certificate, as they do in the Navy. I believe that system has also been adopted in the Post Office, obviating all the clerical work, irritation, and bother Another thing we want to rectify is this: There is some doubt at present whether we have any right to keep in the Treasury the gold proreserve for the Notes Fund. A section the Audit Act requires that all public moneys shall be paid into a bank. It would seem that a strict conformation to that requirement would demand that all the gold in the Treasury should be put into the control of some bank or other. That is quite out of the question. By this Bill we therefore regularize and justify the keeping of the gold reserve in Treasury, where we have, perhaps, best arrangements of any place in Australia for taking care of it. All the clauses are more or less of a machinery character, and, so far as I can see, none does do of them is contentious.",39
144,Mr TUDOR,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"Yarra) [2.31] - As the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs) has stated here on more than one occasion, we have made the Auditor General, to a certain extent, but, after all, only to a certain extent, independent extent. of the Ministry, and the Ministry have refused to give him sufficient assistance to carry out his duties. The Acting Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has informed us that the Bill is introduced only to regularize the work which is going on; but this is the first opportunity we have had of seeing it, and we' have had no opportunity to compare it with the principal Act. Clause 4, for instance, alters section 34 of the principal Act entirely. I do not think we should rush an important measure' like this through. It has been on the table for only about ten minutes, and in that time. I have been trying to compare it with the existing law.",40
145,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,The B i ll was circufor lated on the 19th March.,40
146,Mr TUDOR,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"Then I have not seen it before. It may have been circulated with a lot of other public documents that come to us, and I have missed it. Many documents reach us which, we have no opportunity to go through as we should like. One of the reasons why we have to amend so much of our legislation is that we have not had an opportunity in this Parliament of considering it properly. The Acting T reasurer told me across the table before he moved the second reading that he did not think I would understand the Bill when I saw it. That may have been jocularly meant; but I candidly admit that I cannot understand it without having an opportunity to compare it with the principal Act. I thought the Government intended to follow the practice of printing the Act and the Bill together in such a way as to show the proposed alterations in black or 'erased type. Perhaps, as this is only a two-page Bill, and the principal Act is a very large measure, there may have been difficulties in the way of adopting that course; but the Government should at least furnish us with some such explanation of the extent to which the Bill amends the present law. Sir JOSEPH COOK. - I will do that for you. Mr TUDOR,-If , as the Minister says, the object of the Bill is.to regularize and make operative the procedure which is in operation today, we must have been flouting the Audit Act to that Sir. JOSEPH COOK - In one or two cases, and very properly, as in the wages case. Mr TUDOR,-It may have been done very properly, as the honourable gentleman suggests; but when we do it we should know it. It is quite possible that it was an advantage to the Commonwealth to keep in the Treasury the gold reserve required under the Australian Notes Act. Some of our Acts provide that payments in certain Departments must be made in cash and not by cheque. I think the Customs Department refuses to accept anything but a certified cheque, and rightly so. It would never do to accept the cheques of some people as payment duty, although I have no doubt the Customs Department would be very keen in chasing up the drawers of the cheques to get the money. I think we provide in the Customs Act that the payment must be by bank cheque. Perhaps we should have regularized the keeping of the gold reserve in the Treasury at the time the Commonwealth Notes Act was passed. I urge the Acting Treasurer to give the House an opportunity of considering how far this Bill amends the Audit Act. If he is not very keen on getting the Bill passed today, I ask him to consent to an adjournment of the debate. As the practice which is to be amended has in some cases been followed for a number of years, I cannot see that there is any very great urgency in the Bill. We ought to have a.n opportunity of carefully studying its effect.",40
147,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"Wakefield) [2.37] - I welcome the appearance of this Bill, but unless the Acting Treasurer has some excellent reasons for getting it passed today, it would be only fair to the House to take the Committee stage next week.",40
148,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"I suggest that honourable members make their general observations now so that the second reading may be carried, and then when we reach the first clause in Committee we shall report progress. This is essentially a Committee Bill.",40
149,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"That will suit me. . I am conversant with the audit system in South Australia, and, in my opinion, it is very effective. In certain essentials the Commonwealth Act in comparison with the State law is lacking, when Mr Blacket, K . C , was inquiring, as a Royal Commissioner, into the Federal Capital expenditure, he examined the Couunonwealth Auditor-General, and I think he passed some strictures on the inefficiency and incompleteness of the audit. The explanation offered by the Auditor General was, that in regard to the matters which the Commissioners had criticised, he had no direction, or was limited in his operations'by the wording of the Act, which, in his opinion, required amendment. In connection with the Commonwealth departmental accounts, there have been defalcations that ought to have been detected earlier by the Audit Department, but I understand that the Auditor-General claims that he was notblameworthy.",41
150,Mr MCDONALD,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,He also said that he could not get sufficient staff.,41
151,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"That was another point. But the Auditor-General's main complaint was that there was a defect in the Act which prevented him from doing certain things. We have been waiting for three years to have those defects amended. As to the complaint of the Auditor-General that he could not get sufficient staff to enable him to overtake the arrears in the enormously increasing audit work of the Commonwealth, I am glad to find that in this Bill his powers will be very wide indeed. If this measure is agreed to, he will not be able to shirk any responsibility on the grounds which he urged in connection with the matters to which I have already referred. But I remind the Acting Treasurer that if we give the Auditor-General wide scope and put proper responsibility upon him, we must not limit the exercise of his authority by denying him adequate assistance.",41
152,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"This Bill will relieve him of a lot of the work he is statutorily required to perform. It will enable him to take internal check? wherever he finds they are efficient. Hitherto he has been obliged to audit the accounts of a Department, no matter how well the accounts were audited in the Department.",41
153,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"That is an improvement, and will enable him to cover a greater area. The work of the Federal Audit Department has increased enormously in recent years, and there should be a corresponding increase of efficient staff, because if the Treasurer limits the Auditor-General in that respect, to the extent of that limitation the latter is relieved of responsibility.",41
154,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"Shoul d not this be the order: Give him his job to do, take from him any unnecessary work, and then furnish him with an adequate staff to perform the work that should be done?",41
155,Mr MCDONALD,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,And he ought to be the judge of the staff he requires.,41
156,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"Of course. The argument of the Acting Treasurer, as applied to the work of the Auditor-General himself, indicates an improvement, but it is necessary that hs. should also have an adequate staff.",41
157,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,I agree.,41
158,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,The most rigid economist must fail if he does not give adequate assistance to the Auditor General.,41
159,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"An adequate staff to do work that is unnecessary would be foolish. The first consideration is to prescribe the work to be done, and then give him an adequate staff with which to do it.",41
160,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,Yes ; and then the Auditor-General can be held responsible.,41
161,Mr MCDONALD,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,But only to this House.,41
162,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"Undoubtedly, and under the Act he is responsible only to this House. God help this or any other country if his responsibility is not made wide in that sense. It is necessary that we should have a man strong enough to exercise the responsibility which is placed upon him.",41
163,Mr BAMFORD,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,Mora l strength is what is required.,41
164,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,I am very glad indeed that the Bill' has been introduced.,41
165,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"Capricornia) [2.45] - I , too, would have preferred that the Acting Treasurer should have postponed the consideration of this Bill until next week.",41
166,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"I will take the second reading if I can get it today, hut before it again comes on for consideration in Committee, I will undertake to have the sections in the principal Act which we propose to amend placed side by side with the amendments themselves in order to show honourable members their effect.",41
167,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,The Acting Treasurer does not wish the dehate upon the Bill to be adjourned at once?,42
168,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,iNo .,42
169,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"I think that the right honourable gentleman might very well agree to the insertion of one or two new clauses in this Bill with the object of improving the status of the Auditor-General. In my opinion, that officer's salary should be raised.",42
170,Mr BAMFORD,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,What does he get now?,42
171,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"He receives a salary of £1,000.",42
172,Dr MALONEY,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,We ought to make that sum the limit of any salary.,42
173,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,The honourable member has another profession besides that of member of Parliament.,42
174,Dr MALONEY,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,The honourable member knows that I gave it up seven years ago.,42
175,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"I did not know it, but I know that the honourable member prescribes for quite a lot of people gratis and with entire good will. In this country we ought to have a better idea than we have of the financial value of a man's work, and we ought to follow ihe example of the Americans. It is quite true that for the average man £1,000 a year would be a very high salary. But we should remember that the Auditor-General has the care of many millions of pounds of expenditure by this Commonwealth. During the war that expenditure amounted to £120,000,000 per annum. An Auditor-General,"" if inefficient, might thus lose the Commonwealth millions of pounds. We ought, therefore, by paying him an adequate salary, to encourage him to take the best interest in his work.",42
176,Mr BAMFORD,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"The honourable member ought not to say that, because it implies that the Auditor^General does not take sufficient interest in his work.",42
177,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"I do not wish to convey the impression to which the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) has given utterance. As a matter of fact, I know that the Auditor-General exhibits an absorbing interest in his work, and I doubt whether he has much time for anything else. There is nothing in this Bill to improve that officer's status beyond the technical amendments referred to by the Acting Treasurer, which will have the effect of doing away with a certain amount of unnecessary work. But there is nothing in the measure empowering the Auditor-General to select his own staff, and that, I take it, is the-object which the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) has in view. The Auditor General is responsible for the audit of the accounts of the Commonwealth, and ought, therefore, to be allowed to select the men whom he shall employ. But that is not his position at the present time. I invite honourable members to read the correspondence which took place upon this matter between the Auditor General and the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) and which appears in the records of last year. They will then see that the Auditor-General asked for some assistance-for the appointment of a considerable number of clerks",42
178,Mr EICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,He has done that on several occasions.,42
179,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"The Royal Commission which inquired into the administration of the Navy and Defence Departments pointed out that the work of the Auditor General was two years in arrears, and that it was practically impossible for an auditor to cover the whole of the ground which he had to traverse, and to keep up to date. The Auditor-General applied to the Prime Minister for an increase in his staff, and the Prime Minister, who is very anxious to keep his hand on the pulse of everything, and to do a great deal more than it is possible for any human being to do, referred the matter to Mr Shepherd, the Secretary of the Department. Mr Shepherd-agains t whom. I wish to say nothing derogatory excepting that, as an intelligent man he ought to have known that it was not his duty to direct the Auditor-Generalactually told that officer that he ought to get not the number of clerks for which he asked, but some other number. I think Mr Shepherd said either that that was not the first time he had had a disagreement with the Auditor-General, or that the Auditor-General"" had had a disagreement with him. However, the Prime Minister read his secretary's reply, which set out that it would be very difficult to make the alterations required. After getting Mr Shepherd's reply, the Prime Minister referred the matter to Mr Collins. One can readily understand what a wrong action that was to take. To his credit be it said, Mr. Collins at once recognised the invidious position in which he would be placed if he commented upon the work of the Auditor-General-the very officer who has to audit the Treasury accounts. Prom what I have said it will be seen that there is something wanting.",42
180,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,The honourable member is conveying the impression that the Treasury make these appointments. He must know that the Public Service Commissioner makes them.,43
181,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"I do not think that the House obtained, from my remarks, any such impression as is suggested by the Acting Treasurer. I have not stated that the Treasury makes the appointments.",43
182,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,Why ' did the Auditor-General's request go to the Prime Minister's Department instead to the Public Service Commissioner?,43
183,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"May I read to the his own House the Auditor-General's remarks tions, concerning this very important matter.",43
184,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,Does not Prime Minister's Department make the appointments-no t the Public Service Commissioner ?,43
185,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"The Auditor-General, in a memorandum to the Prime Minister, dated 9th May, 1918-and the date shows the delay in the introduction of an .amending measure-refer s to certain recommendations, and saysMy own views are that effect should be given to those recommendations That is the recommendations of the Commissioners, some of which, as the Acting Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) states, are embodied in the amending Bill; In the United Kingdom, the Comptroller and Auditor-General controls the ""Exchequer and Audit Department""; in New South Wales the published Public Accounts describe the office as the ""Auditor-General's Department""; and in Tasmania the Department is named ""Audit Department."" The Commissioners refer, however, to a "" separate Department,"" and, in my opinion, this is most desirable. The Auditor-General should certainly be the "" Head "" of his own Department, and have his own ""chief officer"" therein, instead of being subject to the approval of a Ministerial Secretary (no matter how highly placed) to all proposals and recommendations for appointment, promotion, transfers, overtime work, employment of temporary assistance, and other operations in connection with the Audit staffs. And it is most desirable that the Audit Department should be a separate one. The Auditor-General further says-and this, to some extent, has reference to the inquiry of the honourable member for Hlawarra (Mr Hector Lamond)The operations of the Commonwealth Public Service Act have resulted in numerous delays before appointments have been made, or vacancies filled, with the result that the' examination of public accounts has been seriously retarded, and the employment of relatively inferior services of temporary officers necessitated, which would otherwise have not been required. Months have elapsed before the appointments were made or vacancies filled. Just imagine! If the Auditor-General requires special officers to audit the accounts of any Department, or of any activity controlled by the Government, he of may have to wait months. If the Auditor-General were allowed to select staff, subject to any necessary restricthere can be no question as to the resulting advantage and improvement, as delays would be avoided, and the most suitable officers the for audit duties would be selected, the Auditor General being the best judge of his own requirements. I submit that the Acting Treasurer should have a clause drafted to provide that the Auditor-General shall have a separate Department, and that he may select his own officers. I respectfully ask the Minister to give this matter close consideration, because it is one on which the House ought to be given an opportunity to express an opinion. I agree with the honourable member who said that, in his opinion, the Auditor General ought to be responsible to this Parliament; and, indeed, the Auditor General is so responsible now. When the Auditor-General makes an interim report to the Treasurer, complaining of irregularities or difficulties he may have with any officer of the Public Service, Mr Speaker ought to get a copy of that report.",43
186,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"""-There, I think, you go too far, though there are certain conditions under which Mr Speaker should have a copy.",44
187,Mr GREGORY,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"There ' is the Auditor General's Annual Eoport, which goes to the Speaker.",44
188,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"But something more is required. It may be that those who receive the correspondence at the Treasury do not bring under the notice of the Treasurer of the day the complaints that the Auditor-General makes. That, however, is a matter of administration which can easily be remedied.",44
189,Mr GJJEGOBY,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,Complaint s may be made which the Auditor-General afterwards finds are unfounded.,44
190,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"That is true. What I have in my mind is that the Auditor General complained of irregularities of an employee in. the Defence Department, but, although he had been complaining for months, that officer was retained, for all I know, may still be in the Public Service.",44
191,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"The honourable member mokes it clear that the present conditions are not fair to the Auditorhead General, who .ought to be absolute master of the situation.",44
192,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"He is not.so at the sent time. The Auditor-General urges that his Department should be a separate one, and that he ought not to be responhe sible to a Ministerial secretary, no ter how highly the latter may be placed.",44
193,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,The case the honourable member is putting now would suggest that the Auditor-General desires to interfere in other Departments as well as his own.,44
194,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"Wit h every desire to assist the* Acting Treasurer in his endea- vour to frame a proper Audit Bill, may I suggest that he ought not to make that insinuation?",44
195,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"But the honourable member said that the Auditor-General had been complaining about an officer the Defence Department, and so far as he knew, the officer might still be in the Public Service. The Auditorthat. Genernl is right in criticising an officer's work, but that is the limit of his interMinister ference. [82]",44
196,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"The Auditor-General pointed out irregularities on the part of this officer, but the latter had sufficient social, political, or other influence to retain his place in the service of the Commonwealth. Those irregularities referred to by the Auditor-General were smothered up as they should not have been.",44
197,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,It was the duty of the Auditor-General to report him.,44
198,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"The House and the Treasurer ought to have known cf these irregularities at an earlier date. Perhaps, if the Auditor-General had a separate Department, we should have known of the case earlier, and then, perhaps, we might have saved- I am not saying in this particular case-hundred s of thousands of pounds lost through the defalcationreferred to by the Commissioners who inquired into the Naval and Military administration.",44
199,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"* When the Auditorand, General made his report concerning that officer his responsibility ceased, and the responsibility of the Minister began.",44
200,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"The Auditor-General reported to the Treasurer, his Ministerial",44
201,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,I thought from the memorandum you read that the Prime preMinister is the Ministerial head.,44
202,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"For the reason .that the Treasurer did not make the appointment, applied to the Prime Minister, because matthe Public Service Commissioner is in the Prime Minister's Department.",44
203,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,The case ought to have been mentioned in his annual report.,44
204,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,The Auditor-General now has the power to mention such matters in his report.,44
205,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"May I suggest that die Acting Treasurer is not now in Opposition- a fact he seems unable, in his combativeness, to forget. Ib is not fair to the Auditor-General to suggest that he wishes to interfere in. other in Departments because he asks that he be added that, given a better status.",44
206,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,I do not suggest,44
207,Mr HIGGS,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"I take it then, that the withdraws his remark to that, effect.",44
208,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,No ; I agree that the Auditor-General should be absolutely independent in his office.,45
209,Mr I,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"IIGGS - The Auditor-General, who is responsible for the audit of millions of pounds 'of public money, should have the staff which he desires within reason. I hope that consideration will be given to the point, and that before the Bill is passed an amendment will he introduced to make the necessary provision.",45
210,Mr WEST,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"East Sydney) [3.7] - Of its kind, there is probably no more important measure requiring the attention of this House. The status of the Auditor-General should be unquestioned, for he is the most important officer in the service of the country. He is, or. should be, above Ministers. The only people whom the Auditor-General should know are the members of this Parliament.",45
211,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,I agree.,45
212,Mr WEST,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,I would like the Government to make provision in order to place it beyond doubt that no Minister shall wield any influence or control over the Auditor-General. He should be the nominator of his own staff. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - I certainly think he ought to be consulted in regard to appointments to his staff.,45
213,Mr WEST,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"I would like to obtain leave to continue my remarks at a later date, when I expect to have more data before me. Sii JOSEPH COOK - I shall take care that the honourable member is not restricted in any way, if he will now agree to the second reading being carried. - WEST - Why is the Bill being rushed through?",45
214,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TRADE AND CUSTOMS EXCISE,"No such vour is being made. T intend to put before honourable members the original provisions and the amending clauses, so (that they may be compared, and honourable members thus will be placed in a better position to consider the whole matter.. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Motion (by Sir JOSEPH COOK) agreed toThat Mr Bamford do take the chair in Committee of the whole this day.
