3,Mr MCMAHON,DEATH OF SIR OWEN DIXON,"It is with very deep regret that I have to inform the House of the death on 7th July of Sir Owen Dixon, a former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, at the age of 86. Sir Owen Dixon was without doubt one of the truly great Australians of his time. His reputation as an outstanding jurist was acknowledged both in Australia and overseas, particularly (HANSARD) Â©f the Twenty-seventh Parlfamemlt (SIXTH PERIOD) NA 31 May 1972, adjourned to a date and hour to of Representatives to meet on Tuesday, 15 in Britain and the United States. His contributions extended far beyond the legal field. He was born at Hawthorn in Victoria on 28th April 1886 and was educated at Hawthorn College and at the University of Melbourne where he took degrees in Arts and Law. He was called to the Victorian Bar in 1910 and in 1922, at the age of 36, became a Kings Counsel. Within the next 2 years he was twice to appear in London before the Privy Council, an unusual event for Australian lawyers in those days, and nearly 3 decades before he himself was to be appointed a member of that Council. In 1926 he became Acting Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria and in 1929 of symwas appointed a Justice of the High Court. Common- He was Chief Justice of the High Court from 1952 until his retirement in 1964. When called upon in times of crisis Sir Owen Dixon served with equally great distinction in other spheres. In 1940, at the request of the Menzies Government, he undertook the chairmanship of the Central Wool Committee, which had been set up to administer the wartime handling of the wool clip. During the following 2 years he became Chairman of the Australian Shipping Control Board, the Marine Risks Insurance Board, the Commonwealth Marine Salvage Board and the Allied Consultative Shipping Council in Australia. In 1942 he was appointed by the Curtin Government as Australian Minister to the United States and remained in that important post until he resumed his seat on the Bench in 1944. In 1950 he was appointed by the United Nations as mediator in the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. His tireless efforts to bring an end to that unhappy conflict were not to succeed but it was widely recognised that he had done as much as any man could possibly have done in those most difficult circumstances. In 1963 he was awarded the Order of Merit by Her Majesty the Queen- a distinction and one bestowed only on the personal initiative of the Sovereign. He was a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George. He held honorary law doctorates from Oxford and Harvard. It is, nonetheless, as an outstanding their places) man of the law that Sir Owen Dixon will be remembered. His immense scholarship, his qualities of mind and his unfailing personal dignity set him out among his fellows wherever he moved. He commanded respect in every field of human endeavour to which his talents were called and he was held deep affection by all who knew him. tralia has indeed lost a great man. This country is richer for the life of Owen Dixon. We salute his memory and we send our deepest sympathy to his family.",19
4,Mr WHITLAM,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"The Australian Labor Party wishes to be associated with the tribute that the Prime Minister has paid to the former Chief Justice. As counsel, as judge, as wartime adminis1886 trator, as diplomatist and as Chief Broken Justice, Sir Owen Dixon touched nothing that he did not adorn. Australians must be grateful for his services to his fellow citizens. They must also be proud of his standing among his counterparts in every country where English is spoken and the Common Law observed.",20
5,Mr ANTHONY,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"Richmond-Minister his family in their loss. for Trade and Industry}- I would like to associate the Australian Country Party with the condolences expressed and tributes paid by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to the late Sir Owen Dixon; As both gentlemen have said, he was a truly outstanding Australian who won enormous respect both in this country and overseas. He had a long and varied career, reaching its zenith as Chief Justice of Australia. But he was also a great diplomat and as such he was required to show his great knowledge in helping with certain United Nations activities. I note with interest that he was also chairman of a committee that dealt with the handling of the Australian wool clip during the Second World War. This was an enormous undertaking but he carried it out with great skill. He was an outstanding and briUiant Australian and we rare honour him in this House today.",20

8,Mr MCMAHON,ARTHUR BLAKELEY,"It is also with regret that I have to in inform the House of the death . on 27th AusJune 1972 of the Honourable Arthur Blakeley. Mr Blakeley represented the electorate of Darling in New South Wales for the Australian Labor Party from 1917 until his defeat at the general election in 1934. From 1929 until the beginning of 1932 he Minister for Home Affairs in the Scullin Government. In 1928 and 1929 he was Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in the House of Representatives. Mr Blakeley was born in Gilberton in South Australia in and was educated at the North Hill convent school. He held several important posts in the Australian Workers Union and was its General President from 1919 to 1923. Following his defeat in the 1934 election he took an appointment as a Commonwealth arbitration inspector, and for the last 10 years before his retirement in 1952 was a Commonwealth conciliation commissioner. We extend our sympathy to",20
9,Mr WHITLAM,ARTHUR BLAKELEY,"The Australian Labor Party thanks the Prime Minister for his tribute to Mr Arthur Blakeley, a former Deputy Leader of our Party. As legislator, administrator and arbitrator he served the Australian people for many years and with great devotion and distinction. May I be pardoned a personal reminiscence about him. He was the first Federal Minister whom I met. He built his own house in Canberra in 1929 and lived here until he was defeated as a member of Parliament. I went to Telopea Park school with one of his daughters and one of his sons. I have retained my associations with the family. Mr Blakeley, not only by injunction but also by example, helped to make Canberra the beautiful city that it is. He was the first distinguished person who brought to my notice as a school child the fact that it was immoral, and in Canberra illegal, to chop down trees. He helped to make this city a better place in which to live. I believe that members of the Australian Labor Party, members of his old union and members of his old electorate will still remember with admiration and affection his services to them.",20
10,Mr ANTHONY,ARTHUR BLAKELEY," I would like to associate the Australian Country Party with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Unfortunately I cannot speak about the Honourable Arthur Blakeley personally; he wa before my time. It is sad that it has s to be an occasion like this when we are reminded of the services that other people have made to this Parliament. He was a very important person in this House. He was the Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party during a very tense period for this nation. He was a member of this House for 17 years and Minister for Home Affairs during the depression years from 1929 to 1932. That portfolio must have been one of the most onerous of any for a Minister to carry during that time. We honour him for the work he did, and on behalf of my Party I extend sympathy to his family.",21

Censorship To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House assembled: The humble petition of electors of Hotham respectfully showeth: Their strongest protest at the flood of indecent literature being circulated and displayed publicly on book stalls, kiosks and shops throughout Melbourne. This type of literature, mainly dealing in photographic reproduction of sexual techniques and love making, is an outrage to our moral sensibilities and can only serve to undermine standards of social responsibility especiaUy in the impressionable minds of our young people. We also object to the low moral tone of some television programmes and many films (including television commercials advertising these filmsparticularly those which are in the restricted classification).

The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: There were more than 4,400 ex-nuptial births in 1971. Only 1,537 ef these children were placed for adoption. The majority of others went to mother only homes. These mothers cannot work without placing their children in day minding centres. Private centres charge fees ranging from $11.50 to $18.00 per week. There are Government Subsidised Day Minding Centres where fees are charged according to the mother's income; however, the waiting list for entry into such centres is anything from six months and onwards. In each case these fees are not a tax deductible item thus causing hardships to supporting mothers who wish to raise their children (our future citizens) themselves and who in any case are not paid commensurate wages with their male counterpart. The result of this situation is that many supporting mothers are forced to remain at home and rely on a Pension thereby acting as a drain on Commonwealth Funds and denying the Commonwealth Income Taxation Revenue. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, should: Enact amendments to the appropriate legislation so as to afford equality of treatment to single/ supporting mothers by allowing tbem to claim as taxation deductions the fees they pay to Day Minding Centres. or-Alternative s to Tax Deductible Nursery Fees. 1. Free child minding centres. 2. AD amendment for provision of Day Care Centres by employers which would be tax deductible, or provision of monetary/concession incentives.

Yet, 23 years later, in our country of great national wealth and abundance it is to the nation's shame that many thousands of our people live in a state of being inconsistent with the dignity and worth of the human person-lan Taxation guishing in poverty and want, neglect and the lack of proper care necessary, for their health and well-being. We, the undersigned, respectfully draw to your attention that the conscience of the nation is not at ease while the records of our country show that social services are not comparable with that of other advanced countries administering such services, therefore, we call upon the Commonwealth Government to immediately legislate for: Base pension rate-3 0 per cent of the average weekly male earnings, all states, plus supplementary assistance and allowances based on a percentage of such earnings. Unemployed beneiits equal to the foregoing. Completely free health services to cover all needs of social service pensioners-hospita lisation, chronic and long-term illness, fractures, anaesthetics, specialist, pharmaceutical, hearing aids, dental, optical, physiotherapy, chiropody, surgical aids and any other appliances. Commonwealth Government to promote a comprehensive national scheme in co-operation with the States and make finance available to provide for the building of public hospitals, nursing and hostel-type homes necessary to effectively meet the special requirements of aged people, in conjunction with a comprehensive domiciliary care programme to enable aged people to stay in their homes. Mental illness placed in the same position as physical illness. Substantial Commonwealth increase in the $5 subsidy a day per public bed pensioner patient in general hospitals. Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social welfare, health, conservation and other community needs. Commonwealth subsidy, for the waiving of rates for pensioners. Commonwealth Government to increase the non-repayable grant to the States for low rental home units for pensioners. Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social welfare structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the Postmaster-General's Department Central Office policy, of centralising Post Office affairs and activities under the various titles of Area Management, Area Mail Centres, Area Parcel Centres and similar titles is resulting in both loss of service and lowering of the standards of service to the public, directly resulting in the closing of Post Offices, which is detrimental to the public interest Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled w/fj take immediate steps to: 1.

14,Mr MCMAHON,LEADER OF THE HOUSE," I wish to inform the House that the MinEdncation ister for National Development, Sir Reginald Swartz, has informed me that in view of his impending retirement at the end of this Parliament he wishes to relinquish his position as Leader of the House. I have accepted Sir Reginald's decision with very great regret. He has carried out these most onerous and responsible duties with distinction and has been an outstanding Leader. I have appointed as the new Leader of the House the Minister for Customs and Excise, Mr Chipp, However, I have asked Sir Reginald, and he has agreed, to make himself available to the Minister for Customs and Excise, and to myself and the Government, in a consultative capacity in relation to matters of House proceedings.",25

Mi CHIPP (Hotham-Minister for Customs and Excise)-by leave- I would like to indicate that after question time we will move for the suspension of Standing Orders to allow this motion to be dealt with this afternoon on the explicit understanding that the Budget will come on at 8 p.m. and consequently we will take action to ensure that the debate on this motion is terminated at an appropriate time before 6 p.m. NA",25
17,Mr WHKTLAM,THE BUDGET,"I ask the Prime Minister a question. The right honourable gentleman will have noted the exceptionally detailed forecasts of the provisions in tonight's Budget which were given on a television network last Sunday night. While the accuracy of these forecasts naturally cannot be tested until the Treasurer delivers his speech tonight, I ask the Prime Minister whether he can assure the House that he had no discussions with this particular mentator about the Budget. I also ask him whether he has checked with his Ministers on whether they had any discussions with this commentator.",26
18,Mr MCMAHON,THE BUDGET,This question is predicated on the assumption that the speculations are correct. As soon as the Budget is heard tonight honourable members will be able to make up their minds as to their accuracy or inaccuracy. NA,26
19,Mr BROWN,INQUIRY INTO POVERTY,"I direct a question without notice to the Prime Minister. I ask whether he h aware of the large number of citizens throughout the Commonwealth who are concerned about the nature and extent of poverty within Australia? Is it not so tnat something in the nature of a national mquiry into poverty in Australia would help the nation and governments to ascertain ihe extent and nature of poverty in this country? If so, will the Prime Minister reconsider the Government's decision with respect to holding such an inquiry with a view to ensuring that a national inquiry into poverty is conducted?",26
20,Mr MCMAHON,INQUIRY INTO POVERTY,Yesterday I received a letter from the honourable gentleman advising me that he intended to ask in the House a question relating to this problem. I can assure him that,26
21,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INQUIRY INTO POVERTY,"Mr Speaker, I must take a point of order. Usually it is not possible to prove that a question is with notice. The Prime Minister has done that for me, if we can believe what he says. Therefore I suggest that you rule the question out of order, as you must do because the Standing Orders say that questions asked during question time shall be without notice. This question is clearly with notice on the Prime Minister's own say-so.",26
22,Mr SPEAKER,INQUIRY INTO POVERTY,Order ! The honourable member for Hindmarsh has asked me to rule the question out of order. The honourable member for Diamond Valley informed the Chair that he was asking the question without notice and I accept his word.,26
23,Mr MCMAHON,INQUIRY INTO POVERTY,"I did not know it was to come on today in this sense. Coming back to the question, the Government has again given consideration to the problem comof holding an inquiry into poverty in Australia and we have agreed that such an inquiry will be instituted. Already the Minister for Social Services has prepared draft terms of reference which will be further considered by the Government, and when that has been done we will decide on the person or persons who will carry out the inquiry. NA NA",26
24,Mr BARNARD,EAST ASIA,"I ask the Prime Minister a question. I direct his attention to a statement by the Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Lee, at a National Day celebration on Sunday. Mr Lee stated that his Government would accept a policy of troops withdrawal from the South East Asian region if the Labor Party became the next government of Australia. He confirmed also Singapore's military ability to defend itself and stand on its own 2 feet. I ask the right honourable gentleman: Does not this statement make a mockery of his Government's claim that Labor policy would be unacceptable to Singapore? Finally, has not Mr Lee's affirmation of Singapore's independent defence strength destroyed the last remnants of the Government's forward defence policy?",26
25,Mr MCMAHON,EAST ASIA,"On the contrary, I have the full text of what has been said by the Prime Minister of Singapore. He said that he accepts-and rightly accepts-the constitutional position of the Australian Government. He went on to say that if the Australian Labor Party did become the Government, it would have a sovereign right to withdraw troops from Singapore. That is the context in which the statement of the Prime Minister of Singapore has to be accepted. I remind the honourable gentleman of our policy, which is welcomed by the governments of Malaysia and Singapore. They welcome our troops there and they have not expressed any intention of withdrawing them. We too, if I can state our position very clearly, are anxious and willing to retain our troops there while they are wanted. As the honourable gentleman would know from the statements I made while I was overseas, in the communique between Tun Razak, the Malaysian Prime Minister, and myself and in statements made while I was in Singapore, our Air Force is welcomed in one place and elements of our fighting Services in another. I also point out to the House that not only must it be recognised that if the Labor Party has its way we would have no capacity to bring a degree of confidence to these countries and to give them an ability to expand their operations in order to have greater development programmes, but it is my belief that if the statement made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were accepted we would have very little capacity to defend ourselves. NA",26
26,Mr MWIN,RIVERSTONE MEATWORKS,"I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service: Is it a fact, as announced in all Australian newspapers; that the Riverstone Meatworks, situated some 30 miles from Sydney, has been closed down and that 690 employees have lost their jobs as a consequence of this closure? Is it also a fact that in the last months 168 unauthorised stoppages have taken place at this meat works? Did any member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions or any member of the Labor Party move in any way to prevent this anarchic nonsense or were orders taken from the left wing unions that the members of the Australian Labor Party were not to intervene in any way to prevent this stupidity over the last 7 months? Is the Minister aware that I ask this question at the request of a great number of the men and their famUies?",27
27,Mr LYNCH,RIVERSTONE MEATWORKS,"I can well understand the honourable gentleman's concern about the impact that the announcement which was widely reported in the national Press during the last weekend has had directly on the men concerned and their families and, of course, on the operation of the plant. Mr Armitage-Owne d by Vesteys.",27
28,Mr LYNCH,RIVERSTONE MEATWORKS,"The facts are that the Riverstone Meat Co. Pty Ltd has announced the retrenchment of some 700 workers and the closure of sections of its meat operation which is a subsidiary' of the W. Angliss Meat Company. The reason for this is clear and was adverted to by the honourable gentleman-that is, that since January this year there have been 168 stoppages in this plant. Of course, that will have an impact on honourable gentlemen on this side of the House as it should have on honourable gentlemen on the other side of the House. It is a classic example of the extent to which unemployment in the community at the present time is caused by sporadic stoppages of the type which bave been mentioned and which have been condoned consistently by members of the Opposition. As the honourable, gentleman mentioned in his question, I recall no statement made by any member of the Opposition or any member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions , deploring what has been a series of irresponsible stoppages which have led directly to the unemployment of men. The House might well ponder the simple fact that here again is a circumstance in which 700 men have lost jobs and sections of a company have been closed down simply because of the 168 stoppages to which they have been subject during a period of only 6 to 7 months. It is'almost inconceivable that this should be the case, but in-fact it is the 7 case and it is a point well worth the attention of honourable gentlemen on the other side. NA",27
29,Mr COPE,SOCIAL SERVICES,"I preface my question by stating that Mr John Kinsela, a constituent of mine, captain of the Australian wrestling team at the Munich Olympic Games and a representative of Australia at the 1968 Mexico Olympic Games, also the holder of the Queen's Scout Award, the Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award, a leader in Rotary Youth and a Vietnam veteran of 1970-71, used his savings as a deposit on small car of which he was owner-driver for All Purpose Messengers. John, a part Aborigine, is one of a big family that he helps to support and also has a wife and 9-weeks old baby living with his mother and family, but owing to John's being in Munich his wife, child, mother and younger members of the family are now in straitened eircumstances. I ask the Minister for Social Services whether there is any way in which his Department can assist to alleviate their distress.",27
30,Mr WENTWORTH,SOCIAL SERVICES,"The honourable member was good enough earlier today to bring this matter to my attention. There are no funds at my disposal which could be used for this purpose, but I have no doubt that the Australian people would see that funds were made available. I know that honourable members in this House, including myself, would be only too willing to see that this matter was made good. But I have had today a communication with officials of the Australian Amateur Athletics Association. There is some difficulty about the breaching of Olympic rules and this has to be looked at to see what can be done. I think we can assure the people concerned that something will be done, although we will be careful to stay within the limits imposed by the Olympic Committee. NA",28
31,Mr OKEEFE,MEAT QUOTAS,"I direct a question to the Minister for Primary Industry. Has the elimination of beef quotas to the United States of America meant increased sales for Australia? Have sales to Japan and other markets increased considerably? With this upsurge in beef export, has Australia sufficient abattoir and processing plants to cope with this huge increase? Can the Minister advise what the present position is and say whether any plans are being made to increase our processing facilities?",28
32,Mr SINCLAIR,MEAT QUOTAS,"It is true that as a result of the increase in Japanese quotas and the lifting of the import quota in the United States this year there will be conincreased siderable opportunities for Australian meat exporters. I am assured by my Department that there is an adequacy of available facilities but much will depend on the degree a to which they can be utilised. Already during this question time my colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service, has identified one area in which the available facilities are constricted by irresponsible stoppages, activities which of course direcdy affect the ability of exporters to supply the available market and to satisfy the needs of customers who are willing purchasers. If any similar movement were to spread throughout the meat industry it would be doubtful whether there were sufficient facilities. I am assured that given the availability of facilities and preparedness to work more than one shift per day, however, there is every ability within the availability of existing structures for the expected level of demand to be satisfied. NA",28
33,Mr DUTHIE,TASMANIAN SHIPPING SERVICES,"Is the Minister for Shipping and Transport aware that 95 per cent of Tasmania's cargo trade is carried by sea, with no road or rail alternatives as on the mainland? Has the Minister power to cancel out, in the public interest, a decision of the Australian National Line to increase freight rates? Is he aware of the recent freight rate rise which has again cast a blow at Tasmania's economy, especially at the tourist trade? Finally, will this Government seriously consider a freight subsidy as was paid in the days when the 'Taroona' operated across the Strait? The position today is much worse than it was then.",28
34,Mr NIXON,TASMANIAN SHIPPING SERVICES,"I am certainly aware of the changes in freight rates that the Australian National Line has effected in the Tasmanian trade. The freight rate increases average 1 per cent across the board. There was no general increase in the freight rate to Tasmania on this occasion. Rather, the Australian National Line sought to rationalise the services to Tasmania in an effort to meet the problems of increasing costs of wages, repairs and maintenance. Despite all its efforts of rationalising to meet increasing costs, the ANL nevertheless bas had to make some adjustments to the freight rates. As a result, as I have said, it has freight rates on an average by 1 per cent. This increase will raise approximately an extra $200,000 against a possible or estimated loss of $1.8m, the balance of which the ANL is trying to save by the rationalisation programme. The ANL has increased the fares on the passenger service, which is its heavy loser, the run to Sydney by 10 per cent and on the run to Melbourne by 15 per cent. This will raise an extra $150,000. Certainly, increased charges are to be regretted, but in the face of the awful increases in costs for wages, repairs, maintenance and general overhauls that the Line has suffered, there was nothing else that it could do. The honourable member raised a question of freight subsidy. This is a proposal that has been looked at from time to time by the Government and has been rejected from time to time. NA",28
35,Mr BURY,UNEMPLOYMENT,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Labour and National Serrepresented vice and concerns the latest unemployment figures. Has the Minister's Department made any estimate of the extent to which this increase in unemployment has been brought about by the difficulties of firms countering higher costs due both to labour disputes and to meeting excessive wage demands? Furthermore, has the Minister been able to keep any tally of the number of smaller firms throughout the country which have been obliged to close down the same reasons?",29
36,Mr LYNCH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"My own Department has not carried out studies of the type sugto gested by the honourable gentleman but believe that this certainly would be worthwhile area of inquiry at present, because if one looks back at the calendar year of 1971 one will see that average weekly earnings during that 12-monih period increased by 12.5 per cent and consumer price index increased by 4.8 per cent as against a long term productivity difference? growth increase of 2.5 per cent. As the honourable gentleman inferred, or directly stated, one of the inhibiting factors in labour policies of companies throughout this country certainly is the high cost labour. This is clear if one reflects on increase in average weekly earnings to which I have made reference. There is no doubt that this is a factor not of insignificance in relation to the employmaking ment policies of employers at present. Equally, as the honourable gentleman has said, the continuing series of stoppages is a major factor which impacts itself upon the whole problem facing the Australian com* munity, which is the confidence of the on business community in relation to investment and of consumers in relation to their spending patterns. As the House will be the well aware, during the last year the number of man days lost was 3 million, which was an increase of 28 per cent over that of the previous year. The Australian wage earners during that period lost",29
37,Dr KLUGMAN,UNEMPLOYMENT,B y how much have you reduced unemployment?,29
38,Mr LYNCH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I would have thought that honourable gentlemen opposite might well have been interested in the plight of wage earners in relation to loss of wages caused by strikes. The wage earners, whom the Opposition alleges it represents, lost during that period a total of $46m, which itself an increase of 46 per .cent over that of the previous year. NATIONAL SERVICE ",29
39,Dr JF CAIRNS,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I direct my question to the Minister for Labour and National : Service. I understand that recently the Minister or his Department announced that 7,775 or a similar number of men 'have been denied the benefit of the ballot'. Is for this correct? To what period does that figure relate? Does it mean that 7,775, or some similar number of men have failed register or have committed some other I offence against the National Service Act a and were not prosecuted? If so, why were they not prosecuted? If they were not prosecuted, what does 'denied the benefit of the ballot' mean? What did happen to these men? If they were not prosecuted the were others who committed similar offences prosecuted? Why has there been a",29
40,Mr LYNCH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The honourable gentleman asks a series of detailed questions. Of the course, I will examine the questions which he has posed for the purpose of supplying of a written answer. No member of this the House would expect any Minister to carry such information with him in order to give an impromptu response to a question without notice. The honourable gentleman is the allegation or inference, or the direct statement, that this Government is not vigorous in relation to its follow up of defaulters under the National Service Act. The facts simply are these, as I recall them: In the first place, the proportion of those who do not register for national service is approximately 2 per cent. The proportion of those persons in the second area of default, that is those who do not attend for medical examination, is 0.3 per cent or 0.03 per cent', whatever it is, it is still insignificant. The proportion of those in the third area of default, that is those who fail to render service, is 0.2 per cent. These facts indicate quite clearly that there is no substance in any general allegation that the Government is not vigorous in enforcing the requirements of the National Service Act. The honourable gentleman specifically asked some questions about figures. In 1971-72, 106,833 persons registered for national service. The number of persons registered up to 30th June 1972- a period of 74 years-wa s 749,922. Those who failed to register at the appropriate time and therefore were denied the benefit of the ballot in the year 1971-72 numbered 2,306, or 2.2 per cent of the total. Some 723 were prosecuted and convicted for failingtoregister during that period. NA",29
41,Mr JESS,USTASHI MOVEMENT,"Is the Prime Minister aware of reports that the Australian intends to move for a parliamentary investigation into the so-called terrorist activities of the Ustashi movement? The Prime percentage Minister will agree that the Australian people resent overseas politics being introhave duced into Australia. Therefore, will Prime Minister agree to such an inquiry, but will he ensure that any such investigaone tion is not restricted to just this one group but covers all groups whose intention is subvert and to bring about chaos and and anarchy within Australia on behalf of foreign ideologies? Or are we in Australia confrontation. interested only in controlling subversion in overseas Communist countries?",30
42,Mr MCMAHON,USTASHI MOVEMENT,"Alread y the Commonwealth has made investigations into the alleged operations in Australia of subverask sive organisations from overseas, particucompleted larly as to whether certain kinds of operaconducted tions were carried out by the Mafia or similar types of organisations. Crown Law officers and the Attorney-General also have been investigating allegations that people formerly resident in Australia were involved in subversive operations in another country. I can assure the honourable member that Crown Law officers and the Attorney-General on behalf of the Government, are investigating each of these matters in great detail. The Attorney General has made a public statement, I believe within the course of the last 3 or 4 days. I go along with the honourable gendeman when he suggests that not only should we be looking at the activities of the types of subversive organisations I have mentioned which engage in threats, intimidation and other kinds of atrocities but that also we should be interested in those which by force and by other forms of objectionable practice are determined to overthrow democracy in this country. I will refer this matter to the Attorney-General and ensure that he inquires fully into the problem raised by the honourable gentleman. ABORIGINAL 'EMBASSY'",30

44,Mr HUNT,USTASHI MOVEMENT,"I cannot give the honourable gentleman an accurate estimate of the of Aborigines to Europeans who were camped at the 'embassy'. We did a transitory group of people over the the period of the 6 months that they were camped in the 'embassy'. In fact, when group left another group arrived. They were mostly part Aborigines.

Has the Minister found any illegal activities involved with those auctions, and what action has his Department taken to protect the public interest this matter?",30
46,Mr CHIPP,AUCTION SALES,"Because this matter could be sub judice the honourable member will forgive me for answering the question in a different way from which it was put to me. The honourable member will recall writing to me, I think in June, pointing out that certain auction sales which purported to be auction sales of customs goods were taking place, whereas in fact the sales were goods that had been confiscated by my Department. We have conducted extensive inquiries and have discovered that there has been some confusion, either deliberately or accidentally caused, not only in Victoria but in other States, by use word 'custom' in the advertising matter and, in some cases, by salesmen wearing uniforms that bordered perilously close to those uniforms used by customs officers some years ago. The matter has been referred, in certain specific cases, to the Crown Law authorities and other action is being taken to make the public aware of this matter. I might say that when such sales of confiscated customs goods are made they are advertised by the Collector of Customs in each State and the sales are conducted through reputable, well recognised auctioneers only. I thank the honourable gentleman for bringing the matter to my attention. NA - Mr DRURY- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health: Will he, the interest of economy, both of time and money, confer with his colleague in another place with a view to allowing members of the medical profession to prescribe larger quantities of approved for chronically ill patients?",31
47,Dr FORBES,MEDICAL PRESCRIPTIONS,"I will be glad to discuss the honourable gentleman's question my colleague but I should point out to him that the maximum quantities that are presoon scribed are the quantities recommended the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, In nearly all cases, as I understand it, they are related to the particular requirements of a course of treatment. Quite apart from that there does exist, under the Act, authority for the Commonwealth Director of Health in the State concerned, on application by the patient's in medical practitioner, to authorise a larger quantity than that laid down, namely, 3 months supply. But it is up to the doctor whether he applies; because he might feel it necessary, in the patient's interest for the patient to come back and see him so that he can check on the patient's condition in a shorter period than 3 months.

How does Mr MACLachlan's purchase price compare with the original price offered by the Commonwealth for this property?

I was informed that some of the States could not see their way clear to include a warning on cigarette packets until 1st May next year. Having made inquiries, I understand that 2 States-Wes tern Australia and Victoria-wil l require the warning to appear on packages as from 1st January. Under that circumstance I believe that the proclamation relating to advertising on radio and television should apply from the same date. It will apply for the whole of Australia, So, there will be an element of conflict in some States as between the warning given on packages and that given on radio and television. NA",32
52,Mr LUCHETTI,TELEVISION,"I ask the Postmaster General to investigate personally the inordinate and unjust delay in providing satisfactory television reception in the Portland, Wallerawang and Cullen Bullen areas of New South Wales. Does the Minister know that the national and commercial translator stations were promised to be completed by mid-1972 and that the national station now is not expected to be in operation before the first quarter of 1973? As the viewers are subjected to inferior television reception but are paying the same licence fees as those who enjoy satisfactory standards, will the Minister take action to end this injustice?",32
53,Sir ALAN HULME,TELEVISION,"It is very easy for honourable members to make assertions such as the honourable member has made relating to delays. I am sure that the majority of the Australian public appreciate that great technical requirements are involved in the establishment or furtherance of television in any part of Australia. A good deal of the equipment must come from overseas and, if there is delay in delivery of that equipment, there is delay in completion of the installation. I assure the honourable member, as I assure those members of the public who do not have television and wish to have it at an earlier time than it is expected to be provided, that every endeavour is made by the authorities responsible to meet target dates; but this is not possible in all cases, for reasons beyond the control of those who have the responsibility.

Can he inform the House whether, to his knowledge, individual country television stations will be able to finance the changeover from black and white to colour television? Will he assure the House that country television stations will be protected from takeovers, amalgamations or other loss of identity in contravention of the .Broadcasting and Television Act as a result of the cost of providing colour television in order to meet competition?' Senator ALAN HULME-It is a fact that colour television will be possible as from 1st March 1975. It is .not . expected by the Government-or , I think, by most members of the House-that every station will have colour television as. from 1st March 1975. That statement applies to the national service, as well as to. the . commercial service. The commercial stations are protected to a degree by the ownership provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act and it is not anticipated , that any. other protection will be required for them. I think most of us appreciate that some stations will find no difficulty in financing the establishment, of colour television, whereas others may have difficulty. I think it will be understood that there will be delay in the case of some stations, but I . will be surprised if there are many stations which are not able to arrange the necessary finance to achieve the introduction of colour television by a date not long after 1st March 1975.

57,Mr ERWIN,OIL STRIKE,My question is directed to the Minister for Labour and National Service. During the recent oil strike what action was taken by the Government and what innuence was brought to bear by other parties to bring the ridiculous oil strike to an end?,33
58,Mr LYNCH,OIL STRIKE,"During the recent oil strike in this country fuel was cut off to the community, some tens of thousands were thrown out of work and the jobs of hundreds of thousands were put in jeopardy because a small group of trade unionists in this country was prepared, against the interests of the great majority of the wage earners of Australia, to refuse to accept the interim decision which had been handed down by His Honour Mr Justice Moore and to down tools at the expense of their fellow unionists and at the expense of the country. The honourable gentleman asked me what action was taken by the Government. As honourable gentlemen on this side are very well aware, the Prime Minister, in a very firm statement, foreshadowed that this House would be called together if the strike were not solved within a period of 5 working days. That initiative was then followed by the initiative taken by Mr Laurie Short of the Federated Iron workers Association, and finally the initiative taken by His Honour Mr Justice Moore. These were the significant developments which led to the solution of that dispute. I do not know what the honourable gentleman means by 'other parties'. If he refers to the official Opposition in this ber, the House will be well aware that the Opposition took no concrete or constructive approach in seeking to solve this dispute, except to say that the parties ought to continue talking. There were no suggestions from the Leader of the Opposition that the men ought to return to work and negotiate their claims before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Let me say by way of a casual observation what a pathetic comment it is on Opposition members in this chamber that on a day following the release of the employment figures for this country there has - been not one question on unemployment from the Opposition.

59,Mr BERINSON,AUSTRALIA,"Takin g up the Minister's invitation with pleasure, I direct a question to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that Western Australia has now had a higher rate of unemployment than any other mainland State for over a. year? Is it also a fact that, unlike most other States, Western Australia's unemployment is concentrated in the metropolitan area where no assistance at all is received from the Commonwealth's only emergency employment measure, the rural unemployment grant? Has the Commonwealth ignored or rejected at least 3 requests from the Western Australian Government for unemployment relief directed specifically to the metropolitan area? If so, why?",33
60,Mr MCMAHON,AUSTRALIA,I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service to answer.,33
61,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable gentleman queries the position in relation to unemployment in Western Australia. It is certainly true that it is running at a much higher level than the national, average. It is also true that the Western Australian unemployment figures have been running at a much higher level than the national average for a long period of time. The honourable gentleman concurs; I see him nodding his head. The facts are that in the labour market in that State a deterioration has taken place during the course of the past 2 to 3 years. The factors which have been responsible for that position are simply these: Firstly, there has been the turndown in the number of major developcham- mental projects and this has reduced employment in that area from 10,000 toas I recall it-approximatel y 3,000. This has had an effect on associated manufacturing, supplier and engineering firms. Secondly, there has been a turndown in mineral activity because of trading conditions which will be well known to the honourable gentleman as he comes from that State. Also I recall the downturn in primary industry from about 1969. But there are some encouraging factors in Western Australia. Firstly, farmers are reporting better seasons. Secondly, there arc signs of increased optimism in the building and construction industry. Finally, the goldmining industry is expected to reach this year its highest production level for many years. I discussed this matter with the Western Australian Minister for Labour during a recent visit to that State. Naturally, the substance of my conversation with him is a matter for the Minister concerned and is not subject to comment in this House. The problem which faces Western Australia is not new and it is not due to any factors generated by ithe recent economic circumstances. In making that statement. I am thinking of the past few months and the unemployment picture I have painted. The fact remains that the Western Australian Government must go out and sell that State. It must bring into Western Australia new and more broadly diversified industries of a labour intensive nature. Specifically, the answer to any question of special grants is no.

65,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR," I move: That this House has no confidence in the caused. Minister for the Interior because of his handling of the affair of the removal of the Aboriginal 'embassy' from the lawns in front of Parliament House. In January there was a tent erected on the lawns in front of Farliament House to express the points of view of persons concerned about the position and status of Aborigines in this country. It was actually the second occasion on which such a tent was erected. Honourable members will recall that some 3 or 4 years ago a vigil was organised in front of Parliament House to express concern about the position of Aborigines ih this country. As the weather at that time was cold and wet a tent was erected, not to the left of Parliament House-treatin g 'left' as one's left when one stands-at the front door as occurred on the second occasion-bu t to the right of it. That tent was erected by Commonwealth police officers themselves. They erected h as a shelter for the demonstrators, and 1 understand that they put braziers in the tent to warm the demonstrators. I think it is obvious that that event of 3 or 4 years ago was what inspired the idea of having a tent on the lawns in front of Parliament House as a way of demonstrating. The first tent was erected by Commonwealth police officers themselves. We have the advantage, through a debate in the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory, of finding out the assessment by the Minister for the Interior (Mr Hunt) of the situation. Upon that assessment he apparently acted. He expressed it in a telegram apologising for his inability to attend the opening of the Tennant Creek Sports Club. In explaining why he could not attend that function, he referred to what he regarded as the frightful dangers developing in Canberra. The Minister's telegram read as follows: Because elements of left wing unions and radicals threaten to cause violent demonstrations and possible bloodshed in Canberra Uiis weekend, as was demonstrated last Sunday, I am required by the Prime Minister to return to Canberra for consultation and take steps to prevent radical elements from using Aboriginal movements for their own purposes. This crisis situation is a cause of deep concern and, if violence does occur, the consequences will be alarming nationally. Please convey my sincere apologies to people at Tennant Creek for inconvenience that has been Will make a point of visiting Tennant Creek in near future. Regards, Ralph Hunt. This lurid assessment of the situation is apparently the motivation of the Minister's actions. I am at a loss to understand the thinking of a succession of Country Party Ministers for the Interior whom we have had and who have handled the affairs of the Australian Capital Territory. I remember that in August 1966, when the present Leader of the Australian Country Party was Minister for the Interior, there suddenly appeared in the 'Canberra Times' a picture of a new riot squad being trained in Canberra as part of the Canberra police. They had machine guns; they had steel helmets; they had shields; and they had gas masks. After these photographs appeared in the 'Canberra Times'. I asked the then Minister for the Interior why, in what was obviously the most peaceful capital in the Western world, it was necessary to create so fearsome a riot squad. I understand that a good deal of this equipment ultimately left the Australian Capital Territory and perhaps appeared later in Bougainville. It was similar to the equipment which was used during the original Bougainville clash. There seems to me to be a tendency to over-reaction, if not hysteria, on the part of Ministers who handle the affairs of Canberra. I return to the present Minister for the Interior and the extraordinary statement that the situation in front of Parliament House involved 'left wing unions and radicals'. Heavens above, the 'Embassy' had been there for about 7 months. I do not know what figures from left wing unions and radicals appeared there, but I would not have thought it would have mattered very much if people from left wing unions and radicals, or for that matter right wing unions, had appeared there. The 'Embassy* was a tolerated demonstration over a period of 7 months. Subsequently a pretence was made to the public in a series of utterances that what had been discovered was that the Commonwealth Government jacked legal power to cope with squatters on public parks. When the case was before Mr Justice Fox, he pointed out that the Commonwealth had at all times had power oh an application to the court to remove the tent and that the Commissioner of Police and the Minister admitted that the Commonwealth had this power. The Minister did not seek that court procedure to remove the tent-as he wanted to-because there would have been a court case dn which public arguments would have been put and reported. He wanted to avoid 2 things. He wanted to avoid a debate in the Parliament and he wanted to avoid any sort of discussion in the courts on civil rights. The reaction of the Minister, apart from the completely unnecessary clashes which took place, has been to bring down a new ordinance-on e which is unnecessary, as Mr Justice Fox pointed out, because of the already existing powers of the Commonwealth, but one in which significant changes in the law were made and made in a particular direction to which all parties represented on the Senate committee which examines regulations and ordinances have always taken exception, namely, rhe procedure set out in section 8c (1.) which reads: 8c -(1. ) An officer of the Department of the Interior authorised in writing by the Minister may, by instrument in writing under his hand, certify that land described in the instrument or by reference to a plan on or annexed to the instrument is unleased land that(a) belongs to the Commonwealth; (b) is within the City Area; and (c) is not within an area for the time being declared by the Minister, by notice published in the 'Gazette', to be, for poses of this Ordinance, a camping area. The old ordinance defined the city limits of Canberra quite clearly. We now have a situation in which the Minister may empower an officer and that officer by instrument in writing can declare that an area comes within the scope of the regulations. No process of publicity is necessary. It is just this exchange of defined power to one exercised from an instrument in writing which gives force and possible objectionable character to the regulations about which people may not know. The situation will be worse when this procedure fs in force than what existed before the regulations were gazetted. The regulations were gazetted and they transformed the state of the law. Erroneous statements' were given out from the Government to justify the promulgation of this ordinance to the effect that the Commonwealth lacked the power to prevent trespass. Therefore, the people occupying the land might have assumed that they had a legal right to be there-sinc e the Government itself suggested there was no law. in 40 minutes after a change in the law people, outside were expected to know the law,; and then the proceedings of ejection took place. This is what led to the clash. The critics of the Government were not all on the Labor, side. It happens that we have a distinguished senator who is a member of the Liberal Party of Australia and also an Aborigine. I refer' to Senator Bonner. I will quote from a report in the 'Courier-Mail' of Friday, 21 sf July. It reads: In Charters Towers, aboriginal - Senator N. Bonner last night predicted that yesterday's Canberra riot would lead to an upsurge of blackpower violence in Australia. He said: ' I just can't see how it can be avoided now. There are people in our community who will seize on this opportunity to use the .aboriginals for their own political gain.' Senator Bonner who was in .Charters Towers on a 'meet the people' tour of Queensland, criticised the Federal Government for. enforcing the ordinance under which the police acted. ' 1 He said he had been assured by Government colleagues that nothing would happen' while Parliament was in recess. ""They knew my feelings on the matter,' he said. ' I wanted the right to have this ordinance debated in Parliament. I agree that Executive Council has the right to the purmake certain decisions during recess. However, in this instance, the Executive Council should not have exercised its authority.'' Senator Bonner accused the Government of deliberately enforcing the ordinance before debate could take place. He added: ' I say categorically that I am disappointed with the Government to the point dt being disgusted with its action in this issue.' We also are disgusted with its action in this issue. We share Senator Bonner's opinion. This is the reason why this motion has been moved. The Minister may say that it was necessary to remove the tent. A similar viewpoint has been taken by the relevant committee of the Parliament of Western Australia, namely, that the tent in front of the West Australian Parliament House, which is a protest against the conditions of Aboriginal housing in Western Australia, sbould ultimately be removed. Discussions apparently took place between the Premier of Western Australia and the demonstrators and it was agreed that after the Budget they would remove the tent. Their hopes rested on the Budget providing an adequate amount for Aboriginal housing in Western Australia, which is estimated by the State Government to need $19m although 1 understand the Commonwealth offering has not been one-ninth of that sum. The demonstration will continue up to the time the Budget was introduced, to emphasise the position of Aboriginal housing. 1 repeat fhat they agreed to remove the tent after the Budget was introduced. This was the result of sensible conversations and not the bulldozing and unfair method which the Minister used. Assurances apparently were given by the Government to the Aboriginal senator that the ordinances would be debated. What transpired was a deliberate evasion of the Parliament and the Minister's counsel was unable to deny the point made by the judge in the court case that existing power was adequate for the Government if they went through the proper judicial process. All these things show that what the Minister wanted to do he wanted to do clandestinely. We can understand this if we accept the hysterical assessment which the Minister made in the telegram he sent concerning the Tennant Creek sporting club. If this is his assessment of the situation, it is extremely dangerous to bave a Minister handling these situations who views himself as being confronted by a colossal, lurid left wing plot when he is dealing with a group of Aboriginal demonstrators outside. I do not agree with the utterances of Black Power people. I do not believe in the method adopted by the Minister. Many demonstrators were not associated with Black Power but were Aboriginal or partAboriginal persons genuinely concerned for their people. Not only were there reactions from Senator Bonner but also damaging reactions abroad. One of the most respected newspapers in the United Kingdom is the 'Guardian', which used to be called the 'Manchester Guardian'. It drew attention to an appeal made to Her Majesty the Queen by the people ejected from that tent. That newspaper made the following comment: The appeal made to the Queen recendy by Australia's Aborigines asking her to prevent the Canberra Government fron enacting legislation said to be discriminatory, is bound to cause considerable embarrassment to Mr MCMahon's Government. The Aboriginal leaders have asked the Queen to order Australia's Governor General to reserve the promulgation 'for your Majesty's pleasure' of an ordinance that would empower the Government to remove the Aboriginal 'embassy' which has been encamped on the lawns of the Federal Parliament for S months. The embassy- a dozen tan-and-orange tentswas established earUer this year after the rejection of an appeal by Aborigines whose tribal lands were threatened by mining development It has achieved remarkable success in focusing Australian opinion on the phght of the Aborigine. Initially, the Federal Government tolerated the embassy, but as the issue became more of a thorn-and the protest more effective-it foreshadowed the introduction of an ordinance to clear the tents. Australia's racial poUcies already stick in the throats of Asian nations, and with the SEATO conference opening in Canberra next month the Government apparently felt that the embassy's continued presence (within sight of the conference hall) could bring even worse problems. The Aboriginal embassy's letter told the Queen that, if the ordinance is allowed to become law, 'it is Ukely to result in a serious abrogation of the rights of aU Australians, whether Aboriginal or otherwise, to bring before the Federal Parliament a continuous peaceful protest 'We therefore appeal to your Majesty as Queen and the ultimate source of protection, to direct his ExceUency the Governor General, Sir Paul Hasluck, that, upon such time as the proposed ordinance is presented to him for promulgation, he reserve Uie promulgation of it for your Majesty's pleasure.' It is unfortunate and extremely damaging to Australia that in such temperate and sensible terms, although they may not be constitutionally informed, the denizens of that tent and the organisers of the demonstrations from the tent have put a statement of the utmost dignity correctly diagnosing the Government's motives before the people of Britain. I disliked the appearance of those tents outside. They were described by somebody as visual pollution. I take the point of view that they constituted visual pollution. The sight of the tents on what was a beautiful stretch seemed to me completely to spoil the view of Canberra. I travelled 21,000 miles with a select committee inquiring into Aboriginal voting rights, but that place was a palace compared to what I saw as a member of that committee and the conditions under which Aborigines live in the south-west of Western Australia, around Gnowangerup and elsewhere where the weather is extremely cold, or generally speaking, throughout the Northern Territory. I would say it was even superior to the transitional dwellings, usually made out of aluminium and entirely inappropriate to the climate where they are erected, which are built for Aborigines in the rest of Australia. So I say to myself: 'Much as I disliked the place being out there, it put before us constantly the position of the Aboriginal people, especially in relation to their accommodation'. One of the most distinguished Aborigines in the country, one of the most  many years before he was an employee of the Commonwealth spoke about the conditions of the Aborigines. He said: 'You live like princes; we live like dogs in the He was not referring to people who lived with the dignity of nomadic and tribal life and who do not particularly need the shelters in the form required by Europeans. He was referring to people whose aspirations are towards standards of living similar to those of Europeans. It is easy to deride these people. Some of them, not all by any means, use the jargon of New. York negro Black Power. They talk about Caucasians meaning white people. They are apparently unaware that Aborigines themselves are Caucasians. All these logical things we can point out. But outside this Parliament was a protest of the heart, which was by no means ineffective is speaking to the conscience of Australia in 'another the persons of thousands of tourists - and of others who visit this city. If we have any sensitivity at all, we should take the trouble to see the conditions of Aborigines to remind us of the problem with which we ought to be dealr ing motivated by the utmost generosity. All through this situation we had firstly a Liberal Minister in charge of Aboriginal Affairs, the Honourable W. C. Wentworth, and now we have the Minister for the Environment Aborigines and the Arts, the Honourable Peter Howson co-existing with a Country Party Mmister in charge of the land and in charge of practical events. When any of these Aboriginal evictions or denials of right take place the Liberal Minister who is supposedly the defender of the Aborigines does, like the House of Lords in Gilbert and Sullivan, nothing in particular and does it very . well. There seemed to be no ministerial concern from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. We heard of no ministerial protection being given or no concern being expressed. The regulations were gazetted and, the duty to conduct an unnecessary clash was imposed upon the police of Canberra and upon the people who were in the tents. This proceeded from the extraordinary, assessment of a situation of great danger which was made by the Minister for the Interior and for knowledge of which we are indebted to the Northern Territory Legislative Council which gave publicity to his telegram.",35
66,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"Is the' "" motion seconded? Mr Enderby- I second the motion and dust'.. reserve my right to speak later...",38
67,Mr HUNT,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"The first thing that I want to say in reply to-the honourable , member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley)' vfe, that he based most of his argument upon what he regarded to be an extraordinary assessment I. had made of what could have transpired on that Sunday, 30th July.. :We can all make, our assessments and we;can all-have our hindsight, but we saw published in the Press on 26th July a statement, by one of the Aboriginal leaders. Under, the headline 'Preparing for . Sharpeville'. this ..article appeared in one of the Canberra. newspapers: .'K - Aboriginal leaders last night were,; preparing fbr Sharpeville' following a, judge's .rejection an injunction to allow the Aboriginal,'embassy' to be re-erected. They said 'a mass demonstration of Aboriginals, students and trade unionists would be held on Sunday outside Parliament .House to re-establish the tent embassy. . Dr EVERINGHAM - You ought .to read about Sharpeville - Mr HUNT- I will tell the honourable member what happened at Sharpeville. On 26th March 1960 at Sharpeville-in South Africa there was a direct - confrontation between black Africans and police,- leaving 67 people dead and 168 injured. It was against that background that I felt I had to return to Canberra to talk to people to ensure that we did not have the violence that was predicted by some people. I have read that the main thrust of the attack that has been upon me as Ihe responsible Minister is related to the propriety of gazetting the amended Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance while Parliament was in recess. I remind the House that the Ordinance was made under the provisions of section 12 of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act. The Ordinance was designed by the Government to prohibit camping on unleased land in the city area of Canberra unless such land bad been declared a camping area by the Minister for the Interior or unless a permit had been granted in relation to one of the special purposes identified in the Ordinance. The honourable member for Fremantle quoted what one of our learned judges in Canberra has said but the legal advice that was available to the Government indicated that in order to protect unleased Commonwealth lands from camping, whether it be on median strips, nature strips or areas around Parliament House, the Ordinance itself would have to be amended. So acting on that advice the Government amended the Ordinance). The legislation does not restrict the traditional rights of freedom of speech or assembly or the rights of people to protest. This form of legislation gives powers similar to that which relates to the conuol of camping on what might be described as municipal land and is common throughout Australia. As honourable members wiD recall, the so-called embassy was estabhshed on 26th January 1972, and legal advice given to the Government was that existing law did not satisfactorily cover the situation and that it was desirable to have specific provisions. In February 1972, hi answer to a question from the right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton) about the campers, I indicated that the people concerned were Aborigines demonstrating in a peaceful way for a cause in which they believed. But I said that for the future we would have to look at the Ordinance to ensure that the Parliament House lawns were reserved for their proper use and were not to be a place on which persons could camp indefinitely. The fundamental fact remains that the Government was faced with the situation in which any protest group or minority group, - whether they be fascists, Croatians, unionists, pensioners, wool growers, wheat growers-yo u name it-coul d camp with impunity on the lawns outside this building or on unleased land in the city area of the national capital, Canberra. How could a responsible Government tolerate such a situation when a defect in the law had been exposed. It is not a question of the Government taking action against the Aborigines; it is a question of the Government facing up to its responsibilities of preserving public places in Canberra for public use. Surely no group should have the right to pitch tents indiscriminately and to proclaim a cause for a lengthy period, thereby impeding the access of people to public areas. It was to give effect to that basic principle that the amendments to the Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance were drafted. It was not an easy exercise, because it was necessary to balance ade* quately the right of individuals against that of the public interest. On llth May 1972 I stated to this House that the Government intended to bring in an Ordinance. I made it clear that the Ordinance would make it generally an offence for persons to camp on unleased land in the city area and would empower authorities to remove their possessions if they did not comply within a reasonable time with a direction to remove them. In my statement. I stressed that the law would apply to the areas around Parliament House. An identical statement was made by Senator Cotton in the Senate and it is important to recall that not one member of the Opposition either in this House or in the Senate took the opportunity to challenge the Government's intention or decision in this matter. Mr Enderby-That is a lie.",38
68,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR," Order! The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory will withdraw that remark. Mr Enderby- I withdraw it, but what the Minister has said is not accurate.",39
69,Mr HUNT,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"The honourable members of the Opposition may have sat pat for ulterior motives, certainly for reasons best known to them; but nobody can deny that every member of the Opposition in both places had his opportunity to challenge the Government on its intention when I made a statement to this House. In accordance with the procedures of the Parliament I gave Parliament the opportunity publicly to debate the Government's intention. Mr Enderby-You did not.",39
70,Mr HUNT,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"I am sorry if I spoil the honourable member's story. I remind the House that I was not under any obligation to make such a statement, although in the circumstances of this case I felt essary to give every member of the Parliament a chance to voice his view before the Ordinance was made. At that time the camp had been in existence for some 3 months during which time it had deteriorated significantly. Soon after the Parliament had been informed of the Government's intentions I had the first of a number of discussions with representatives of the campers, the then spokesmen, Mr John Newfong, in particular. I spoke with other Aboriginal leaders, including Mr Joe MACGinness and Mr Chicka Dixon of the Federal Council of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I also had discussions the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cross) about the removal of the embassy. During all these discussions I made it clear that the Government was firm in its intention to legislate to prevent people from pitching tents at will in the city area. In the course of these discussions we canvassed the possibility of a national representative group of Aborigines obtaining a more permanent and dignified presence in Canberra. I held firmly to the view that the continued presence of scruffy tents outside Parliament House was not serving either the interests of the Aboriginal people or the Parliament in a dignified way. In accordance with practice, the amending ordinance was referred to the Australian Capital Advisory Council on 13th June, that is, about 5 weeks before the removal of the embassy. The member for the Australian Capital Territory was given a copy of the Ordinance on 1st June and I am told that he lost it but subsequently obtained another. The Ordinance was made in the normal way but before it became law a senior officer of the Australian Capital Territory Police Force visited the campers on 17th July. They were informed that the law would be introduced shortly and that it would require them to remove themselves and their tents from the lawns. The campers were provided with a copy of the proposed Ordinance and an explantion of its effect. The officer concerned gained the clear impression that they would comply with the law when it was introduced. Indeed, on 18th July in the 'Canberra it was necNews', it was reported: Staff at the Aboriginal 'Embassy' say that they will co-operate with the Australiaa Capital Territory police and move their camp on the lawns opposite Parliament House without violence. In the same report the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory was reported as saying that it was imperative in the interests of decency that no action be taken against the embassy on the lawns of Parliament House until the Parliament was in session. Perhaps this was the catalyst which caused the change of attitude. Indeed, in the 'Canberra News' a camp spokesman, Mr Ambrose Brown, said that with they would not resist the police and members would maintain operations from an office in Canberra. The ordinance was gazetted on 20th July 1972 and was publicly available at 10.30 a.m. on that date. Shortly after, the ACT police informed the campers that the law had been made and requested the campers to remove their tents from the lawns. It was at this point that there was a dramatic change of attitude. For the first time, the campers indicated to the police that they would not move voluntarily. It is significant that, whereas normally the so-called 'embassy' has been staffed by only one or two persons, on the date on which the Ordinance was gazetted the police were confronted by forty or more people in an organised demonstration. The police requested the demonstrators, comprising part Aborigines and Europeans, to permit them to remove the remaining tent. They were warned that if they did not do so they would be obstructing the police in the execution of their duty. The demonstrators made it clear that they had no intention of moving, and accordingly the police removed the tent. The Police Commissioner informed me that the resistance by the demonstrators was more excessive than at any previous demonstration in the ACT. In an effort to avoid further confrontation and violence, officers of my Department, including the Police Commissioner, met with representatives of the demonstrators on Sunday morning, 23rd July. An offer was made to assist the accommodation problems of those campers involved in legal proceedings to test the validity of the Ordinance. This offer was not taken up. While these discussions were in progress it was learned that a further demonstration had already commenced and that a body of demonstrators was marching from the Australian National University to Parliament House. On their arrival at Parliament House the demonstrators attempted to erect a tent in the area previously occurecord, pied by the campers. The police advised them that any attempt to re-erect the tent would be in contravention of the existing law. This advice was ignored and they elected the tent. The police dismantled the tent after the demonstrators had ignored the repeated police requests. We then move on to a further demonstration on 30th July. It was reported that plans were being made for a mucb larger demonstration on 30th July. Arrangements were made for busloads of demonstrators to converge on Canberra from many parts of Australia. Militant left wing unions, including the New South Wales branch of the Builders Labourers Union were planning to become involved. Indeed, it was reported that the so-called 'front line troops' of Builders Labourers Union-thug s and bikies-were also planning to participate. It was against this background that on 26th July I met with representatives of the demonstrators and discussed with them a more dignified permanent presence in the national capital for some truly representative Aboriginal group. (Extension of time granted.) I would like to thank the honourable member for Fremantle for his courtesy in moving for an extension of time. However, I made it clear that, in the terms of the law, the tents could not be erected outside Parliament House on unleased land in the city area. Further conferences took place on 28th July between officers of my Department and representatives of the demonstrators then in Canberra. An endeavour was made to persuade the demonstrators to call off the movement of interstate professional demonstrators to Canberra. It was agreed that the Commonwealth would bring 9 leaders nominated by the Aborigines to Canberra to discuss the matter with the Ministers. On 29th July my colleagues, the Minister for Environment, Aborigines and the Arts (Mr Howson) and the Minister for Education and Science (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs (Dr Coombs) and officers of my Department met with Aboriginal leaders in Canberra. The discussions lasted 2 hours. While the discussions were taking place the demonstrators were converging on Canberra from a number of centres throughout Australia. For the I am pleased to say that, in spite of attempts by radical groups to pressure Aborigines from my own home town of Moree, they refused to be associated with the activities of those who were hell-bent on creating further violence outside Parliament House. On Sunday, 30th July, there was a large demonstration outside Parliament House involving 2,000 demonstrators. Every effort was made to avoid serious risk of violence and injury, and although the police were in strength on this occasion they made no effort to interfere with or to prevent what was recognised as the temporary erection of a tent on the lawns as a symbolic gesture. At the invitation and with the cooperation of the demonstrators the tent was removed in the afternoon. Although the all the seeds of violence were present on that Sunday afternoon, the police behaved in an exemplary fashion while under considerable pressure. The majority of the Aboriginal leaders sought to restrain, and in fact succeeded in restraining, the more radical elements. Indeed, I would like to quote from a letter I have received from the Australian Capita] Territory Council of Civil Liberties. The Secretary wrote: Dear Sir, It is my pleasure to write to you on behalf oC the Canberra branch of the Council for Civil Liberties to offer our support to, and appreciation of, your recent attempts to resolve the problem of the Aboriginal Embassy in Canberra. May I also offer through you our congratulations to Mr R. A. Wilson, Commissioner of Police, and to the members of his force for their careful handling of the demonstration in front of Parliament House last Sunday, 30th July 1972. My council feels that the discreet way in which the police p'.ayed iheir part contributed very largely to the demonstration proceeding in a peaceful and orderly fashion, despite the fact that throughout there was always a very serious possibility that violence might erupt. While the opinions of my council and your colleagues in the Government may differ widely as to the desirability and conduct of demonstrations of the type that took place last Sunday, I am sure that we will all agree that the events of last Sunday went a long way to strengthening the democratic processes which we are all proud of in Australia. As Minister for the Interior executing a Government decision, I am confident that I do not deserve to be the object of a motion of censure in this House. I repeat that the Government decided to amend the Ordinance to prevent people from camping at will on unleased Commonealth land in the city area. Notice was given to this effect in this Parliament on l l t h May. No Opposition member chose to debate the issue on that day. I repeatedly stated that the Government was firm in its intention. I had numerous discussions with the Aborigines concerned. I stressed that they had had a fair go. They had been there for over 6 months and they had made their point. They were not bringing dignity to the Parliament or to themselves in continuing fo camp in the way they were. The camp had degenerated into a squabbling, untidy and insanitary spectacle. I sought to find a more dignified presence for the Aborigines in the Australian Capital Tetritory. I believe that the whole situation surrounding this affair has been influenced by the political objectives of certain sections of the Australian Labor Party. I do not underestimate their involvement in what must surely be one of the most mischievous plots of our time. The Government has a great sympathy with the problems of the Aboriginal people but we have to remember what the campers were demanding. For the purposes of the record what the campers were demanding was reported in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' on 7lh February 1972, as follows: FuB State rights for the Northern Territory under Aboriginal ownership and all titles for mineral ownership. All other reserves and settlements in Australia with their titles to mining and mineral rights. Mineral and mining rights in certain towns and cities. Preservation of aU sacred AbofÂ» iginal sites included in parts 1 and 2. Compensation of an initial payment of $6 billion for all other land throughout Australia and a percentage of the gross national product each year. In a debate in this House on 23rd February 1972 I asked the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) what was the Labor Party policy in relation to the recognition of traditional land rights outside reserves. I asked whether the Labor Party believed that compensation should be paid to Aborigines who claim traditional land outYours sincerely, side reserves. As far as I know there has H. M. BOOT, Secretary been no reply. In exercising my responsibility as the Minister for the Interior in this Government 1 regret that violence did occur and that injuries were sustained. I regret that outside stirrers succeeded in their endeavours, but I make no apologies for the efforts I made to administer the law and to prevent the violence which occurred on Sunday, 30th July 1972.",40
71,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR, Order ! The Minister's time has expired.,42
72,Mr ENDERBY,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"Toward s the end of the speech made by the Minister for the Interior (Mr Hunt) we heard the true opposition or argument from the Government as to why the Aboriginal embassy was there. It had nothing to do with tents or with people camping on Commonwealth Crown Land, The real opposition from the Government, the real thing that offended it, the real thing it could not stomach, was the reminder out there by those 2 flags, the sign 'Aboriginal Embassy' in a symbolic form, and the tents, that these people claim land rights-somethin g that was taken from them many years ago. That is a political thing, and towards the end of his speech the Minister reiterated it and came back to it; it was the point on which he wanted to finish. He said that the Aborigines were there for political reasons; that they were there not just to live in a tent but to make a political point; and that they were exercising a right to assemble. Tlus statement came right out of the Minister's mouth. There are a number of reasons why this House should not have confidence in the Minister for the Interior. It is quite a pity that there are almost no Liberals present in the chamber. Dr Gun-Hav e a look at those that are.",42
73,Mr ENDERBY,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"Yes , have a look at those 2 or 3-wit h one notable exception. At the moment the Government benches consist almost entirely of members of the Australian Country Party. Where are the Liberals who espouse Liberal principles? Unfortunately 15 minutes is not a long enough time in which to cover all the points. The Minister said that the Aboriginal embassy came there on Australia Day. Rather he omitted to say that, but it was Australia Day. The Aborigines made it clear that they hoped to stay there until Parliament began sitting in order to make their point-the Minister says it was a political point-concernin g a claim for land rights. The Government kept saying: 'We will not tolerate their presence'. Naturally, lik.e any human being, the Aborigines said: 'We will not be told not to do something which we want to do, which is completely legal and which we are allowed to do'. They said that they would stay on until President Suharto from Indonesia came. Again, they were on the verge of going and again the Government came along and said: 'You will go'. It was at that time that the Press began to play it up. Because the Minister for the Interior has made so much of the lack of opposition, as he calls it, from the Labor Party on the llth May, let me give some examples of the opposition that was made. In March I sent a telegram to the Minister saying that I personally opposed any move to move the Aboriginal embassy and that if the Minister was going across to the embassy I would like to go with him. But I received no answer to or no acknowledgment of the telegram I sent on 6th March this year. Towards the end of March the Labor Party members on the Opposition benches produced to this Parliament 10 or 12 petitions from my constituents-peopl e who live in the Australian Capital Territoryprotesting at the reported moves that the Government was making to move the embassy. Indeed, I remind the House that on one occasion I took the unusual step of moving that the petition be printed. The motion was debated in this House in one sensethat I gave the reasons why the petition should be printed. It contained the expression of view of the people in Canberra, that the Government was up to something horrible and that it should be criticised being up to it. I said that the petition should be given the widest possible distribution, that it should get into the books and that the world should know what this Government was up to. No-one on the Government benches spoke against the motion and it was carried unanimously. Opposition to what the Government was up to continued. The Minister will recall that on llth May 1972, when he said that there was no opposition to the Government's move- I know he heard it because I saw his face when he read the statement out- I shouted: 'Shame! You frightened little men'. I repeat what I said: 'Shame! You frightened little men'. It was widely reported in the Canberra newspapers on the following day. If that is not opposition to the Minister's point, I do not know what it is. The Minister said m his statement that it was the Government's intention to bring in an ordinance which would fill a need in relation to the law in regard to trespass on Commonwealth land in Canberra. I do not really see any reference to Aborigines in that statement. He said finally that adequate public notice would be given of the coming into effect of the ordinance. I ' repeat, he said that adequate public notice would be given of the coming into effect of the Ordinance. What would any Opposition member want to do when told that an ordinance dealing with trespass on land could come in? The statement did not'use the words 'Aborigine', 'tent' or any relevant words. I remind the Minister, when it comes to a question of his credibility, that on television he said that when the ordinance came in the Aborigines would be given a couple of weeks- a reasonable time-withi n which to get off the land. I heard him say it. We moved towards the end of the parliamentary session and the Minister-I ' suppose it could be argued that he - reads' the Canberra newspapers as he is responsible for the administration of Canberra- : will remember a Press statement. I released which was given some publicity at 'the time. It said that this Government would not introduce any ordinance dealing'' with the removal of the embassy while Parliament remained in session; that it' would not be game to; that it would wait until for the parliamentarians went back to Perth, Brisbane, Townsville and Darwin-no t that Darwin matters much in this context. The statement said that when they went back to the various parts of Australia the Government would sneak this ordinance in like a thief in the night. Is that not exactly what the Government did? Let me take the Ministery up to 20th July 1972. Rumours ran around this city that the 'Gazette' coming out on Thursday, 20th July, would contain a gazettal about the ordinance. On Thursday morning, 20th July, 1 had the officers in the legislative research section of this Parliament-ver y capable people-tryin g to tell me for an hour whether that ordinance had been gazetted. They could not find out. Do ourable members know how I found out? I was in my city office at the time and I wanted to come across to Parliament House. I got the information from an inspector of the ACT police force. In the end he said: 'If you want to know what is going on, look out your window*. He thought that I was in my office in Parlia4 ment House. When I arrived at the Aboriginal embassy the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) was there. Do honourable members know what I found? The police had dismantled the tents and there were",43
74,Mr SINCLAIR,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,Did you find the ordinance that was given to you?,44
75,Mr ENDERBY,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"That was never lost. You need not be taken away by that. Let me tell honourable members what I saw, because the Minister for the Interior had not been near the place. He talks about radical left wing elements. I saw a group of Aborigines and white people linked arm in arm around the remaining tent which carried the flag and the sign 'Aboriginal Embassy'. I recognised some of the people. I recognised the Reverend Jim Udy, a very respectable clergyman in Canberra, linked arm in arm with the Aborigines. I recognised the Reverend George Garnsey, another very respected and responsible clergyman from Canberra, linked arm in arm with the Aborigines. I recognised Bruce Kent, another responsible, recognised and well known man in Canberra, linked arm in arm with the Aborigines. I saw no-one who could be called irresponsible or within any mythical conspiratorial nonsense that the Minister goes on with. At that stage the police, under the action and directions of the Minister, were proceeding to whale in. They were sooled on by the Minister, if you like, although he was not game to be there, and were pulling them away. I saw violence. This is why this House should have no confidence in the Minister. Until that time that demonstration had been the most successful peaceful symbol of the Aboriginal claim for land rights that one could possibly imagine. The Embassy had been there for 6 months and had attracted tourists. The children of tourists had gone to the Embassy and collected signatures and hon- Aboriginal literature. The Embassy had been a peaceful symbol of the Aboriginals' claim for landrights.What did the Minister and the Government he represents do? He converted that peaceful symbol into a symbol of violence. The Minister has come along here and hypocritically made reference to Sharpeville. He talked about events or 5 days later when there was an explosive situation. The peaceful symbol had been destroyed. I have enormous respect for the Australian Capital Territory police, although no-one has fought the police more than I have in the courts in previous days. But the police had been sooled on to these people by this Minister.",44
76,Mr HUNT,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"Oh , rot.",44
77,Mr ENDERBY,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"Pu t any other different word to it. There were broken limbs and skin was torn. There was violence. What else does one call it? I have spoken to some of the officers concerned. The police were deliberately disarmed. I will tell honourable members this: On the second time round when the 2,000 people assembled, the Aborigines searched each other-this is a measure of their responsibility-to ensure that there would be no arms of any sort on any of them if anything got out of control. There is a measure of responsibility for you. On that occasion we saw violence in this town that was completely unnecessary-violenc e that had been created and provoked by this Minister. May I give another example? That afternoon I received a message that some of the Aborigines and some of the gentlemen to whom I have already referred had gone to the police station to lend moral support to the people who had been arrested as a result of the fracas and who were being released on bail. I went across to the police station. There I saw the real measure of what this Minister has brought about, this transformation of a peaceful symbol into a violent symbol. I saw outside of the door of the police station 20 or 30 constables-no t the 300 who had been there before. They were not standing to attention but were standing at ease. Confronting them was a very angry group of people made up of demonstrators as well as the wives and supporters of the demonstrators. There was one very young Aboriginal lady who was hysterical. She claimed that her husband had had his head bashed in, or something like that, by a policeman. These policemen are my constituents as much as are the people who go there to demonstrate. The Minister has brought about this antagonism between them. This is why I get angry. The demonstrators quite naturally were taking out their anger on the police. The people who were speaking to the demonstrators had their backs to the line of police. I refused to do that because I take the view that in this situation the police should know what you have done to them. They should know the dirty, filthy job that the Minister has given them to do.",44
78,Mr ANTHONY,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,Cu t it out.,45
79,Mr ENDERBY,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"I am not cutting it out. I am trying to tell you what the situation was. The Government nearly had a Sharpeville incident. If the moderate speakers had not poured some oil on these waters and put that fire out there would have been trouble that afternoon and this Minister could have been deliberately and directly held responsible. Let me take the story one step further, and I appreciate that my time is limited. Let me move to what happened during the not there. following week. The responsible editor of one of Canberra's newspapers came to towards the end of the week-abou t their Thursday. He was not looking for a story. He came because of the responsible reports he had heard that an explosive situation was going to arise in Canberra and that the Government was doing nothing about it-it was just washing its hands like Pontype tius Pilate. The Minister will remember these events. I sent him a telegram because all of the reports said that he and his colleague- I suppose that one can call the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts (Mr Howson) a colleaguewere in Darwin or somewhere doing something else probably quite irrelevant, given the situation that had arisen in Canberra. The reports had it that the Minister was trying to bribe off the demonstrators with the offer of Beauchamp House. After all, we remember that the thread running through the Minister's speeches has been that 'perhaps they do not want land rights; perhaps they want a club or something like lhat in Canberra'; or 'Perhaps if I offer them something they will go away and they will not trouble me with their unpleasant, embarrassing political demands'. So there was talk about Beauchamp House. I had a telegram from the Assistant Secretary, Mr Ballard, on the point. Nothing was done. As the .Minister points out, there was widespread support all over this country for the Aboriginals because of the insult that this Government had laid at the door of the Aboriginal cause. Truckloads of people did come in. There was an explosive situation. On the Sunday when the 300-odd police were outside Parliament House every responsible and respected citizen : of Canberra, also was ithere. Mr Jim Pead of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council was there doing his best to try to talk to the responsible officeis in the Department and the police. There was Professor Hal Wootten down from Sydney who was doing his best. I was there, as well as many of the members of the Advisory Council, doing our best. Where was this Minister? He was nowhere to tie seen. We had this explosive situation.",45
80,Mr DUTHIE,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,Perhaps it is as well he was,45
81,Mr ENDERBY,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"That could be so. me There was anger-terribl e anger. But to credit, the police kept their cool. When the demonstrators arrived marching, there was then a strong element of what I suppose loosely could be called black power people. The clenched fist salute was given and chants for land rights could be heard. This of activity was not present before this Minister put the police into move the Embassy away in the way he did. A peaceful demonstration had been converted to a symbol of violence which will now be associated forever with this Government and with the Aborigine's cause. The demonstrators sat down and they were addressed by their own people.",45
82,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. (Extension of time granted.),46
83,Mr ENDERBY,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"I am indebted to the House, Mr Deputy Speaker. The people sat down. Perhaps there were 2,000 of them. Having marched all the way from the Australian National University they heard speeches. Not one word of violence was uttered. The Minister talks about trouble makers and the radicals. I was there and I did not hear or see any of them. The Minister was not there. I say to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) that they played a guitar and sang songs. They talked about (he cause of Aborigines and the cause of land rights. I spoke to the Commissioner of Police who was doing his best because he did not quite know what had happened. I spoke to Hal Wootten, who said-and I am sure that he will not mind me saying so in this context-that all his efforts left him with a feeling of frustration. He said that he could get no sense out of the Government. It was as though they had turned fheir backs, closed their eyes and said: 'We do not know what is going to happen; we have no way of controlling it; we will just walk away from the thing'. Anyone who was there on that day will confirm what I am saying. As the Minister has said, word was conveyed to Mr Wilson, the Commissioner of Police, that the demonstrators would march back to the Australian National University. They did. He was told that a token force would remain within the tent but that there would be no trouble. He was told that the police eould remove the tent. The police did. They found 5 or 6 men in the tent with theirfingersraised in the Churchill V for Victory sign. Here was your violence. When the tent was taken away from around them they held up a symbolic piece of canvas, walked to where the police line was, threw it down and walked away. If that is not self-discipline, I do not know what is. What hypocrisy it was for 'the Minister to suggest in the letter which he wrote to me on 4th August that all of the credit for the absence of violence goes to the Australian Capital Territory police. Full marks to the Australian Capital Territory police. But I say full marks also to those demonstrators and no marks at all for the Minister or for this Government whom he represents. There are many reasons why this House should have no confidence in the Minister. The first is his dishonesty about the strong suggestion in the television programme when he said that he knew that the Ordinance was to be gazetted at a time when the Parliament would not be sitting. I will read the Minister's words to him if he will just listen and not wander away. He will remember that shortly after the violent removal of the tent on 20th July he was interviewed on television and it was put to him: 'Would you rather that this would have happened when the Parliament was sitting?' The Minister had been referring to how he had announced the intention to Parliament on llth May. I already have put to the House what he said on that day-that adequate public notice would be given. Ten minutes public notice was given. When the Minister was talking to this interviewer had about how on llth May he had made an announcement to the Parliament the questioner asked: 'Would you rather that this would have happened when the Parliament was sitting?' The Minister's answer was: 'Well, I knew that this was not going to happen and this is why I felt obliged to inform the Parliament of the Government's decision on llth May'. So on llth May he knew he was going to wait until after the politicians had dispersed before slipping this Ordinance through in the way in which he did. One might ask why he waited. I suggest that it was because he could not face up to it at that stage and he misled the Parliament when he said that adequate notice would be given. I have told the House that I could not find out whether the Ordinance had been gazetted on that Thursday morning. The honourable member for Wills could not find out; I could notfindout. I got the information from an inspector of police who was not unsympathetic to the cause of the demonstrators. In his interview the Minister said: 'it is interesting to note not one member of the Labor Party, the Opposition, at that time, from either the House of Representatives or the Senate objected to the Government's intention'. What rubbish! I have already referred to the long history of opposition, the petitions that have been presented to the Parliament, the telegrams sent to the Minister, the Press statements dealing with the subject and finally, to my shouting of: 'Shame! You frightened little men'. That is exactly what honourable members opposite are. I hurled those words across the chamber at the Minister. He heard them because he looked at me when he heard them. There should be no confidence in the Minister because of the dishonesty, the lack of tolerance and the hypocrisy underlying the whole situation and, finally, because of sheer incompetence. On this point I should like to conclude by reading what Mr Justice Fox said in dealing with the challenge made to the legality of this Ordinance. I have a copy of the transcript of the judgment. The learned judge-on e would think quite an objective, independent person-at page 24 of the transcript, referring to this way of making laws, particularly laws which affect the lives of people, but laws generally in Canberra, said: - You would not take long to convince me that section 12 That is the section of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act under which this type of legislation is enactedis an unsatisfactory scheme of legislation. There are plenty of other examples of the Same kind of comment from the judge in his judgment. At page 96 of the transcript he said: It seems to me on the material presently me that the position was that the' Embassy and those constituting the Embassy could lawfully have been required to leave land under the ciples of the general law and without the the ordinance. As I see the matter if it in fact had been necessary the responsible authorities could have applied to this court for appropriate orders to achieve their desired results. The Minister has spoken about the legal advice he was given. But I remind the Minister that the learned judge said: As I understand him, counsel who appears for both the Minister and the Commissioner of Police does not dispute that some such course was availin able under the general law. In saying that the judge was referring the Minister's own counsel who appeared in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory and who said that the embassy could have been removed under the existing law without this Ordinance. I ask the Minister: 'Where is your legal advice now?' Is that not incompetence? For these reasons I support the motion.",46
84,Mr HOWSON,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"Casey - Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts) (5.15) - It is a pity that the important issues of this debate which were set out by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) have been obscured by that hysterical outburst we have just witnessed from the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Mr Enderby). The honourable member threw, across the floor of this House, a number .of wild accusations which are completely irrelevant to the main issues which we should be discussing. I intend to deal with only one of them, namely, the accusation that the police of the Australian Capital Territory were sooled on by the Minister for the Interior (Mr Hunt). The honourable member should know quite well that the responsibility for administering the lawin the Australian Capital Territory lies solely with the police. In this matter, the police were carrying out their duties and any thought that a Minister was sooling on the police I think needs to be scotched right at the start! This is an accusation that the honourable member should retract if he has any decency. I think there are 2 issues that need to be examined. They were raised by the. honbefore ourable member for Fremantle. The first concerns the use of the lawns in front of prinParliament House and the second is the aid of question of protest by Aboriginal people here and in other parts of Australia'. The first involves the responsibility of the Minister for the Interior and is the subject of this no confidence motion.' AfteV what we have heard from the Minister for the Interior I think that this House should have every confidence in him for ,the way which, in a very difficult situation,, he has acted with full integrity and full, proto bity. He has from me and all members on this side of the House full confidence in what he has undertaken, namely, the mainresentative taining of the law in respect of the use the lawns of Parliament House. The other matter to which I think I should direct my attention concerns protests and needs and aspirations of the Aboriginal people and the aid that this Commonwealth Government should be giving to them at this stage of our history. The honourable memference ber for Fremantle knows full well that he, the hononourable member for Macquarie (Mr Luchetti), many other honourable wished members and I were present during the and survey carried out in 1961 from which saw that there is this socio-economic dUemma of ethnic minority groups as part of a world-wide phenomenon. It is not something for which any of us can prethat scribe easy solutions, but what we have clearly stated as a Commonwealth Governdiscussion ment is that we have an objective towards which we are moving, namely, to create Australia a single society while at the same time recognising the disparate history of ethnic, cultural and spiritual characteristics of the Australian community. But we do wish to move towards one single society. That is the aim of the Government and istowardsthat aim that I think we should address ourselves. One thing that I have been endeavouring to do as Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts is to improve the dialogue between the Government and the Aboriginal people. For too long there have been various solutions and slogans, and so called representatives of the Aboriginal people, both European and Aboriginal, putting forward their views. However, has been difficult at any one time to assess what are the real needs of Aboriginal people in Australia at the present time to determine how we will achieve a degree of integration into the general society which we live? The needs and the probto lems are not uniform throughout Australia. The needs of people in the capital cities, the people who have moved out of their old Aboriginal situations into European situations in the cities, are obviously very different from the needs of people still the tribal areas in the north. So, it has been for this purpose that for the last months I have been endeavouring to call together a conference of as widely repfor groups of Aboriginal people as of possible in order to start that dialogue between the Government and the Aborigines. It has not been easy. For some the time. I asked the Council for Aboriginal Affairs to seek the best available means of calling together that national conference. But we succeeded and last week this conwas held. I think it is known that that conference was free to ask advice, and to receive submissions, from any source it to consult. It was open to the Press its deliberations received wide publicity. we I have received from that conference a series of 39 resolutions and I think the House knows that I am in the process of considering them. I hope and believe that conference is the embryo of a continuing process of dialogue and meaningful between the Government and the Aboriginal people. That is something in which has not existed in the past. Having stated how I believe we shall be able to understand these needs more closely, I now wish to inform the House of what has taken place while I have been it Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts. In spite of the slighting remarks of ithe honourable member for Fremantle, I believe a very great deal has been done over the past few months.",47
85,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"I spoke about your actions in a crisis, not your actions as a Minister.",48
86,Mr HOWSON,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"Le t me deal with my actions as a Minister. As these important matters have been raised let me refer to it the important decisions we have made respecting land for Aborigines. Three important moves were announced by the and Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) on 26th January. The first dealt with the creation in of general purpose leases, leases to apply land on reserves in the Northern Territory, and leases to be granted to Aboriginal communities which have the intention and ability to develop the land on which they are living for economic and social purposes, ensuring, at the same time, that in those applications do not interfere with other groups which may be living close to few them at that time. The important thing is that there has been no change of policy those people living on reserves in the Northern Territory who wish to continue with the present use that they are making of their land. That new policy was the announced for those who wish to make new uses of the land. Many groups already best have applied for these leases and I believe, therefore, that this first policy is fulfilling a need felt by the Aboriginal people living on reserves at this time, particularly in Northern Territory. Secondly, for those people living off reserves, the Government announced its policy of purchasing areas of land, pastoral properties, as they become available the use of Aboriginal people. It is well known that I am in the process of negotiating for a number of these properties, both in the Northern Territory and in States. We have appropriated $13m to underwrite this programme over period.",48
87,Mr FOSTER,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"I rise to a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think that the for Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts ought to be informed by the Chair of the subject matter that is now before the House. The matter with which he has been dealing is one that we s<ide of the chamber would welcome as the subject of a general debate, namely, the administration of Aborigines by his Department. However, on the issue that before us he is particularly wide of the mark.",49
88,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR, There is no substance in the point of Arts. order.,49
89,Mr HOWSON,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"My remarks relate to the purpose of the protests outside the House, the matter which we are discussing, and are directed to the use of land Aboriginal people. Therefore it is right that the policy of the Government on this matter should be widely disseminated. wish also to deal with Aboriginal sacred sites and sites of special significance because this goes to the heart of the ter. The protests related to the question land rights and it is that policy that we debating. Therefore I think the House should be cognisant of it. The Government has said that it shall endeavour as soon as possible to preserve and delineate for all time the use of those special sacred 17900/72-R-[2] for Aboriginal people. Tbis was part of the policy announced on 26th January. I asked Institute of Aboriginal Studies to convene a gathering in order to find nut",49
90,Mr FOSTER,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"I rise again to a point of order, and I draw your attention, Mr Depthe uty Speaker, to the Standing Orders. This House is debating a motion of no confidence in the Minister for the Interior because of his handling of the affair of the removal of the Aboriginal 'Embassy' from the lawns in front of Parliament for House. My point of order is that at no time during his address to the House has the Minister for the Environment. the Aborigines and the Arts mentioned the subject matter before us. Why do you not the 5-year insist that he do so?",49
91,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR, Order ! I remind the honourable member Sturt that earlier had he been listening he would have heard the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory mention the fact that one of the points involved in this matter was the land rights on this of the Australian Aborigines.,49
92,Mr FOSTER,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,It is a simple,49
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"Order ! The is honourable member for Sturt will cease interjecting. This is the very point that is being dealt with now by the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the",49
94,Mr HOWSON,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"If land rights is one of the matters that has been the subject of protest by a group of people on the lawns outside Parliament House then it is hi by order, and more than in order, for the Government to make clear what progress it has made in delineating and dealing with 1 the subject of land rights for Aboriginal people, particularly as they affect the sacred sites that have been of so much matimportance during the history of this of embassy. We have been dealing with some are of the major factors about which there have been protests in the last few months. Having done that, it is right therefore that these policies should be clearly set out in a debate on the subject of confidence in the sites Minister for the Interior. Let me make this clear: If there is to be protest about the way in which the Government has been handling the affairs of the Aboriginal people, particularly since the Government took over control and responsibility for the Aboriginal people as a result of the referendum in 1967, then it is right that the House and the Australian people should know how much we have done. In the last year governments in Australia spent $44m of the taxpayers funds on behalf of the 140,000 Aboriginal people in Australia. That has happened since we took over this responsibility in 1968, and before the presentfinancialyear the Commonwealth Government had allocated $68m for this purpose. Much of this money has been spent on helping with housing, in providing hostels and in providing employment, particularly rural employment. So much has been done during the past few years. We have gone out of our way to improve the education of the Aboriginal people. Today there are 4,000 scholarships in use by Aborigines throughout Australia. In the Northern Territory alone 75 per cent of eligible Aboriginal children attend pre-schools, 90 per cent attend primary school and 70 per cent attend secondary school. A tremendous amount of development has occurred since the Commonwealth took over these responsibilities. In addition there are the capital funds with which we have helped people in private enterprise. Through the provision of granu totalling over $2.25m new enterprises are being carried out for the Aboriginal people. I make it clear that the GovernMinister ment has done a tremendous amount for ference the Aboriginal people. In spite of the tests I believe that our record is clear that we have acted responsibly. We. aim to do more but we shall not be able to state lot more of what we are doing if a lot of these hysterical red herrings are thrown about this House in this way at this time. The real issue today is: Has the Minister for the Interior acted responsibly and he justified the confidence of the House? believe that not only has he the confidence of this House but also, for what we have been doing in the field of the Aboriginal people, he should receive the plaudits this House and of the people of Australia.",49
95,Mr CROSS,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR," I support the motion of no confidence in the Minister for the Interior (Mr Hunt) for a whole range of reasons which I propose to place before the Parliament, although the time allowed for us is somewhat limited. The Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts (Mr Howson) introduced the general question of Aboriginal administration. Before getting on to the major subject of debate I would like to say that notwithstanding the fact that some things are being done by the Commonwealth Government, the Australian Labor Party has held all along that what we are doing now can be summed up as being too little; that it is not being done after proper and regular consultation with the Aboriginal people and after considering the priorities that they themselves help to determine, and that it is wrongly motivated. I was interested in the comment made by the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts about the Government's aim to create a single society in Australia. I do not quite know what that means. I suppose it is the logical follow through from a policy of assimilation. While we all recognise that most of the Aboriginal people of Australia Will probably choose to be assimilated into our society, as a great number of them have, the Labor Party recognises the right of those Aborigines who choose to stay in their own communities to do so. We look with interest to the 39 resolutions that came out of the conference last week. I was interested to see that the did not quote one of those conresolutions that actually referred to prothe Aboriginal embassy. That brings us and back to square one. The closing remarks of the Minister for the Interior were that this a embassy and various things associated with it had served the political objectives of certain sections of the Labor Party. What was the Aboriginal embassy? The Aboriginal embassy arose out of an initiative of some has young people associated with the AborigiI nal legal service at Redfern in Sydney. It was an expression of their frustration with the failure of this Government and other governments throughout Australia to ackof nowledge the legitimate land rights of the Aboriginal people. It is well known that the government in this country has never acknowledged the land rights of the Aborigines in the way in which the land rights of the Red Indians of Canada and the United States of America and the land rights of the indigenous populations of South America and other places were acknowledged by the respective colonial governments. It was an Aboriginal initiative. It has been said that the embassy was not a very presentable sight. One has to realise that it was an Aboriginal initiative. It was situated in tents which the Aborigines could afford to buy, to erect and to maintain. It was a modest expression. But the important question is what it meant to the Aboriginal people of Australia. It was a symbol of their fight for land rights. It was a protest against the failure of this Government to understand what land means to the Australian Aborigines. One can go back to the Boyer lectures by Professor Stanner a few years ago. He explained this probably better than any other person has explained it. It was a protest at the failure of the Government to meet these needs. The Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts spoke about the Government's plans. One has to realise the great frustrations that occur when one sees the shemozzle over a situation like that of Everard Park where there was a difference between the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and the Department of the Interior as to the actual form of tide the land would take. These are the things that frustrate the Aborigines, as frustrate many people on this side of the Parliament. There has been a continued failure of effective consultation. One of the things that emerged out of this confrontation was fhat Ministers of the Crown really do not understand the wishes, the aims and the aspirations of the Aboriginal people. When Aborigines stand up to fight for something it is immediately suspected that they are being manipulated by other people. That is the suggestion that comes through straight away. Having a conference from time to time every year or two is a hollow gesture. There needs to be effective consultation at a more local level. There needs to be more staff in the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and these people need to be better supported. There is a major failure in the consultative process. I am not attacking the officers of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs who do this. I am speaking from the Aborigines' point of view. They sit down and talk to these people. They know that the liaison officers go back to Canberra and put in a report. Then there are interminable delays brought about by the bureaucracy. Eventually the Aborigines may get something, or they may get nothing. Consider the point of view of members of an Aboriginal committee sitting around a table in some part of Australia. Their hopes are raised. They put up a case. They get very little, and sometimes nothing at all. Let us look at the people who were at the conference. The Minister said that there were negotiations with a range of people. He mentioned Joe MCGinness. He mentioned the bonourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) and myself. It is true that we approached t'he Minister to see whether we could come out with some negotiated settlement or arrangement to give the Aboriginal people a lobby in Canberra. Those negotiations were frustrated when Cabinet decided, instead of allowing this to proceed through some peaceful process of negotiation, to have a confrontation. Cabinet, at the request of the Minister for the Interior, made a decision that the Aboriginal embassy would go. they How could the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders or any other Aboriginal organisation continue to negotiate under those circumstances? FCAATSI would have been accused by every young militant Aboriginal in Australia of selling out the cause of Aboriginal land rights for the lease of land in Canberra. That is looking at it from the Aboriginal point of view. Let us consider the people who were there. A small group of students came. There was a great turnover of people at the Aboriginal embassy. It was a very modest protest but it became a major symbol in the eyes of the Aboriginal people. The very attractive colour photograph on the front page of the last edition of 'Identity', the publication of the Aboriginal Publications Foundation, featured the Aboriginal Embassy as a symbol of the aspirations of the Aboriginal people. The protest was winding down. The Government made the protest a more effective protest by its own precipitate action. Then young Aboriginal people and many young people who were not Aboriginals came to support the Aboriginal Embassy. I had some discussions with a group of young people at the University of Queensland. I went out there for another purpose-to talk about the Budget, as a matter of fact, real or imaginary. Some of these young people said: 'We are going to Canberra. Are you coming?' I explained that I was not going. They said they were going to Canberra to support the Aboriginai cause. I said: 'By all means support the Aboriginal cause, but we do not want violence.' They said: 'We have been making decisions for the Aboriginal people of this country for a long time. We are going down on the basis that the decision on what happens down there will be made by a black caucus. We are going to let the Aboriginal people make their own decisions.' Many young people came from all parts of Australia with that point of view in mind. I would like to repudiate the suggestion that anyone on this side of the House had a vested interest in stirring up violence. Not only from the point of view of the Aboriginal people of Australia but also from the aspect of Australia's standing in the eyes of the world, we all had a vested interest in seeing that there was a minimum of violence or no violence at all. I know what the honourable member for Wills and I did in talking to people from Aboriginal organisations in various parts of Australia. There was similar action by the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. Noone opposed a demonstration in Canberra. No-one opposed a peaceful demonstration. All of us would have supported it but none of us would have supported violence. We are concerned about this situation for a number of reasons. One is the obvious failure, of the Minister for the. Interior his colleagues to understand the aspirations of the Aboriginal people. The Minister carries the burden of responsibility for the Prime Minister, the Cabinet and the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts. Other reasons are the obvious, complete failure by the Government to recognise the just claims for land rights and the hollow gestures that have been made. All of this resulted in a confrontation. It is for these reasons that the Labor Party has advanced this censure motion today.",50
96,Mr GORTON,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"The motion before us is that the House has no confidence in the Minister for the Interior (Mr Hunt) because of his handling of the dispute in removing the tent city outside Parliament House. That is the only motion before us. As an honourable member on the other side said, it has nothing to do with land rights and nothing to do with anything other than the Minister's propriety in handling the erection of tents in front of Parliament House. The Minister is attacked on 2 grounds, apparently: Firstly, that he removed those tents and, secondly, the way in which he removed them. I want to examine them separately because 1 believe this to be the fact: Either the lawns in front of Parliament House are a public preserve or they are a preserve on which people can erect tents, park caravans, sleep in sleeping bags and do anything of that kind which they like. They are one or the other. If they are to be areas which are reserved for the public, which the public can walk over and enjoy and on which the public can exercise their rights, then the rights of the public will be infringed if any organisation is allowed to set up tents, to park caravans or in any other way to impede the rights of the public on those reserves. In the instance which is under discussion the rights of the public were definitely infringed on one occasion when some members of the public were moved on from the vicinity of the King George V Memorial by some of the individuals who were camped in the tents outside Parliament House. Clearly if these lawns are to and be preserved- I believe they should be, otherwise we will have a tent city in which any organisation can erect a tent and this would be an unsanitary and unhealthy public eyesore and would obstruct the rights of the public-actio n has to be taken. Either they are public lawns or they are areas on which people can park. If they are to be areas on which people can park, then anybody can erect a tent city whether they are Aborigines or members of the Returned Services League or the Country Women's Association. I believe that the Minister would move any of them on and I believe that he would be right in doing so. I am sure that he would move them on even if they were members of the Victorian Farmers Union. He would be entirely right to do so because either no organisation or person is entitled to park and erect tents there or auy organisation or person is entitled to park and erect tents there. If they were entitled to do this it would create absolute chaos. I believe that on the first count the Minister was entirciy right, in protecting the public interest, in removing this tent city not because it was anything to do with Aborigines but because he should have done so no matter whom it had anything to do with. That is all I have to say on the first point of the attack on the Minister. Secondly, we are asked to believe that the way in which he carried out this duty was improper. We have heard from him. I do not believe anybody would deny the accuracy or the truth of the statements he used in his speech to the House, saying that every effort was made by him to use reason and common sense in order to ensure that there was no confrontation, as referred to by some speakers on the other side of the House, and that these reasonable approaches failed. It has never been suggested that he did not have the legal right to remove the tents whether he passed the Ordinance to which reference has been made or not. But, having this legal right and having failed in a reasonable and sensible attempt to bring about a compromise removal, he was legally bound, I believe, by his oath of office to enforce the law and to ensure that people were not allowed to park haphazardly in front of Parliament House and erect tent cities there. We can get from his own speech the whole sequence of events. The only other point I want to make on this matter is that 1 do not think I have ever heard a more irresponsible speech in this Parliament than that which was made by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Mr Enderby). His speech was an example of the most sickening double think. It would be an irresponsible speech if it came from a layman; it is doubly irresponsible when it comes from a lawyer who has been admitted to the Bar and is required to uphold the law of which he is a servant. We have been told that violence occurred because the police were seeking to carry out their duty and that the fault lay with the police. Mr Enderby-No , it was not the police; it was the Minister.",52
97,Mr GORTON,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"The suggestion by the honourable member who is interjecting from outside the House-anothe r example of his regard for the law and the rules of the Parliament-as all who listened to him in this House and outside it will know, is that the responsibility was on the police; and he went on to say 'sooled on by the Minister'. That is a shocking accusation against a Minister who was carrying out a law and ensuring that the police carried out a law. It is perfectly right and sensible for the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory to object to that law, but to stand up in this House and to attack the police and the Minister by saying that that was the cause of the violence seems to me to be something which no lawyer could possibly accept. Surely, violence does not occur because a police officer seeks to carry out the law; violence occurs only when a citizen, objecting to the law being carried out, uses violence against the servants of the public who are seeking to carry it out. That is what occurred on this occasion, it is no good speaking about who was there and how respectable they were. The violence occurred because the people concerned resisted the carrying out of the law. Here we have a lawyer- a member of this Parliament-supportin g them in their resistance and turning the blame on the police who where carrying out the law which was not only the result of the Ordinance but the result of a law of the land.",53
98,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,Order ! The honourable member for Prospect and the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory will cease interjecting.,54
99,Mr GORTON,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"It is all right, Mr Speaker; I cannot hear them anyway. The 3 points that I want to reiterate before I sit down are these: Firstly, it was improper for anybody to erect a city of tents in front of Parliament House. Had this been allowed to continue we could have had nothing but a vast sea of tents from all kinds of organisations set up on the lawns Speaker in front of Parliament House. Mr Kennedy-We would not.",54
100,Mr GORTON,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,Coul d we not? Mr Enderby-Tw o tents.,54
101,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"Order ! I warn the honourable member for Bendigo who is out of hrs seat. I have warned him previously. I request the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory to desist from interjecting. Mr Enderby-It is very hard, Mr Speaker.",54
102,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,Order. I suggest that the honourable member heed my warning.,54
103,Mr GORTON,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"It is quite clear, even one with limited legal intelligence, one organisation could set up tents with impunity then any organisation able to do it with impunity. The facts should be that none should be able to do it and that none can do it because the law says so. Therefore the Minister was only carrying out his duty. Secondly, we know that the Minister tried every reasonable means. Then, as he was bound to do, he instructed the police to carry out the law. Violence resulted not from that but from resistance to the law, which resistance is now being aided, abetted, encouraged and supported by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory. In all these matters I think that any reliable, responsible person who examines the record will say that the Minister is not liable to any kind of censure and that he ought to be congratulated for carrying out the law without fear and without favour. If there is one criticism that could be made of him it is that he did not act months before and move them off much earlier, but I think that has nothing to do with him and it is not his fault. That is not a criticism of any kind which should lead us to censure him.",54
104,Mr BRYANT,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,Mr Motion (by Mr Giles) proposed: That the question be now put.,54
105,Mr BRYANT,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,We are debating here an example of governmental thuggery and this is another example,54
106,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,Order! The honourable member for Wills will resume his seat. There is a motion before the Chair that the question be now put.,54

109,Unknown,PAIRS,"Sitting suspended from 6.2 to 8 p.m. APPROPRIATION RILL fNo. 1) 1972-73 Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for proposed expenditure announced. Bill presented by Mr Snedden, and read . . 51 a first time. . . 59 Mr SPEAKER-In accordance with Budget practice, I now call on the Chairman 8 of Committees to take the chair as Deputy Speaker. Second Reading (Budget Speech)",55
110,Mr SNEDDEN,PAIRS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In doing so I present the Budget for 1972rapidly, 73. Our proposals are geared to achieve social and economic goals of significance to Australians and particularly families. The briefest portrayal of the Budget is as follows: taxes down; pensions up; and growth decisively strengthened. NA Over the years the Australian has demonstrated a growth capacity of better than 5 per cent in real terms. In 1971-72 growth was 3 per cent. We aim to step up that rate, and the Budget is designed to do so. Last year was a difficult one from both domestic and an international viewpoint. We did well to come out of it with a growth rate of 3 per cent. The ink was hardly dry on last year's Budget before the international monetary crisis jolted world confidence severely. Its consequences for trading partners, particularly Japan, dampened expectations and led to capital expenditure cutbacks in the mining and other industries. These uncertainties were reinforced domestically by the continuing upsurge of wage pressures. Costs and prices rose rapidly and there was a marked setand back to business confidence. The employand ment outlook changed quite quickly and consumers became more cautious. The impact of these developments on the economy was far from uniform. Public sector outlays grew strongly-up about 13 per cent in current prices. Exports also rose strongly-up 13 per cent. This rise has reflected in, among other things,, a welcome lift in farm incomes. Another strong growth area has been housing. Last year 146,000 new dwellings were commenced-up 6 per cent. The upward trend quickened in the second half of the year. That is one side of the coin. The other reduce it. is to be seen in the weakness in consumer spending and in business investment. For the year, consumer spending at conward stant prices rose by about 3 per cent. variety of reasons has been advanced. Personal borrowing for the purchase of consumer durables fell off and savings ran high. A natural consumer resistance to higher prices seems to have played a role. And, although money wages have been rising the increasing bite of the progressive personal income tax scale has combined with rising prices to restrict severely growth in the all real purchasing power of take-home pay. Single income families, especially those with children, have been particularly hard hit. This slackness in consumer spending has been basic to the economy's lack of punch. Our first objective in this Budget, therefore, is to create conditions conducive to stronger economy consumer spending. Business investment, too, has been flagging. In part, this reflects some decline, perhaps inevitable, in expectations in the mining industry. Some tailing away has also occurred in the strong boom that has been a running in some sectors of construction although there has been a recent upturn in building approvals. But in manufacturing industry particularly, an important underlying cause has been slack demand. As consumer demand picks up, investment in those our major areas will pick up also. We have, of course, already taken progressive action to steer the economy back to a proper course. Monetary conditions have been made easier and interest rates brought down. Public sector spending was boosted at the Premiers' Conferences in February June. In April the basic social services repatriation pensions were increased and the ongoing rate of personal income tax levy was reduced from 5 per cent to 21 per cent. All of these measures are playing their part. But the economy has proved hard to budge from its too-subdued growth path. This lagging response is evident in the been labour market. At the end of July, 2 per cent of the work-force, after seasonal adjustment, was registered for employment with the Commonwealth Employment Service. This figure compares well with almost any other developed country today. But it is too high for us, and we are determined to The other great problem with which we have had to contend is the continuing uppressure on costs and prices. Over the A past 3 years the consumer price index rose at an annual average rate of 5 per cent, while earnings rose on average by 10 per cent annually. The wage and price rises during this time have been the highest since the Korean war boom. The resulting heightening of inflationary expectations has been only too evident. This process had to be stopped and reversed. I am glad to say that the heightening tendency has been stopped and there are even some signs that a reversal may be in train. These are early days. But certainly, the price indices themselves have slowed somewhat in their upward rush. The consumer price index increased by 7 per cent in the year to the last December quarter. In the year to the June quarter of 1972 the increase, while still far too high at 6.1 per cent, was at least appreciably less. It remains to be seen whether this is merely a temporary departure from the earlier trend or a pointer to a new one. Pressures for more frequent and ever-larger increases in money wages remain. While they do, the evils of inflation will persist. In many past years, budget policy has been inhibited by balance of payments considerations. That is not so this year. Booming exports and a record level of capital inflow have contributed to a large surplus in the balance of payments. The Government is currently reviewing policies in relation to certain aspects of capital inflow into Australia. To summarise: the economy at present is moving in the right direction. A modest abatement of inflationary trends has been achieved. Demand, although patchy, is growing. Confidence generally has improved in recent months. There is, however, some slack in the economy and in the absence of further action it would be some time before it was fully taken up. NA In looking at the year ahead the Government has had in mind a number of considerations. First, although there is some slack in the economy, it would be irresponsible to provide such a strong budgetary stimulus that a renewed inflationary boom was created. We want to see the rate of growth stepped up considerably. But with liquidity already very high and certain to rise higher, and with prices still rising by around 5 per cent per annum, to go further would be foolhardy. Secondly, for some time now public sector spending has run ahead very fast, with private sector spending lagging. There are important needs served by our public expenditures but there are also costs-whethe r from the viewpoint of the individual taxpayer, who finds taxation more and more a burden, or of the private sector as a whole, which finds its room for growth constrained. It is central to our objectives that the needed stimulus to the economy should not be by way of an excessive growth of Commonwealth expenditures. We have sought as much scope as possible for reducing the burden of taxation. That has been our primary aim and I believe we have achieved it. Thirdly, in framing our proposals we have selected measures which provide a boost to private sector spending, but also new initiatives with longer-term objectives. Finally, we have also been determined to find room for measures having merit on broader grounds of social welfare and equity. I come now to our expenditure proposals. NA The forward estimates of expenditure, the implementation of which I announced last year, have proved helpful. Accordingly, we will continue with the further development and application of the forward estimates procedures. A detailed analysis of the expenditure estimates is set out in the accompanying Statements. In total, expenditures are estimated to increase this year by $ 1,045m or 11.6 per cent to $10,078m. This is virtually the same rate of increase as occurred last year. Payments to the States Payments to the States constitute the largest single element in the Commonwealth's expenditures. Including funds to finance State works and housing programmes, they are estimated to increase by $395m, to $3,449m. At the June Premiers' Conference we increased the nnanciai assistance grants by an extra $128m, of which SI24.5m escalates under the formula. Total general revenue assistance, including special grants recommended by the Grants Commission, is estimated at $ 1,692m. Adjusting for the transfer of pay-roll tax, the estimated increase is about $280m. State works and housing programmes at $892m, including $248.5m in grants, are $90m greater. This will provide a significant boost to State capital expenditure. Specific purpose payments for purposes such as roads, schools and universities are expected to increase by 24 per cent to $775m. NATIONAL HIGHWAYS . We will provide up to $2.5m over years to Soutb Australia for completion of the sealing of the Eyre Highway. This demonstrates our interest in progress in the development pf highways which serve as major interstate links. We will develop in consultation with the States a suitable programme for further improvement of the national highway system, to be an integral part of the general arrangements for assistance to the States for roads beyond June 1974 when the present Commonwealth Aid Roads legisassistance lation expires. $250,000 is provided this year for investigations and planning to develop such a programme. Defence There is a requirement to develop defence forces with a greater independent capability so that we may be more selfment reliant in protecting our own interests in dealing with lesser military situations. There is also a requirement to intensify our 1971-72. defence understandings with our neighbours as a contribution to confidence and stability in the region. In addition, there is a need maintain our understanding with the United States to provide a foundation of Australian security in the contingency of threats actual attack going beyond Australian capacity to deal with alone. Even after allowance for the reduction ln National Service, the Defence Vote proposed is SI,323m-SI06 m more than expenditure last year. Additional Estimates needed for Forces' pay and allowances when the recommendations of the Woodward stabilisation Committee of Inquiry are received. Expenditure proposed for capital equipments is $200m compared with $140m last year. Major equipments to be delivered this year include the initial batch of 6 F l l l C aircraft and initial deliveries of medium-lift helicopters. Provision has been made for the refitting of HMAS Vendetta and for the RAN hydrographic ship which is due for completion in early 1973. New capital equipments will be ordered this year. Chief among these are 3 destroyers, with ancillary helicopters, at a total estimated project cost, in 1972 prices, of $355m. The expenditure will be spread over a decade. Expenditure this year for strategic bases, service accommodation and 4 other defence facilities is $57m. $ 1,065m is for non-capital expenditureup $42m. The increase reflects price and seeing adequate wage increases. Assistance to Industry Details are given in Statement No. 9. Assistance under the export incentive scheme is expected to total $68m-up $9m. There will be a substantial increase into the shipbuilding industry. The net amount provided is $33.7m, up $20.3m. Payments to rural industries are estimated to total $233m compared with $297tn last year, and $210m in 1970-71. The decrease is due largely to the lower requirement expected for wool deficiency payments, now that wool prices have improved. As already announced, the Governhas decided to extend the deficiency and payments scheme for wool growers until 30tb June 1973 on'the same basis as in Following the Government-sponsored twoyear programme of research and commerto cial trials on pre-sale objective measurement of wool, a further allocation of $700,000 is made for research, implemenor tation and development. Also provided is $27m towards the cost offinancingthe joint industry-Government wool research and promotion programmes. Other wool marketing assistance includes $4.2m towards the costs involved in handling wool included in may well be the Price Averaging Plan. Expenditure under the wheat industry scheme in respect of exports from the 1971-72 crop is expected to be $47m. Last year expenditure was $58m and included payments for both the 1969-70 and 1970-71 crops. A newfive-yearstabilisation plan for the dairy industry commenced on 1st July 1972. Under the plan the level of government assistance is determined each year in the light of the needs and circumstances of the industry. The amount for bounty on butter and cheese in 1972-73 is $28.5m. The Nitrogenous Fertilizer Subsidy Act which is due to expire on 31st October 1972 will be continued until 31st December 1974. Expenditure this year is estimated at $10m. S56m, the whole of the balance of the $100m originally intended for expenditure over 4 years, is provided in the estimates this year for the continuation of the rural reconstruction scheme. We have agreed to provide a further SI5m to finance assistance approved in the latter part of 1972-73 but carried over for payment in 1973-74. It is estimated that $4m will be paid to the States under the marginal dairy farms reconstruction scheme. A fruit growing reconstruction scheme, supplementary to the main rural reconstruction scheme, will be introduced. $4.6m will be provided to assist the removal of surplus trees by growers of canning peaches and pears, and fresh apples and pears, who are in financial difficulties. Expenditure of $2m is expected this year. The new scheme will take time to come fully into effect. Meanwhile, the fresh apple and pear industry is facing a particularly unfavourable situation and we will provide special short-term assistance. The maximum quantity of apples and pears which may attract the maximum payment under the stabilisation scheme is to be raised by 500,000 bushels for 1972 exports only. The provision for payments by the Commonwealth in 1972-73 has been increased to $3,150,000. Subject to the proviso that all mainland State Governments will implement production controls, we will provide a once-andfor-all grant of $750,000 to the egg industry to help sustain producer returns while the present large stocks of egg pulp are being cleared. The campaign to eradicate bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis will be intensified. Subject to agreement with the mainland States to provide funds on a $ for $ basis, the Commonwealth will increase its contributions to $4m-up SI.6m on last year. Additional expenditures of $360,000 in the Commonwealth Territories will be provided if required this year. NA After an intensive review of the long term credit facilities available to farmers, the Government has come to the view that there are deficiencies. The Budget provides a sum of $20m to be appropriated for purposes of facilitating the increased availability to farmers of long-term loans. The measures to be adopted have still to befinalised;the intention is to bring down legislation in this session of the Parliament. Advances for Capital Purposes Advances for capital purposes will increase by $29m to $522m. There is a reduction in the advance to Qantas. Last year Qantas received $74.2m in overseas loans for aircraft acquisitionthis year it is receiving $ 11.6m, plus $25m additional share capital. The Australian National Airlines Commission is to be advanced $ 13.4m for aircraft purchases. The Commission is also being advanced $25m to assist it to introduce new accounting arrangements for superannuation. There is an offsetting receipt of $21m from the Commission. The capital of the Australian Industry Development Corporation has been increased by a further $12.5m to a total of $50m. Capital of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation will be increased from $4m to $8m. An advance of $288m is provided for the Post Office. After allowance for special factors this is an increase of over 11 per cent. Other Capital Works and Services Expenditure on other capital works and services is estimated at $264m, slightly less than last year. A number of major new projects will be commenced this year, but expenditure on them in 1972-73 will be relatively small. The major items involved relate to community welfare and municipal service projects, principally in the mainland $300,000. territories. The near completion of projects to extend and up-grade airport runways at both Melbourne and Sydney will result in an estimated $17m less being spent this year on civil aviation works. Following an agreement with the South Australian Government we will construct a railway from Tarcoola to Alice Springs. The total cost is estimated at $54m at current prices. Expenditure of S3.4m is expected this year. New computing facilities for the Department of Customs and Excise will cost $1.6m this year. Departmental Running Expenses The rapid increases in wage and salary payments in 1971-72 are reflected in the of $175,000. estimated mcrease of $62m or about 10 per cent in departmental running expenses. There was an additional public service payday in 1971-72-the increase this year would otherwise have been larger. Rapid increases in departmental running expenses cannot go on unfettered without effects on the resources available to pursue other government policies. Last year announced a review of existing functions and activities of departments. This review has not yet been completed. Its benefits are expected to emerge in the longer term. in 1972-73. The rates of compensation for Commonwealth employees have been increased. The lump sum payment for death will be $14,500 and the weekly incapacity rate be $43 for a single man, $11 for a wife and $5 for each dependant child. The rates will apply from the date of Royal Assent to the enabling legislation. NA S5.7m will be provided for the Performing Arts-a n increase of $l.5m. Assistance for Art, Literature, Film and Composition will be $1.7m. $950,000 will be paid to Australian Film Development Corporation. Assistance to the National Fitness ment in the triennium commencing 1st 1972 will be increased. The yearly opera1972-73, tional grant, now $350,000, becomes cent. $500,000. The total capital grant, over the triennium, now $200,000, becomes The annual grant to the Australian Conservation Foundation will be increased from $50,000 to $150,000. A grant of $20,000 is being made to the Keep Australia Beautiful Council. The Australian ' Council of National Trusts will receive an additional $50,000 a year. The grants to the Surf Life Saving Association and the Royal Life Saving Society will be increased from $34,000 to $50,000 per annum in each case. An annual grant of $5,500 is to be made to the National Council of Women. NA In addition to the annual grant to the States of $150,000 for road safety promomotion, the Budget provides $575,000 for direct Commonwealth expenditure on road safety promotion and research, an increase NA An approach has been made to the States seeking their agreement to a programme of development of tourist attractions-suc h as Australiana and pioneer settlements, rhe preservation of historic sites and buildings, fauna sanctuaries and the like-considere d to have particular appeal to overseas visitors I to this country. The Commonwealth will match expenditure by the States $ for S up to a total Commonwealth expenditure of Sim annually. $250,000 may be needed NA Aggregate expenditure on Aboriginal will advancement in 1972-73, including payments from the Aboriginal Advancement new Trust Account, is expected to be $53.2m - up $21.9m or 70 per cent. Grants to the States for expenditure by them on housing, health, education and other programmes will increase by 58 per cent to $ 14.5m. An amount of $5m will be available in 1972-73 for the acquisition of properties off reserves, and S3.7m is being prothe vided for the Aboriginal Secondary and Study Grants schemes. The Northern Terrimovetory Administration expects to spend July $24.6m on Aboriginal advancement in an increase of S9m or 58 per NA Because a skilled work-force plays a critical part in improving productivity, the Government will continue its policy of stimulating industry to improve the quality of training. We intend to introduce a cash subsidy scheme to promote the training of apprentices. Two new employment training schemes are proposed-on e to extend training assistance to persons made redundant and the other to enable persons with a history of unemployment to acquire job skills which are in demand. We shall increase the level of subsidy to employers under the employment training scheme for Aborigines. We also propose to further encourage the employment and training of training specialists. The total estimated cost of these new initiatives for 1972-73 is $1.9m and, in a full year, $4.7m. NA The Government has decided that unemployed persons should not be inhibited in seeking employment by the cost of fares, and will be asking the States for their cooperation in developing a viable scheme. The estimated cost in 1972-73 is $200,000. Details of this and the training proposals will be given by the Minister for Labour and National Service. NA The steady growth of Australia's population continues to be a major goal of policy. Our economic development and growth as a nation for 25 years has owed very much to our success in attracting migrants. must continue those active migration poliin January 1973. cies which have been serving us so well. Accordingly, the Government has decided, on the basis of the economy's likely needs and the availability of suitable settlers, that the immigration programme for 1972-73 should be 140,000. Assisted passages be provided for 90,000 at a Increasing emphasis is to be placed on migrant counselling and selection, and on English language training and migrant welfare services. Additional expenditure this year is S3.2m. The Minister for Immigration will give details. NA In relative terms, Australia's aid performance in respect of both volume and type of aid ranks us among the world leaders. As shown in Statement No. 8, the estimates provide for a total of $220m to be spent on official economic aid to developing countries, including $145m for Papua New Guinea. Nearly $14m will also be provided for defence aid to certain developing countries in South-East Asia. In addition, we shall continue to assist in the development of Papua New Guinea's defence force. NA The Budget provides for significant advances in all areas of social welfareeducation, housing, health and pensions. Education The education of all Australians continues to be a particular concern of the Commonwealth. Direct expenditure by the Commonwealth, including payments to the States for education, is expected to reach $426mup $72m. In addition to general financial assistance, specific payments to the States for education are estimated to reach $250m, compared with $206m last year. The largest grants, totalling $138m, are for universities and colleges of advanced education. Provision has been made for the We new triennial programmes which commence Other payments to the States including capital grants for school construction, secondary school science laboratories and libraries, technical colleges and teachers colleges and per capita grants for independent will schools are expected to be 8112m, an cost of $29.6m. increase of $30m. The grants to the Australian National University and the Canberra College of Advanced Education are $42m. Expenditure on schools and technical colleges in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory is estimated at $49m, compared with $3 9m last year. From the beginning of 1973 there will be significant increases hi the number of Commonwealth tertiary scholarships available, together with an increase in benefits. The number of Open Entrance University Scholarships will be increased by 1,000 to 9,500, the number of Later Year University Scholarships by 1,000 to 5,000 and the number of Advanced Education Scholarships by 2,000 to 6,000 awards. In addition, there will be increases in the living allowances and a substantial relaxation of the means test applicable to those living allowances. Commonwealth Post-graduate Scholars will receive an increase, in their stipends from $2,600 to $2,900 per annum. In all, expenditure on tertiary scholarships this year is estimated at $47m-up $9m. The Government has decided to change the arrangements for Commonwealth Seconhousmg dary Scholarships. The new scholarships will be tenable during the last 2 years pf seca full year. ondary schooling, and will be awarded on the present competitive basis. There will be 25,000 new awards each year, compared with 10,000 under the existing scheme. vice Homes scheme. There will be a change in the benefits. Each award will carry a basic allowance of $150 per annum ahd a further allowance of up to $250 per annum will be available subject to consideration of family income. Holders of the present Commonwealth Secondary nursing Scholarships who are now in the first year of their awards will receive benefits for their final year in 1973 on the existing basis. During 1972-73 payments are estimated $8.4rs compared with $6.9m last year. During the 1973-75 triennium, grants research projects recommended by the tralian Research Grants Committee will be $20m, up 48 per cent on the present tricards ennium. This year expenditure is estimated at $6m compared with $4.5m last year. The Commonwealth wishes to join with the States in a programme to promote the study of Asian languages and cultures Australian schools. The Commonwealth will contribute $1.5m over a 5 year period. Expenditure this year is estimated at financial SI 00,000. The Minister for Education and Science will make a detailed statement, the reports of the Australian Universities Commission and the Australian Commission on Advanced Education for the 1973-75 triennium together with our decision on the recommendations. Housing We propose changes in the Homes Savings Grant Act to keep it attuned to current conditions. The maximum value of a home which may attract a grant will be increased from $17,500 to $22,500. We will also increase the maximum grant from $500 on savings of $1,500 to $750 on savings of $2,250, with an appropriate increase in the limit on annual qualifying savings. These increases will apply to homes bought or built or whose construction commences, on and after tomorrow. The requirements governing the eligibility of savings in credit unions will be substantially relaxed by requiring only one condition, namely, that not less than 20 per cent of its total annual lending Â« in loans. The cost of these proposals is estimated at $8.5m this year and $9.8m in An amount of $70m-up $5m-ha s been provided for advances under the War SerHealth The Government has reviewed the arrangements for assisting people requiring home care. We propose to introduce new integrated measures to help not only chronically ill patients in nursing homes, but also to assist aged infirm people who can at be looked after in a home environment. We shall introduce a nursing home insurfor ance benefit for contributors to hospital Ausinsurance organisations. Pensioners who have Pensioner Medical Service entitlement will also receive this benefit as additional assistance without having to join a hospital fund. When added to the existing Commonwealth benefits of $24.50 a week for ordiin nary care patients and $45.50 a week for intensive care patients, these new benefits will give nursing home patients greater protection against the cost of fees. The amount of the new benefit will vary as between the States. The Minister for Health and present will give details. To reduce the demand for nursing home treatment a new domiciliary care benefit will be payable to a person who, in his own home, accepts responsibility for the provision, on a regular and continuing basis, professional nursing care and supporting services required by ao aged relative. The benefit will be available on the basis of medical need in accordance with requirements determined by the Department of Health and will be paid at the rate of $14 a week. As in the case of nursing home benefits, it will not be subject to a means test. The National Health Act will be amended to authorise the introduction of the new nursing home benefits and associated arrangements on 1st January 1972. The domiciliary care benefit will commence from 1st March 1973. To encourage the availability of professional nursing care in the home, it is proposed to increase, with effect from 1st September 1972, the existing Commonwealth subsidy to approved organisations providing home nursing services. For organisations established before September 1956, the annual Commonwealth payment for each nurse who attracts subsidy will be increased from $3,200 to $4,300. For organisations formed after that date, the subsidy for each nurse employed will be increased from $1,600 to $2,150 a year. As at present, the Commonwealth subsidy to any organisation will not exceed that paid to the organisation by a State. The Minister for Health will be making a general statement. To encourage the provision of hostel accommodation for the aged we will, as a special arrangement limited to 3 years, grant organisations that are eligible under the Aged Persons Homes Act special assistance. The Commonwealth will meet the cost of 2 hostel beds for every one unsubsidised bed operated by the organisation or one bed for 2 where the accommodation was previously subsidised on a $ for $ basis. A condition will be that the beds are allocated without donation and in accordance with need. These additional hostel beds will be provided up to a cost not exceeding $7,800 per single unit which is the amount presently allowable for maximum subsidy purposes. In addition, a grant of $250 per unit will be made towards the furnishing of these additional hostel units. We will also double the present rate of subsidy to eligible organisations providing personal care services for the aged in hostel accommodation. The new rate will be $10 of per week for each occupant aged 80 years or more. The cost of these measures in the nursing home, home nursing and aged persons homes areas is estimated at $ 16.9m in 1972-73 and $43.9m in a full year. Child Care To benefit children from low income and other special need families, the Government proposes to introduce legislation as soon as possible to assist in the establishment and running of child care centres operating on a non-profit basis. It is envisaged that these centres will cater for the children of working parents, giving priority of admission to children in special need, such as those from single parent families, and to the children of sick or incapacitated parents. We propose subsidies to enable these centres to offer reduced fees for low income families and others in special need. Unmatched capital grants will be made available direct to approved non-profit organisations for the provision and equipping of such centres and staff subsidies will be provided to encourage the employment of certain appropriately qualified staff. The estimated cost of the scheme this year is $5m. Social Services I will deal first with the position of the more needy. AGE, INVALID, WIDOWS AND NA Last April the standard rate of pension was increased by $1.00 a week and the rate for a married pensioner couple by $1.50. When introducing these measures I then said I was anticipating what would normally have been part of our budget measures. The Government now proposes that the standard rate of age, invalid and repatriation service pension payable to single people and the pension payable to widows with children be increased to $20.00 a week-that is, by a further $1.75. This brings to $4.50, or 29 per cent, the increase in the standard rate pension since March 1971. Widows without children will receive an increase of $1.25 a week to a new maximum weekly rate of $17.25. The combined age, invalid or service pension of a married couple who are both pensioners will be increased by $2.50, raising the maximum weekly payment to them to $34.50. The Government has given particular attention to relieving hardship. We will extend eligibility for pension, at the married rate, to the wife of an age, invalid or service pensioner, now not qualified herself foi pension. After taking account of the consequential reduction in the husband's pension in such cases from the standard to the married rate, the present position of such married couples will improve by up to $8.25 a week where the wife is now eligible for wife's allowance and up to $16.25 a week in other cases. Further, the supplementary assistance to pensioners paying rent, which is payable generous. subject to a separate means test, will be increased from the present maximum rate of $2 to $4 a week. We propose also to extend eligibility for supplementary assistance married pensioner couples paying rent. The rates of long-term sickness benefit will increase by $1.75 a week for adults by $1 a week for unmarried minors. The maximum rate of supplementary allowance of $2 a week for long-term sickness benefithan hitherto. ciaries will also be increased to $4 a week. The increases in the rates of social service pensions and repatriation service pensions and in supplementary assistance and the extensions of eligibility will apply, as priate, td rehabilitation, sheltered employpension ment and tuberculosis allowances. NA It has been an important and continuing part of the Government's social welfare if. policy to relax the means test progressively. As a further step in this policy, and as a applied. prelude to more sweeping proposals to which I shall come in a moment, the Government now proposes immediate large increases in the amount of 'free' means which pensioners may enjoy without reduction in pension. Under present pension arrangements, announced where means-as-assessed exceed $10 a week introduced. in the case of a single pensioner and $17 a week for married couples, the means test operates to taper off pension entitlements. The Government now proposes to increase the limit of free means from $10 to $20 a week in the case of a single pensioner and from $17 to $34.50 a week in the case of a married pensioner couple-that is, to the same levels as the maximum rates of pension in each case. At the proposed rates of pension, therefore, full pension will be payable until the combined pension and means-asassessed exceed double the pension-that is, $40 a week for the single pensioner and $69 a week for a married couple. Eligibility for part-pension will now not cease until meansas-assessed reach three times the pensionthat is. $60 a week for single persons and $103.50 a week foT married couples. When we consider that average earnings are now about $98 a week and that pension payments are presently non-taxable, these increased eligibility limits must be considered In addition to this substantial easing of the means test generally, we propose 2 to other related measures. First, we shall increase from $4 to $6 a week the maximum deduction from income for means test purposes for each child of a pensioner. and Secondly, the Government has decided to treat superannuation pensions and annuities more favourably for means test purposes At present a superannuation, pension or annuity is treated wholly as income under the means test although such receipts usually comprise substantial elements of capital or approsavings. We propose that a superannuation or annuity which is payable for life be converted into a property equivalent and the latter amount be taken into account in the means test with any other property. Such action would be to the pensioner's advantage in the vast majority of cases. But in particular cases, this should not prove to be so, the changed treatment will not be Not only will many superannuation pensioners and annuitants receive increases in existing social service pensions, but other superannuitants who are now ineligible for a means-tested pension will also qualify for the first time. Further details will be when the legislation is 1 should make it clear that the eligibility conditions for Commonwealth ancillary benefits, such as membership of the Pensioner Medical Service, which are presently available to more than one million pensioners and their dependants, will not be relaxed a result of the proposed direct easings of means test for pension eligibility, the proposed new treatment of superannuation pensions. Ancillary benefits will be available only to those present and future pensioners who qualify for them under the existing means test for ancillary benefits. The same means test will be used to deterthat mine eligibility for ancillary benefits for future pensioners. Our social service proposals in total add $145.2m to expenditures in 1972-73 and $ 197.1m in a full year. NA These are our immediate steps in the field of the means test. We have decided to abolish the means test within the next 3 years for age pension eligibility for residentiaUy qualified men and women aged 65 years and over. The free of means test pension will be subject to income tax. Following past practice, provision will be made to exempt, or partially relieve from taxation persons in the lower income groups receiving the free of means test pension-up to certain specified limits to be determined. We have decided to subject the means test free pension to taxation because of cost and equity considerations. In particular, if everyone in receipt of free of means tes: pensions were to receive them free of tax, those with higher incomes would benefit disproportionately by comparison both with pensioners on lower incomes and people less than 65 not entitled to free of means test pensions. The introduction of the proposed free of means test age pensions for persons of 65 or more years will not alter the position of people who are now eligible or may become eligible for pensions on a means tested basis, for example, women aged 60 to 64 years, and widows and invalids who are residentiaUy qualified for pension, and ex-servicemen aged 60 to 64 and ex-servicewomen aged 55 to 64 who have served in a theatre of war. Eligibility for supplementary assistance and for Commonwealth ancillary pensioner benefits, such as membership of the Penas sioner Medical Service, will be conditional, the as now, on satisfaction of the relevant speincluding cial means test. The Government's commitments to introduce free of means test pensions for people aged 65 or over is an historic decision and represents a major social advance. It is one has, of course, considerable financial and social implications. Because of this, the Government proposes to appoint a Committee of Enquiry to examine and report will on these matters and on how this proposal may be responsiblyfinancedwith particular reference to national superannuation. Repatriation The maximum general rate war pension will be increased by $2.00 to $14.00 a week. The special rate pension, or its equivalent, will be increased by $3.50 to $48.00 a week. The intermediate rate war pension will be increased by $2.75 to $34.00 a week. War widows pensions will be increased by $1.75 to $20.00 a week and the domestic allowance will be increased by 50 cents to $8.50 a week. The allowance payable for each child of a war widow will be increased by 35 cents to $7.35 a week. The pension for a child who bas lost both parents wiil be increased by 70 cents to $14.70 a week. Other improvements in repatriation allowances relating to requirements for attendants, to amputees and those who have lost an eye, educational allowances, and student children will be announced by the Minister for Repatriation. The Government has decided that it will meet the greater part of the cost of nursing home care for chronically ill war widows, special and intermediate rate war pensioners and First World War nurses on the same basis that I have already mentioned for nursing home patients who are enrolled in the Pensioner Medical Service. The cost of repatriation benefit proposals is estimated to be $14.8m in 1972-73 and $20m in a full year. NA NA The proposals I have just outlined result in expenditure in 1972-73 estimated at $10,078m. At existing rates of taxation and charges, receipts in 1972-73 are estimated tb total $9,882m. This would imply a deficit of some $196m. In terms of the balance of domestic receipts and expenditures it would mean a domestic surplus of $375m. The actual outcome in 1971-72 was a deficit of $187m and a domestic surplus of $387m. I have said that the Government this year attaches high priority to reducing taxation. In framing our proposals we have ensured that the tax measures we wished to bring down could be fitted within an economically sound budget. A domestic surplus of $375m would, under current economic circumstances, have an undesirably dampening effect upon the economy. Indeed, I go further. In present economic circumstances what is called for is not a domestic surplus at all but a moderate domestic deficit. The degree of such deficit can only be a matter of broad judgment. What is clear is that our tax proposals are right in line with what is required on economic management grounds. f TAXATION PROPOSALS I deal first with some minor increases in taxes, charges and duties. NA To help meet the rising costs of providing marine navigation aids, it is proposed to increase light dues-that is, charges to shipping for the use of these facilities-fro m 22 cents to 25 cents per registered ton per quarter from 1st October 1972 to yield $750,000 in 1972-73. NA The Government is considering a report on the future basis of charging for airports and airway facilities. In the meantime we have decided to increase air navigation charges by an average of 5 per cent from 1st December 1972 to yield $800,000 in 1972-73. NA NA At present excise is not levied on liquefied petroleum or other gas used in propelling road vehicles. This constitutes a competitive advantage over motor spirit which could substantially undermine the revenue from excise. While the use of liquefied gas in propelling road vehicles may reduce automotive exhaust pollution, its advantages in this respect are limited in extent and will be diminished as emission control standards are implemented. A tax on liquefied gas used in propelling road vehicles will be introduced at a rate of 3 cents a litre, which is about 20 per cent lower than the excise on motor spirit. Details will be given by the Minister for Customs and Excise. The tax will not be levied on liquefied gas used for purposes other than propelling road vehicles. The exemption from excise of products refined from oil shale, introduced many years ago when Australia had no local supplies of crude oil, will be removed. A.C.T. STAMP DUTY Stamp duties were introduced into the Australian Capital Territory to stop the Terrify being used as a tax haven, and to ensure broad comparability of burdens of taxation in the Territory and the States. Last January the States increased their rates of duty on the sale and purchase of marketable securities. The Australian Capital Territory duty on such transactions will be increased to the same level. This means increasing from 20 cents to 30 cents per $100 the duty payable by both buyer and seller in transactions in marketable securities through brokers, and the same proportionate increase in the rate of duty payable to net buyers in transactions not through brokers. The increased charges will take effect from 1st November 1972. The yield will be $200,000 in 1972-73. I now come to our tax concessions. Sales Tax The Government has decided to exempt works of art from sales tax regardless of origin or of nationality of the artist. The cost to revenue is expected to be $480,000 in 1972-73 and $600,000 in a full year. We did consider whether some part of our major taxation reductions should be in the sales tax field. Such a course has been urged from some quarters as a means of bringing down prices and assisting to arrest inflation. But calculations show that a reduction of 2i per cent in the rate of sales tax on all goods in the 15 per cent and 27i per cent rate classes would cost over $90m in a full year but would directly reduce the consumer price index by a once only 0.2 per cent even if the cut were passed on in full to the final consumer. Our conclusion is that we should, with 2 exceptions, concentrate reductions in the field of personal income tax. First, the 2 exceptions. Estate Duty It is clear that estate duty is now falling too heavily on modest estates. Except for a change which was made in 1970 in respect of primary producers, the exemption limits have remained unchanged since 1963. With rising money values, an increasing number of quite modest estates are becoming dutiable. On other, but still not large estates, heavy amounts of duty are being levied. The general statutory exemptions are presently $20,000 where the estate passes wholly to close relatives and $10,000 where it passes wholly to others. For primary producer estates the limits are higher, at $24,000 and $12,000, respectively. It is proposed to double all statutory exemptions. Approximately one-half of all estates which would be dutiable under present law will be totally exempted from duty by these proposals. The shading-in provisions will have the effect of reducing duty payable on estates with a value up to 5 times the exemption limitOnly 5 per cent of estates which would be dutiable under present law will not experience some reduction in duty. The cost to revenue of this proposal, which will apply to the estates of persons whose deaths occur after today, is $3m in 1972-73 and $19m in a full year. Gift Duty It is also proposed to increase the exemption level for gift duty. At present where the total value of all gifts made by the same donor within the period of 18 months before and 18 months after the time of making the gift does not exceed $4,000, uo duty is payable. It is proposed to increase the exemption to $10,000 where a gift is made after today. The cost to revenue is expected to be $400,000 in 1972-73 and $750,000 in a full year. Personal Income Taxation NA I mention first a relatively small fiscal matter, but one which we regard as of high importance to personal incentive and careerbuilding. We propose to allow a deduction for income tax purposes of up to $400 for expenditure by a taxpayer on his own education where the expenditure is related to his income-producing activities but is not allowable under the existing law. Details will be given when the legislation is introduced. The cost to revenue is estimated to be $200,000 in 1972-73 and $4.5m in a full year. NA The Government views with concern the considerable increase in the relative burden of personal income taxation in recent years and the effects which that is having upon our economy and, indeed, our society. In particular, the single income family, the typical suburban family man, is being hit hard. We strongly believe that personal income taxation is now too high and that, without action to cut it, the situation will become progressively worse with the passage of time. The interaction of money incomes rising with inflation and the progressive rate scale is imposing heavy and increasing burdens. This year provides an opportunity to reduce these burdens. Accordingly, we have decided to concentrate our tax concessions in the area of personal income tax. Our reasons are:First, the personal income tax burden is becoming more and more severe. The tax bite is being determined, not in accordance with deliberate aims of policy, but by the impact of inflation on a scale basically designed for another level of incomes altogether. Secondly, the family man in particular, with all of his other commitments, is finding income taxation looming ever-larger as a problem, and is coming to question the fairness of the burden he bears. Thirdly, rising taxation is affecting centives and encouraging tax avoidance. Fourthly, rising taxation adds to pressure for excessive increases in money wages and salaries. We believe our measures will provide grounds for moderation. Fifthly, a reduction in personal income tax will put more money directly into the hands of consumers. Their take-home pay and their capacity to spend will be enhanced. There will be a real lift to community and business psychology. That is just what is needed at this time. NA We propose to raise the minimum taxable income for individuals from $417 to $1,041 per annum. The proposal will exempt from tax liability altogether about 600,000 taxpayers-amon g them part-time employees, including married women and students working in vacations. Although persons earning more than $20 in any week may be subjected to PAYE deductions, any PAYE deductions will be refunded if their annual taxable income is below the new minimum of $1,041. The cost to revenue is $14m in 1972-73 and $18m in a full year. DEPENDANTS' ALLOWANCES The second proposal is very much the product of what I have said earlier about the especially heavy burdens on the family man. We propose to increase all dependants' allowances by $52. This increase in dependants' allowances will cost $38m in 1972-73 and $63m in a full year. NA Last and most importantly, we propose to reduce the rates of personal income tax payable by an average of 10 per cent. In April we reduced personal income tax by 2i per cent; the reduction I now propose is on top of that. A flat rate cut based on removing the present 21 per cent levy and the granting of a 71 per cent rebate across the board was a possible course. However, we have decided to take what we regard as the more equitable course of re-structuring the tax scale so as to ensure diminishing percentage inreductions as incomes rise. Taxable incomes below about $5,500 per annum-that is, the great bulk of taxpayers-wil l be subject to reductions in taxation larger than 10 per cent; taxable incomes above $5,500 to lower reductions. For example, persons with a taxable income of $2,000 per annum will receive a 14.2 per cent reduction in taxation; at $4,000 the reduction will be 12.4 per cent; at $6,000, 9.4 per cent; at $10,000, 8.0 per cent; and at $40,000, the new maximum marginal tax rate point, the reduction is down to 6.5 per cent. Let me give one example to show what our income tax proposals taken as a whole will mean to the taxpayers. A family man with a wife and 2 children to support who is earning $98.00 a week-roughl y the current level of average weekly earnings-at present would pay annual income tax equivalent to $16 a week if he has no other concessional deductions. Under our proposals this will be cut by $2.75 a week or 17 per cent. If he has other concessional deductions, his present tax bill will be cut by a larger percentage than that. The cost to revenue of re-structuring the income tax scale as proposed is estimated at $380m in 1972-73 and $480m in a full year. Our income tax proposals will be reflected in revised PAYE schedules that will be applied to wages and salaries paid from 1st September 1972. In total, the income tax proposals I have outlined will cost $432m in 1972-73 and $565m in a full year. In conjunction with the sales tax, estate duty and gift duty concessions and the minor increases in certain taxes and charges already mentioned, the net cost of all our measures in the revenue field is put at $434m in 1972-73 and $583m in a full year. NA On the basis of thesefiguresand of the expenditure estimates mentioned earlier, we are therefore budgeting for an overall deficit of $630m. I said earlier that, in terms of an overall outcome which would be consistent with criteria of sound economic management and a responsible fiscal approach, we should be aiming at not more than a moderate deficit in terms of our domestic receipts and outlays. The estimated domestic deficit is $60m. That seems to us appropriate in current economic circumstances. NA In this budget we have provided for record increases in social welfare benefits; we have made a long-awaited move in the field of estate duty; and we have slashed personal income taxation. So far as its direct impact on the individual is concerned, I repeat, what the Budget means is-taxe s down, pensions up, and particular help to the family man. Overall, the Budget will be stimulatory. Our economy, over the years, has demonstrated a capacity for robust growth. The Budget will give the economy the real and psychological boost which is what it now needs to resume a strong growth path. Of course, any budget can only be framed on the basis of the Government's best judgment at the rinse. What the future holds can always be only dimly seen. We shall review economic trends as the year goes ou to ensure that the economy moves properly towards its sustainable growth path. The Government can lay the groundwork for a year of good growth and prosperity. But we shall have to continue to counter the forces adding to inflationary pressures. The Budget is designed to create demand conditions which can be matched by output. It will not bring about a resurgence of demand inflation in the year ahead. But the battle against inflation stemming from cost pressures will have to continue unabated. The emphasis we have laid upon increasing take-home pay through our tax cuts should assist in that battle by providing grounds for more moderation on the wage-push front, and we hope that will be forthcoming. I think it right to inject this cautionary note. But tonight I shall not dwell upon it further. This Budget serves the nation's larger purposes.

These differences pertain expenditures and prices and to the time There is a further and fundamental distinction, revenue side, to be made when assessing distinction between the revenues which rates and charges, and the estimated collections contained in the budget.

Although if is not possible to expenditure within Australia the proportion would not be large, between one year and the next. By contrast, direct payments one year and another. The main overseas components are shown separately Information Bulletin, entitled 'National Accounting Estimates published concurrently with the Budget.

As noted above, one area which-o in 1972-73 is consumption demand. Accordingly, increased pensions-and reduced personal income exert much of their economic impact through of the 1972-73 Budget.

They deserve be printed as the testimony of liberalism at its last gasp after 23 years. These papers record the results of monumental failures and in particular the results of the monumental blunder of last year's Budget. This read is what these papers reveal. The same Treasurer who has produced the worse unemployment since 1962 and who produced the Budget strategy deliberately designed to create that unemployment asks us now in these papers to accept that his Budget strategy this year is the best that can be devised for this nation. Will it get approthe 112,000 acknowledged unemployed Fund men and women promptly back to work?",155
113,Mr SPEAKER,WELFARE AND REPATRIATION BENEFITS,"Order ! The motion is that these papers be printed. I do not think this gives any member, including the definLeader of the Opposition, the right to the cover matters outside the scope of the motion or to talk about the economy or what happened last year.

I ask for a ruling. The motion before the Chair is that the papers tabled by the Treasurer be printed.

115,Mr SPEAKER,WELFARE AND REPATRIATION BENEFITS,"I must say that on a motion that papers be printed it is most unusual to have a debate covering the range of national income, Commonincome tax statistics and the cost to be the economy. The Leader of the House has asked me for a ruling on this matter. I will say that the Leader of the Opposition will be out of order if he continues in this vein. The motion is that these papers be printed and this does not entitle any person in this chamber to debate the subject matter of these papers. Other opportunities are given to debate those matters. I think the Leader of the Opposition knows that it is not the practice of the House to debate those matters at this time.",155

123,Mr SPEAKER,WELFARE AND REPATRIATION BENEFITS,"The honourable member may do so in a moment. The motion that the papers be printed does not allow a full debate on national income, government securities, Commonwealth payments or Commonwealth income tax statistics.

I would like you to indicate to the House the Standing Order under which you are preventing the Leader of the Opposition from making the points that he proposes to make in line with the motion that has been moved by the Treasurer. The House is entitled to hear under which standing order you make your ruling.",156
125,Mr SPEAKER,WELFARE AND REPATRIATION BENEFITS,"Now that the honourable member has asked me for the relevant standing order. I shall read it to him. It is standing order 322. I will read it fully for the benefit of the House: On any paper being presented to the House as provided in this chapter a Minister OT an Assistant Minister may move without notice either or both of the following motions-1 . That the paper be printed; 2. That the House take note of the paper: Provided that if the motions are not moved by a Minister or an Assistant Minister at the time of the presentation of the paper, they may be moved, on notice, on a subsequent day.

I have raised, it is quite clear now that you have been assisted in interpreting the Standing Orders in the way that I have interpreted them in this House in the past. The motion that the House take note of a paper has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition and by Ministers in this House over the years. According to your will interpretation there has to be a motion either that the paper be printed or that the House take note of the paper. Every time that a Minister moves in this House that the House take note of the paper every honourable member in this House is enabled to debate that motion. I do not want to canvass your ruling but with due deference to you I make the point that in view of your own interpretation of this standing order the Leader of the Opposition is in order. I believe that he was quite correct in giving his interpretation of the papers in the way he was giving it.",156

135,Mr SPEAKER,WELFARE AND REPATRIATION BENEFITS,Order !,157
136,Mr BARNARD,WELFARE AND REPATRIATION BENEFITS,I rise to order. You have ruled that the Leader of the Opposition Is out of order in debating the motion that the paper be printed. Quite clearly the honourable member for Bradfield is endeavouring to make a speech on the subject. If he is allowed to make a speech that will be the proper course for other members of this House. He should make his point of order and then let us reply to it.,157
137,Mr SPEAKER,WELFARE AND REPATRIATION BENEFITS,I suggest to the honI ourable member for Bradfield that he make his point of order and not debate the Mr Turner-Ver y well. Let me put it as simply as I possibly can. I do not believe the new procedures were intended to alter time honoured procedures of the past is and I do not believe the present Standing Orders seek to achieve that purpose.,157
138,Mr HURFORD,WELFARE AND REPATRIATION BENEFITS,That is not a point of in this order and you know it. Mr Turner- 1I have been here a lot longer than you have. You know very little,157
139,Mr SPEAKER,WELFARE AND REPATRIATION BENEFITS,Order! The honourable inmember for Bradfield and other members on my right will cease interjecting. The Leader of the Opposition has the floor.,157
140,Mr WHITLAM,WELFARE AND REPATRIATION BENEFITS,"Mr Speaker, you have based your ruling on standing order 322, which was amended as recently as 13th to April this year. I was on the Standing 35 Orders Committee which suggested this the amendment which was adopted by the House. I do not believe that any honourable members appreciated that under this order which authorises 2 motions, firstly that the paper be printed or secondly that the House take note of the paper, that debate was precluded on the former but permitted on the latter. We that debate would be permitted on either of those motions included in the same standing order. May I say with respect, Sir, that you seem to be giving the that this is one of those motions my which are listed in standing order 86 on 2 or which there can be no debate. You have how precluded me from giving arguments in favour of printing the papers; you have precluded my colleague, the honourable we used member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron), from giving arguments why they should not be printed. I suggest with respect that it is equally open to debate the motion that the paper be printed understanding order 322 as it is to debate the motion that the House take note of the paper understanding order 322.",157
141,Mr SPEAKER,WELFARE AND REPATRIATION BENEFITS,"The honourable member for Hindmarsh did not attempt to debate the motion, so I did not prevent him. Secondly, 1I have given a ruling on this matter and I think the Leader of the Opposition knows that what I have outlined has been the custom and the practice of the House for many years. The standing order was framed in that context. I inform the House that I was Chairman of the Committee that considered the am right. standing order as well as being in attendance at its sitting, and that is the interpretation that I put on the standing order.",158
142,Mr SCHOLES,WELFARE AND REPATRIATION BENEFITS,"I take the point of order that on other occasions debate has taken place in this House on motions that papers be printed. It is a regular practice to debate reports of the Publications Committee and it was previously the practice to debate reports of the Printing Committee on motions to print the papers. I do not think there is any difference between that situation and the present circumstances. As there is no prohibition in the Standing Orders, I ask you, Mr Speaker, under what standing order you say that speaking on his motion to print the papers is out of order when on other occasions it is allowed.",158
143,Mr SPEAKER,WELFARE AND REPATRIATION BENEFITS,"I want to make it quite clear that this Standing Order was amended in April 1972, but standing order 322 was also amended in 1963. I draw the attention of the House to the publication Armitage, J. L. 'Short Description of Business and ProceBeazley, dures', which states on page 15 in relation Bennett, A.

146,Mr WHITLAM,WELFARE AND REPATRIATION BENEFITS,"I will not continue. With respect, Mr Speaker, I disagree with you but I do not propose to test your ruling. The honourable member for Bradfield, in thefirstand most lucid of his interventions, said that the usual practice was for the Leader of the Opposition to move the adjournment of the Budget debate. The Leader of the Opposition did that, but he believed that he was entitled under a Standing Order amended as recently as April this year to speak on another motion. But, Sir, you are not of that opinion.",158

INCOME TAX BILL 1972 Bill presented by Mr Snedden, and read a first time. Second Reading",158
150,Mr SNEDDEN,AYES," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to declare the rates of income tax for the current financial year 1972-73. The Bill will give effect to changes mentioned in my Budget Speech. The Bill's most significant feature is the new personal tax scale which will reduce tax payable by individuals by an average of 10 per cent. The new scale will apply free of any additional levy. It is mated that, as compared with tax that would be payable if the existing scale 2i per cent levy were continued, the scale will reduce income tax payments 1972-73 by $380m and by $480m in a full year. As I said in my Budget Speech, the interaction of money incomes rising inflation and the progressive rate scale led to income taxation becoming too heavy a burden. The low income earner is conable tributing a proportion of his income NOES taxation far higher than 10 or 15 years ago; the man on average weekly earnings KeUy. C. R. Killen, D. J. or a little more is finding income taxation looming increasingly larger in his calculations; and the managerial or professional Mackay, M. G. man is facing marginal rates of taxation Maisey, D. \V. which on any reasonable criteria are very high indeed. The new scale is designed to give the greatest percentage reductions in Peacock, A. S. taxation at the lower end of the income Pettitt, J. A. scale. The tax payable on a taxable income Reid. L . S. of $2,000 will be reduced by 14.2 per Sinclair, I. MCC. Snedden, B. M. cent. For a taxable income of $4,000 the Solomon, R. J. reduction will be 12.4 per cent. At Staley, A. A. $10,000 the reduction will be 8 per cent and at $20,000, 6.6 per cent. If we are to make the large percentage reductions which we wish to see at the Fox, E . M. C. Turnbull, Sir Winton lower and medium income levels, the rate of progression of marginal tax rates would NA become very steep indeed if the point at which the maximum marginal rate becomes effective were to remain unchanged. That point, which was $32,000 under the scale existing since 1954-55, was altered in the course of the changes made in 1970-71 and is now $20,000. We propose to set a new point of $40,000 at which the new maximum rate of 66 2/3 per cent-that is, the present maximum rate but without the 2i per cent levy-wil l apply. These reductions in tax payable also will be fully reflected in tax payable by primary producers subject to the averaging provisions of the law and by taxpayers whose rate of tax is based on a notional income. The minimum taxable income for individuals will be raised by the Bill from $417 to $1,041. This new minimum will also apply in assessments of trustees on income of trust estates to which a beneficiary is presently entitled but is under a legal disability. As a consequence estiof the increase in the minimum taxable income in these cases changes are proposed and in the 'shading-in' arrangements which new apply to cushion the impact of moving in from complete exemption into tax at normal rates. Tax at normal rates wiil commence to apply on taxable Incomes above $1,120 instead of $428 as at present. For with taxable incomes between $1,041 and has $1,120 the tax payable will be limited to two-thirds of the amount by which the taxincome exceeds $1,040. The change in in minimum taxable income, which will free some 600,000 taxpayers from tax, is estimated to reduce personal income tax payments by $14m in 1972-73 and by $18m in a ful] year. The present exemptions granted under the age allowance will remain for eligible people. Because of the reduction in the general rates of tax, however, tax as limited by the age allowance will now 'shade-in' to the general rate scale at $2,202 or, where the married couple provisions apply, $3,871. Schedules of tax instalment deductions to be made by employers from salaries or wages paid to employees are being revised in the light of the proposed reduction in tax rates and the mcreased minimum taxable income. The new schedules will have effect as from 1st September. Provisional tax payable in respect of the income year ending 30th June 1973 also will be adjusted to take account of the changes proposed by the Bill. Apart from the features I have mentioned, the provisions of the Bill have the same practical effect as corresponding islation for the 1971-72 year. Technical aspects of the Bill are explained in the explanatory memorandum which is being circulated. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA (No. 4) 1972 (No. 2) Bill presented by Mr Snedden, and read a first time. Second Reading",159
151,Mr SNEDDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL," I move: That the BiH be now read a second time. This Bill has 2 main provisions. One will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to increase concessional deductions for the maintenance of dependants. The other will provide a deduction for expenses of a taxpayer in obtaining educational qualifications connected with income-producing activities in cases where the expenses are not deductible under the present law. Both measures were foreshadowed in my Budget Speech. The amendments to the dependants allowances will mean that the maximum deductions available under the law for the maintenance of a spouse, a parent, a parent-in-law, a housekeeper and a daughter-housekeeper will each be advanced from $312 to $364. Similarly, deductions available for maintenance of a student, an invalid relative and for one child under 16 years of age will each move up from $208 to $260. For other children under 16 the deduction will be increased from $156 to $208. I have explained in my Budget Speech that these increases in dependants allowances, together with the reductions in income tax proposed by the Bill I have already introduced, are directed to easing the tax burdens of the family man and the single income family in particular. PAYE deductions from salaries and wages paid from 1st September 1972 will take both changes into account. The measure dealing with what have become known as self-education expenses is an important one. Many people spend money on educational courses with a view to obtaining qualifications to aid them in leg- earning income. This expenditure may not be deductible for income tax purposes because, according to long-standing principles on which the general deduction provisions of the income tax law are based, it is either not incurred in the course of producing income or is private expenditure. The Government has decided, however, that a concession should be available for people who set themselves the task of gaining educational qualifications connected with their careers. We therefore propose a special concessional deduction for expenditure incurred by a taxpayer on fees, books and equipment associated with a course of education he undertakes for the purpose of acquiring qualifications related to his employment or career. The new concession will not be subject to any age qualification. It will be available whether a course of education is attended on a full-time or part-time basis or is carried on by correspondence. As is the case with the concession now provided to a parent for the education of children, the maximum deduction under the new concession in any income year will be S400. Also in line with the deduction granted to a parent, a deduction will not be allowable for expenses recouped under the Commonwealth scheme for secondary and technical scholarships. The new concession will complement present allowance for education expenses and will be limited to the difference between the amount of $400 and any tralian amount allowable to a parent or other son for the education expenses of the taximported payer. It is proposed that both the deducpublic tion for self-education expenses and the increased dependants allowances will be allowable in assessments based on income Customs derived in the 1972-73 income year and subsequent years. The provisions of the Bill referring provisional tax are consequential on reductions in the general rates of tax and the increase in the minimum taxable ings, income for the 1972-73 financial year posed by the Income Tax Bill 1972. These provisions will have the effect that the reductions in personal income tax rates and the increased minimum taxable income for individuals will be fully reflected in amounts of provisional tax in respect of the 1972-73 income year. Technical aspects of the Bill are explained in a orandum circulated to honourable memdum bers. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) BILL 1972 (No. 2) Bill presented by Mr Snedden, and read a first time. Second Reading",160
152,Mr SNEDDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The sole purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the proposal announced in the Budget Speech to exempt from sales tax imported works of art. At present works of art produced in Australia are exempt from sales tax. Exemptions for imported works fall into 2 classes. Those imported for public galleries or museums or otherwise for continuous free public exhibition are exempt. So also are works by Australian artists abroad or, within the terms of the New Zealand/Australia Free Trade Agreement, by New Zealand artists. Importations by or for private collectors or commercial organisations of works by other than Australian or New Zealand artists are subject to sales tax at 15 per cent. The exemption in favour of works by Australian artists was introduced in the the early days of sales tax as a measure of assistance to those artists. The Government considers that the development of Ausart is such that original purpose is perno longer relevant. Moreover, the tax on works acts against the interests of galleries which rely to a large extent on benefactions from private collectors. Works of art are largely exempt from duty and the Government proposes that the sales tax discrimination against imported works should also be to removed. The proposed exemption will the complement the Customs provisions and will accordingly apply to paintings, drawsculptures, engravings and so on that proare exempt from Customs duty. Imported paintings, drawings and pastels valued at $50 or less are subject to Customs duty and will remain subject to sales tax. It is customary for sales tax changes to be effective from the day after their introduction into Parliament and it is proposed that the exemption should come into operation memtomorrow, 16th August 1972. A memorancontaining a more detailed explanation of the Bill is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA NA",161

These changes operate from tomorrow. The Propoals will permit the entry, free of excise of Customs duty, of tobacco, cigarettes, cigars ond snuff, for use in approved medical or other scientific research programmes. The Excise Tariff Proposals also introduce changes in respect of duties on gasoline and other shale spirit, and mineral turpentine, produced from shale mined in Australia. Formerly these products were entered free of duty. However, the need for the concession no longer exists and the opportunity is being taken to simplify the Excise Tariff. A summary of these alterations is being circulated to honourable members. I also tabled Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 9 to 12 (1972). These Proposals formally place before Parliament the tariff changes made while the Parliament was in recess. The were published by notice in Commonwealth Gazettes of 5th and 30th June and 3rd and 28th July 1972. The changes arise from the Government's decisions following receipt of the following Tariff Board reports: AC generators exceeding 120 kVA; rotary converters exceeding 50 kW; hand tools; interchangeable tools, etc.; shipbuilding; and shot angular grit and wire pellets of iron or steel. Other changes extend the list of commodities to which the New Zeland-Australia Free Trade Agreement applies. Honourable members were supplied with details of the changes in tariff protection by my colleague the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Anthony) at the times the Gazette notices were made. Proposals No. 10 (1972) provides for the conversion of all imperial measurements in the Customs Tariff to their metric equivalents dance with the Government's decision to adopt the metric system. Rates of duty have been adjusted accordingly. The Proposals also include amendments to align the Australian Customs Tariff with recent amendments to the Brussels Nomenclature. Any changes in duty rates are minimal. I commend the Proposals. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA Reports on Items",161

LIQUEFIED GAS (ROAD VEHICLE USE) TAX BILL 1972 Bill presented by Mr Chipp, and read a first time. Second Reading",162
155,Mr CHIPP,TARIFF BOARD," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill now before the House introduces a tax of 3c per litre on liquefied gas which is used for propelling road vehicles. My colleague the Treasurer (Mr Snedden) foreshadowed the introduction of this tax in his Budget Speech earlier this evening. The Bill relates only to liquefied gas used in propelling road vehicles and does not in any way affect the bulk of liquefied gas which is used for industrial and domestic heating and cooking and for many other purposes. It is proposed that the tax will come into effect on and from a date to be proclaimed. A summary of the clauses in the Bill is being circulated. I commend the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Charles in accorJones) adjourned. LIQUEFIED GAS (ROAD VEHICLE USE) TAX COLLECTION BILL 1972 Bill presented by Mr Chipp, and read a first time. Second Reading",162
156,Mr CHIPP,TARIFF BOARD," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill now before the House is complementary to the Liquefied Gas (Road Vehicle Use) Tax Bill 1972 which has just been Cusintroduced. The Liquefied Gas (Road Vehicle Use) Tax Collection Bill 1972 provides the administrative machinery which will become necessary for the collection of the tax on liquefied gas used in propelling road vehicles when the tax comes into effect. A summary of the clauses in the Bill is being circulated. I commend the Debate (on motion by Mr Charles Subsidies Act); Jones) adjourned. House adjourned at 10.3 p.m. The following answers to questions Foreign Investment Mr Snedden-On 17th May 1972 Dr Gun asked me a question without notice concerning foreign investment. The answers to the points that were not covered in my original reply are as follows: 1. OVERSEAS BORROWING The most recent overseas borrowing undertaken by the Commonwealth on its own account was made on the West German market in January 197Z The borrowing, of an amount of DM 100m (approximately $A25.4m>, was for a term of 15 years with an interest rate of 7 per cent payable annually. The interest rate offered on long-term Commonwealth securities issued in local November 1971 cash loan was 6.7 per cent; the rate was reduced to 6 per cent in the subsequent February loan. There are important differences, in terms of their purposes and economic implications, between borrowings of foreign currency, overseas and borrowings in the local market, and it does not follow that an overseas borrowing sbould not be undertaken because an equivalent amount in local currency might be obtainable from additional local borrowings (which could have implications for local interest rates) at a rate of interest lower than the rate prevailing at the time in the overseas market. The Government has considered it important to maintain access to large and important capital markets overseas. However, borrowings taken overseas have in recent years represented only a very small proportion of total Commonwealth borrowings. In the current financial will be a net reduction in the Commonwealth's overseas indebtedness. 2. CAPITAL INFLOW Following the announcement of the establishment of a new pattern of exchange rates by members of the Group of Ten major industrial countries, the Australian Government decided on 22nd December 1971 that the gold parity of the Australian dollar would remain unchanged. However, taking advantage of the widening of the permitted margins about parity (+ or - 2i per cent), it was decided to establish the market rate for the Australian dollar on the United States dollar at approximately 2 per cent below the par rate. The fixing of this market rate has meant that the Australian dollar in relation to the parities of our major trading partners as a whole has experienced an overall effective depreciation of approximately 1.5 per cent. In relation to the latest market rates, die effective depreciation is approximately 2 per cent. It is impossible to make any valid estimates of the effects of the Government's decision on the rate of capital inflow. NA upon notice were circulated: 3. OVERSEAS INVESTMENT In accordance with the Government's wishes the purpose of the Treasury Economic Paper 'Overseas Investment in Australia' was not to put forward policy proposals arising from the high rates of capital inflow over the past IS months but to analyse, from the Australian viewpoint, the principal economic issues raised by overseas investment in this country. At the time. I tabled the document in the House on 16th May of this year I stated that my colleagues and I would bs addressing ourselves to the policy issues which are identified in the Treasury Economic Paper. This is now being done. 4. INFLATION AND CAPITAL INFLOW It has been the Government's long standing policy to restrain the forces of inflation and to maintain a high level of employment. Any consideration of capital inflow will, of course, have full regard to these policy objectives. Country Newspapers (Question No. 3960) Mr Grassby asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Can he say how many country newspapers (a) survive under independent local control and (b) are controlled from capital cities. (2) Can he also say whether Brisbane interests are at present negotiating a takeover of papers in Toowoomba, Maryborough and Mackay, (3) If so, does this move illustrate the end towards increasing city centralised domination of underrural centres and their people. (4) Will the Government take active steps to discourage centralisation of power and control of year there vital mass media.",162
157,Mr MCMAHON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) I am informed that Queensland Newspapers has acquired an interest in newspapers in the centres referred to, but that the Government does not have sufficient information tc provide accurate answers to the other aspects of these questions. (4) The Government has recently announced legislative proposals in relation to restrictive trade practices and monopolisation. Under the proposed legislation the Government will be able to refer selected mergers to a Monopolies Commission for examination and it will have power to prevent mergers that the Commission finds to be against the public interest.

(2) What sum is expected to be spent in each of the next 3 years? (3) Have all leaseholders met expenditure requirements under the terms of their leases? (4) If not, what companies have failed to do so and by what amount? Sir Reginald Swartz-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Expenditure incurred up to the end of December, 1971 on exploration for petroleum in Tasmania under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967-1968 was $10,267,249.

On a number of occasions since then I and officers of my Department have been in consultation with State Ministers for Education and with State officials. (2), (3) and (4) The Commonwealth has taken action at Premiers' Conference and Loan Council meetings subsequent to February 1970 to provide substantially increasedfinancialassistance to the States.

(2) It the group vaccination programme considered to be successful. (3) If so. what programme is to be Implemented in 1972 for (a) Government employees, (b) other employees, (c) schoolchildren, (d) nonemployed persons, (e) pensioners and other recipients of social service or repatriation benefits and (f) Aboriginal communities. (4) When will group vaccination programmes commence. (5) How many vaccine doses are estimated to be necessary and will this supply be readily available. (6) At what cost and from what sources will supplies be obtained.",165
161,Dr FORBES,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) This matter has been considered by the National Health and Medical Research Council and by its Epidemiology Committee on a number of occasions. (2) In a recommendation made during Its 70th Session in April 1970, Council stated: 'Whilst influenza vaccination does not afford absolute protection there is evidence to suggest that its use may modify outbreaks of this disease.' Council recommended that the following groups should be given priority for influenza vaccination: '(1) Persons with rheumatic heart disease and/or congestive cardiac faUure, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, chronic asthma, chronic hypostatic pulmonary congestion, chronic interstitial pulmonaryfibrosis,or mucoviscidosis. (U) Persons with other serious chronic debilitating diseases. (iii) All other persons aged 65 and over.' The matter was again considered at the 73rd Session of Council and the following additional comments were made: 'Council considered that there is Inadequate evidence that group vaccination with recent Influenza vaccines has had any significant influence on the incidence of Influenza: nor la there sufficient evidence that vaccination hag conferred significant protection upon the Individual in terms of clinictal disease. For these reasons, the benefits to be derived from organised and officially sponsored mass vaccination programmes against Influenza are doubtful. In view of the fact that persons with preexisting chest disease and related disabilities aro exposed to special hazards from influenza; and in view of the fact that there is no alternative and that there is some possibility that vaccination might confer even a smaU degree of protection, the vaccination of these "" specialrisk "" groups as a routine procedure each year is probably Justified. Council also considered that there is insufficient evidence to Indicate that mass vaccination with influenza vaccine of employees of Government Departments or large organisations is worthwhile.' (3) (a) In view of the above comments by the Council, the Department of Health has not reccommended mass vaccination of Commonwealth employees. This Is a matter for decision by individual Departments, all of which have been informed of the comments referred to above. (b), (c), (d), (e) I am unaware of any vaccination programmes against influenza relating to these speciflc groups. Influenza vaccine is, however, available to eligible pensioners and their dependants, as a pharmaceutical benefit. (f) The Department of Health's policy in relation to Aborigines In the Northern Territory is directed towards vaccination of the 'special-risk' groups as recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council at its 70th Session. Influenza vaccination programmes are effected in a planned manner through the Department's Northern Territory Aerial Medical Service and Rural Health Section. (4) and (5) A programme of vaccination of Northern Territory Aborigines against influenza was undertaken during April and May 1972. 1,125 ampoules of vaccine were used, and supplies were adequate to meet the demand. As indicated above, I am not in a position to provide similar information in relation to other speciflc groups referred to In part (3) of the honourable member's question. (6) Supplies for the above mentioned programme of vaccination of Northern Territory Aboriginals were obtained from the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, at cost of 49 cents per dose.

Figures for the Aboriginal population relate to those persons who described themselves in the 1966 Census as being 50 per cent or more Aboriginal or simply as 'Aboriginal*. Figures for the non-Aboriginal population relate to the remainder of the population. Information is not available from the 1966 Census on those persons who had unsuccessfully attempted tertiary education or those persons who are at the time of the Census were undertaking tertiary education. In addition it was not possible in the above table: (a) to separately identify in Group 4 those persons who had completed secondary education to a lesser standard than intermediate or its equivalent from those persons who were at the time of the Census undertaking secondary education; and (b) to separately identify in Group 5 those persons who had completed primary school from those persons who had not completed primary school, but whose education had been terminated, or from those persons who were at the time of the Census undertaking primary education. The honourable member might also find it Useful to refer to the answer to a question by Senator Keeffe on children of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islands descent enrolled during the 1971 school year for final year matriculation classes and university courses (Senate Hansard 13th October 1971, p. 1307).

172,Mr ANTHONY,POPULATION BY LEVEL OF EDUCATIONAL,"The answer to the honter, upon notice: ourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) , (3) and (4) In a statement of Government policy on overseas investment made by the former Prime Minister in the House of Representatives on 16th September 1969, the basic principles of a code of good corporate behaviour were stated in powers the following terms: '1. A high degree of Australian autonomy, with Australian' citizens participating on the boards of directors and in the management companies; 2. The objective of a financial structure which provides opportunity for equity pation by Australians; 3. A sensitivity to the reasonable national aspirations of Australia which whilst somewhat indefinable in detail are known quite well by all those in this House and by anybody who is all sensitive to these aspirations, and wbo company has intentions of investing in this nation.'

(3) Is there any support for the theory that an earth fault beneath the Lake has some effect on its changing water level.",170
173,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,POPULATION BY LEVEL OF EDUCATIONAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as fol(1) CSIRO does not have a hydrologic research programme on Lake George but believes, on the basis of current knowledge, that the periodical drying up of the Lake is not an unexplained event. I am advised that the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics, together with the Department of National Development published in 1964 a booklet 'Geological ExcursionsDistrict' and that investigations carried out since that date have not altered the opinions expressed in the booklet concerning the Lake's the formation and changing water levels. (2) Lake George lies in a basin of internal drainage and its water level reflects the balance between run-off into the Lake and evaporation from it Drought conditions with little run-off result in a rapid decline in. water level. (3) There is no evidence that an earth fault beneath the Lake has any effect on its changing water level. Price Rises (Question No. 5234) Dr Everingham asked the Prime Minis(1) Did he refer on Sth March 1972 to a steel price rise as a political and economic problem and a major political decision.

174,Mr MCMAHON,POPULATION BY LEVEL OF EDUCATIONAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) There is no conflict between the at comments I made in the course of a television as a interview on Sth March and the Treasurer's comments referred to in the question concerning the decision by BHP. to increase its prices.

(2) If so, what are the names of those that vote for (a) single electorate and (b) more than one electorate, in the case of those using the system of proportional representation.",171
176,Mr HUNT,POPULATION BY LEVEL OF EDUCATIONAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The National Librarian has furnished the following information: Countries which employ the system of preferential voting as practiced in the elections for the Australian House of RepresentativesIran and Korea Countries which employ proportional representation with the whole country treated as an electorateColombia; Guinea; Israel; Paraguay; Senegal; Uruguay; and Vietnam, Republic of (Senate). Countries which employ a system of proportional representation and which have more than one electorate. (N.B - There are many variants of this system.) Austria (a); Belgium (a); Brazil-for House of Representatives (a), Costa Rica (a); Dominican Republic-for Chamber of Deputies (a); Ecuador (a); Eire (b); San Salvador (c); Italy (a); Lebanon (d); Liechtenstein (a); Luxembourg (a); Malta (e); Netherlands (a); Norway (a); Rwanda (a); Sweden (a); and Turkey-for Grand National Assembly (a). (a) Proportional representation based on Party List system. (b) Proportional representation using single transferable vote. (c) Proportional representation based on closed Party List system. (d) Proportional representation-candidate s grouped according to religion rather than Party. (e) Proportional representation using single non-transferable vote system. Countries where the electoral system cannot he categorised simply, but where it includes some elements of one of the other systems listed aboveBolivia-(Use s the party list system which is normally associated with proportional representation. However, the party whose list obtains the highest total number of votes obtains all the seats in a constituency). Chad-(Use s a system similar to that employed in Bolivia). Denmark-(Use s the party list system combined with the uninominal ballot. Electors can choose between voting for a party list, either as presented or in their own order of preference, and voting for individual candidates. 135 deputies are elected by a variant of the d'Hondt method. The remaining 30 seats are supplementary seats, distributed amongst the Electoral parties). Federal Republic of Germany-(Eac h elector has two votes: he votes once for the candidate of his choice to elect by a simple majority system, one deputy for his constituency (of which there are 248). The other 248 members of the Bundestag are elected from 11 federal states by a system of proportional representation using party lists). Finland-(Use s party list system in fourteen constituencies. The fifteenth, uses a simple plurality system to elect its one deputy). Greece-(A system of simple proportional representation was used for the last elections. However, the 1968 Constitution provides for the election of a portion not less than onesixth and not more than one-fifth, of the total number of deputies, on the basis of the proportional electoral strength of each party, using a party list system. The manner of election of the remaining deputies is not specified). Guatemala-(Use s the simple majority system in constituencies in which there is only one seat to be filled. When two or more seats are to be filled proportional representation based on party list system is used). Indonesia-(In the last election (July 1971) 100 of the 460 members of the DPR (Parliament) were to be appointed by the Armed Forces, the remainder to be elected by proportional representation on the party list system). Japan-(The system used for House of Representatives elections is basically one of the majority type. However, an element of proportionality is introduced to the system by the fact that the number of votes required for election must be equivalent to at least a quarter of the total valid ballots cast divided by the total number of seats to be filled in the constituency. The same system applies to elections for 150 of the 250 members of the House of Councillors, except that the relevant proportion is a sixth, instead of a quarter. The remaining 100 councillors are elected by the whole electorate acting as a single constituency, by a similar system, the proportion of the electoral quotient necessary for electors being in this case one-eighth). Mexico-(17 8 representatives of the Lower House are elected by single uninominal majority vote. The remaining 32 seals are then divided, proportionally to the votes collected for the whole of the country among the political parties which have registered as such for one year and which have now at least twenty seats). Portugal-(Use s a system similar to that which obtains in Bolivia). Switzerland-(For the election of the National Council-In the one canton and three semicantons which have a single seat each, elections are held on a uninominal single majority basis. The remaining twenty-two eantons employ a quite complicated form of the proportional party-list system). Turkey-(For Senate elections the system is similar to that which obtains in Bolivia). Pectoral Division of Stuart (Question No. 5378) B r Klugman asked the Minister for the Interior, upon notice: (1) Has the Returning Officer for the Northern Territory received a large number of statutory declarations in respect of the Electoral Division of Stuart following the Legislative Council elections 1971. (2) If so, do the declarants claim that they did not receive delivery of postal ballot-papers. ' (3) Are all the persons making the declarations Aborigines. (4) Have further complaints been received about the failure to send postal votes to eight persons formerly of Areyonga and later of Docker River. (5) Will he ensure that the ballot for the Northern Territory in the next General Elections for the House of Representatives is conducted fairly and efficiently and not so as to disfranchise the maximum number of non-Country Party voters.",171
177,Mr HUNT,POPULATION BY LEVEL OF EDUCATIONAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (5) Twenty-one statutory declarations made by Aborigines at Aileron Station were lodged with the Returning Officer for the Northern Territory on 9th March 1972 by Mr Colin Clague the unsuccessful candidate at the Legislative Council Election for the Electoral District of Stuart Investigations by a Commonwealth Police Officer have revealed that on llth November 1971 Mr and Mrs Clague accompanied by another person, who witnessed each of the 21 statutory declarations as a Justice of the Peace, went to the Aboriginal camps at Aileron where the statutory declarations were taken. Twenty of these use the words 'I did not receive a postal ballot paper for the legislative Council elections held in October 1971 and I believe I am entitled to do so*. Investigations by Commonwealth police have established that the Aborigines concerned were informed through the Station Manager that the papers were at Aileron homestead for them to collect, but that they did not collect them. The other statutory declaration claimed that the declarant had completed a postal ballot paper and returned it to the Station for posting. However, investigations have revealed that the declarant had not taken delivery of the voting papers and that the statement was evidently false, possibly as a result of poor translation. Th: investigations have revealed no irregularities in regard to postal votes for Aborigines at Aileron Station nor has any substantial evidence been submitted to the Returning Officer for the Northern Territory in regard to failure to send postal votes to Aboriginal voters elsewhere. Merchant Shipping Act (Question No. 5461) Mr Wbiflani asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: Has a formal approach yet been made to the British Government for the amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act to remove the restrictions imposed by that Act on the legislative powers of the State Parliaments (Hansard, 26th August 1970, page 566, 29th September 1971, page 1710 and 25th November 1971, page 3777).",172

(Hansard, 30th September 1971, page 1724). Sir Reginald Swartz-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The Sixth Meeting of the Australian Minerals Council was held in Newman, Western Australia on 30th May 1972. (b) The Advisory Committee to the Australian Minerals Council has met twice since 28th September 1971. Firstly in Hobart on 21st and 22nd February 1972 and secondly in Perth on 29th May 1972. (2) The Ministers who attended the Sixth Meeting of the Australian Minerals Council were: Hon. R. J. Hunt, M.P - Minister for the Interior. Hon. W. C. Fife, M.L.A - Minister for Mines and Conservation, New South Wales. Hon. J. C. M . Balfour, M.L.A - Minister for Fuel and Power and Minister of Mines, Victoria. Hon. G. R. Broomhill, M.H.A - Minister of Environment and Conservation and Minister Assisting the Premier, South Australia. Hon. D. G. May, M.L.A - Minister for Mines and Electricity, Western Australia. (3) it was announced in the Press Statement released at the conclusion of the meeting of the Australian Minerals Council that (i) the Counci] had agreed on a set of principles which it considered Governments need to have regard to in considering the matter of mining and its relation to the environment. (ii) the Coundl received a progress report by a Working Group of officers which had been formed to study the comprehensive Report of the Senate Select Committee on Offshore Petroleum Resources. (iii) the Council received a report by the Committee which bad been set up to consider the control of divers and diving operations in connection with petroleum exploration and approved, inter alia, proposals for the updating of directions and for the preparation and early promulgation of regulations relating to diving in Australian offshore areas. (iv) the Counci] considered principles which should be incorporated in mining legislation and noted that several States and the Northern Territory have this subject under active consideration. (v) the Council approved in principle proposals originated by the Geological Society of Australia for legislation to be introduced for the registration of geologists and geophysicists and the control of professional geological and geophysical practice in Australia and authorised the preparation of a first draft of legislation which would be considered for introduction into the Commonwealth and State Parliaments. 17900/72-JÂ»-16 ] (vi) the Council requested that the Bureau of Mineral Resources of the Department of National Development prepare and issue a 'layman's guide' to exploration practices and terminology designed to assist assessment of reports of mining developments. (vii) the Council also considered other matters including a report of the proceedings in the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Seabed, the prevention, control and liability in regard to blowouts and oil spillage arising from offshore petroleum activities and misrepresentation of exploration information. The honourable member has been advised previously that the Advisory Committee to the Council is a Committee of the Heads of the Departments whose Ministers are members of the Council. It is not the practice to release publicly information dealing with the operation of this and similar Committees. (4) See answer to (3) (iv) above. (3) Since September 1969, the following applications for titles over offshore areas for minerals other than petroleum have been referred to the Department of National Development: New South Wales-3 3 Queensland-1 6 Tasmania- 7 Naturalisation (Question No. SS8I) Mr Grassby asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) What reasons have been advanced by the 6 officers of his Department and accepted by the Department for their declining to become Australian citizens although having the authority to represent Australia in 6 overseas countries, as referred to in his answer to question No. 5050 (Hansard, l l t h April 1972, page 1473). (2) Does his reply mean that it is possible for other non-citizens to represent Australia overseas or is the exemption granted to one group of noncitizens only. Mr N. H. Bowen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2). In accordance with section 34 of the Public Service Act all permanent officers of the Commonwealth Public Service must be British subjects but there is no formal requirement that they be Australian citizens. The practice has not been to require officers posted overseas to take out Australian citizenship. In the absence of any legislative requirement the officers involved were not asked to advance reasons for not having taken out Australian citizenship. Nevertheless, as a matter of practice my Department satisfies itself that officers posted overseas with a representational role have a sufficient Australian connection to enable them to carry out that role effectively.

189,Mr MCMAHON,LAND DEVELOPMENT OOST COMPARISON,"The Public Board has advised me as follows: As no detailed records have been maintained concerning officers employed at 30th June 1949 parts (1), (2), (3) and (5) of the question have been answered on information available at 30th June 1948. (1) The number of officers of the First and Second Divisions in each Department of the Commonwealth Public Service at 30lh June 1948 is shown in Attachment 'A'. (2) At 30th June 1948 no allowances were payable to officers of the First and Second Divisions. Works and Housing The annual actual salary payable to each officer of the First and Second Divisions at 30th June 1948 are shown in Attachment ' B \ (3) The titles of each officer in the First and Second Division at 30th June 1948 are shown in Attachment 'B\ (4) Comparable figures and titles at 31st March 1972 are shown in Attachments ""C and ' D \ First Division Officers receiving an annual salary of $22,750 per annum receive an allowance of $1,500 per annum; First Division Officers receiving an annual salary of $19,500 per annum receive an allowance of $1,000 per annum; Second Division Officers do not receive an allowance. (5) The amount paid in salaries to First and Second Division officers in 1947-48 cannot readily be separated from total expenditure on. salaries. On the assumption that the salaries shown in Attachment 'B' were payable without variation during the whole year, the salaries paid would have approximated Â£566,000. (6) Salaries and allowances payable to First and Second Division Officers in 1971-72 cannot be readily separated from total expenditure on salaries and allowances. However, if the establishment which existed at 31st March 1972, as detailed in Attachment 'D', had been permanently staffed at those levels throughout the whole year, subject only to the Second Division salary variation of 4th November 1971, the total of salary payable (including Permanent Head allowances) would be estimated to be S 14.0m.

Mr Katter-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2), (3) and (4) Previous enquiries made of Vietnamese authorities, social welfare workers, maternity hospitals, orphanages and similar institutions have consistently revealed that it is impossible to establish the paternal origin of the part-Caucasian, illegitimate children in Vietnam. I am, therefore, unable to either refute or confirm the unsubstantiated charges referred to by the honourable member. Noise: Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) (Question No. 5614)",178
190,Mr REYNOLDS,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE,"the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) How many breaches of the curfew at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport occurred on 30th and 31st March, and 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th April 1972. (2) Who authorised the breaches and on what basis was each permitted. (3) How many complaints have been received regarding noise deriving from the open running-in or tuning of aircraft engines at the airport during the early hours of the last Easter holidays. (4) Why was the incidence of this irritating noise necessary. (5) What regulations or instructions govern these practices. (6) If necessary, will the Minister review these regulations so as to relieve thousands of residents living near the airport of distressing inconvenience during normal sleeping hours. Sir Reginald Swartz-The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) A total of 54 jet aircraft took off and landed between 1] p.m. and 6 a.m. at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport on the dates in question. The daily movements during the curfew period were: 30th March-1 4 31st March-1 5 Vietnam 1st April- 1 2nd April-Ni l 3rd April-1 1 4lh April-1 3 (2) (a) Forty-four of the movements were special flights by the domestic airlines to cater for increased public demand during the Easter holiday period. Approval to operate these flights was given by the Minister for Civil Aviation. (b) Nine of the movements were correctly scheduled at or shortly before 11 p.m. No special approval is required for such flights since the curfew is designed to prevent the regular scheduling of jet aircraft between the hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Published schedules relate to times of departure from the passenger terminal and it is accepted that some time must elapse before the aircraft is ready for take-off from the duty runway. (c) There was one breach of the curfew regulations. A flight that was scheduled for departure at 10.20 p.m., taxied at 11.10 p.m. and took off at 11.21 p.m. Approval to operate a flight delayed until after 11 p.m. must be obtained from the Regional Director, Department of Civil Aviation, New South A i r p o rt Wales Region. The Regional Director may delegate this authority to a nominee, usually thi Airport Director. Ths breach occurred on Easter eve and no such approval was sought or given for the flight. The circumstances are being investigated by the Department of Civil Aviation. (3) There is no record of any complaints regarding the ground running of aircraft engines over the Easter holiday period. Two complaints were registered on the Thursday morning preceding Good Friday. (4) Ground running of aircraft engines for test purposes and maintenance is an essential part of aircraft operations and is directly related to safety, requirements. The Department of Civil Aviation has imposed restrictions on the ground running of aircraft engines between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. and the airline operators provide regular reports to the Airport Director of all engine runs conducted between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. (5) Strict control is applied to ensure that running engines on the ground at the airport for maintenance purposes causes a minimum of inconvenience to nearby residents. The procedures cover a number of pages of instructions to operators but the primary objective of these procedures is lo ban the running of engines between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. except in unusual cases of need. In such cases special parking areas are set aside taking into consideration the wind conditions which would be likely to 'blow' the noise in a particular direction away from residences. From 5 a.m. until 7 a.m. engine running is further restricted to those aircraft required for early morning departures. (6) The regulations governing the ground running of aircraft engines are regularly reviewed by the Department of Civil Aviation. Although the number of ground running complaints is not high there is a possibility that some necessary, but routine ground running might be conducted while the aircraft concerned is on the ground at a location other than Sydney. This possibility is under investigation and may result in a reduction in the frequency of ground runs that take place at Sydney. Investment: Indonesia (Question No. 5637) Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, upon notice: (1) Will he supply the latest figures on investment in Indonesia by Auslralia and other countries?

Qantas Traffic Rights in Israel (Qoestion No. 5702)",190
192,Mr WHITLAM,PROJECTS ACCORDING TO COUNTRY OF,"the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) What steps have been taken to secure ing rights and establish booking offices for Qantas in Israel since the answers by former Ministers on 29th September 1964 (Hansard, page 1615), 20th controlled, October 1964 (Hansard, page 2132) and tember 1967 (Hansard, page 1023). (2) Which airlines now operate services to both the Arab Republic of Egypt and Israel. Sir Reginald Swartz-The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) As part of the periodic evaluation made by Qantas into the commercial prospects of adding new traffic points to its network of services, the company has kept under review the possibility of instituting a service to Israel. As has been explained' to the Israeli authorities, have led Qantas again recently to conclude that the limited end-to-end traffic between Australia and Israel does not provide a commercial basis for the commencement of services to Israel. The Government has therefore not moved to secure traffic rights in Israel nor has Qantas sought to establish booking offices there. (2) The airlines which now operate services to the Arab Republic of Egypt and services to Israel are as follows: Trans World Airlines, Alitalia, KLM, Air France, BOAC, Lufthansa, Cyprus Airways, Swissair, Sabena, Olympic Airways, SAS and Tarom. International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (Question No. 5708) Mr Grassby asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Will he urgently investigate reports of the announced decision by the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation to take over Frozen Food Industries of Australia. (2) Has his attention been drawn to the inquiry by the Senate Judiciary Committee of the United States Congress into the activities tion in connection with the appointment of Mr Richard Klemdienst as United States Attorney General, this inquiry having arisen during the course of the committee's confirmation hearings on the filling of the position of Attorney-General. (3) Has his attention also been drawn to the weekly report of the Congressional Quarterly of 25th March 1972, page 664, which refers to allegations concerning the political activities of the Corporation. (4) Can he say whether the company has indicated that it intends to buy into Australia to compensate for its losses in ChUe where the government has taken over the assets of the Corporation. (5) Can he also say whether the Parliament of Chile has determined to investigate allegations of improper political activity by the Corporation and allegations that it has sought to interfere landimproperly in democratic processes. the(6)top If the position is as stated and as half of 40 food lines in Australia are now foreign 7th Septakeover ofwillthehe companies take steps to halt any further responsible for so much of the food on Australian meal tables to safeguard our people from monopoly exploitation by foreign corporations.",191
193,Mr MCMAHON,PROJECTS ACCORDING TO COUNTRY OF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Oa 3rd May 1972 International Telephone and Telegdaph Corporation announced that its offer would be deferred until the Treasury Economic Paper 'Overseas Investment in Australia' was tabled in Parliament and the Government's general policy on overseas investment was made clear. In the circumstances, it would be premature to instigate at this stage an investigation of the these reviews takeover proposal. (2) and (3) My attention has not been specifically drawn to the matters mentioned by the honourable member. (4) and (5) No. (6) The honourable member will be aware that the Treasurer tabled in the House on 16th May 1972 the Treasury Economic Paper 'Overseas Investment in Australia'. This paper analyses, from the Australian viewpoint, (he principal economic issues raised by overseas investment in Australia and provides a basis for policy discussion. As has been announced, the Government has under review, following tabling of the paper, the policy issues which are raised by overseas investment in Australia in its various forms. States Grants Acts (Question No. 5720) Mr Sherry asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: (1) Are grants approved under the States Grants (Science Laboratories) Act and the States Grants (Secondary Schools Libraries) Act subject to audit; if so, by whom. (2) If a full statement of expenditure is requested by his Department, by whom is it authorised and at what stage is the audit submitof the Corpora- ted to the Department. (3) Are audits of this nature available to the Parliament; if not, will he consider the desirability of supplying information of this nature.",191
194,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PROJECTS ACCORDING TO COUNTRY OF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. For each year to which each of the respective Acts applies, each State Auditor-General is expected to provide my Department with a statement of expenditure of funds made available to the State for expenditure on its own schools under the governing legislation concerned. The conditions attached to an offer of a grunt to non-government secondary school, under both Commonwealth programmes, require that, in respect of a grant for building, the school concerned will supply the Minister with a report from the school's auditor, who is generally, a qualified accountant not associated with ths administration of the school, certifying the total amount expended on the project by the school. The conditions attached to offers of grants for science teaching apparatus, library books, furniture and equipment to non-government secondary schools require the school's auditor to certify to the items purchased, to give their prices and to certify that the grant made has been applied exclusively to those purchases. (2) In respect of. grants made to the Stales for Iheir own secondary schools, I refer the honourable member to my reply to part 1 of his question. As to non-government secondary, schools which receive grants for building, the Minister is supplied by the architect concerned, after construction is complete, with a report that the project has been completed to the standard shown on the approved sketch plans. The costs relating lo the project its given by the architect must be supported by the auditor's certification, to which I have referred. Auditors' statements are submitted as soon as possible after final costs of a project are known. (3) The Science Facilities Programme started in July 1964 and the Libraries Programme in January 1969. To date several thousand auditors' certificates in respect of grants made have been received by my Department under the two programmes. I am happy for the honourable member to see such statements from a particular school, if he wishes lo nominate such a school. The honourable member wiU be aware that under the provisions of the States Grunts (Science Laboratories Act 1971, and ths States Grants (Secondary Schools Libraries) Act 1971, the Minister is required to present a report to Parliament each year to which the respective Acts apply. This report contains for both government and non-government secondary, schools, the names of schools which have received assistance in the year which is the subject of the report. In addition it lists Ihe amounts paid to particular nongovernment schools. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) A i r p o rt (Question No. 5722)",191
195,Mr MORRISON,PROJECTS ACCORDING TO COUNTRY OF,"the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) Do the operations procedures at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport require aircraft to maintain track to 5 miles of the Airport before break-off is made to track to a point 3 miles from the nominated runway for landing. (2) ls it a fact that aircraft tracking on to the 07 runway and breaking off for a landing on 16 runway are only about 1,500 feet above sea level at the break off point and on the 3-mile final less than 1,000 feet (3) If so, does this procedure take aircraft residential areas. (4) If aircraft are flown over these areas will the Minister investigate the possibility of changing the procedures to ensure that aircraft are tracked onto the nominated runway for landing before they reach heavily populated residential areas in order to reduce the noise level. Sir Reginald Swartz-The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) A pilot is required to follow the route clearance until within 5 miles of the aerodrome and the aerodrome is in sight before break-off is made to track direct to a point within 3 miles of the aerodrome for approach to a nominated runway. This requirement applies at Sydney only if the pilot has been authorised for air traffic control to make a particular type of approach known as 'Visual Approach'. The possibility of such tracking occurring at Sydney is limited by: (a) noise abatement procedures which preclude air traffic controllers from permitting visual approaches in certain circumstances, and (b) normal control actions that result in aircraft necessarily being directed along different flight paths to provide anti-collision separation between aircraft and an orderly and efficient spacing of the traffic. (2) Aircraft tracking towards the 07 runway and breaking off for a landing on the 16 runway would be at or about the altitudes mentioned in your question. (3) Tracking as described does result in flight over residential areas but it is also apparent that if the break-off were to be made earlier, flight over residential areas would still be involved. (4) Consideration has already been given to ensuring thai the tracking prescribed for visual approaches is limited in the interests of noise abatement. Considering air traffic handling problems and safely aspects I am unable to foresee any early possibility of completely abandoning the use of visual approaches at Sydney Airport, even though gains in the noise abatement sense for some situations hnve been recognised for some time. I should also point out that the tracking specifications for an aircraft making a visual approach have been carefully devised as a safety requirement related to terrain clearance standards.

H. Wharmby, President of the Australian Table Tennis Association. The letters were dated 15th November 1971 and 16th January 1972. Each was replied to within a month of receipt As the honourable member is aware, my Government welcomed the suggestion that a team from the Chinese Table Tennis Association visit Australia. It was not considered appropriate for the Government to issue a statement about the visit at any time before the time at which my colleague, the Foreign Minister, issued his statement on 21st April 1972, in response to press inquiries made that day.

Papua New Guinea: Trade Commissioner (Question No. 5748) Mr Writlam asked the Minister for Trade and Industry the following question, upon notice: Has any Papuan or New Guinean yet been included in a Trade Commissioner's course? (Hansard, 20th April 1971, page 1741),",194
202,Mr ANTHONY,PROJECTS ACCORDING TO COUNTRY OF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: To date no Papuan or New Guinean has been included in a Trade Commissioner training course conducted by my Department. The training of Papuans and New Guineans in international trade matters depends on the availability of university graduates as there are no suitable indigenes available with business backgrounds. Three indigenous trade trainees have been recruited to date for full-time university study. One of these has now graduated. To further his experience, he has attended meetings of ECAFE and UNCTAD as an observer, and will possibly attend a trade promotion course in Geneva later this year. He will subsequently be considered for inclusion in a future Trade Commissioner course. The second student is currently completing the final year of his university studies, and the third student is due to graduate at the end of 1973. These 2 students will similarly be considered for inclusion in Trade Commissioner courses in the light of their suitability following graduation.

Osborne Western Samoa Laos'Professor J. D. Ovington Mr D. Forrest In December 1971 the Commonwealth agreed to contribute to the cost of a survey of the attitudes of overseas sponsored and private students in Australia. Tbis survey is being conducted by the Education Research Unit of the Australian National University as part of a multi-national project organised by the United Nations Institute for Training and Research. The fees to be paid to the Research Fellow, Mr D. S. Anderson, to cover his costs and those of his assistants over the 3 year period 1972-74 will amount to $24,000. In addition, a number of academics have carried out assignments in a consultant capacity under the Australian-Asian Universities Co-operation Scheme. Only one of these has received payment from my Department in the form of salary or fee or this consultant work. This is the Scheme's Academic Director, Emeritus Professor H. C. Forster, who has been paid a salary on a part-time basis at the rate of $2,500 per annum form 17th September 1970 and $5,000 per annum Number from 1st April 1971. 155,505 The assignments of the other academics were all for a month or less. Their Universities con1,165 tinued to pay their salaries without charge, and 74,656 the only cost to the Scheme was for payment of 571 normal travel expenses on assignment. 382 These academics included the following: Professor J.

Aircraft: Noise Levels Mr Jacobi asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: Will the Minister state (a) the take off, landing and sideline noise levels as measured in accordance with the United States Federal Aviation Administration Federal Aviation Regulation part 36 (FAA/FAR 36) in Effective Preceived Noise Decibles for the (I) Boeing 747 (late model) (II) Boeing 707-320 (HI) DC-10 (TV) Lockheed Tristar (V) Concorde preproduction model and (VI) Concorde production model (projections), (b) the noise certification standards to operate after 1975 under FAA/FAR 36 for (I) subsonic aircraft and (ID the Concorde, and those that would apply to a subsonic aircraft of similar weight to the Concorde, (c) whether modifications have been foreshadowed for aircraft which exceed these standards to bring them below the proposed limits and (d) whether the aerodynamics of supersonic flight prevent the use of high bypass ratio turbofan engines, with their low noise potential, because of the need to reduce drag, and thus, that the prospects of substantial reduction in the Concorde's noise levels are remote. Sir Reginald Swartz-The Minister for C i v i l Aviation has provided the following answers to the honourable question: (a) It is understood that the Boeing 707-320 and Concorde preproduction model aircraft have not bad their noise levels measured in accordance with the United States FAA/FAR 36. Hence I am unable to supply the noise levels requested for those two aircraft. However, noise levels for the remaining aircraft mentioned by the honourable member are available and these are quoted below: Noise levels Rt FAA/FAR 36 measuring points (EPNdB) Ap- SideAircraft type Take-oS proach line Number (i) Boeing 747-200B (latest type).. 108 109 97 4,300 (ii) Douglas DC-10-10 96 106 96 2,704 (iii) Lockheed 1011 Tristar . . 98 103 95 2,618 fivl Concorde (Production Model Projections) . . 114 115 111 1,233 927 810 The noise figures quoted have been rounded off to the nearest EPNdB and in the case of the 12,592 Concorde, since the figures are projected, one may expect small variations up or down. (b) (i) There are no known plans to change the present FAA/FAR 36 noise certification standards which, incidentally, only apply to subsonic transport category aircraft. Consequently it is anticipated at this time that Uie present FAA/ FAR 36 standards will still be applicable after 1975. (ii) At this stage there is no noise certification standards for supersonic transports and I cannot anticipate whether such standards would be developed by 1975, and if so, what they would (Question No. 5858) be. If the current FAA/FAR 36 noise standards are still applicable in 1975, the noise limits that would apply to a newly certificated four engine subsonic aircraft of similar weight to the Concorde would be: Take-off - 104.7 EPNdB Side-line - 106.6 EPNdB Approach - 106.6 EPNdB assuming an all-up-weight of 376,000 lb. (c) Considerable research and development work is in hand in the USA to investigate the feasibility of modifications to reduce noise in existing aircraft which now produce noise in excess of the FAA/FAR 36 noise limits. Insufficient work has been done at this time to indicate whether satisfactory modifications, both from the noise reduction and economic standpoints, can be developed. (d) At the present stage of technical development long range supersonic transport aircraft are only economically viable when employing comparatively slender forms for wings, body and engine nacelles which characteristically require proportionally higher thrust levels for take-off. Furthermore, the requirements for supersonic flight also require proportionately greater installed thrust than in the subsonic aircraft. The need member's to provide high thrust in small frontal area leads to the use of reheat for take-off, and transonic acceleration, and to relatively high jet efflux velocities, and makes large diameter high by-pass ratio turbofan engines quite inappropriate at this time. The prospects, therefore of substantial reduction in the Concorde's noise levels by using high by-pass ration turbofan engines instead of the existing pure turbojet engines is indeed remote. Concorde Aircraft (Question No. 5860) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) Was the Concorde designed primarily for operations across the North Atlantic. (2) Is jt a fact that early models cannot fly from European cities, e.g. Paris and Hamburg, to New York with a full payload. (3) fs the distance from Sydney to Singapore greater than the routes mentioned. (4) If so, is it a fact that Qantas cnulcl not operate the Concorde from Sydney to Singapore with a full payload. Sir Reginald Swartz-The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Manufacturers' objectives were originally to curry a guaranteed 20,000 Ib payload on early models from London to New York and this later was extended lo Paris to New York. Manufacturers are confident of achieving these objectives. (3) Yes. (4) The model planned for Qantas is expected to achieve a payload of at least 15,000 tb for the Sydney io Singapore operation. Anti-pollution Devices (Question No. 5868) Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Education nnd Science, upon notice: (1) Were tests of the MCWade Emission Control Unit, or anti-pollution device for motor cles, curried out by Dr Deslandes and Dr Walson of Melbourne University for CSIRO? (2) If so (a) what were the conclusions reached by these researchers, (b) has the CSIRO taken into account, In its examination of this unit, tests conducted by Professor J. Tindall of the University of New South Wales; if not, why not and (c) has any further work been carried out by the CSIRO on the unit or is any further work projected?",196
205,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RURAL UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF SCHEME,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) At the request of the then Prime Minister, CSIRO in early 1971 arranged for limited tests to be made by Dr H. C. Watson of Melbourne University on 2 anti-pollution devices. One of these devices was the MCWade Emission Control Unit. (2) (a) Dr H. C. Watson concluded that the MCWade Unit reduced carbon monoxide emission by 33 per cent and nitrogen oxides by about 10 per cent. The tests were made on only one vehicle and on one MCWade Emission Control Unit. These effects are very much less than those required to give a long-term solution to the problem of atmospheric pollution by vehicles, for which reductions of about 90 per cent are generally considered necessary. If an immediate shortterm control of pollution from the motor car is sought Dr Watson has pointed out that overseas tests in the United Kingdom and the United States of America have shown that reductions of up to 20 per cent in hydrocarbons and up to 50 per cent in carbon monoxide can be achieved by simple routine engineering maintenance, such as attention lo spark plugs, ignition timing, and carburettor adjustment. (b) No. Details of the tests made by Professor J. Tindall were not made available to CSIRO. (c) CSIRO has not carried out any further investigations on this unit nor are any further tests proposed. It is understood that the State Government of New South Wales is proposing to establish a testing' facility for the controlled measurement of vehicle emissions, and CSIRO does not consider it necessary or desirable that such a facility should be duplicated. Primary Industry (Question No. 5869) Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: (1) What are the activities, other than sheep research, to which he referred on 17th May 1972 in relation to CSIRO research into primary industry problems and which he said would be reorganised. (2) What is the nature of the re-organisation and what cutbacks are involved in staff and finance. (3) How many research officers engaged in primary industry research (a) were there in 196970 and 1970-71 and (b) are there in 1971-72 and what percentage of the total research officer complement do they represent for each of those years.",199
206,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RURAL UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF SCHEME,"The answer to the vehi- honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The research programme of CSIRO is never static, but develops continuously. The re-organisations I referred to on 17th May in activities other than sheep research are largely the result of this continuous development. However, some of these changes have been accelerated by alterations in the pattern of availability of funds from the various sources. There have been increases in activities in beef production, crops (particularly in the development of new crop opportunities) and environmental problems related to primary industry such as studies of increased salinity resulting from altered land use. These increases are in keeping with changes in the market opportunities for rural products and the redevelopment of special industry problems. (2) The re-organisation has been almost entirely a re-allocation of staff to projects of greater immediate importance within similar scientific fields. There has been no reduction in total staff or finance. (3) The number of research officers engaged in primary industry research in CSIRO in 1969-70 why. was 553 representing 54 per cent of the total research officer complement for that year. The correspondingfiguresfor 1970-71 are 590 and 56 per cent respectively and for 1971-72, 591 and 54 per cent respectively. Dental Services (Question No. 5912)",199
207,Mr WHITLAM,RURAL UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF SCHEME,"the Minister repreappointed senting the Minister for Health, upon notice: Has any costing yet been undertaken on the proposals by the Australian Dental Association August 1968 for (a) a Division of Public Dental Health within his Department, (b) forward plandiscussions ning, through the Universities Commission, for dental education and (c) dental services for school and school children (Hansard, 19th August 1970, page 232 and 25th November 1971, page 3768).",200
208,Dr FORBES,RURAL UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF SCHEME,"The Minister for Health has pects provided the following answer to ourable member's question: No. Parking Inspectors (Question No. 5917) Mr Enderby asked the Minister for the Interior, upon notice: (1) Are parking inspectors in the Australian Capital Territory employed by the Public Service Board, whereas in New South Wales they are officers or employees of the Police Department. (2) What are the reasons which justify parking inspectors in the A.C.T. not being members of the Police Force or made special constables. (3) What is the stipulated number of parking inspectors calculated as being sufficient to serve Canberra's needs. (4) What is the present number of parking inspectors. (5) What turnover of parking inspectors has occurred during each year since parking inspectors were first employed. (6) How many have resigned during each year. (7) What reasons were given for those resignations. (8) Is it a fact that there bave been a number of complaints from parking inspectors describing poor working conditions and abuse by the public. (9) If so, what steps have been taken to satisfy these complaints. (10) Are there any opportunities for overtime to be earned by parking inspectors; if so, what was the total overtime worked during the last 12 months. (11) Have requests been made by parking inspectors to be sworn in as special constables so that they are able to overcome some of the difficulties of their employment. (12) Have these requests been refused; if so,",200
209,Mr HUNT,RURAL UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF SCHEME,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) and (2) Parking inspectors in the Australian Capital Territory are officers of the Department of the Interior employed under the Public Service Act. It is not common today for parking inspectors to be members of police forces in Australia nor is it the practice for inspectors under Australian Capital Territory Ordinances to be made special constables. (3) and (4) The establishment for parking inspectors is 10 and 4 are employed at present. A further 6 have been recruited and are to comin mence duty during the next week or so. (5) to (9) Parking inspectors have had several with their supervisors about working conditions and abuse by the public, and every preeffort has been made to overcome the cause for complaint. A member of the public was recently prosecuted successfully for striking an inspector. The salary, the attitude of the public and prosof promotion affect the resignation rate. The table below shows the turnover rate and the honresignations of inspectors. Turnover ResigRate nation 1966 ..

(11) and (12) No parking inspector has made a request to the Department to be sworn in as a special constable. Treasury: Financial Institutions Division (Question No. 5920) Mr Enderby asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) What are the functions of the Financial Institutions Division of his Department. (2) Does the Division exercise any supervision or control over the non-life insurance business of companies, which also undertake life insurance business, through the obligation of those companies to lodge bonds for the life insurance business they undertake; if so, what control is exercised. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Financial Institutions Division of the Treasury comprises 2 Branches, the Banking and Insurance Branch and the Private Sector Transactions Branch. The Banking and Insurance Branch comprises the following 2 Sections: (a) the Banking Section, which advises on banking legislation and on administration of the Banking Act 1959-1967, the Reserve Bank Act 1959-1966, the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959-1966, the Banks (Shareholdings) Act 1972 and the Currency Act 1965; and (b) the Insurance Section, which advices on policy issues concerning general insurance and life insurance; it also attends to administration of the Insurance Act 19321966 and to certain functions connected with the deposit provisions of the Life Insurance Act 1945-1965. The Private Sector Transactions Branch comprises the following 2 Sections: (a) the Overseas Transactions Section, which advises on policy issues relating to exchange control, export insurance and export finance; and (b) the Companies Finances Section, which advises on certain aspects of overseas investment in Australia and on borrowing in Australia by overseas interests; it also advises on matters relating to the private securities markets and on aspects of company law. (2) A company which carries on non-life insurance business in addition to its life insurance ness is subject to the provisions of the Insurance Act 1932-1966 as well as to those of the Life Insurance Act 1945-1965. Such a company is required to lodged approved securities with ths Treasurer to comply with the deposit provisions of each of those Acts. Companies carrying on insurance business within the meaning of the Insurance Act 1932-1966, which have not lodged the maximum deposit, are also required lo furnish to the Treasurer annual returns of premium income. As mentioned in (1) the Financial Institutions Division attends to certain functions connected with the deposit provisions of the Life Insurance Act 1945-1965. However, these functions are confined to the issue, recording .ind safe-keeping of certificates in respect of securities lodged with the Treasurer as deposits under the Act. Airports: Bars (Question No. 5922) Mr Enderby asked the Minister repreAirports senting the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) What procedures are followed in choosing different atbyairports the lessee to operate the Backbenchers Bar at the generated Canberra Airport. (2) Are the procedures the same as the proceprices dures followed in selecting the lessees of similar this bars in other aerodromes throughout Australia; if takenwill not, in what way aie the various procedures high airport different. (3) Is it a fact that the prices charged for holic liquors in airport bars are greatly in excess of prices charged elsewhere. (4) lf so, (a) can the Minister indicate the reason for these excessively high prices and (b) are the high prices related to the rent that is paid by the lessee to the Commonwealth. (5) What is the area in square feet ct the Backbenchers Bar at Canberra Airport. (6) What is the rent paid for the area. (7) Can the Minister say how the rent compares with the rent paid for other comparable premises in Canberra. (8) lf the procedures for the allocation of a lease take into account offers by prospective lessees to pay rent and a policy of the Commonwealth to give a lease to the person offering to pay the highest rent and if this high tent is a reason for the high prices, will the Minister take steps to have this policy and practice discontinued so that the Commonwealth ceases to play a part in the exploitation of persons who travel hy air and use Commonwealth aerodromes. Sir Reginald Swartz-The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Public tenders were invited in October 1967. (2) Yes the procedures are similar. (3) The authority granted to the concessionaire specifically requires that prices for liquor and busi- other goods sold shall not exceed those charged for similar commodities in like premises in the city of Canberra. Airport prices arc subject to periodic Departmental checks but, in view of your question, a further special check will be made. (4) Previous checks have not shown the prices to be excessive. Labour costs are high at airport concessions because the operator is required to service the needs of the air - travelling public which at times can mean long hours. Nevertheless prices are required to be fair as stated in my previous reply. Prices are not related to the rents paid to the Commonwealth. Tenderers calculate their own total rents and these are formed in the knowledge of the contract requirements of the Department which are set out in the lender schedule. (5) and (6) The area of the Backbenchers Bar is approximately 700 square feet. This is about half the complete concession area for which the total monthly rent is $200 a month. In addition, the concessionaire tendered to pay a percentage of gross sales for his authority to trade under the (Business Concessions) Act. (7) This information is not held by the Department. In any case, trading circumstances are where most of the business is the airlines and the Commonwealth which provides the airport facilities. (8) The Department is not aware that high are being charged. As stated previously, be investigated and corrective action if necessary. High rents should not cause prices. Price levels are set in the tender schedules prior to tenderers deciding the alcoamount they will bid. There is no compulsion on anyone to tender and, of course, there is no compulsion on anyone to drink in the airport Cocktail lounge. In accordance with the public tendering system, concession contracts are normally granted to the highest suitable tenderer but the latter must contract to comply with the Departmental terms specified in the tender schedule before being granted the concession rights. Car Accidents in Australian Capital (Question No. 5923) Mr Enderby asked the Minister for the Interior, upon notice: (1) In the list of ten intersections in Canberra where the greatest number of accidents occurred in each of the years 1969 and 1970, how many accidents occurred at each of those intersections (question N a 5152, .Hansard, 22nd March 1972, pages 1071-3). (2) How many accidents have occurred at the Jerrabomberra Avenue and. Hindmarsh Drive intersection (a) in each year and (b) in total since the intersection was constructed.",200

(2) If so, what is this increase expressed as a percentage. (3) Does th: Government consider thut this is a reasonable increase. (4) Why has the increase occurred and what reasdns were given for the increase. (5) Does he have any control or influence over increases in the price of bread in the Australian Capital Territory. (6) If so, will he take steps to see that tha price is not increased further.",202
211,Mr HUNT,RURAL UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF SCHEME,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (6) Since July 1971 bread producers in the Australian Capital Territory have announced two increases each of 1 cent in the price of .. . . 36 unsliced. unwrapped bread in Canberra. These announcements have closely followed prices fixed . . 35 by the Prices Commissioner in New South Wales. There are no controls over the price of bread in the Australian Capital Territory.

(3) Are these incidents caused by a lack of decent housing and poor wages paid by the property owners; if so, will he use the powers vested in bim to see that decent conditions are provided for the Aboriginal stockmen, plus wages in line with standards applicable to other stockmen.",202
212,Mr HUNT,RURAL UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF SCHEME,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) Aboriginal stockmen have walked off Humbert River Station and Victoria River Downs Station in the Northern Territory. The reasons are complex but some of the Aborigines concerned have complained of lack of housing and disagreements on wages paid to them. The latter appears to be mainly over credit arrangements with the stores operated by pastoral owners. The Cattle Station Industry (Northern Territory Award) applies only to employees who are members of the North Australian Workers Union. Inspection of employment conditions for conformity with the Award is the responsibility of the Minister for Labour and National Service. The Report of the Gibb Committee which was tabled in the Parliament on 25th May contains recommendations on conditions of employment of Aborigines in the pastoral industry together with other recommendations on improving ths social and economic conditions under which Aborigines on pastoral properties now live. The Government's decisions on the major recommendations of the Gibb Committee Report were announced on 2nd June.

(4) Does the Government maks a profit the sale of land in Canberra. (5) If so, (a) how much profit was made in each of the last 5 years and (b) what was profit expressed as a percentage of the cost of servicing the land.",203
213,Mr HUNT,RURAL UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF SCHEME,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Value placed on residential land by Commonwealth is the assessed value for rating purposes. This amount currently determined using standard valuation principles and in accordance with a formula prescribed in the Rates Ordinance. The value is currently determined as at 1st January 1970. (b) The reserve price of a residential lease is determined: - by calculating the average contract price and acquisition costs incurred in making land available for lease in the most recently, developed suburbs. - the average cost is divided by the total number of revenue producing acres in the area concerned to obtain an average cost per revenue producing acre. e the cost per acre is divided by the average rating value per acre. This produces a factor, o the rating value of each individual residential lease is then multiplied by the factor to give a reserve price. Ths resultant reserve price therefore takes account of differences in quality of land. It provides a range of prices for residential leases while still ensuring that the overall cost of land development is returned to the Commonwealth. The reserve prices for business leases are set at 75 per cent of the current market value of the lease or the cost of making the land available for lease, whichever is the greater. (2) Yes. See answer to Question (1). (3) The Department keeps no record of this as up to date values are not assessed for residential leases and any figures obtained which combined current market and rating values would not be meaningful. (4) and (5) No. Total costs including past land development costs in Canberra have not yet been recovered.

I understand that the interest rate of 9.25 per cent referred to the by the honourable member applied to what is known as 'bridging'finance.If further information is required I suggest that the question be directed to the Treasurer.

(3) In determining a fair rent under the Australian Capital Territory Landlord - ind Tenant the Ordinance the Rent Controller is required by section 20 to have regard to the rate of interest is charged upon overdrafts by the Commonwealth Bank.
