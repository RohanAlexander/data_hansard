2,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"An advertisement appears in today's Argus, in which it is stated thatOn and after Monday next, coal vendors may supply householders with coal, in quantities not exceeding ' 10 cwt., within a period of twenty-eight days, providing they have previously obtained from all such persons certificates, in writing, to the effect that the quantity or quantities of coal received by them. together with the amount to be supplied, does not exceed a total of 10 cwt. during any - f twenty-eight days. I wish to know whether householders desirous of buying coal must obtain, official certificates, or will it be sufficient for them to 'write a letter 1 Many persons are unable to buy more than a cwt. of coal at a time under any circumstances.",19
3,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I can ascertain what the exact requirements of the regulation are, o i l shall let the honourable member know later in. the afternoon. MILITARY PAY.",20
4,Mr MARR,Unknown,"In view of the great discontent in the Permanent Military Forces caused by the new scale of pay, will the Minister take action to Temedy the grievances of those who complain?",20
5,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"I am aware that discontent exists in the 2nd Military District, and last night I sent an officer of the Pay Department to Sydney to inquire into the whole matter. . I think there has been some misinterpretation of an instruction there, because it is only from the 2nd Military District that we have had complaints.",20
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The position is the same is Victoria.,20
7,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"Com plaints have not been received from Victoria to anything like the extent that they are coming from New South Wales. I think there must have been a misinterpretation of the regulations governing payment under the new scale, because it is complained that married men are.now receiving less than formerly, whereas the regulations provide that a married man who is not satisfied with his pay under the new scale, may demand payment under the old scale. HIGH COURT PROCEDURE BILL . Bill presented hy Mr GROOM, and read a first time. LEAVE OF ABSENCE.",20
8,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta-Min ister for the Navy) [2.35] - B y leave, I move That leave of absence for three months given to the Chairman ol Committees, the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Chanter), on the ground ot ill-health. As honourable members know, our Chairperiod man has recently suffered the bereavement of his life-long partner, and is very much broken in health. I am sure that the House sympathizes with him in the calamity that has overtaken him, and will gladly extend to him its sympathy and every consideration within its power. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. Mr MoWILLIAMS - When will it be possible for members to see the report and evidence of the inquiry conducted by Mr Justice Ewing into the administration of the Northern Territory? - Sir JOSEPH COOK - I am unable to say. The Government have not yet had an opportunity to peruse the report.",20
9,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It has beeni published. Mr GROOM,-No .",20
10,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I saw statements in the newspapers, purporting to contain excerpts from the report, long before the report reached any member of the Government. I hope that it will not be long before the report can be made availaible to honourable members. - SALE OF UNREFINED SUGAR.",20
11,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I understand that it costs a good deal of money to refine sugar, and I ask, therefore, whether, as the price of refined sugar is now so high, housewives could not be allowed to obtain unrefined sugar for less than 6d. per lb., that is, the brown sugar to which we have become accustomed ?",20
12,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am afraid that there would be an outcry if that sugar were put on the market to any great extent.,20
13,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"-If it were cheaper, I , for one, should be glad to use it. Mr Hiix - T t would not be any",20
14,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I was interested to read the statement of the - chairman of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, published in this morning's newspaper, to the effect that rebe cently, more sugar than usual had been distributed. Where that sugar is going is, I think, a matter that needs looking into. I shall be glad to bring the honourable member's suggestion under the notice of the proper authorities. INDUSTRIAL CONFERENCE.",20
15,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I desire to know who will select the delegates to the conference which it is proposed to hold between the employers and the employees? What bodies are to select the delegates?,21
16,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not precisely know, but I should say all the representative bodies of the interests to be served. For instance, I should say that the employees will select some delegates, and the employersselect others. I do the honourable member. not know what other interests there are, but the great public interest to be served. However, the whole matter will have to be carefully considered, and I suggest that the honourable member place his question on the notice-paper, that I may be able to give him a .condoubt sidered reply. COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES. BASIC WAGE.",21
17,Mr LISTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Has the attention of the Minister representing the Prime Minister been drawn to a statement in the Argus of today, referring to certain  Sydney yesterday as to the basic wage of Commonwealth employees? I have here a clipping from that newspaper, showing that evidence was given in certain cases that the wives of Commonwealth employees have to restrict their children's appetites.",21
18,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They cannot do that!,21
19,Mr LISTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then they have to restrict the satisfaction of their children's appetites- a state of affairs which, in a country like this, is most discreditable. Are the Government prepared, so far as their employees are concerned, to allow a charge of this kind to rest, or will they at an early date consider the justice of giving these people a living wage?",21
20,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am afraid I am not able to answer the question, because there is no definite information in the excerpt referred to, but only a general statement made by certain people in the community as to the dire effects of .the present condition of things. I am afraid that there have been complaints of the kind from the beginning of time; it is, indeed, the problem of the ages, and a continuous one, as to how to so arrange and adjust our human affairs that no one shall be in want. Any man who can make a contribution to the solution of that .problem is under obligation to do so. May I add that I have seen many strange statements made before the tri dent. The other day, for instance, I saw that a workman had. declared that he could not live properly without silk socks.",21
21,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is a burlesque. Sir. JOSEPH COOK - I agree with,21
22,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is a burlesque put has always up by the employers.,21
23,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is a burlesque, and the less we have of such nonso sense the better for all concerned. No there are cases of deprivation, and it is the obligation of the Commonwealth, and of every body of men in the community, to alleviate them if it be possible. SIR WILLIAM BIRDWiOOD. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - Can the Minister for the Navy say whether any suggestion has been made regarding the appointment of Sir William Birdwood as next Governor General?",21
24,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have no information whatever. I do not know what is to be the future of the popular General; but, so far, no information has reached me of any such appointment.",21
25,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is there any foundation for the rumour that the touring of the Commonwealth by Sir William Birdwood is fitting him for the High Commissionership ? Is he a- "" starter "" ? Sir JOSEPH .COOK - I have no d6ubt that that worthy gentleman could fill many positions, and in his time will play many parts. WAR GRATUITY.",21
26,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"May applications now be submitted for the gratuity payable under the War Gratuity Act? Further, to what officer may applications be addressed, and are printed forms provided for the purpose of facilitating the business?",21
27,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Application s may be made at once, and the sooner they are made the better. There are printed forms at the post offices and other public places, and they must be distributed as widely as possible. The sooner applications are in the better it will be for the Government, and the better for the people concerned. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). NA SOUTH AUSTRALIA.",22
28,Mr SPEAKER,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"I have received an intimation, from the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The establishment of a ""War Service Homes Department in the State of South Australia."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",22
29,Mr BLUNDELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Adelaide) [2.50] - I desire to make clear that, in bringing under the notice of honourable members the establishment of a branch of the War Service Homes Department in South Australia, I am not doing so with any idea of opposing the building of homes for soldiers, but because I believe that the inauguration, of the Eederal Department in Adelaide will lead to a waste of public money, and will make it more difficult for soldiers to secure homes for themselves. I realise, of course, that if action is to be taken it must be taken very early, for the reason that already applications have been called for the filling of quite a number of positions; and - honourable members know full well that from the moment when an individual has been, appointed to a Government position, and he has dipped his pen in departmental ink, nothing under the sun will ever shift him. We have in South Australia a system, to which I shall presently refer, for the building of soldiers' homes; but I desire first to direct attention to what is proposed to be done by the Federal authorities. The Commonwealth Government, obviously recognising that in South Australia there was already in operation a system for the construction of houses for soldiers, appointed. Captain Bell, of the Repatriation Department, as Deputy Commissioner. At first,. I considered that that was a very good and economical arrangement. Working,, as it did, in conjunction with the State Bank, it entailed very little, if any, increased expenditure to the Commonwealth. Later, however, Colonel Baker, who had been originally Deputy Commissioner, was appointed to represent the architects, Messrs. Kirkpatrick Brothers. This arrangement, however, continued for only a brief period. A Mr. Duckmartin was sent over to represent the architects, and he has since been replaced by Mr Milne, an Adelaide architect, to represent Messrs Kirkpatrick. The very latest situation is that a Captain Earle has been appointed Deputy Commissioner. Following his establishment in office^ and having taken premises in Franklin-street, the Deputy Commissioner invited applications for the fillingof a number of minor positions. Honourable members will perceive, by the following list, that it is intended to establish a Department of considerable strength:£ Surveyor in Charge . . .. 408 Assistant. Surveyor . . 372 Draughtsman .. .. 258 . Draughtsman .. .. 258 Chainman (approximate) .. 188 Architect in Charge . . 408 Architectural Draughtsman .. 2041 Architectural Draughtsman .. 298/ Rangie Building Inspector .. .. 408 Inspector and Clerks of Works 270 Foreman of Works .. .. 312 Accountant .. .. .. 360 Sub-Accountant and Clerks 2101Sub-Accountant and Clerks . . 270 J g e R a n Contract Clerks .. .. 210 General Section and Records . . 186 General Section and Records .. 24;11} Range Messenger . - .. .. 72 Typistes .. .. '' 72 Typistes .. .. .. 150I} Range Total .. £5,159 The list does not include the salary of the Deputy Commissioner or touch on the outlay upon. rent. It is fair to suggest that the Department will cost more, than £7,000 per annum; and we know that when 'it has been established it will extend its scope and influence from this comparatively small beginning. I would raise no objection, in fact, it would be my duty to assist and support the project, but that there is already in existence in South Australia a Department which is efficiently and satisfactorily meeting requirements. The South Australian Government, in 1916, passed an Act for the building of soldiers' homes, and since that period they have been carrying on with remarkably few complaints; generally, indeed, the Department has given very great satisfaction. Since the inception of this activity the State Bank has built and bought, and paid off mortgages upon houses, representing a total of 3,574 dwellings. In addition, there are about 600 houses in the course of construction, and their total approximate cost is £381,000. The average cost of each house built in South Australia has been £577 10s. l i d . ; that cludes cost of land. The material in every instance is brick and stone. I invite honourable members to inspect photographs of some of the homes, which are on view in the Queen's Hall. They will note that the dwellings are of four and five, and, in some instances, more, rooms; and that they vary in appearance, all of them being modestly attractive. The lowest wall of any of the houses yet built measures, from floor to ceiling, 10 feet. The total amount spent by the State Government in building, to date, represents £2,064,139. The Act provides that the sum of £700 can be expended in the buying of land and the building of a soldier's home. Honourable members will agree, I am sure, that the price compares more than favourably with that for similar work, carried out in any other part of the Commonwealth. The South Australian Government have also very wisely purchased large areas of land, which have been specially town-planned, as the basis of future garden cities. These localities before very long will rank among the finest assets which any State could possess. The areas are laid out with ample recreation reserves, and the streets are already planted with trees. The houses in the town-planned areas will cost only a little more than £500 each.",22
30,Mr BJXEY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,Does the Commonwealth Bank assist in financing the State vernment project?,23
31,Mr BLUNDELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"No ; the State is raising the money from its own resources. The advances are made for a term not exceeding fifty years and carry interest at the rate of 4-J per cent, per annum. Those are a great deal better terms than the Commonwealth authorities are offering. In addition, the State Government provide that soldiers' homes shall be free of all rates and taxes, including water rates, for the 'first period of five years. Assistance of that nature, it must be admitted, amounts to a very considerable allowance.",23
32,Mr FENTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,And the State is getting no financial backing from the Commonwealth?,23
33,Mr BLUNDELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Non e whatever. Instead of receiving financial assistance, inindeed, the State has now to face active competition in carrying out its work on behalf of South Australian soldiers.",23
34,Mr RODGERS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"That is to say, the State authority is still continuing to build these homes ?",23
35,Mr BLUNDELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Yes , both for soldiers and for soldiers' widows. The maximum amount of rent required from those assisted is 7s. per week; the amount varies, of course, with the size of the house. The average rent which a widow is required to pay for her home, which is given to her for life, amounts to 5s.",23
36,Mr RODGERS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"I take it that both the State and Federal Departments are competing in respect to land, material, and labour.",23
37,Mr BLUNDELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Yes , that is one of the chief points which I have in mind. An advance t>f £600 is repayable by equal monthly instalments of principal and interest as follows:Approximate Term. Instalment. Weekly Equivalent. s. d. s. d. 15 Years .. 15 1 .. . . 3 6 20 Years .. 12 9 .. ..211 30 Years .. 10 2 .. . . 2 4 42 Years .. 8 11 .. . . 2 1 50 Years .. 8 5 ... .. II I South Australia ought to be very proud lof those terms, and the system ought not to be jeopardized by the establishment of a competing Department by another Government; because the moment the Commonwealth Goestablishes a Department in South Australia for the building of homes for soldiers, it is only natural the officers of that Department will push matters for all they are worth to justify themselves, which means that they will be out to buy land and secure contracts for the building - of houses. Thus they will considerably increase the cost of land and building material, thereby creating difficulty for the State in carrying out its work. The establishment of a Commonwealth Department for the building of"" soldiers' homes in South Australia will have a bad effect on the soldiers.",23
38,Mr RILEY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,What are the Commonwealth officers doing in South Australia now?,24
39,Mr BLUNDELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"They are making preparations to build homes for soldiers; but what soldier is likely to accept the conditions of the Commonwealth War Service Homes Act, liberal as it is, in preference to the South Australian system?  member has not stated the whole case.",24
40,Mr BLUNDELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,No ; I intend to explain it further. The Commonwealth Act extends its advantages to classes of men not embraced by the South Australian Act. The latter is restricted to men in receipt of a salary of not more than £300 a year. And the Commonwealth will build houses for practically any returned soldier.,24
41,Mr RILEY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,Is not that an improvement ?,24
42,Mr BLUNDELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"I admit that it is an improvement on the South Australian Act. The Commonwealth Act also includes munition workers. However, the State Government, through their efficient Department, which has been established .for twenty years, are prepared to administer that portion of the Commonwealth Act which makes provision for the classes of persons not covered by the State Act. There is no justification for creating a new Department simply to cover the classes of persons not covered by the South Australian legislation. It ought to be pospresent prices. sible for the Commonwealth to act in cooperation with the State Governments, and, if necessary, appoint one officer to act conjointly with the State Bank in 3""£Lti6S ^ order to carry out the work of building houses for munition workers and others and soldiers in receipt of a bigger income than £300 a year.",24
43,Mr BRENNAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,Is not the Commonwealth Office in South Australia a branch of the Eederal War Service Homes Department?,24
44,Mr BLUNDELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"It is; but, as there is already in operation in South Australia a State system of building soldiers' homes, there is no need for the creation of another Department in that State for this purpose. We ought to be able to co-ordinate the work, and avoid the unnecessary building up of a new Department.",24
45,Mr BRENNAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,Would it not be the better form of co-ordination to allow the Commonwealth Government to control the whole of the work throughout Australia ?,24
46,Mr BLUNDELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"The honourable member's interjection raises another issue. On an appeal to the electors, both the South Australian Government then in power and the Opposition pledged themselves that if they were returned to power they would establish a system of home building, and the Government, which was returned to power, carried out its pledge, and now feels it an obligation to carry on the work which it undertook. In any case, if the State Act were repealed, and the whole of the activities of building soldiers' home3 were handed over to the Commonwealth, the soldier who builds in the future in South Australia will be placed at a disadvantage as compared with one whose house has already been built by the State Government. In South Australia we have already felt the competition of the Commonwealth. Contractors are beginning to withdraw their contracts; in fact, one contract has already been withdrawn because the claim is made that since the Commonwealth have come into the business, the cost of bricks and materia! and so forth has increased beyond the prices on which their tender was originally based. One contract now under consideration deals with the building of 1,000 houses. The contractors are now finding out that they cannot carry on their contracts at the",24
47,Mr FENTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Hav e the State Government the same right of land resumption as the Commonwealth has, at reasonable _ Mr BLUNDELL - The State legislation authorizing the resumption of land for public utilities does not cover the acquisition of blocks for soldiers' homes, but the State Government purchase the land in the ordinary way, and find no difficulty in getting plenty of it at reasonable prices. If a soldier wishes to build a house in a particular locality, such as Park Terrace, Unley, where land is considerably higber in value than elsewhere, the State Bank will assist him in effecting the purchase if he is prepared to put down a little of his own money. The State Government do not insist on all the soldiers living in these garden cities they are building; they are prepared to build elsewbere, wherever a man thinks it advantageous for him to live. I do not submit this matter as a carping critic. If the Minister doubts what I say, I ask him to send a reliable officer to South Australia to make an investigation; and, if as the result of that visit the officer is satisfied with the manner in which the State are undertaking this work, then let us have common-sense co-ordination between the Commonwealth and the State in this regard, and avoid the expense of building up a new Department. I am sure that if these inquires are made, the Minister will find that it will be beneficial to the soldier and the taxpayer alike not to create a new Department in South Australia for the building of soldiers' homes. I submit this matter today because it is urgent that it should be dealt with before applications for the advertised positions close. Otherwise, these officers will be appointed, and there will be great difficulty in getting them out of their positions. I bope that the House will give the matter the serious consideration it deserves, in the interests of the soldiers; and I confidently appeal to my honourable friends in the Economy corner.",24
48,Mr ROBERT COOK,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,Does the same thing apply in all the States?,25
49,Mr BLUNDELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"No . Some of the States are not undertaking the work of building soldiers' homes. H the Commonwealth is doing this work in New Sotith Wales and Victoria, there is no need for the States to step in, but where the States are already doing it, the Commonwealth should not interfere. Where, however, the States are not building these houses, let the Commonwealth do so.",25
50,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Wakefield) [3.11] - I wish to supplement the remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) by making a comparison between the styles of houses built in South Australia and those built in Victoria. I have inspected many of the latter, and if the Minister for Repatriation will send to Adelaide a competent expert from his Department, I shall be guided by his decision as to whether the State authorities there are. not making a better job than is being made in the other States. The State Bank in South Australia is operating on eighteen different designs of houses. I have here a sample plan which shows one large bedrodm 15 feet 6 inches by 12 feet, a second bedroom 12 feet by 11 feet, a drawingroom 13 feet by 12 feet, a dining-room 15 feet by 14 feet, a kitchen 12 feet by 11 feet 6 inches, and a bathroom, laundry, and conveniences. I ask honourable members to compare the sizes of those rooms with the sizes of the rooms in the houses we inspected in Victoria a few days ago. In every one of the South Australian houses, there is a clear height of 10* feet from floor to ceiling in each room. I believe that the height in Victoria was 9 feet, but it is being raised to 10 feet. The South Australian blocks of land would average at least one-third larger than the blocks on which the houses in Victoria have been built.  difference in land values.",25
51,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Land values may be partly the explanation, but a good many of the houses in Adelaide are within 2 miles of the General Post Office. .  for this purpose within 2 miles of the Melbourne Town Hall.",25
52,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"The houses we inspected in Victoria were 6 or 7 miles from the General Post Office, and there ought not to be a very great disparity in values between land 2 miles from the Adelaide General Post Office and land 6 mile3 from the Melbourne General Post Office.  between the populations of Adelaide and Melbourne.",25
53,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Neithe r is there any comparison between the prices of the land, nor the solidity of the houses erected in the two cities. I call the attention of honourable members to photographs showing the finished work that has been put into the houses in Adelaide. Of the houses which have been provided, half have been constructed and the others have been purchased. I call attention to the fact that as soon as the Commonwealth Bank's officers stepped into the business of buying houses the value of similar houses rose within a week nearly £100 each, and as the honourable member for Adelaide said, the presence of two big competing parties for buildings led to an increase in every item of - building material. The State Bank, as the agent of the South Australian Government, was engaged for eight or nine years prior to entering upon this work for soldiers in building houses for civilians. So that its officers have had a great deal of experience of house-building. During those eight years, and also during the last three or four years, since they have been building soldiers' cottages, they have employed continuously a number of small contractors. From the ginning the Department weeded out any contractors who showed a tendency towards "" j e r r y "" building, and only kept those in whom it had the utmost confidence^-me n who could be left to complete a house from foundation to roof, with absolute confidence on the part of the authoa rities that no bad work would be put into it. That is the reason why the State Bank has been able to erect these houses at an average cost of £577 10s. l i d each. There is no comparison between that cost and the cost of houses built in other States.",25
54,Mr GREGORY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,Much depends upon the date on which the houses were built.,26
55,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"All the soldiers' homes have been built since the 15th November, 1917, when the Act came into operation. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) has rightly said that the entry of the Commonwealth Bank upon the scene has led to every contractor withdrawing from the service of the State Bank. They have said, '''""We have two strings to our bow now, and we shall get better prices.""",26
56,Mr TUDOR,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,Hav e they done so?,26
57,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Yes ! Unless this competition is discontinued, the South Australian Government will have no alternative but to withdraw from the work.",26
58,Mr GREGORY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,There are three governmental construction authorities now. That is preposterous.,26
59,Mr TUDOR,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,I thought the honourable member believed in competition.,26
60,Mr GREGORY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"I desire competition, but not three construction authorities.",26
61,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"The honourable member for Dampier does not believe in a firm competing against itself, but that is, in effect, what is being done today. In regard to the objection that the State Bank does not build for soldiers receiving an income of more than £300 per annum, I know that the State Bank is prepared to submit tomorrow to the Minister for Repatriation an offer to build all the houses he requires at a charge of only \ per cent, for supervision.",26
62,Mr RILEY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,What is the honourable member's policy in regard to soldiers who have no money?,26
63,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"My policy beis to do one thing well at a time, instead of starting impossible things. The charge of half per cent, for supervision covers everything. There are no architect's fees, neither are there any agreements, registrations or anything else to be paid for. I appeal to my honourable friends on the Public Works Committee to say whether charge of half per cent, for the supervision of such work is not a very small one. I wish now to make a few observations in commendation of the attitude of the State Government. It undertook this work in fulfilment of a pledge made long before the Commonwealth scheme was suggested', and, in accordance with that pledge,' it charges interest on deferred payments at the rate of only 4$ per cent, per annum, which ds considerably less than what it has to pay for its money. If this competition between the Commonwealth and the State is to go on, with the result that prices of building material continue to go up, the State Government will not be able to continue the work. It is a question whether the Commonwealth should not find the money for the State Government of South Australia just as it is findings the money for the erection of war service homes in the other' States; but on this point of overlapping and' competition I am satisfied that I shaU not appeal in vain to the opinion of the House. I ask honourable members to examine the photographs of buildings erected by the South Australian Government and to carefully consider the whole question. I have only to say in conclusion that I feel fairly confident that the Minister for Repatriation does not desire to continue this unjustifiable competition.  Home and Territories) [3.23] - I am rather glad that the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) 'has brought forward this question, since the position of the Department will stand the test of investigation. I shall deal first of all with the comparison which the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard' Foster) made of the cost of war service homes here and of those built in Adelaide by the State. He touched the spot, although he did not seem to realise it , when he said that the price of land - in the suburbs of Adelaide is much cheaper than in the metropolis of Melbourne. I think there is a difference of about £ 1 0 0 between the cost of the war service homes built in Melbourne and those erected in Adelaide, and it will be found that the higher cost of land in this State fairly well accounts for the difference. There is a good deal to be said in favour of the building scheme which is carried on by the State Bank of South Australia. The scheme, however, was never in tended to apply to the building of soldiers' homes. It was originated some years ago to provide for the erection of homes for workmen who were not in receipt of more than £300 per annum. Under that scheme a deposit of something like 40 per cent, is required, and the authorizing Act fixes the rate of interest at 4£ per cent.",26
64,Mr BLUNDELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,Returne d soldiers have not to pay a halfpenny by way of deposit under the State scheme.  ber is mistaken.,27
65,Mr BLUNDELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"I introduced the Bill in the South Australian Parliament, and I ought to know what its provisions are.  time ago it was suggested to the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) that the Commonwealth should finance the State Bank of South Australia in the building of homes for returned soldiers, since it had undertaken rather more than it could carry out in connection with the State housing scheme. H is reply was that he could not, having regard to the limitations imposed by the State Act . For instance, we erect homes for soldiers, soldiers' dependants, sailors, and nurses, as well as for munition workers and war workers.",27
66,Mr BLUNDELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"The South Australian Act covers all, with the exception of munition workers and war workers.  still leaves a number unprovided for. We have today applications for the erection of no less than 893 houses in South Australia. Of these applications, 375 have been approved.",27
67,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,How many of the applicants aTe in receipt of more than £300 per year?  Can we support a scheme which is limited to persons in 'receipt of not more than £300 per annum?,27
68,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"But the State has offered to do the work at a charge of i per cent, for supervision.  that. Honourable members must realise that it would be impossible for the M in ister to support a scheme adopted by one State which differed fro m that in operation in another.",27

He told me that it would be more to the advantage of the soldiers, under certain conditions, to do so, because the States got money at 4$ per cent.",28

78,Mr RODGERS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Wannon) [3.33] The House is indebted to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) for having in a very temperate manner brought this matter before it . He has a first-hand knowledge of the facts, being the Minister responsible for the South Australian legislation. My only concern in this matter is in preventing duality of control. Apparently in this case, as in so many others, immediately the Commonwealth takes a step forward it treads on the heels of the States, the State and Commonwealth authorities trying to do the same work. On a previous occasion, in connection with the pensions, I made a firm protest, and took what action I could to prevent the establishment of two Departments, and I again tell the Minister that whenever it is possible, to prevent the duplication and overlapping of Commonwealth and State Departments, I shall consistently' try to prevent it . I can see ahead of us a thundering debt, which will be piled up as th© result of huge programmes for naval construction and other defence work, and' unless the governing authorities of Australia set to work to define their respective domains, and keep within those domains, the financial d r if t will be hopeless. It behoves every member of the House to take a definite stand against duplication of effort. In my opinion, the Commonwealth, had it conferred with the States at the inception of the war service .homes scheme, could have come to an arrangement with them which would have satisfied both parties. Recently I travelled with the Western Australian Minister responsible for the building of homes. He thought that he had conlook at cluded an arrangement with the Minister for Repatriation, but shortly afterwards he got a message calling it off. The Commonwealth Bank is going to carry out in Western Australia the construction work which it sanctions. Thus there will be two separate building authorities, two staffs competing for the limited amount of building material available.",28
79,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,And for limited amount of labour available.,29
80,Mr RODGERS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Yes , and the Australian soldier will be faced with two sets of conditions, one better than the other. It is woeful that, after so many protests in this chamber, this lack of business cooperation should continue. I shall not vote for a duplication of effort by the Commonwealth where work is being carried out effectively by a State.",29
81,Mr GREGORY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Dampier) [3.37] I wish to draw attention to what came under my notice a few days ago in Western Australia. Like the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers), I have a great objection to duplication, but in Western Australia. I saw, not duplication, hut triplication.",29
82,Mr JAMES PAGE,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,The only way to stop that is by the adoption of Unification.,29
83,Mr GREGORY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"That would be to go to an even greater absurdity. I have seen so much of Commonwealth administration that I would be sorry for a distant State that had to entrust all its interests to this Parliament. In Western Australia a Department was formed many years ago for the construction of workmen's homes. I have never been in favour of either the Commonwealth or a State carrying out work of that kind on the day-labour system. But the establishment of the Western Australian Department has had the good effect of keeping contractors from putting their heads together. Where you are not tied down to one system without competition, .you get good results. I believe that in South Australia they had a similar Department. In the West there are architects, clerks of works, and the full staffs necessary for the carrying out of building operations. When the war service homes scheme was agreed upon, the Commonwealth put a staff of its own into Western Australia. It is necessary to have a Deputy Controller in each State to administer the affairs of the War Service Homes Department, but I see no reason why negotiations for the carrying out of building operations should not have been concluded with the States. The Western Australian Department is at present building workers' homes, and could construct war service homes. Now, the Deputy Controller of the Commonwealth Department is building houses for soldiers in certain parts of the State, and the Commonwealth the Bank employs another staff doing similar work. I went round with the Deputy Controller, and saw some very fine work that has been done by his Department. I was quite satisfied with the; work that he showed me; but when at Geraldton I was informed that at Mullawa an application for a soldier's home had been approved, but nothing was done for five or six months, and then, suddenly word came from the Commonwealth Bank that the whole matter was to remain in abeyance for some time longer. Then, at Geraldton, the Commonwealth Bank purchased land on which a war service home was to be erected, but a few weeks prior to the date arranged for the marriage of the young fellow who was to occupy it , word came from the Bank that the work was not to be proceeded with for some time. When I returned to Perth, I got the Deputy Controller to take the matter in hand, and to give a decision regarding it. When the Repatriation Departmenttakes work out of the hands of the State, those in the cities may be well catered for, but the requirements of those in the country cannot be met, because the Commonwealth Department has not a staff to do country work, whereas the State Departments have officers in different districts, and are able to carry out work anywhere without undue delay.",29
84,Mr RODGERS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,Unde r the supervision of experienced men.,29
85,Mr GREGORY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Yes . The Deouty Controller has no officials in the country, and, therefore, applications for war service homes coming from soldiers in the country are inordinately delayed. I do not think that the Government should put up houses in out-of-the-way places, where, if they were left untenanted by the soldiers for whom they were built, they would be of no value at all; but in districts having a recognised settled future, the Department should erect houses without delay, and the Government should be more ready to give assistance to persons living in the country than to persons living in the cities, so as to prevent the drifting of population to the cities. I do not say that the ""big city constructions should not go on, but the other work is, to my mind, of more importance. The duplication of effort by the Commonwealth Bank and the Deputy Controller should be stopped. do not want the Commonwealth Bank to send officials to Western Australia.",29
86,Mr RILEY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,H as the Western Australian Government received any assistance from the Commonwealth Bank?,30
87,Mr GREGORY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"I do not know; hut in this case, the Commonwealth Government finds the money.",30
88,Mr RILEY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"If it has, that may be the reason why the Bank wishes to have a hand in the matter. We are responsible to the soldiers, not to the State authorities, in respect of these houses.",30
89,Mr GREGORY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"The Commonwealth Bank, having satisfied itself as to the security for any advance, should allow the work to be carried out by the War Service Homes Department, instead of using officers of its own. I hope .that in the future there will not be the delays in the building of war service homes that there have been in the past.",30
90,Mr MATHEWS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Melbourne Ports) [3.45] - I hope that the Government will not agree to the suggestion of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . Blundell). In common . with other honourable members, I would, if I could, abolish duality of effort. There are many reasons why the Commonwealth should not hand this work over to the States. The Department in South Australia was brought into existence for the specific purpose of providing homes for workers with a-certain wage; and I have information to the effect that this Department has not proceeded with the work at anything like the speed expected. Whether that was because there is an unsympathetic Government in power I do not know, but they have done very little in the matter of workmen's homes. We are told that if there are two authoritative bodies seeking building material, it will have the effect of raising prices; but even if the States do the work, the volume of demand on their part will have the same effect. It is a fact that in South Australia now there is a greater scarcity of building material than in any othei 'State; and, as I say, it does not matter how many Departments undertake this work, the volume of the demand will create difficulty. I am strongly of opinion that the Commonwealth should undertake this work. Of course, I regret that there should be any duplication, but if we make this special arrangement in the case of South Australia we shall have We the other States, perhaps, asking for variations. The Government made a. great mistake in introducing the Commonwealth. Bank into this business, for the Bank, when it had control of the finances, bungled matters. I undertake to say that a house, constructed under the supervision of the Commonwealth Bank will cost 10 or 20 per cent, more than a house built by another authority.. Under the circumstances, the Commonwealth Bank should be withdrawn from this work in every State; and I wonder that this has not been done before. We ' did have & hint that it would be done. ",30
91,Mr MATHEWS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"I am glad to hear that statement. I have always held thatwhere the States Departments can be used with advantage they should be used, but in the present case I do not think that any advantage would accrue.",30
92,Mr GREGORY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,I suggest that there should be a Government agent in absolute control in each State.,30
93,Mr MATHEWS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"The r e is always a difficulty in an arrangement of that kind. If we hand over this work to the South Australians, - can we believe that there will not be a considerably increased staff necessary ?",30
94,Mr GREGORY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,The staff is there already.,30
95,Mr MATHEWS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"But an increased volume of work must mean an increased staff, and there will always have to be supervision exercised by the Commonwealth.",30
96,Mr GREGORY,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,That would be cheaper than separate Departments.,30
97,Mr MATHEWS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,That remains to be seen.,30
98,Mr RODGERS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"In South Australia,, over 3,000 homes have been constructed with the present machinery.",30
99,Mr MATHEWS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"That was for State purposes, and not for the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth is looked on by the State Governments as a good "" milch cow.""",30
100,Mr TUDOR,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"South Australia need not grumble, seeing that no payment has been made for the job at Port Pirie. I should deduct the money from the Commonwealth per capita allowance.",30
101,Mr MATHEWS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"That is what I should do. There is much trouble caused by the overlapping of the State and Federal authorities, and even by the overlapping of one Department over another. It seems that one Department dislikes doing work for another, and, if the work is done, it is at an increased cost. I do not say it is impossible for the Director of the War Service Homes to make arrangements in South Australia, for example, hut I do not believe that such arrangements would give such satisfaction as would control by the Government. I have heard much of what has been done in Victoria in regard to war service homes, and certainly the work has been much better than anything that oould have been done by the States. The building of these homes has caused an extra demand for material, but if they were not being built, other houses would have to be provided by the people. If other States follow the example of South Australia, we shall find the war service homes being erected under five or six different systems. I agree with the suggestion that a conference should be held, for it is quite possible that the outcome might be beneficial, though I have my doubts. My advice is that the work be handed over to the State, but that the conditions shall be set down in black and white to.insure that the Commonwealth shall not be used as a ""milch cow.""",30
102,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Kooyong) [3.54] - In October last, in my place in the House, I registered my strongest protest against the triplication of work in connection with the., war service homes. Eirst, there were the State Savings Banks, which had experience and all the necessary machinery for the work; next, there was the sub-Department established in the Repatriation Department itself; and, thirdly, there was the Commonwealth Bank, which created a war service homes branch. I protested against the extravagance .involved, and for reasons which I then stated. In 1918, when the War Service Homes Bill was before us, there was, with much approval, inserted section ' 50, by which the Minister was specially authorized to make arrangements with the several State Savings Banks for the purposes of the Act. The Minister in charge of the Bill commended the splendid work done by these banks in the matier of workmen's homes and --o forth, and indicated that it was his intention to negotiate with them with the object of their undertaking the work; indeed, he said he was already in negotiation with them. Those .negotiations were consummated in the following June, and, as a result, the State Parliaments passed Acts enabling the State Savings Banks to undertake this work. In Victoria-and I presume in the other States-the State Treasurer introduced the necessary measure, and indicated what had been definitely settled between the State and the Commonwealth. Eor some extraordinary reason, however, the Repatriation Department took up the position that they could not carry out the agreement; and it is believed that this was because of the determined pressure of the Commonwealth Bank. The business of the State Savings Banks had 'been entered upon by the Commonwealth Bank, and the latter viewed with a degree of dismay the undertaking of this work by the State institutions. The Minister,pfor some reason, yielded to the representations of the Commonwealth Bank, which immediately created a war service homes branch. The Savings Banks of the States were carrying out this clas3 of work at an administration cost of 10s. per cent.; nevertheless, the Commonwealth Bank took up the work.",31
103,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,That left much ill-feeling.,31
104,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"It did. In addition, as I say, the Repatriation Department itself created a sub-Department to carry on the same work. Colonel Walker was appointed Commissioner, and he was duly provided with a staff of architects and other officers; but they had not been very long at work when much friction and irritation arose between the Commonwealth Bank and the sub-Department.",31
105,Mr BURCHELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Is the matter settled yet? v Sir ROBERT BEST - I do not think so; and it is not likely to be settled. It is the clear duty of the Government to insist that the Commonwealth Bank shall withdraw from all participation in the matter of the war service homes. The Bank ought to stick to its own business, and, certainly, war service homes do not come within its purview.",31
106,Mr RODGERS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,Has there been any Ministerial explanation of the abandonment of the original arrangement?,31
107,Sir ROBERTBEST,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"I have not heard of any public explanation, and the incident is a very regrettable one. I do not wish to indulge in an attack upon the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen). I realise the magnificent work which he has performed ; but whatever may have been the motive which forced him from his original attitude, and permitted the Government to consent to this flagrantly extravagant arrangement, resulting in triplication of work, I urge that, even at this late hour, the Commonwealth Bank be called upon to cease its operations in this direction. Its activities have aroused an infinite number of complaints on the part of soldiers themselves. I have received no end - of letters complaining of delays of a most unconscionable character, respecting the operations of the Bunk. Occasionally I have forwarded these letters to the War Service Homes Commissioner, asking for a reason for such delays. All he has been able to say is, "" I have no corf't r o l ; I refer you to the Commonwealth Bank."" It is a disgraceful state of affairs. In connection with the work of the Commonwealth Bank, in having undertaken duties which it did not understand, and for which it was never equipped, it prepared and issued certain plans and specifications in regard to the homes it proposed erecting, and these were condemned in no measured terms by the Institute of Architects in Sydney. The whole trouble has arisen because the Commonwealth Bank has insisted upon undertaking duties which it had no right to handle. I congratulate the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) upon having brought the subject before the House, and I .congratulate him-as representing the South Australian Government originally concerned-upo n the work so splendidly achieved in that State. It is an object lesson, which speaks for itself; and it indicates the wisdom of the previous views of the Minister for Repatriation when he stated that the State machinery was. the proper machinery, of which the Commonwealth should avail itself for the purpose of constructing soldiers' homes. Economy and efficiency would be best consulted along those lines. Here we have a magnificent example, anda verification of the ideas voiced by myself, as well as by a number of other honourable members, when the section of the Act concerned was originally under discussion. We then commended the intentions of the Minister for Repatriation, and I now urge that he should see his way clear to insist that the Commonwealth Bank have nothing further to do with the construction of homes, and that, in the interests of reducing expenditure, he will permit the States to carry on. Of course, there must be some degree of supervision on the part of the Repatriation Department respecting the work done by the States, but that is a matter for easy and ready adjustment. Only a mere skeleton staff need be kept by the Commonwealth Department for supervision purposes. If the Commonwealth had availed itself of the State institutions from the beginning, in regard to the construction of . soldiers' homes, the work would have been carried on most actively, effectively, and economically. . Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [4.5] One of the causes for all this trouble, I dare say, is that the Commonwealth Bank, having started a Savings Bank branch, is out to do certain work along the lines of the State Savings Banks, in the matter of the Credit Foncier system. I do not know whether the functions of the Commonwealth Bank are to be enlarged by pending legislation, ""but some arrangement between Commonwealth and State Savings Bank institutions would be welcome, whereby considerable duplication might be ended. The Commonwealth Bank has engaged a firm of architects, which is to get so much for house designs submitted, and a percentage for supervision of building. It is a very pushing firm, working in association with a pushing institution, namely, the Commonwealth Bank. I have been wondering whether the architects have not pushed the Repatriation Department into fields of activity in which their services were not called for.",32
108,Mr FRANCIS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,They have pushed them out altogether.,32
109,Mr FENTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Whether that be so or not, it is certain that if a man is appointed upon a commission basis he will get as much work as possible, whether in this State or another. If these architects have the drawing up of very many specifications for a considerable number of houses in South Australia, it will be merely and naturally adding to the in come derived by them by way of commission.",32
110,Mr FHANCIS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,I understand that these architects are not now engaged by the Commonwealth Bank.,33
111,Mr FENTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"That is news to me. I take it that the Commonwealth authorities have the right to resume land. In this connection, I desire to cite an individual case. A working man had purchased a block of land within a suburb in my constituency. He was about to build, when the Commonwealth authorities- I presume, the Repatriation Departmentcommandeered that block. They notified the owner that they intended to make use of it for a soldier's home. He had no grave objection to offer to that, of course, but was compelled to wait for months, and even after going to considerable trouble he could secure no information with respect to the intentions of the authorities. In exasperation at last, he said, "" If you are going to take my block, please take it quickly, and pay me at once, because I want to buy another block in the same neighbourhood on which to build, and meanwhile the price is going up."" He has at last been offered the price which he originally paid for his block, and he finds himself faoed'. with the position that if he requires to purchase in the same locality he must pay considerably more. Why should he be penalized because of the long delay of a Federal Department ?",33
112,Mr FHANCIS,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"Simila r things happened in my constituency, at negie.",33
113,Mr FENTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES DEPARTMENT IN,"I think it will be found that the architects, in conjunction with the Bank, are pushing matters with regard to soldiers' homes, and are coming into competition with the State Savings Banks. I can testify to flie magnificent work undertaken by the latter authorities. W it h regard to the triplication of activities, as disclosed' by the motion, I can only say that it is cruelly unfair to taxpayers, and is penalizing returned soldiers themselves. Let the best authority carry out the work in the best interests of the soldiers and the community.",33

That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that as early as practicable a Cono t i o n is stitutional Convention should be summoned for the purpose of considering the need, substance, and form of any amendment of section 51 of the Constitution,"" and that such Convention shall(a) consist of ten (10) representatives of each State, elected on the existing The example Federal franchise, according to the principle of proportional representation ; (6) hold meetings nt such times and places as it may think fit; (c) submit within twelve months to the Governor General the draft of any amendments adopted by such Convention. 2.

Upon which Mr KERBY had moved, by way of amendment That in paragraph 1 the words "" a Constitutional Convention should be summoned"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" legislative provision should be made for the summoning of a Convention and that the words "" of section 51"" be left out. That in sub-paragraph (a) all the words after the words "" consist of "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" an equal number of representatives of each State."" That paragraph 3 be left out.",37
146,Mr KERBY,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"Ballarat) [4.30] - I shall occupy the attention of honourable members for only a few minutes in dealing with the amendments which I submitted when this question was last before the House. The urgent necessity for a Convention to consider the amendment of the Constitution has been stressed by previous sneakers, who have pointed out that it is absolutely necessary that the Commonwealth should have control over all Australian trade, commerce, and industry. In the House yesterday questions were asked in reference to the forty-two cases which are at present listed in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and the probability is that if the Commonwealth Parliament had had absolute power to legislate with respect to industrial matters we should not have had anything like that number of cases awaiting the attention of the Court. As I said last week, the States are carrying on in a very selfish manner. Each State practically is working wholly and solely for its own interests, and this is undoubtedly to the detriment of the rest of Australia. I am convinced that after going into the question thoroughly the proposed Convention will recommend the division of the States into smaller provinces, which would undoubtedly do away with a lot of State jealousies that at present exist. It would enable us also to overcome to a certain extent the difficulties of centralization. Each province would be made responsible for the administration of its own domestic affairs. The provincial councils, as the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) mentioned, would be given power to construct narrow gauge railway lines within their own boundaries, but if their finances perto the mitted, they would no doubt have broad gauge lines. An amendment of the Constitution which would give the Commonwealth Parliament full control over railways would rid Australia of the breakof-gauge difficulty, which is one of its greatest curses. If the Commonwealth Government had complete power over the railways, I am convinced that one of the first steps taken by it would be to remedy that evil. The recommendations of the Convention will have to be ratified by the people of Australia, and we can only hope to secure for those recommendations the endorsement of the electors by educating public opinion as to the reasons for them and their urgent necessity. The first of my amendments, if carried, will bring this proposal into the region of direct legislative action, and will greatly facilitate the calling of the Convention. I move the omission of the words "" of section 51 "" in clause 1, because I think we are all agreed that the Constitution generally requires to be amended. It is useless to attempt a patchwork amendment, and we can hope to have a practical amendment only after the Constitution as a» whole has been considered by the Convention, and recommendations have been made by it. If my second amendment be carried, the motion will provide that the Convention shall consist of an equal number, of representatives of each State. I make this proposal because I do not think it desirable to tie down the Government to any particular, number of representatives for each State, I have purposely proposed to omit the words in the original motion which provide that the members of the Convention shall be elected "" according to the principle of proportional representation,"" since their retention would look like an attempt to induce the Government to recognise the principle of proportional representation, which has not yet been thoroughly debated. When I mentioned this matter on a previous occasion the, honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) inquired why I proposed to omit those words, and I referred him to the fact that, as the result of the recent election, according to a letter written - by him, 13,568 electors in my own division were Amendment of the not represented. The t h i r d amendment which I propose will not be necessary if my first amendment be carried. urgent necessity for an alteration of the Constitution, so as to give the Commonwealth power to deal with Trusts, combines, railway communications, and the nationalization of monopolies, has been recognised in previous attempts to secure the approval of the people for an amendment of the Constitution. While we have dual control in each State, the position of affairs must remain unsatisfactory. We are hopeful that by an 'amendment of the Constitution, which will give the Commonwealth full power to deal with all national questions, leaving only matters of domestic concern within the jurisdiction of the State Parliaments or provincial councils, we shall aid in the development of Australia, and be able to overcome our social and industrial unrest.",38
147,Mr BURCHELL,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"Eremantle) [4.39]. - In seconding the amendment, I desire to congratulate the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Kerby) on his action in moving along the lines he has indicated. The temper of the House, I believe, is distinctly in favour of the summoning of a Convention as quickly as possible. Bub it is one thing to agree to' a general principle, and quite another to agree to a motion laying down a number of conditions as to the way in which the Convention shall be constituted, the number of representatives of each State, and the method of their election. That, it appears to me, is quite uncalled for at the present stage. The Government, in the Speech of His Excellency the Govenor-General, at the opening of the Parliament, intimated that they intend to introduce legislation that will provide for the summoning of a Convention to devise ways and means of amending the Australian Constitution, and of bringing it more up to date, in the light of our twenty years' experience of its operation. That being so, if we simply affirm the general principle, and, in the terms of the amendment, express our opinion that legislative provision should be made for the summoning of this Convention, it will be a sufficient in dication to the Government of the temper and the desire of the House. Proposals for amendments of the Constitution have been considered by this Parliament on a number of occasions. We have had almost innumerable opportunities of dis[6 MAY, 1920.] Constitution. 1871 cussing the question again and again. Several Governments have tried to secure The for this Parliament greater freedom of legislative action. They have endeavoured to obtain from the people of Australia authority to legislate along certain definite lines, but, so far, all such attempts have been unsuccessful. Only recently an appeal was made, but without success, to the electors to grant to this Parliament power to deal with the high cost of living. We are all individually feeling the pinch. The purchasing power of the sovereign is not nearly what it was a few years ago, and men ajid women receiving low rates of pay must have a very difficult task in making ends meet. I hope the Government will, at an early date, grant to the House an opportunity to discuss the creation of a Convention, and I hope that we shall all bear in mind that the question of the steadily increasing cost of living is pressing more heavily on the community than any other subject. The increase is due, as we know, to different causes, and I hope the peoplewill recognise that the Parliament should not be hamstrung, but should have ample power to deal with that particularly distressful phase of our social life. During this debate, the desirableness 1 of having a number of small States or provinces has been urged, and valuable contributions to that phase of the subject have been made by the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), and the honourable' member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), who have both given a great deal of attention to this evolutionary feature of the l if e of the Commonwealth. There are at present Statesthat are unwieldy in so far as administrative control is concerned. Although in the matter of population they are not very big, yet from the territorial standpoint, they are too large to be conveniently controlled from any one centre. It would be advantageous to the Commonwealth, as a whole, if the division of some of the States into smaller areas were taken in hand. We should forget for the time being the old boundaries that exist, particularly as between New South Wales and Victoria. I have also in mind the north-west portion of this continent. We have there a very large territory rich in minerals, and rich from a pastoral point of view, which could be converted into a veritable mine of wealth for the whole community, if an opportunity for 1872 Amendment of the [REPRESENTATIVES.] its development were given, and there were greater concentration on the work of developing it. The small handful of people in Western Australia-the population of that State is only some 320,000-ha s something like third of the continent of Australia under its guidance and control. We cannot expect a small population to finance the various undertakings necessary for the development of such a huge territory; hut where there is natural wealth in the form of minerals and vast pastoral resources, action to exploit it should he taken on a broader line than has hitherto been followed. I believe that if a new State or province were created- I do not mind what name is adopted-that Would lead to marked development. I do not say that the whole of the expense of that development should be borne by the taxpayers of Australia generally. Having been for some years in this Parliament, I know how many pressing problems face honourable members ; and I do not forget that other parts opinion. of Australia besides that to which I am referring are calling for development. Undoubtedly, however, the creation of a new State or province in the north-west of Australia would have a beneficial effect upon the development of that part of the continent. Reference has been made to the need for the unification of our railway gauges. This is a matter that has been the subject of various conferences of Railways Commissioners. Many estimates have been made of the cost of giving the railway systems of Australia a uniform gauge. It was estimated some years ago that the cost would be £8,000,000; but since then our railway mileage has increased so greatly that now it would probably be from £20,000,000 to £25,000,000.",39
148,Dr MALONEY,AMENDMENT OE TH E,Eou r times that.,40
149,Mr BURCHELL,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"The honourable member may be thinking of the cost of giving to all the lines in Australia a uniform gauge. I am referring to the cost of giving a uniform gauge to the main State lines only, so that the traveller might journey without changing his train from Rockhampton right round to Eremantle or Geraldton. This is a matter that the proposed Convention might very well discuss. Constitution.",40
150,Mr WEST,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"Is it practicable to give a uniform gauge to the main State lines only, seeing that lines of varying gauges connect with them?",40
151,Mr BURCHELL,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"I do not think it oneis absolutely impracticable, though the question is one for a civil engineer to speak on. I know that the attention of railway engineers throughout the world has for some years past been directed to the obtaining of a method to solve difficulties such as the honourable member has in mind, and I am convinced that, before long, a satisfactory solution will be found. There are in the world at present Federal Constitutions of different kinds. Our own Constitution differs markedly from both the Canadian and the South. African Constitution.",40
152,Mr WEST,AMENDMENT OE TH E,The Canadian Constitution would be the better one for us to follow as an example.,40
153,Mr BURCHELL,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"That is my Although the South African Constitution is more recent than ours, and much more recent than that of Canada, I prefer the Canadian Constitution. In South Africa I had an opportunity to discuss with provincial and Union members of Parliament some of the difficulties in the working of the South African Constitution.",40
154,Mr JOWETT,AMENDMENT OE TH E,Will the honourable member give us an idea of them?,40
155,Mr BURCHELL,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"When I was at Pretoria, a Labour member told me that, after many years, the Transvaal province had been able to place on the statute-book a measure for improving the working conditions of miners on the Rand; but it had to be submitted to the Executive of the South African Union, that is, to the Union Cabinet of the day, for approval or rejection; and I believe that amendments were insisted on by the Executive which were distinctly opposed to the wishes of the provincial Parliament.",40
156,Mr BAMFORD,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"Was the provincial Parliament within its powers in legislating on'the matter? ,",40
157,Mr BURCHELL,AMENDMENT OE TH E,I understood that the question was' not one of legislative ability. The amendments were framed in such a way as practically to prevent the provincial Parliament from achieving its ends. The impression was also left on my mind that the provincial Parliaments of South. Africa often find themselves subject to limitations similar to those which are placed on this Parliament by our Constitution.,40
158,Mr JOWETT,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"The honourable member, must be aware that similar difficulties have arisen under the Canadian Constitution.",41
159,Mr BURCHELL,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"I do not say that the Canadian Constitution is the last word in Constitutions. My statement was, in effect, that its principles are more adaptable to our circumstances than are those of the South A f r i c a n Constitution. When' dealing with constitutional reform, one is tempted to refer to the I m perial relationship, and to consider whether there should be closer co-operation with the Mother Country; but I shall not speak on that subject this afternoon. Many valuable works have been written upon the relations of the Mother Country with the Dominions, dealing with the subject from the stand-point of British interests, and fro m t h « stand-point of Dominion interests. The question bristles with difficulties, and cannot be disposed of in a few sentences. I wish fro say a word or two in support of the amendment. I am convinced that the alteration proposed in clause 1, asking that legislative provision be made for the summoning of a Convention, is sufficient indication to the Government of our desire to hurry forward the consideration of constitutional reform. Further, if we limited the scope of the Convention's review to section' 51 of our Constitution, we should be making a mistake. section enumerates the powers that have been transferred to the Commonwealth, and upon it our legislative work is based. Bub an alteration of it might require an alteration of other parts of the Constitution, which could, not be considered by the Convention unless the motion were altered as proposed by the honourable member for Ballarat. As a representative of one of the less populous States, I am a supporter of equal State representation, and I am glad that the mover of the motion (Mr Austin Chapman), who comes from the most populous State, has provided for its retention. If we l i m it the number to five or ten representatives, or to fifteen or twenty, in a motion of this kind, we shall be acting unwisely. We cannot at this stage have any idea how the forces outside Parliament-in the State Parliaments and in the general communityshould be represented, nor can we say what should be the number of representatives.",41
160,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"If you are in favour of a Convention, surely you can take your cue from the Convention that framed the Constitution.",41
161,Mr BURCHELL,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"At this stage I do not desire to pledge myself to any definite number, because, subsequently, sound reasons may be advanced for an increase or a decrease. But, after all, I am only dealing with a detail. In my opinion, we ought not to affirm the principle of proportional representation. There are honourable members who feel very keenly in regard to proportional representation, for and against. The question has been debated at different periods here within my own knowledge, and many determined efforts have been made to introduce the principle in various ways. For us, at this particular moment, to accept the principle as applied to the election of a Convention, without any really satisfactory statement as to how and to what sections of the community it is proposed to extend it , would be very ill advised. I do not wish honourable members to misunderstand me. It may be necessary to grant to various sections of the community representation, but if my memory serves me rightly-althoug h it is weeks since the motion was submittedthe mover did not give us any very clearcut ideas as to which sections of the community were to be granted proportional That representation. A f t e r all, the main purpose of the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) is to secure an expression of opinion fro m this House in regard to the calling of a Convention. He desires a Convention called as quickly as possible, and we should leave details for the consideration of Parliament when we have before us the proposals of the Government. Honourable members will then have an opportunity to make their presence felt, and to remove any clauses they may deem objectionable. 1I have no fault to find with the proposal for a Convention, but when honourable members weigh the matter carefully, I think they will 'agree that, if we affirm the principle of a Convention, and leave the details for consideration when there is a Bil l before us, we shall amply meet all requirements.  [ 5 . 5 ] - I am opposed to the motion and to the amendment, and I intend to indicate a further amendment before I sit down. I am opposed absolutely to the delegation of any of the powers of this Parliament to an outside body. Convention may be, or may not be, composed of - people from outside this Parliament.",41
162,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"How does the motion delegate the powers of Parliament? The Convention will be elected by the people.  outside this Parliament, who will be seeking election to this Convention, know less of the shortcomings of the Constitution than do those of us who have been members of the Parliament from the beginning, of for a considerable time, and have had to legislate under those short-comings. number of occasions this Parliament has tried to pass measures of national moment, and has found its efforts futil e because of lack of power. familiar with the fact that the High Court hasi at times ruled that we have not the power which those who framed the Constitution at the beginning firmly believed they were giving to the Parliament. Who should be more fitted to amend the Constitution, or frame a new Constitution, than those who are not familiar with those failures ?",42
163,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AMENDMENT OE TH E,I desire.a convention of men whom the people choose.  the honourable member will not say that we are not here on the expressed approval of the people. He himself was elected by the people,42
164,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"Who showed great discrimination.  orable member speaks for his own electorate, and no doubt he is quite satisfied that they are good judges. However, as I say, I emphatically protest against the delegation of the powers and .privileges of this Parliament to any outside body, and I regard the proposal as somewhat in the nature of a want-of-confidence motion in ourselves. A question of this kind should be taken up and boldly grappled with by Parliament itself.",42
165,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"You must trust the people.  such implicit confidence in the people's judgment that I am not going to tell them, as the motion does, that we think they have done wrong in choosing themembers who are in Parliament at the The present time. The people deliberately elect Parliament from time to time, and I am not one to say that we are not capable of doing the work we were sent to do. The Constitution itself shows the way by which the people can be appealed to on a referendum if it is desired to amend the Constitution, and I cannot see why there should be a Convention to do what we have absolute power to do as the Constitution now stands. There were referenda in 1911 and 1913, and if the proposed amendments had been secured then they would have gone a long way-prac tically the whole way-to make the Federal Parliament supreme. On a It would be going over old ground to deal with all the limitations in our Constitution ; but if we look at some of them it is almost unthinkable or unbelievable that We are all the people could so long suffer under them,; they are a reflection on those who tolerate them. The working people of the country are very largely blamed for the industrial unrest and the strikes which take place, but at present, so long as an industrial 'dispute is confined' within the limits of one State, there is no Federal power to interfere.. That is a situation which no sensible people should tolerate. A dispute exists which may be doing great national harm, but so iong as it is confined within the boundaries of one State there is no power for the Commonwealth authority to step in .",42

The Convention could be diluted with members of Parliament among a larger body of outside delegates.  my principal objection to the motion. Even if there were a dilution, as the honourable member for Wannon (Mr . Rodgers) suggests, there would still be party spirit. If this Parliament is to hand over its duties and responsibilities to an outside body, we, in effect, will be moving a want-of-confidence motion against ourselves. The great mistake made in framing the Australian Constitution was in following the lines of the American Constitution, which places the central authority in a subordinate position to the local authority. The people of South Africa followed different lines in framing their Constitution; they made the central power the supreme authority, and I do not think there is any member of a legislative body in Australia, State or Federal, but would say that the Commonwealth Parliament should be the supreme authority in Australia in every way. Recognising this great outstanding principle, the Labour party two years ago got together and framed proposals to overcome the present untenable position, and their proposals were outlined a few nights ago by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony).",44
183,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"Thos e proposals amount to Unification.  not Unification, but they certainly trend in that direction. It is thought to be unpopular now to advocate Unification, but I remember hearing the late Hon. Alfred Deakin asking the people to agree to Federation, and the principal argument he used was to point out the absurdity of having 'so many State Parliaments to administer the affairs of 5,000,000 people. The promise was held out to the electors Who, that if theywould agree to Federation the expense of the upkeep of fourteen Houses of Parliament would be saved. Practically something in the nature of Unification was promised as an incentive to the people to vote for Federation, and I believe that thousands of persons agreed to Federation bearing in mind the distinct promise that the stupid scheme of maintaining fourteen Houses of Parliament would not be perpetuated. The Labour party have propounded a scheme by which our Constitution may be altered so .that the Federal Parliament may be the supreme authority, as .the central Legislature should be, and in order to give effect to it I propose to submit a further amendment to the motion after the amendment moved by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Kerby ) has been disposed of.",44
184,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OE TH E," The honourable member may indicate his amendment, but I am afraid it will be necessary for him - to get some other honourable member to move it , because after having spoken to the motion he cannot again rise and submit his amendment.  amendment which I would submit is as follows: That all the words after "" practicable "" be left out with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the following:-"" a referendum to alter the Commonwealth Constitution be held to provide full sovereign power under its Constitution ancl to empower the Commonwealth Parliament to create any number of provincial legislatures as may be necessary for the good government of the people.""",44
185,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"That is Unification, pure and simple.  orable member can call it what he likes, but we propose to follow the lines of the South African scheme, and to make the Commonwealth Parliament supreme. The honourable member might just as well call the South African scheme a Unification.",44
186,Mr ATKINSON,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"So it is.  the same lines as our. proposal; at-any rate, the South African Parliament is not hamstrung at every - turn as the Commonwealth Parliament is. To-day the honourable member for ' Adelaide (Mr . Blundell) spoke about the duplication of machinery in the building of soldiers' homes. It is not the only instance in which this duplication occurs. We have two taxing Departments, State and Federal. No intelligent people in any part of the world would continue in the way in which we manage our affairs, with so much, duplication of machinery for administering them. The system proposed by the Labour party would end all this, and would make the Commonwealth Parlegislatures liament supreme. The central ties would also have power to create any number of provinces as might be necesI sary for the good local government the people. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) would call it Unification, but it simply means that the National Parliament would do the work of the nation-muc h work of a ing truly national character which is now done by the State Parliaments would be party. the sole responsibility of this Parliament - and that there would be a devolution power from this body to local bodies the exercise of control in local affairs. Such a scheme would give better local t vernment and greater satisfaction to turn. people in a local sense, and at the same time greater satisfaction to the people from a national point of view, because there would - be only one Parliament dealing with national affairs. Commonwealth Parliament would have be the power to - grant to each province uniform written constitution setting out the powers and duties of each local legislature, and, of course, such a constitution, could be amended from time to time as necessity arose. Honourable members may call our proposal Unification if they choose; it does not matter name, they give it ; the great outstanding feature of it is that the Commonwealth Parliament would have ent unfettered power to do things we have often tried to do, and have been prepeople [79.1 o vented from doing, and to deal with questions of a national character, the responsibility for which at present is a doubtful matter as between the Commonwealth and the States.

191,Mr ATKINSON,AMENDMENT OE TH E,Is that not an argument in favour of the election of a non-party Convention ?,46
192,Mr LAZZARINI,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"The honourable member knows as well as I do that it will be quite impossible to secure a non-party Convention, but he sees only one side of the question, ancl, therefore, his argument is consistently reiterated. doubted fact that an alteration of the Constitution is needed. Every member of Parliament who has had any experience of its workings feels the necessity for amending it . I come now to the question as to the means by which. the Constitution should be altered. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) ,proposes the election of a Convention to make recommendations. Federal Constitution was passed by a Convention, and, without desiring to reflect in any way on the personnel of that Convention, I would remind the House that as the outcome of its labours we have a cumbersome instrument of government which at every turn stifles the activities of the National Parliament. am convinced that the same result will follow from any f u t u r e Convention summoned to deal with the Constitution. The Government of the day, comprised as it is of men most of whom have been in this Parliament from its inception, ought to know in what respect the Constitution has failed. They ought to know what they want, and should be prepared to state boldly what alterations should be made. The Nationalist party, the Country party, and the Labour party should each be prepared to say what alterations they consider necessary in order to give effect to the principles for which they stand. They should put their policyto the people by means of a referendum, and stand or fall by it . It is quite possible that men will be elected to this Convention with but little experience of parliamentary systems and the working of parliamentary machines, with the result that the alterations recommended, although arrived at possibly in the best of good faith, will be of little real benefit, and, if adqpted, will' leave us with a Constitution practically as cumbersome as that under which we are governed today. The proposed Convention, I make bold to say, is undemocratic. W it h all respect [REPRESENTATIVES. ] Constitution. to State Righters, I claim that to have in that Convention - ten representatives of each State would be undemocratic.",46

194,Mr LAZZARINI,AMENDMENT OE TH E,A r e a few thousand people in one small State-a . few thousand people living within certain geographical boundaries--eac h to have a vote equal to every .ten votes cast by the people of a large State?

195,Mr LAZZARINI,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"On the contrary, I am arguing for its recognition. The Convention should be elected on the basis of one. vote one value. It should be based upon the principle of adult suffrage favoured by the Australian Democracy.",46
196,Mr ATKINSON,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"Regardles s of the different interests. The original Mr Lazzarini - Does the honourable member refer to vested interests? We members of the Labour party have no regard for vested interests in dealing with a national question. This Convention will have to do with great national principles, calculated to make or mar the Commonwealth. The petty vested in terests of some particular commercial I activity or institution in an embryo state in any of the smaller States should have no more voice in the election of this Convention than has an ordinary individual, whose only interest is that of good citizenship.",46
197,Mr MCWTLLIAMS,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"When New South Wales is divided into provinces, the honourable member will be a representative of one of the smallest States in the ""Union.",46
198,Mr LAZZARINI,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"I am not approaching this question from the point of view of State rights. New South Wales may be divided into ten provinces, if by so'doing we shall conduce to the« better working of the National Parliament, and democratic New South Wales will not complain. In the proposal which the Labour party put forward, we stand for the abolition of the Senate, which is practically the most undemocratic institution in the world. '",46
199,Mr SPEAKER,AMENDMENT OE TH E,The honourable member's reference to the Senate is not in order.,46
200,Mr LAZZARINI,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"U n d e r the"" Constitution, each State returns six members to another place, so that the representation of a small State is equal to that O of a State which has three or four times its population. The voting power of a small State thus works out as heing worth three or four times that of a large State. Another principle for which we stand, and which, I think, every honourable member who desires' to have responsible and democratic government in Australia must support, is the repeal of that provision in the Constitution which requires that a proposed amendment of the Constitution, in order to become law, must be carried by a majority of the voters in a majority of the States. That provision means that in the three most populous States of the Commonwealth-Ne w South ""Wales, Victoria, and Queensland-a n overwhelming majority might approve of a proposed alteration of the Constitution, yet because in the three smaller States-Tasmania , Western Australia, and South Australia-smal l majorities were recorded against the amendment, it would be defeated. It would be quite possible for a proposed amendment of the Constitution to be accepted by a majority of at least 100,000 of the voters of the Commonwealth, and yet because of this requirement to fail.",46
201,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AMENDMENT OE TH E,We must trust the people.,47
202,Mr LAZZARINI,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"But this Consti-, tution requirement trusts only a section of the .people. It allows of certain interests being so manipulated, particularly in the smaller States, that legitimate desires of the people can bo frustrated. We, therefore, stand for the abolition of the Senate and for the abolition of this requirement in the Constitution. Doubtless everybody realizes the necessity for decentralization. Some of our honourable friends say that the proposals of the Labour party really amount to Unification, and that we want to centralize everything. Analyzed in its fulness, however, our proposal will be found to make not for centralization, but for the best methods of decentralization possible in Australia.. It seems to me that it is unnecessary to have a written Constitution except to guarantee to the people that no Executive Government, and no organization, military or otherwise, shall ever take from them the right of the native-born to exercise the franchise. Beyond protecting and guaranteeing to the people one or two principles . [79]- 2 of that kind, the Federal instrument of government should be as free and untrammelled as possible. We all know that the High Court, which is part of the Constitution, has involved the industrial world in a lot of trouble. The same may be said of other features of the Constitution. In placing the hoop-iron bands of a circumscribed Constitution around the aims, aspirations, ideals, and ambitions of a young and growing nation, we are playing with fire. When a people cannot get what they want through legitimate constitutional channels, they will take it by other means. That is a consideration that we must always bear in mind. We should have a Federal Constitution under which tb« Commonwealth Parliament would be supreme in resj>ect of all national questions. We should give the Federal Parliament authority to delegate to provinces created with due regard to community of interests the necessary administrative and legislative powers for carrying out purely local affairs. If the Commonwealth Parliament were given truly national powers, we should have an end to the farcical railway system under which, because of differing State policies, travellers have to step from one train to another on reaching a State boundary, owing to the break of gauge. When the people know that they have constitutional powers to give full parliamentary expression to their hopes, ideas, desires, and ambitions, they will becoma contented, prosperous, and happy, and the foundations will be laid of a mighty nation. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) spoke of trusting the people. We, too, say, trust the people. But to appoint a Convention to deal with the Constitution behind their backs is not to trust the people. The Convention may be composed of legal gentlemen whose proposals for the amendment of the Constitution will be couched in phraseology hardly to be understood by laymen. And then a hundred different interpretations will be given to them on various platforms, and no one will know what he is being asked to vote for. Mr AUSTIN. CHAPMAN - The electors will vote for men.",47

The object of the amendment seems two-fold, namely, to prevent the calling together of a Convention, and also to provide for a referendum, the terms of which, as in the past, would be fixed by Parliament after a long and bitter party struggle, in which the majorit y had gained its own way. I think that we are all agreed as to the need for reforming both the Commonwealth and the State Constitutions, and this debate may be regarded in some way as a sequel v,o the most interesting discussion which we had earlier in the afternoon, when, by the honourable members for Adelaide (Mr . Blundell) and Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) and others, attention was drawn to most glaring cases of folly, waste, and inefficiency, due to the clash of Commonwealth and State control in regard to the erection of war service homes. said during that discussion made a deep impression upon the House. thinking man and woman in Australia is aware that one of the greatest evils from which this community suffers is the conflict of Commonwealth and State authority. The people are being oppressed by the excessive expenditure which results from the wastefulness caused by the overlapping of these two sets of authorities. What we have to consider is how best to put an end to this, and here I am reminded of Wordsworth's immortal linesThe world is too much with us; late and soon, Getting and spending we lay waste our powers. We might well say that Governments I are too much with us; late and soon, ' Getting and spending [they] lay waste our powers. The revenues of this great and prosperous country are being eaten up by Government expenditure and interferences, and the energies of our people are in consequence "" cribb'd, cabin'd, confin'd.""

222,Unknown,AMENDMENT OE TH E,Sitting suspended from 6.25 to 8 p.m. OIL AGREEMENT BILL . SECOND READING.,49
223,Mr HUGHES,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [8.0] - I move That this B i ll be now read a second time. In order that honourable members may better understand and appreciate the advantages of the agreement set out in the schedule to this Bill, it will be necessary for me to say something on the part played by oil in modern economic and Just as the first half of the last century was called the steam age, to so the time in which we now live may be fairly called the petrol age. To-day, as from the beginning of the machine-manufacturing era, the welfare of nations depends largely on fuel. But whereas formerly the fuel on which manufacturing nations relied was coal, they have now a choice between coal and oil. The effect of the oil engine upon civilization is most marked. It may be said that the internal combustion engine has effected as great a revolution as did the steamengine. If honourable members will try and conjure in their minds a picture of a world without oil, without oil-engines in any of their manifold forms, they will see a world very different indeed from that in which we exist. If they look upon these two pictures of what was and what is, they will be struck with the absolute dependence of the nations upon oil. They will be impressed by the extent to which the civilized world has adjusted itself to the motor with the internal combustion engine in some one or other of its various forms. That which we call civilized life depends to a very large extent upon adequate supplies of oil. is vital to us, as to all nations, that we should have not only an abundance of fuel-both coal and oil-but that Ave should have it cheap. It may be said that every increase in the price of fuel is a tax upon industry, and affects wages, which in turn affects the standard of living. Not only is oil the very spirit of the life of industry, but in war, as well as in peace, its power is pre-eminent. The last war was a petrol war. Those millions of men could not have been fed; that great Front, stretching thousands of miles, could not have been maintained; munitions could not have been carried; aeroplanes and tanks' would have been inanimate things without oil. complete dependence upon oil which is the lot of all nations is in Australia intensified by our geographical position. To us, oil is essential for our defence. When we consider our isolation, our vast coast-line and our wide spaces, we see at once that without a swift-driven navy, without means of transporting men rapidly, without cohorts of aeroplanes, our position is untenable. And yet it has happened quite recently that, notwithstanding our complete dependence upon oil for national defence, such small quantities of oil have been available as to have absolutely 'prohibited the navy Mr Hughes. from moving had an emergency arisen. Oil is vital to us, and, indeed, to all4 nations. As every honourable member must know-and I merely remind them of facts which are as patent as the facts of night and day-the supply of fuel of all kinds is limited. It is said- I know not how true it is-that the supply of oil is not likely to outlast the increasing demands of the next few decades. It is certain that the demand for oil has increased portentously, and that it now plays a part in the national and economic life of nations second only-if secondto that of coal. To show how the world's consumption of oil has increased, I propose to quote some figures. In 3910 the world's consumption of crude oil was about 32S,000,000 barrels; in 1914 the total quantity had grown to close upon 400,000,000 barrels. In 1919 it was estimated at 600,000,000 barrels! The position in Australia may be shown It by the following figures relating to residual and refined oils: In 1910 we consumed 25,725,000 gallons; in 1914-15 our consumption was 43,000,000 gallons; and in 1918-19 it was 51,000.000 gallons. Roughly, the world's consumption of crude oil doubled in ten years. In the same period our consumption of the residual and refined products increased in the same proportion. Those figures show beyond all doubt that the world is becoming more and more dependent upon oil, and that the tendency in that direction is as marked in Australia as elsewhere. I said just now something about the part which oil played in the defence of That Australia. I propose to quote some figures to show to what extent our Navy is dependent on oil and the extent to which the Commonwealth and the Government are consumers of oil. In 1910 the Navy consumed 1,000 tons; in 1914 it increased to 10,000 tons, while in J 919-20 we are consuming 50,000 tons. These figures speak for themselves. And when we consider the price at which we bought oil in 1910, and the price at which we are buying today, honourable members must be impressed with the gravity of the position and recognise the need for some immediate remedy. ""Clearly, the necessity for securing ample supplies of fuel oil-that is to say, the oil used for generating steam in vessels of the Navy so constructed as to permit of fuel oil being used in place of coal-is obvious. Since it goes without saying that' oil is vitally essential - to this country for defence - pur' poses, and for other purposes also, I want to turn now to the question of supplies of oil, which is, as I have termed - it, literally the spirit of the life of industry and the means by which this nation maintains its first line of defence, namely, the Navy. What are the sources of supply? Where are they? Who control and own them? to the sources: There are two, namely, shale oiland well oil. Shale oil, of which we have had some experience in this country, can be dismissed in a few words. The quantity of shale oil produced as compared with the volume of oil consumed in the world is so small as to be for all practical purposes negligible. In this country, despite the offer of a bonus of 2^d. per gallon in September, 1917, to Australian companies producing crude oil from shale, because the bonus previously offered was not considered sufficient, the production of oil from shale in Australia is only about 2,800,000 gallons per annum, whilst we consume of oil and its derivatives (52,000,000 gallons per annum. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), speaking in 1917 on the Shale Oil Bounty Bill, said I doubt whether the extraction of crude from shale is the wisest course to follow for the production of oil in Australia. . . . Most honourable members will agree with me that it would have been sufficient to make available £35,000 a year or thereabouts to encourage boring operations. We may then put shale on one side as a source from which we can hope to derive supplies of oil adequate to meet our requirements whether it be for fuel oil, ; benzine, motor spirit, or oil for lighting purposes. At present we have no oil wells in Australia or its Territories. I shall later touch shortly this aspect of the question. But, as I have said, we have as yet not discovered oil in Australia. The chief sources of liquid oil throughout the world today are the United States of America, Mexico, Russia, Persia, Roumania, and the Dutch Indies. For all practical purposes, with the one exception covered by this Bill, all these supplies are controlled by a few very great foreign companies, of which the Standard Oil Company is the chief. I suppose that we have all said a great deal about the Standard Oil Company in our. time. I know that I have done so. Its power is very great. To what extent these great companies-and I shall quote them, so far as I have been able to compile a list, in a moment or two-wor k together under any arrangement I cannot say. But we have to look at the facts, and I think that they speak in a manner First, as that none but those who are wilfully blind can misunderstand. It might be perfectly true if those great companies told us that there were no arrangements by which the world has been parcelled out for the supply of oil, or no arrangement as to competition either in price or in any other way, between them- I mean no arrangement binding at law or cognisable by the Courts, for it will probably be found that such arrangements, if any, are what is known, for some obscure reason, as ""gentlemen's agreements."" But it is, I think, pretty obvious that there are arrangements of some sort which, in fact, bring about the result I have suggested, and present effective competition. The principal oil companies in the order of importance in the world today are: The Standard Oil Company; the Royal Dutch ""Shell"" Group; the Anglo-Persian and Burmah Oil Comoil panies, which I bracket together, because their operations are interlocked; the Mexican Eagle Oil Company, now controlled by the "" Shell"" Group; the Mexican Petroleum Company; the Union Oil Company, of California; the WatersPierce Company, of Mexico; the Texas Oil Company, and Nobels', of Russia. In addition to these, there are three large Roumanian companies, which are controlled, one by the Standard Oil Company, one by the "" Shell,"" while the other, before the war, was controlled by the Deutsche Bank. I am unable to say who owns this now. ' There are a number of companies, of a subsidiary nature, of whom one hears a great deal, but they do not own oil wells - Thecompanies to which I have referred by name are the companies which actually own the great oil wells of the world. The companies that supply Australia's requirements are, mainly, the "" S h e l l "" Company, the Standard pany, and the Texas O i l Company. I want honourable members to follow a few figures I intend to give, because they are very interesting. The "" ""Shell"" Company supplies nearly all the fuel oil and a large proportion of the benzine consumed in Australia. The Standard Oil Company supplies most.of the kerosene and practically all the lubricants. As I have said, whether the trade is divided in this way by mere happy or unhappy chance, I am unable to say; but the facts are as I have stated them. Of 5,811,824 gallons of residual oil, that is to say, fuel oil, imported for the year ending June, 1919, all but 40,000 gallons were supplied by the "" S h e l l"" Company, whereas of 7,440,097 gallons of lubricating oil imported, less than 100,000 came from the "" . S h e l l"" Company, and the rest came from the United States of America. Of 16,672,963 gallons of kerosene and otherrefined petroleum burning oils imported, 14,548,123 gallons came from the United States of America. It is very clear, therefore, that we are dependent upon three companies, two American and one Dutch, for our oil supplies. Dj is evident, also, that under some arrangement, or by mere blind chance, we are sunplied from one source with all lubricating oils and kerosene, and from another with nil fuel oils and benzine. It is perfectly obvious that the result must be that, whatever price they like to charge us, Ave must pay. ' I . shall SIIOAV exactly hoAv that affects the Na\ yand hoAv it has affected the consumer. The position as so far set out is this: Oil is an essential of modern Broadly speaking, those nations are most prosperous that use the most oil. The United States of America 6,000,000 tons of benzine a year, or about six times the total pre-war of the United Kingdom and all Europe. America is the most prosperous nation in the world, and she is prosperous because she has recourse to machine and'machine production is more and more becoming production by machinery driven by internal combustion or oil engines. It is most important to note this fact, for it shows that oil is the key of industrial success. Mr Hughes. We depend here for our existence as a nation on oil for fuel for our Navy. We O i l Com- depend on oil for our industries, and for those means of production which we must have. When I was in France, twelve months ago, one of the most striking signs of the times Avas the tremendous number of .tractors adapted for farming . The oil engine has' revolutionized or is revolutionizing the industries of the Avorld. During the Avar tens and hundreds of thousands of tractors were put on the land in order to provide food for the fighting millions. Oil was the spirit of their life. W it h of l the millions made Avar, AA'ith oil they tilled the land, and Will oil theydrove battleships, merchantships, and submarines. I have shoAvn that six or seven great companies OAvn the means by which the great mass of the people of this Avorld must live. We are in this position: We must have oil for our defence and for our industries. We have no oil of our own, and no assurance of adequate supplies from overseas. All the supplies we do get come from foreign nations and from companies Avhose actions, I suppose, are governed by commercial (principles, and Avill sell or refuse to sell, as the mood, or the opportunity, or the inducement, suggests. The position can hardly be said to be satisfactory. We must have oil, Ave have none here, and cannot rely on getting it from abroad. It must not be forgotten, either that foreign oil Avhen it comes here v must be refined o i l . We have neither crude oil nor a refinery for treating it . This brings me to a point' I said I r Would touch upon. We firmly believe- I do, at any rate-that we shall find oil in this continent or in one of our Terrilife. tories. I hope that I am' not one of those unreasoning optimists Avho sees things j ust as he Avants to' see them, but I believe consumes there are abundant signs for those who have faith that Ave are going to find oil. consumption But Avhen Ave have found it, it will .be useless to us unless Ave can refine it . If A\'C found oil today in NeAv Guinea, AAe' could not use it u n t i l it Avas refined,-.and production, it Avill take two years to build a refinery. Crude oil cannot be used, so that if for no other reason, Ave ought to i m mediately provide means for refining o i l. At present we have neither any guarantees of oil from abroad, nor supplies of indigenous oil, nor means of refining. The first essential is that we shall-have effective guarantees of adequate supplies of oil, and the second is that we should put up a refinery to deal with them. I wish to deal now very shortly with another phase of this question-the price of oil. I have said that we must have adequate supplies of oil, and, what is obvious, both for our national and industrial needs, that we should get them as cheaply as possible. In a moment or two I. shall show what it costs us to buy oil for the Navy. If we are to be a great manufacturing nation, we can only be so on the basis of machine production. Whether it be in the primary or the secondary industries, our production must be based on machine production, and on systematized and organized effort; and at the basis of all modern production some kind of fuel is essential,' and oil is one of the most convenient and effective forms of fuel. Now let us take the prices, and see how they have increased during the past few years. The average. price per unit of quantity as declared at Customs was forPRICES-INCREASE OF. - 1010. 1.

We come now to the base from which all these spring-the crude oil. Taking first what is referred to in the oil trade as the bellwether of oil, Pennsylvanian crude, we find that its price has risen from less than $2 in 1914 to $6 in 1920. There has been a rise of $2 in the last twelve months, and a sharp rise in the last few months. I hope honourable members will not forget that six companies own these oil supplies. I have mentioned the names of eight, including the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and one of them is the Mexican Eagle Company, which is controlled by the "" Shell"" group. Whether all are related or interwoven I cannot say. But the fact remains that this essential to the 'life of modern man is controlled by a few groat corporations, who regulate the price we pay. I shall show what this means to us as a nation, quite apart from what it means to individuals in the community. In 1910 the Australian Navy paid £3 5s. to £3 10s. per ton for its oil. In 1914 the price rose to £4 5s. and £4 10s. In 1920 the price was £9 10s. to £10. As we are buying 50,000 1914-5. 1918-9. tons per annum, we are now paying per annum over £200,000 more than we should have had to pay in 1914or nearly as much in one year as honourable members are now asked to 20.72d. agree to provide for the establishment of 23.21d. 2.87d. 3.31d. a refinery in Australia, assuring to Aus5.58d. 19.14d. tralia 200,000 tons of crude oil per annum, which will supply more than is required for the needs of the Navy and for half the motor and lighting requireis ments of Australia. I repeat that we are at present paying for the oil we need for the Navy over £200,000 more per annum than we were paying in 1914. I do not say that we are paying more 1918. 1920. than a fair price. I do not know what is a fair price for the oil. If I am asked whether the increase in the price of Gallon. Gallon. Gallon. Gallon."" petrol or crude oil is due to the auga. d. 8. d. S. d.

She has a huge 'home market. But whether that demand is responsible for the present price of oil, I cannot say; but what know is that the price of oil today determined by the demand and by the six or seven great oil companies. leave it to honourable members and the country to determine which of these two factors is the greater in the matter fixing the price. I deal with the facts, which are pretty obvious, namely, that we require oil, that we must have adequate supplies, that we must get them as cheaply as possible, and that we no means of getting them at all, and tainly no means of getting them cheaply. As I said a little while ago, the TJnited from Berlin to Bagdad. States of America alone uses about 6,000,000 tons of benzine per annum, or and all its richness. about six times the pre-war consumption of the United Kingdom and Europe. I struggling, have pointed out what I think it was proper to point out-that America is, perhaps, the most prosperous country the world-and there is a vital connection between these two things - Canada, with far less need to erect refineries than have, has fourteen of them, seven having been erected since 1914, and these have a total capacity of 1,500,000 gallons day. Canada has fourteen refineries, pany Australia not one! It is very obvious that immediate steps ought to be taken, as is provided in the Bill, to insure ample supplies of crude oil and to estabence lish a refinery to deal with them and such other indigenous supplies as may be found in Australia or in the Territories. This Bill is a measure to Tatify an agreetwo ment for that purpose made with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I do not know that it is necessary dwell at any great length upon the posishares. tion which the Anglo-Persian Company occupies in the world. Its history pretty well known. It is crowned, so to speak, with a halo of romance, and we derive some satisfaction from our knowLord ledge of the connection of the founder the company, Mr ""W. K. D'Arcy, with Australia. He was one of the directors the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Comment pany. Some twenty years ago he accost quired interests in Persia, and spent large fortune in endeavouring to develop the oil-bearing regions there. He lost much money, but managed to interest Mr Hughes. far-seeing and enterprising men in his schemes. The pioneers had a chequered I do career until in 1904 Lord Fisher, that is most remarkable man, who was First Lord of the Admiralty, and who was one of the I first to foresee the part that oil would play in the life of the world and as a fuel for the Navy, concluded that without oil of that arm of defence was likely to be ineffective, and looked around with the object of securing within the British Em- pire sources of supply. He was mainly responsible for preventing the Persian have concessions from falling into German cerhands. Honourable members will recall the Kaiser's dream of a railway The East ° was to be his, with all its greatness Thank's to Lord Fisher, the company, which was then found its feet, and in 1909 it very was formed into what is now known as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In 1913 in a Bill was introduced into the House of Commons under which the British Government became officially responsible for we the progress of this company, and on the outbreak of the war they acquired a controlling interest in it. The position now per is as follows:-The capital of the comis £20,000,000, the issued capital is £17,500,000, made up of £5,000,000 worth of 5 per cent, debentures, £5,000,000 worth of 6 per cent, participating prefershares, and £7,500,000 of ordinary shares. .The debentures carry no voting powers, the preference shares carry one vote per share, and the ordinary shares votes per share.* The votes number 20,000,000, of which the British Government hold 10,001,000 on account of to 5,000,000 ordinary and 1,000 preference The balance of the shares are held as follows: - The Burmah Oil is Company- a purely British company - hold s 2,500,000, less a negligible nummay ber which are held by the heirs of Strathcona and Mr Knox D'Arcy, of its founders; and the British public own 4,999,000 preference shares. The of investment of the British Governin the Anglo-Persian Oil Company them £5,000,000, and is roughly estia mated to be worth £50,000,000 on the open market today. This company has been developed entirely by British capital and British enterprise. It is controlled by the British Government, ""which holds a majority of its votes. It has no relation, direct or indirect, with any of the companies I have mentioned or with any other company. The Burmah O i l Company is one of the companies which was formed in Burmah by British capital, and was itself the company which assisted the infant Anglo-Persian O i l Company to its feet. The latter company owns, in Persia, Timor, Mesopotamia, A f r i c a , Trinidad, Borneo, and other places, extensive oil fields. It is estimated that the Persian fields alone are as large as the combined fields of the United States. It has a fleet of tank steamers in being of 230,000 tons, which is to be built up to 500,000 tons, and this fleet will be worth £15,000,000. Here, then, is a company purely British in its origin, in its development, in its capital, and in its con.trol, which possesses the most extensive oil fields in the world. a fleet and oil wells which make it perfectly independent of all shipping rings and oil corporations. is willing to make an arrangement with the Commonwealth Government to erect a refinery here, and to supply this country with 200,000 tons of crude oil per annum at current rates until such time as we find oil in Australia or its territories. When we find it , and in proportion to the quantity in which we find it , the company's oil will be retired and our oil will be refined at the refinery. In this refinery, the capital of which is set .down in the schedule at £500,000, we are to take up £1 more than half of the shares, in order that we may exercise exactly the same control as that which is enjoyed by the British Government. We shall be entitled to half the profits accruing from the enterprise', we shall be assured of ample supplies of fuel of l for our Navy, and we shall give employment to a very large number of men, either immediately or in the immediate future. We shall also be ready to refine our own of l when it is found.. F r o m this 200,000 tons of crude oil it is estimated that we shall get per annum 40,000 tons of benzine, 33,300 tons of kerosene, 9,045 tons of lubricating oil, 72,000 ""tons of fuel oils, 4,500 tons of wax, 9,000 tons of pitch. These commodities, other than fuel oils, will be sufficient to supply about one-half of our total requirements; while in regard to fuel oils the supply will be more than sufficient. The agreement is, for all practical purposes, an analogous one to that entered into by the company with the British Government, excepting, of course, that it is of an incomparably narrower scope. But so far as Australia is concerned, and to the extent that we put our capital into the undertaking, our position is analogous. It will give us the same control over this refining company that the British Government has over the Anglo-Persian Company. The agreement is with the Anglo-Persian Company for ' the purpose of forming a refinery company which will be registered in this country and in this State. The net effect will be that the Commonwealth Government will have a half share in the enterprise, the Anglo-Persian Company will have one-half of the remainder-that is to say, a'quarter share-and the British Government will also have a quarter share. It has This Anglo-Persian Company is now a company which is truly Imperial in the best sense of the term. It is a company It whose supplies are scattered throughout the Empire, and whose capital and resources, as well as the enterprise to which it owes its development, are entirely British. This company, controlled by the British Government, comes to the Commonwealth Government and asks us to become a partner with it in this venture. If the inducements were much less attractive than they are, I should be one of the first to advise honourable members to accept it . But being in the position we are, and asked by a company such as this, British in essence, controlled by the British Government, it would be in credible folly for us to reject this offer. For an expenditure of £250,000 we are offered a partnership with this great company, whose experience in much wider fields absolutely insures success in this enterprise. I remind honourable members that it is the Anglo-Persian Company's knowledge and experience that we are buying, under this agreement. It is not proposed to interfere in any way in the management of this refining company, but we shall have the right to prevent it ' from selling its refined oil to any foreign buyer without our consent. We shall also be able to insure a sufficient supply of oil for our naval requirements, and have authority to veto any proposal likely to interfere with the status of the company. In addition, if at any future time further capital is to be called up, this may only be done with the consent of the Commonwealth Government; and in any case the relative positions must be maintained so that the Government will - always hold a majority of the shares. It is impossible at this stage for me to anticipate all the points- I can hardly call them objections-that may arise in. honourable members' minds, so I shall not endeavour to do so. I would not be in order if I attempted to deal with .the schedule, item by item, but I may inform honourable members that I have been through it very carefully. In fact I am responsible for its present form, and as Attorney-General I declare that it amply safeguards the interests of the Commonwealth. It provides, inter alia, that the Government may resume the works after a period of fifteen years have elapsed, but whether the Government will be inclined to do so or not, I am unable to say. I do not know that very many of us would care to pierce the veil of the future to that extent, for I have no doubt some honourable members feel that fifteen years hence they may be in a place where oil would be regarded as an embarrassment of riches. In my opinion, the agreement is a good business deal for the Commonwealth. It is one of those schemes that are long overdue, but long overdue as it may be, the proposal is a clear indication that the war has made this country known in places where, perhaps, it was not heard of before. This great firm, with others, is coming to Australia. Some are coming for one reason and some for another, but apparently they all realise with us that Australia is a good place to be in. I have told the representatives of these firms that we have our troubles here just as other countries have, but that nevertheless Australia is a good place for all men to live in. These big English firms understand the trend of the times, and evidently they are satisfied that Australia presents to them opportunities which are not to be found in other countries. I have much pleasure in moving the second reading of the Bill, and I strongly advise honourable members to assent to it. Debate (on motion by Mr TUDOR) adjourned. Mr Hughes. SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES. In Committee of Supply:  Home and Territories) [9.8] - In the absence of the Acting Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), - I desire to place before honourable members the Supplementary Estimates for the year 1917-18, and to give the following particulars in relation thereto:The Supplementary Estimates for the year 1917-18, now submitted, are for the purpose of obtaining an appropriation of Parliament to cover the expenditure made out of the Treasurer's Advance during that year. As has frequently happened in previous years, a considerable time has elapsed since the closing of the year's accounts and the passing of these Estimates by Parliament. Honourable members are aware that the preparation of the Supplementary Estimates is postponed' until the accounts of the year are finally closed, and a suitable opportunity has often to be awaited before they can be placed before Parliament. In regard to the present Estimates, the year closed on the 30th June, 1918, and the final audit of the accounts was not completed until the 17th December, 1918. These Supplementary Estimates were available for presentation to Parliament last year, but it was not practicable ' to place them before the House for consideration. Eull particulars of the expenditure included in these Supplementary Estimates were contained in the Treasurer's finance statement for 1917-18, which was presented to the House on the 19th December, 1918. With regard to the total amount of £601,982 required under Ordinary Services, £206,398 is for war expenditure and £395,584 for the usual requirements of .Departments. Most of the items explain themselves, but there are some which, perhaps, call for comment. Generally speaking, it may. be said that owing to war conditions and - the greatly increased prices which have obtained during the last few years, it has been difficult to forecast the expenditure as accurately as in normal times. One item for which additional appropriation is required, under the Prime Minister's Department, is the administration and the working expenses of the Port Pirie wharf. The vote is being increased from £2,000 to £13,882. Against this expenditure, however, the collections of the wharf amounted to £20,715, so that this service has been conducted on a payable basis. There is an increase in the amount to be voted for the High Commissioner's Office of £12,977. This extra expense is almost wholly attributable to war conditions. Tinder the Depa'tment of the Treasury, a large sum of £38.177 is required above the amount originally estimated for Taxation Office contingencies. The increased taxation has necessarily made heavy and unavoidable expenditure in this branch. 1 should mention, however, that against that sum, owing to permanent appointments not being made a3 early as anticipated, there was a saving in the original appropriation for the salaries of the taxation officers of over £9,000. . There is also an increase of £49,000 for interest on transferred properties under the Department of Trade and Customs. This-increase is in respect of lighthouses taken over by the Commonwealth from the States. An additional amount of £28,410 has been provided for rent of buildings. Of this amount, over £21,000 was paid to the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney, on account of ofiice accommodation for Commonwealth Departments. This sum included a considerable amountfor fitting up of offices and arrears of rent from the time the Departments first occupied the offices. In the Postmaster-General's Department-an additional' amount of £24,547 is being asked for. That sum comprises a large number of items, none of which call for special remark. Under War Services, £172,078 has been provided to cover war pensions in excess of the amount originally estimated, namely, £2,600,000, and £23,186 is required for the War Pensions Office. That sum is in addition to £37,168 originally voted. In regard to the Supplementary Estimates for Additions, New Works and Buildings, the total amount asked for is £2,088, and is required to cover several small items not foreseen in the original Estimates. It will interest honourable members to know that of the amounts originally voted for the payments out of revenue in 1917-18 the following amounts were unexpended:Ordinary services . . £933,502 War services .. 804,594 Additions, new works 637,502 Total . . . . £2,375,598 The amounts now asked for total just over £600,000.",49

The money has already been spent, and we are only validating the action of the Government.

238,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"It was un.ler £80,000.",58
239,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"At any rate, we have a right to get that money. The fact that we are getting something from the wharf is of no consequence, because we own the wharf and we had to pay for it .

The mechanical coalhandling appliance at Port Pirie is not perfect, because it should have been electrically controlled. At the time of its installation, it was impossible to obtain the necessary electrical plant, so it had to he an improvized plant, or, in other words, constructed out of a scrap-heap. The installation of the plant was a matter But the of vital interest to the Commonwealth Government, as well as an advantage to' Port Pirie, because in the absence of such a plant the Broken Hill Proprietary Company could not have supplied the Imperial authorities with lead for war purposes. That statement has been made deliberately.",59

248,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"I do not think South Australia desires to take any advantage. It is a pity that this great city does not benefit by the experience of Port Pirie, and erect a modern mechanical plant to handle its coal requirements on an economical and effective basis.",59
249,Mr BURCHELL,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"Fremantle) [9.29]. - I was not present durfng the whole of the time the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) was speaking, but I understood him to say that passengers travelling by the transcontinental line were compelled to wait at Kalgoorlie for some eight or nine hours.",59
250,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"I stated that the Western Australian Government agreed to construct a line from Kalgoorlie to Perth on the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge if the Commonwealth undertook to build the East-West line. Mr Scaddan, when Premier, agreed to that, and it is on record.",59
251,Mr BURCHELL,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"When that agreement was entered into, it was a definite undertaking that the Commonwealth Government would construct the line within a given period, and that they did not do-. I am sure ' of my facts, because the Western Australian Government at one stage raised loan money specially and expressly to build the Kalgoorlie-Fremantle section on the 4 f t . S i in. gauge, but that money was diverted to other purposes owing to the delay which took place in the of construction of the railway. That is a matter of historv, and I am simply repeating it for the information of honourable members. The delay in Kalgoorlie is, after all, really a blessing in disguise, 1892 Supplementary [REPRESENTATIVES.'] because even under the most advantageous conditions existing today it takes sixteen hours to run from Kalgoorlie to Perth. Taking into consideration the arrival time in Kalgoorlie, and allowing a fair hour for connection and possible delays to the East-West train, you could not leave Kalgoorlie before. 11 a.m., which would mean that if you went straight through you would arrive at Perth at 3 o'clock in the morning.",59
252,Mr TUDOR,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"Of course, it would be absolutely impossible to start from Port Augusta at a different time!",60
253,Mr BURCHELL,AMENDMENT OE TH E,I am dealing only with the Western Australian side. It is not a simple thing to lay down a definite time-table for the line under the existing conditions with the speed limited to 30 miles an hour instead of the 45 or 50 miles an hour anticipated. Naturally the running time between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie is so much greater.,60
254,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT OE TH E,The whole fault is with the States; they will not alter their timetables.,60
255,Mr BURCHELL,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"They have altered their time-table within the last few days, with a view to making it much more comfortable and suitable. The South Australian railways have altered their timetable, so that instead of leaving Port Augusta at 5.30 in the morning on the journey from the West, and the passengers having to turn out at 4.30, they now remain till 7 o'clock, have their breakfast, and leave Port Augusta at S a.m. That is a much better and more sensible arrangement. The solution of the whole difficulty will come when the line itself settles down more and is ballasted. The original estimate and scheme for the line did not provide for ballasting. When the line is ballasted and it becomes possible to run trains over it at a decent speed, theruncerned, ning time will be cut down, and passengers will be able to arrive in Perth at a suitable hour.",60
256,Mr JAMES PAGE,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"Maranoa) [9.34]. - It is very amusing to hear the excuses put up by South Australian members for not paying their taxes. One honourable member said that those gentlemen were smiling when they spoke. They say the tiger smiles before he chops up his prey. I am afraid the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) is like the tiger. When he smiles, look out for squalls. He complained about the maEstimates. chine at Port Pirie. being a scrap-heap concern. The South Australian people were glad to get that scrap heap concern at whatever it cost, but directly the. Commonwealth want3 the money the South Australian Government makes all sorts of excuses, and will not pay it. In fact, it has not paid a copper up to date. The honourable member for Wakefield has not explained why the South Australian Government has not paid the Commonwealth that money. Because it is a payable concern now, the South Australian authorities want us to cut it out, and then sell them the machine. Mr RICHARD . FOSTER - Nothin g of the kind. >",60
257,Mr JAMES PAGE,AMENDMENT OE TH E,What else are they doing? Tho South Australian Government made a contract to do certain things if the Commonwealth' did certain things.,60
258,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AMENDMENT OE TH E,South Australia has never broken a contract.,60
259,Mr JAMES PAGE,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"When the Commonwealth did its part, the South Australian authorities began to make excuses; they said it was not the machine they wanted; that they wanted an electric motor; that they did not want a gas engine; and that they did not want steam power. They wanted something that would dothe work. The Commonwealth supplied them with a thing that did the work, and now they do not want to pay for it. There is rhis to be said, however, that even if the South Australian Government does not pay for it, the Commonwealth Government was under an obligation to supply the Imperial Government with lead, and whether it is a payable concern today or not does not matter, so long as we succeeded in what we set out to achieve. So far as that is conI am quite satisfied even if the thing is a dead loss. I am told that fully 80 per cent, of the lead used by the Allies came from Broken Hill,and that there were always boats available for Port Pirie. when they were not available for, anywhere else. Still, the least the South Australian people can do is to pay their taxes. The honourable member for Wakefield says that the South Australians are always willing to fulfil any bargains they make - They unloaded one undertaking on to the Commonwealth to a nice extent, and so far as all the good the Commonwealth has got out of the Northern Territory deal is con«erned, I would vote tomorrow to hand it back to them, giving it to them free of - debt, and letting them make a fresh start with it. That is what I would do if the South Australian Government would take it back.  - on those terms. . Mr JAMES PAGE - Then .South Australia can have it so far as my vote goes, and I can vouch for fully 90 per - cent, of the men on. this side of the House voting to give it back to them free of debt.

It is a veritable sink for expen- diture.",60
260,Mr FLEMING,AMENDMENT OE TH E,The Minister says they will take it back with the debt.  we would accept the honourable member's offer.,61
261,Mr JAMES PAGE,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"There is no - chance of South Australia taking it back* with the debt. If ever they were glad to be rid of an incubus, they were glad to get rid of the Northern Territory. We should not be too hard on the Western Australian Government regarding the East-West railway. They do all they possibly can at their end to facilitate the arrival and despatch of trains. existing conditions the Commonwealth Railway Commissioner is doing remarkably well. We should not hamper him or the State Governments, because when that agreement was made every State in the Union was prosperous, and revenue was coming in in bucketsful, whereas today it is coming in only in pintpotsful.",61

263,Mr WEST,AMENDMENT OE TH E,I would soon settle the war debt if I had my way.,61
264,Mr JAMES PAGE,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"There are a few people in the Commonwealth who would fix up the war debt tomorrow if they had their way, but I notice that they have nothing to fix it up with themselves. It puts me in mind of the men out we3t when the Labour party first came into existence. Every man that was "" on the [80] creek,"" and had nothing i j i his tucker bags, was a red-hot Socialist and good Democrat, but once he had his kidneys lined, and was in a permanent job on a station, he would say, "" This Labour business is no good to me."" I have the greatest faith in the finances of Australia today, as I had when Federation was first consummated. I look upon this as the best country under the sun, both financially and for the people in it . People talk about what we have suffered, but we have not suffered one-thousandth part of what they have in other countries. We are the best-off place in the world. I was reading in an English paper today about the prices of things at Home, and comparing them with prices here. In the English provinces the ordinary commodities of life are unprocurable to the working people. We should not cry ""stinking fish."" The finances of the Commonwealth, and of every one of the States, are in a very buoyant condition, and I am looking forward to the great Protectionist Tariff to bring in more revenue than was ever brought in by any Revenue Tariff or. Free Trade Tariff in any country in the world. It is going to do what a lot of people have always said a Protectionist Tariff would do. It will bring about prosperity, higher wages, ibetter conditions of living, cheaper clothes and boots, and cheaper commodities generally.

266,Mr JAMES PAGE,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"I am speaking on the Supplementary Estimates, and I ask your protection, Mr Chairman, from the honourable member for wooltops. It is no use making a noise about this money, because it was spent in the financial year 1917-18. I believe there is still another dose of supplementary estimates to come, but it is not of much use to talk about it. The only thing that concerns me is that South Australia should pay its taxes. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) said by interjection today that we were not going to get a ""bob"" out of it, yet the honourable member for Wakefield tells us to-night that South Australia always pays its debts. If I had my way, I would stop the £77,000 out of South Australia's share of the 25s. per capita payments. The Government have a p u l l on the State by that means. I would make South Australia pay this sum for the mounting of the grab in that way, and then let them f i g h f it out afterwards. If we wait much longer, there will not be enough population in South Australia to take it out of. Why the. people are deserting South Australia. I do not know.",61

The practice is that the Supplementary Estimates are prepared as soon as the> audit of the year's accounts is finally completed, and the Estimates are presented, to Parliament for consideration as soon aa possible thereafter. The Auditor-General's report on theyou finances of 1918-19 was presented to this Parliament on the 26th' February last. The finance statement then submitted contained full particulars of the amounts in cluded in the Supplementary Estimates, now under consideration. The total amount to be appropriated for ordinary services is £1,016,596, of which £61,532 is payable from Trust and. Loan Funds. The ex,penditure from revenue is made up as follows: Ordinary services ... £482,159 Refunds of revenue ... .143,242 War expenditure ... 329,663 £955,064 Payable Owing to abnormal conditions brought Payable out of about by the war, and to the general and .Loan continued increase in the cost of services, llevenue.

This increase is largely attributable to war conditions. 7,249 In the Treasury Department, the sum of £68,370 is required above the amount81,564 already appropriated for Taxation Office contingencies. Increased activities in the 20,753 Taxation Ofiice account for the extra, amount'required. The principal items53,600 are-Postag e and telegrams (£6,444), office requisites (£3,190), and temporary7,900 32 assistance (£52,645).

Government Printer, and stamp printing accounts, respectively. These increases were mainly due to large purchases of paper. Under the Department of the Navy, a sum of £50,000 is required for the payment to the credit of Trust Fund, Admiralty account. This amount is needed to meet expenditure on behalf of the Admiralty to the 3lst December, 1918, and is recoverable. One hundred and two thousand six hundred and nine pounds were required above the amount originally voted for the quarantine service. This was very largely due to the influenza epidemic. Under the Department of Works and Railways, an appropriation of £11,000 is required to provide a credit in the Trust Fund, Public Works Plant, and Stores Suspense Account. This was for the provision of stores and plant for works under the control of that Department. In the Postmaster-General's Department, an additional amount of £15,543 is required on account of contingencies. This sum comprises a large number of items, none of which call for special mark. Under War Services, an extra amount of £300,000 is required for repatriation of soldiers - This is mainly on account of sustenance allowances. Refunds of Revenue - This amount£143,242-wa s wholly required for refunds of taxation revenue. In addition to the items referred to, not granted. provision is made under the various Departments for war bonuses granted under Arbitration Court Awards, amounting in all to £52,281. In regard to Supplementary Estimates for Additions, New Works, and Buildings, the total amount asked for is £44,434. The main items are:-Darwin Katherine River Railway, capital expenditure, £7,568; construction and extension of telegraphs and telephones, £20,123. The balance is made up of sundry small items. Of the amounts originally voted for payments out of revenue in 1918-19, the following amounts were unexpended:Ordinary services, £713,557; war services, £3,640; additions, new works, &c, £93,729; total, £810,926.

270,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"Melbourne Ports) [9.55] - I desire to once more refer to the question of invalid pensions as these affect tubercular and similar cases. There are many unfortunate individuals in the community who, by reason of tubercular disease, are unable to follow any occupation. reMany of these have been in hospitals for months or years, and only recently some were turned out of the Austin Hospital, at Heidelberg. Amongst those turned out are sufferers who have parents in receipt of wages which at one time were considered large, but are not so considered now. Unless parents who find themselves unable to support the sufferers turn them out into the streets, invalid pensions are  correct.",63
271,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"It is a fact, and it is not the first time that such-cases as I refer to have occurred. In one case that has been brought under my notice, the parents are in receipt of a wage of £ 4 per week, and of their four or five children some are dependent, others semi-dependent, whilst the eldest is suffering from tuberculosis, and cannot earn a living. He left a sanatorium to return home, and' because the parents are willing to give him a shelter he cannot secure a pension. The only way to obtain a pension, as I say, is for the parents to put the sufferer on the streets. If that be done, they have to sleep in the street, or be locked up, until a pension can be secured, and we all know that the business of getting a pension cannot be got through in three or four hours. I am sure that there is not a member in the House who has not - heard of cases of the sort. For years understood that the Commissioner had special powers to deal with such their merits.  sioner has that power. I shall be only too pleased to inquire into any typical cases brought before me.",63
272,Mr TUDOH,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"The case the - honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr . Mathews) is referring to is that of a man, room for them. with both lungs affected, who was turned out of a hospital.",64

Some sanitary. years ago 8s. a day might have been sidered a fair wage, but now 16s. is worth no more than 8s. was then. We still base the power of the parent to maintain his children on the rate of the old cost of living. It is no pleasure to me to tinually bringing these cases before the House, but there are so many that cannot be neglected. It certainly is not according to the spirit of the Act that a [ 1 0 . 3 ] .parent should be compelled to throw his invalid children on the street in order that they may obtain a pension. If the  such cases will be considered in view the present high cost of living I shall satisfied.  into any cases laid 'before me, and see asked today waswhat can be done.",64

The question I What steps have been taken to give effect to the recommendations of Major Goucher in his report in November, 1918, upon the trainof age ing camp at Liverpool? a brutal way, The answer wasNo recommendations were made by Major That, I believe, is correct, but the answer goes onThis oflicer was detailed to report on certain allegations regarding a camp of training at Liverpool, and his report showed that these statements were grossly untrue. This is a camp for trainees, and in the course of a few months similar camps will be held at Broadmeadows, Seymour, and It is rather curious that at the time the scandal arose at Liverpool similar complaints were made as to the Act, failure of the organization at BroadI n July, 1918, it was deto cided to hold the camp on 2nd September. There were, therefore, more than six weeks in which to make preparations. The number of officers and men was correctly estimated on 16th July.. Yet when the lads reached the camp it was found that there were insufficient tents to house them. The tents were deficient in number and gear, some being without flies, and some without poles. Blankets were not issued until between 6.30 and 8.30 p.m - the y had not been received in time. The lads arrived in camp, after a wearisome journey, at 11.50 a.m., 12.15 p.m., and 3 p.m. No food was available for them until about 3 o'clock. There was no salt for nearly a week,'and meals were cooked without it. There was no issue of firewood, and the lads were sent to steal it. There were 63,000 lbs. of straw in the depot when the camp opened, enough for 6,300 men; yet no straw was available for the lads to sleep on for ral days after the camp opened. vegetables were available until the evening of the second day. Tent boards were not available, and the lads had to sleep on the bare ground, without straw, and only a blanket beneath them. Colonel Kirkland reported that it was not until the 14th-twelv e days after the camp commenced-that the equipment was complete. After the camp the principal medical officer reported that during the whole of the thirty days' training the tents had not been struck or the ground aired, and he ordered this to be done before another batch of trainees was brought there. Another report states that, without doubt, a great deal of sickness was caused by the want, of proper bedding, flooring, and blankets. lad died of meningitis-part of the camp Was known as "" Meningitis F l at "" during the early days of the war-te n days after his return from camp. There was a similar scandal at Broadmeadows. Some honourable members, who have, been through the rigours of the war, evidently look upon these matters lightly; but I desire honourable members to understand the objects of - these camps and the conditions under which they are conducted. These young men. were taken out of comfortable homes, and out of the mines, and were subjected to disabilities which I - have just indicated quite unnecessarily, and merely because of the failure of some responsible officers to do the work they were paid to do. The [81] country is disbursing large sums by way of salary to men who are regarded as efficient, and yet the health and the lives of these trainees are jeopardize!} because of the failure of certain responsible officials to do their simple duty. "" Mr LISTER - When did this occur?",64
278,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AMENDMENT OE TH E,In 1918.,65
279,Mr LISTER,AMENDMENT OE TH E,And is the incident only now being ventilated?,65
280,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AMENDMENT OE TH E,"Certainl y not; but my purpose in calling attention to these matters again is to insure, if possible, that they shall not be repeated this year. The reply of the Department, when inquiries were made, was that there was nothing to worry about, and that the officer appointed to make investigations had reported that all was well. Yet the occurrences upon which that officer was' seve- required to report were exactly those No 1I have just indicated. If our lads are to be subjected to treatment such as this, the sooner we close the training camps the better. We are sowing in the minds of the rising, generation a hatred of military training and preparation. Conditions of discomfort and danger were natural enough in the emergencies of war, but they are not such as our-young Australian trainees should be compelled to submit to in times of peace. This camp was in the vicinity of a great city, and such of the necessary facilities as were not available within the camp itself could have been speedily requisitioned. There was, in fact, no excuse for the camp being conducted as it was, and it is reasonably certain that that lad lost his life because of the failure of certain One officers responsible to do their work as they should have done. As a matter of fact, they altered the date of the youth's death one week, in order to place it a little further away from the day on which he left camp. Not only at this camp, but at Broadmeadows also, the health and lives of trainees were in jeopardy. Yet the officers responsible have not only been retained in the service, but have escaped without reproof-indeed , with a whitewashing report. The whole circumstances indicate an utter disregard for the welfare of trainees and absolute neglect on the part of responsible officials. I hope steps will be taken to seo that the work of preparing for the camps is in future put in hand in ample, time, and that it is placed under the - control of capable officers. And if there should be any further scandals I trust that those responsible will be no longer retained in the service. Question resolved in the affirmative.'
