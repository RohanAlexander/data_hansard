If that arrangement iscontemplated, I ask the honourable, gentleman to take into consideration, the possibility of the train arriving in. Sydney too late for the function. Will he think over theadvisability of permitting members, toleave on Thursday night, so that they may apend some time in Sydney before the function takes place) Mr. JOSEPH COOE:-My honourable friends opposite are. fertile, in suggestions of adjournment.",12
2,Mr FENTOH,Unknown,"This , is a' national occasion. V Mr. JOSEPH: COOK - I am afraid that the holiday habit is becoming chronic with them.

3,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Referring to what the honourable gentleman, has said, about adjournments, I ask Him . whether he could not have introduced in another place' a number of the measures mentioned in the memorandum which he laid on ths table on the 13th August. Had hedone that it would not have been necessary for the Senate to adjourn for want of. business from the 1.1th to the.24th of this;month?",12
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"My honourable friends opposite have given full notice, of their, determination not to do business;. They have - told us that repeatedly.",12

6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I hear it many times, almost every week.",13
7,Mr FENTON,Unknown,We helped to A u d it Bill through.,13
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Honourable members took three days to deal with a Bill which should, have been dealt with in thirteen minutes. The Government is taking the course that it thinks most likely to ultimately conduce to the despatch of public business.",13
9,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, a question arising out of his answer concerning another place. The Prime Minister said that he had been repeatedly in formed that it was the intention of this party not to allow the Government and the parly opposite to do any business. I should like to know who is the gentleman who has informed the Prime Minister that it is the intention of this party not to allow the Government to do any business, and whether he has obtained information on that subject from the Leader of this party in this House?",13
10,Mr KELLY,Unknown,W h i o h Leader? That is the point.,13
11,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Thes e frivolous interjections are not at all relevant.,13
12,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The remark was sulting.,13
13,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"It was insulting, too. I wish to know whether the Prime M i nister has heard from the Leader of this party in this House, or from the Leader of the party in the Senate, at any time, that it is the intention of the party to prevent him and his Government from carrying on any business?",13
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have not heard any such statement from the Leader of the party opposite. not expect to do so. I think he has more sense than to make a statement of that sort.,13
15,Mr FISHER,Unknown,What authority had you for making such a statement?,13
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I had this authority among others - that actions speak louder than words. SMALL - P OX OUTBREAK .,13
17,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Does the Government in tend to take notice of a communication Bent by the Premier of New South Wales conveying a resolution passed by the New South Wales Board of Health affirming the opinion that quarantine restrictions should be removed from the metropolitan area of Sydney? If so, will the Prime » Minister, at the earliest opportunity, let put the the House and the public know what it intends to do in the inatter ?",13
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I understood that the subject would be discussed this afternoon. I hope that my honourable friends will facilitate the consideration of the. motion of which the honourable member for Gwydir has given notice.,13
19,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Will the honourable member offer any objection to that motion being brought on?,13
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have no control of private members' business, but the Government will offer no objection to any course that will facilitate the discussion of that motion.",13
21,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"A report appeared in the press yesterday to the effect that the health authorities of New South Wales had communicated to the Premier of that State the opinion that the disease now epidemic in Sydney is not true small-pox. I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs, without notice, whether he has received information to that effect; and if so, what action the Federal quarantine authorities intend to take in respect of the matter? As this is a very important insubject I wish to ask the Minister for an authoritative statement.",13
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The whole matter is to be discussed presently.,13
23,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I know that; but I am asking quite a different question. T wish to know whether the Minister will lay an authoritative statement before the House from the Director of Quarantine, Dr Cumpston, respecting the disease, as to whether it is, in his opinion, true I do small-pox or not. I think the public have a right to know, and he is the only authority to whom we can look in the matter.",13
24,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I tliink that the honourable member for West Sydney has been misinformed as to .the opinion of the health authorities of New South Wales that the disease in question is not true small-pox. Their opinion isThe Board is satisfied, from sucli experience, that the disease now prevalent in Sydney is an exceedingly modified form of small-pox, mild in its nature, with no tendency to change its type and become more virulent. They do not say that it is not small-pox, but that it is small-pox of a mild type.",13
25,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I did not gather that they said that.,14
26,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I think the honourable member's question suggested that the disease was "" not true small-pox.""",14
27,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Yes .,14
28,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable me iber - has asked for an authoritative opinion from the Director of Quarantine. I will communicate with Dr Cumpston, and obtain his opinion at once.",14

30,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The answers to honourable member's questions are1. This Department is not in possession of the information. The State authorities have trol of such details. 2. Both forms of protection have been used. ABORIGINALS. TREATMENT OF PRISONERS : DEATH,14
31,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I ask the Minister of External Affairs whether he has read the account which appears in this morning's newspapers of the trial for murder in the Northern Territory of some aboriginals, who have been convicted and sentenced to death, and if he has read the report of Professor Baldwin Spencer, which has just been circulated among members, dealing with the unfair treatment of aboriginal prisoners compared with that of white prisoners? In view of the circumstances disclosed by the newspaper reports, will the honourable gentleman see that no steps are taken to carry out the penalty imposed until he himself has had an opportunity to thoroughly in vestigate the case ?",14
32,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have not yet had a chance to go into the case, having been occupied this morning with a deputation; but, of course, all cases in which the death penalty is imposed are carefully in vestigated by the Minister, who reads allrelevant documents. Recently, when two aboriginals were convicted of manslaughter, I sent to the Northern Territory for all the documents conuected with the case, including the Judge's notes, so that I might read them myself before making any recommendation to the Cabinet, and T shall follow the same course in this case. As to Professor Baldwin Spencer's report, I shall study it carefully, and see what should be done in the matter referred to.",14
33,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"The question of the honourable member for Cook covers, in part, a question that I had intended to address to the Minister. I should also like to ask him if he will take into consideration the have advisability of giving the House an opportunity to express an opinion on the in fliction of the death penalty upon unhave civilized natives of the Northern Terribeen isolated ? and been altory, or of any other part of Australia lowed to be at large? under Federal control ?",14
34,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I cannot promise to ask the opinion of the House in every case in the which the death penalty is imposed, but I assure honourable members that the same caution and deliberation that are con- observed in connection with the imposition of the death penalty on white persons are observed when aboriginals are affected. Both the last Government and this most carefully considered the case of a native who was one of two convicted for the PENALTY. murder of a Chinaman in the Northern Territory, and it was only under a sense of imperative necessity that his execution was resolved upon. The question whether the other man should be executed is still under consideration, and cannot be decided until all the notes in connection with the case have been considered by me and a recommendation made to the Executive. Four months must elapse between the sentence and the execution. SUGAR EXCISE.",14
35,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Ove r a week ago I asked the Prime Minister a question relating to the amount of sugar in bond at the date of the proclamation of the repeal of the Sugar Excise Act? I also asked for the names of the persons interested, and the quantity of sugar they had in bond on that date; and for copies of any correspondence which had passed between the parties and the Department. The Prime Minister informed me that the in formation was being obtained. I now desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs when we are likely to get it ?",14
36,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member will obtain the information almost immediately. Some of it has already been obtained. The remainder will be procured as soon as possible. TASMANIAN FRUIT IN SYDNEY.,15
37,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Trime Minister, without notice, whether he has obtained any further in formation with regard to the holding up of Tasmanian f r u it on Sydney wharfs?",15
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"A reply has been received from Sydney from the Collector of Customs to the effect that the company's employees and the f r u it merchants themselves are discharging cargoes, and that everything is proceeding expeditiously. The f r u it is in good condition, and ajDparently no harm has resulted. DISLOYAL UTTERANCES.",15
39,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether he has observed reports of several disloyal utterances made yesterday in the State of Victoria ? One case occurred at Port Melbourne, where a citizen is reported to have saidWhen they were sufficiently strong and the blow, landlords, instead of singing "" save the K in g , "" as is fashionable nowadays, will sing "" G o d save ths rent!""",15
40,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honorablo member is not in order. The Government have nothing' to do with the private opinions of citizens.,15
41,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I think, sir, that in order. if you will hear me out you will see that I am in ordsr. At another meeting, that of the Protestant Defence Association, Dr Leeper is reported to have said that he was willing to aid and abet",15
42,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member must resume his seat. have pointed out on several occasions that questions put to Ministers must have reference to the administration of the Departments of which they have charge, or to public affairs with which they are connected. The honourable member is now asking Ministers a question in regard to the utterances of private citizens, which have no connection with their Departments. The question is absolutely out of order.",15
43,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I want to know whether the Prime Minister will take action,15
44,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member must not traverse my ruling. The question is out of order, and cannot be put.",15
45,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,On a point of order-ho w can you possibly say that my question is not in order when you have not heard me ? This is a constitutional point.,15
46,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member must not argue the point with the Chair. There is only one way in which a ruling can be objected to, and that is provided for in the Standing Orders. It is within the province of the Speaker to decide whether a question is permissible or not. It is not for the House even to decide that. It is a matter entirely within the province of the Speaker. The honourable member's question has already been ruled out of order.",15
47,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"What I wish to do is to ask the Prime Minister whether he will advise the Governor General to approach the State Governor with a view to getting him to interfere and put a stop to such disloyal utterances? Dr struck Leeper talked about arming, organizing, God and drilling, and about fighting England.",15
48,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,15
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I can undertake to do no such thing.,15
50,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have already ruled the question out of order, and, if a question is not in order, the answer is also not",15
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I think we had better mind our own business. Mr MATHEW'S - Are we to allow disloyalty of that sort? INTER - STA TE COMMISSION . I,15
52,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I promised the honourable member for Yarra that I would lay upon the table information asked for concerning the forms relating to Tariff matters issued by the Inter-State Commission. Copies of these papers have been sent to each honourable member, and I now formally lay them upon the table.",15
53,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Will the Minister move that the papers be printed? They should be preserved amongst the parliamentary papers. Otherwise they will get out of the hands of honourable members, and we shall not be able to turn back to them.",15

55,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I desire to ask the M in ister of Trade and Customs the reason why it took him one month to produce the papers relating to the appointment of an Inspector of Lighthouses, and whether all the papers in connection with that matter have been laid upon the table of the Library?",16
56,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The reason why the papers were not produced immediately is that at the time they were asked for the motion of censure was under consideration. The debate upon that motion terminated whilst I was absent from this State. Immediately on my return I procured the papers and put the honourable member in possession of them. All the papers have been laid upon the table of the Library. ELECTOR AL BILL : SECRECY OF,16
57,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he has any mandate from the people for harking back nearly 100 years, and now seeking to abolish the secrecy of the ballot under the Electoral Bill , which is before the House ?",16
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I emphatically say that no such intention is in the mind of the Government. We are intent only on one thing, namely, to provide for the secrecy of the ballot, while at the same time affording further facilities for voting to the people of this country.",16
59,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I would like to ask the Prime Minister whether the words which he himself used in replying to a question put by the honourable member for Capricornia a few moments ago are not applicable to him - "" Do not actions speak louder than words?""",16
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I hope they do.,16
61,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I rise to a point of order. Is the Prime Minister in order in failing to rise when answering a question put by an honourable member ?,16
62,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the Prime M in ister did make a serious answer to the honourable member's question, he was not in order in failing to rise from his seat. But I took his answer as a sotto voce in terjection.",16
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I would not do anything to h u r t the feelings of my honourable friend. I hope they do. COMMONWEALTH BANK.,16
64,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Treasurer what profits have been made by the Commonwealth Bank since its establishment? also Sir JOHN FORREST - The accounts of the Bank are published quarterly. If the honourable member will give notice of his question, I think that I shall be able to give him the informatiou which he desires tomorrow.",16
65,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,I wish to ask the Treasurer whether he will see that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank does publish quarterly returns so that the position of the Bank may be understood?,16
66,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The law requires that to be done, and I believe that it is being done.",16
67,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Treasurer whether he is aware that the Governor of the Commonwealth BALLOT. Bank is charging the farmers 2 per cent, more than he is charging persons who live in the city centres, and if the right honourable gentleman has the power, will he alter that condition of affairs?",16
68,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I shall be obliged if the honourable member will give notice of his question. I do not think that I have any power to interfere with the Governor of the Bank in this respect. BUDGET.,16
69,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Can the Treasurer state when he proposes to deliver his Budget?,16
70,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,I shall-be glad to make an announcement to the House on that subject at the earliest possible moment. 1 hope that I shall be able to deliver the Budget statement very soon. NA CIRCULARS.,16
71,Mr FENTON,POSTAGE ON LETTERSAN D,"The other day I asked the Postmaster-General a question relating to the postage charged on letters and circulars. I pointed out that suburban business men and secretaries of organizations were compelled to come into the General Post Office, Melbourne, in order to secure the advantage of a cheaper postage rate on such mail matter, and I asked if the Postmaster-General would d r a f t a new by-law with a view to giving suburban residents the same privilege as is enjoyed by business men in Melbourne.",16
72,Mr AGAR WYNNE,POSTAGE ON LETTERSAN D,"The concession to which the honourable member refers was granted to persons posting large quantities of matter, and to obviate the purchase by them of stamps. If we made the concessioni n respect of every post office, however, the work of the officials would be enormously increased, and the cost would be excessive. I do not think that very much inconvenience is involved in requiring persons to forward such matter to the Central Office. NA",17
73,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENTIAL TRADE,"the Minister Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether, in any preferential trade treaty between the Commonwealth and any country, the Government will provide that only those goods manufactured or produced by workers receiving the Australian standard rate of wages shall be allowed to come into Australia under preferential rates of duty ?",17

I will endeavour to get him as much information as possible, but of I would point out that if the whole of the returns which he seeks have to be compiled, several months will elapse before the work is completed. There are a large number of persons in the Public Service who are employed, it may be, for several days, or for a week, or for a fortnight at a time, and to get a return which would embrace them would be a long and tedious undertaking. honourable STABLE S: MOORE PARK .",17

SMALL - P OX OUTBREAK . QUARANTINE AREA : SYDNEY. PAPERS. Mr Webster (Gwydir) [ 3 . 1 ] - I do not know that I have ever felt a greater responsibility in submitting a proposal, either in this House or any other, than I feel today in movingThat-wit h a view to putting an end to the suffering, sacrifice of human life, and the commercial, industrial, and domestic stagnation in the State of New South Wales, resulting from the proclamation and administration of the laws governing small-pox epidemics-this House is of the opinion that the proclamation should be cancelled, and that isolation, combined with sanitary reform, the true enemy of small-pox, should be substituted for the present injurious methods. The motion strikes at the very heart of the health of the community. It is the first step that has been taken to deal VOTES with the subject since the Federal GovernRECORDED . ment took over the quarantine of contagious diseases. No doubt it is essential in a Parliament of this kind for honourable members to see, firstly, that any steps that may be taken may be effective for the intended purpose, and, secondly, that they may not be injurious to the people, whilst not giving any benefit in qualified to vote; return. This subject bristles with difficulties and complexity of opinions. U n doubtedly, it requires a great amount of study and attention, which, with all due respect to the Minister of Trade and Customs, I fear he did not give to it before the proclamation was issued. In dealing with a malady of this kind-it is a national, and not a parochial questionone ought to be able to look into the very recesses of experience to find out what has been done by other countries. It strikes me that three or four very essential points require to be elucidated in order to understand the problem. First, vaccination is an operation which has been in vogue for very many years. The medical fraternit y have assessed the method, not always at one value, - but at varying values, as experience has taught them the wisdom of it , or otherwise. Vaccination consists of injecting, practically into the blood of the human, poisonous matter in the shape of vaccine virus, taken fro m Small-pox [18 SEPTEMBEB, 1913.] one of the most repulsive sources it is poslymph was taken from a corpse. sible to contemplate. As the subject cannot he properly dealt with in an hour, I intend to show as quickly as possible the various phases which, in my opinion, are worthy of consideration. It is held by the advocates of vaccination that it is a remedy for small-pox-that is, that it renders immune those who have not got it from contact with those who have already contracted it . Further, it is said that the lymph itself-the vaccine-is of a pure character; that it is so clearly analyzed by the authorities as not to convey to the system many of the evils which are charged to it . What is the lymph that is used, for the purpose of vaccination t It is undoubtedly one of the most repulsive of all poisons that have yet been introduced into the human system. Dr Jenner got his name recorded as the originator of vaccination, but he was not entitled to that-credit, because vaccination, or inoculation, had long been in existence in Turkey, perpetrated by a number of old women, who inoculated people from those persons who were suffering from the disease. From that primitive method, which was introduced into Turkey, Dr Jenner seems to have got his inspiration. proclaimed over a hundred years ago that vaccination gave a lifelong immunity from small-pox. That theory has long since been exploded. Dr Jenner took the lymph from the greasy heels of a diseased horse. A horse suffering from grease is alleged by the best of our veterinary surgeons to be in a state of consumption, and horse grease formed the basis of the vaccine or lymph. Next it passed from horse grease pure to horse grease, then to cow-pox, taken from a cow through the grease of the horse; and then spontaneous cow-pox followed. with cow-pox, they produced small-pox in oculation. Then came the stage when they introduced the lymph from the calf. Having inoculated a monkey from a diseased person, they took the disease from ihe monkey to the calf, and then from the calf to the human. Then came the system of arm-to-arm inoculation, which was one of the greatest sources of trouble in the Old Country when I was a little boy; so much so that the lives of hundreds of thousands of children were sacrificed to that objectionable and impure method. Next came monkey lymph, and finally the [49]- 2 Outbreak. 1323 Authorities reckon that the purest lymphthe lymph which is least injurious to the human-is that which is taken i m mediately after death from the corpse of a person who has suffered from the disease in a developed form, Such are the sources from which we are inoculating the people of this country today, quite unnecessarily, while the action of the Government-for which I am not blam-ing them-ha s been given a certain support by the press, which has ever been behind the medical men who have recommended vaccination. Through these sources we are forcing thousands of people, indeed, hundreds of thousands in Sydney and suburbs, under a most objectionable system. Every day paragraphs appear in the newspapers urging on the people that vaccination presents the one and only escape from small-pox. We know that the disease, if small-pox at all, is only a modified for m ; and yet, as a result of the action of Dr Cumpston, backed up by the Health authorities and the press, I know, in my own experience, though I have not moved about much-of more than twenty people between the ages of He ten and for ty who today are in their graves. Those twenty people are not a tithe of those who have gone under, or who will go under, in consequence of the deadly impurities which have been in jected into the human blood, and which, developing slowly but surely, will show their effects in years to come. As a matter of fact, the medical authorities know little of the disease, and not one can tell what the virus of small-pox is. The tetanus virus, the tuberculosis germs; and the germs of almost every other disease can be detected by the microscope, Next, but those of small-pox or of vaccinia have never yet been identified by any scientific authority, medical or otherwise. Since the medical authorities fail to identify the germs of vaccinia and of small-pox, they have no means of comparing or eliminating the inr jurious germs which are introduced into the human system by means of vaccination; and it is not maintained that it is possible to secure vaccination without the risk of conveying other and more serious diseases than smallpox to human kind. In regard to vaccination, authorities hold that there are two essentials, namely, lymph and its proper In the first place, for the reasons I have given, no certificate of pure lymph can he issued, and, as to the serting aright of the vaccine, what the opinions of the great authorities? If honourable members are inclined to treat this matter lightly or with hilarity it is just as well that the suffering people should know. As to the proper insertion tion. of the vaccine, Dr Curschman, a German authority, holds that there should not be less than twelve vesicles, six on arm, to constitute proper inoculation. from these foreign bodies. Dr Bond, secretary to the Jenner Society, maintains that the more vesicles the better; that is to say, the more which vesicles there are the more certain one can be of immunity from small-pox. Of against enteric fever. course, one might carry that argument to an absurd conclusion, and declare that if a man had vesicles all over him he would be sure to be immune; though, of course, such a man would not live long. Dr Drysdale says that vesicle is sufficient, while Dr Adams, Liverpool, declares for two, Dr halgh, of London, for three, Dr Sandwith for five, Dr Debenham for six, and on. Here we have a divergence opinion ranging from one vesicle to while the secretary of the Jenner Insti tute says that the more vesicles there are trouble. the better. Under the circumstances a layman may hesitate to for m any conclusion as to the efficacy of vaccination. It is alleged that lymph is capable of diseases. analysis, so that any injurious matter may be detected; but on this point the Lancet, in 1902, declared that, after investigating various lymphs, it had to pronounce them nearly all alive with in numerable extraneous organisms.",18
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Is the against vaccination?,20
87,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I do not know, but that is not the point at present.",20
88,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Does the Lancet what is the nature of the organisms?,20
89,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"No ; but the fact that the organisms are present is quite sufficient for my argument now. The Lancet is the recognised medical author it y in the British Empire, and we have that serious statement from it i u regard to lymph. Further, we are informed that the lymph which came twelfth on the pure list, in order of purity, was that f u r insertion. nished by the Jenner Institute, which has grown up from the Jenner period to be the great authority on vaccination. When in - the institute, which makes this their are sole business, cannot produce lymph free from innumerable living organisms, we see the immense possibilities of those organisms entering the human system i u the general practice of vaccinaI t has been contended that glycerine is the preservative of lymph, but the highest authorities have shown each that glycerinated lymph is not free Erom time to time various serums have been advocated, such as the enteric serum, was introduced into South A f r i c a , at the time of the war, as a preventive And yet three soldiers died from enteric fever to every one who died from wounds received in battle. This shows that,the serum which was introduced to prevent an outbreak of enteric among the troops had the same very disastrous effects as vaccine has when one used in connection with small-pox. Then of we have the Haffkine plague serum, Greenwhich is generally used in India, and plague has been raging there ever since so its introduction amongst the protected of inhabitants of that country. The more six, they have been inoculated with the serum - the greater has been the growth of the",20
90,Mr H IGGS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"To be logical, one should be vaccinated for a thousand and one",20
91,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Quite so. If we accepted the advice of some medical authorities, human beings would be vaccinated from their infancy u n t i l, I was going to say, old age was reached; but people vaccinated in this way would never live to an old age. No one could undergo Lancet such treatment and live. Those who are opposed to vaccination have also to contend with misleading statistics, which, in relation to this' question, are glaringly inaccurate. I guarantee say that scarcely one of the certificates given by doctors in Sydney as to the causes of the death of persons who have become diseased as the result of vaccination indicated that death was brought about in that way. I know of the case of a young man who had never had a day's illness in his life. He was vaccinated at a public depot, and a week later retired to rest apparently in good health save for a pain in his a r m ; but in night his wife, to whom he had been married only a few months, failed rouse him, and, on striking a light, found that he was dead. He suffered from one of the after-effects of vaccination. It acknowledged by eminent medical authodisease rities that such diseases as apoplexy paralysis are rapidly developed after the germ has been introduced. knew of another gentleman, who was in an insurance office, and enjoyed original good health u n t i l he was vaccinated. the virus you use?"" Two or three days after his cination his mind became unhinged.

Two days after his removal to the hospital he the issue. died, and was buried amid the grief and regrets of those who loved him. I could quote case after case in which death has occurred as the result of vaccination.",20
92,Mr BOYD,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Did the medical certificates state that these deaths were the result of vaccination ?,21

94,Mr BOYD,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,But that would not be time to time in lymph. conclusive evidence.,21
95,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"-Doctor s hesitate give a certificate of death from vaccination. In such cases, the certificate usually the cause of death as heart failure, paralysis, apoplexy, meningitis, or one of the other diseases culminating from vacforty cination. Eminent authorities have nounced the medical profession time again during the last sixty years for their dishonesty in failing to give certificates including of death in accordance with the whole of sixty-four cases of eczema, the facts leading up to the deaths of persons concerned. As showing what the medical men know of lymph, let me quote Dr Elgin, one of the greatest authorities who is in favour of vaccination, and when examined before the British Royal the Commission, said, in reply to the question "" What is vaccine?"" "" I would like to to know."" Here we have a doctor who advises the public to be inoculated with vaccine the composition of which he says is he "" w o u ld like to know."" Is there any which would be treated in such an and irresponsible manner as is small-pox by men who do not understand the nature of I the remedies they are employing? Dr Elgin was further asked, "" What is the source of the strain or strains of His answer was, vac- "" I do not know."" Medical men know neither the source of the virus nor its composition. It is because of that lack of knowledge, I suppose, that they recommend the people to be vaccinated with calf lymph. Most of the authorities shirk Dr Bolton, in his treatise on diseases, can find space for only nineteen lines in regard to small-pox and vaccination, although his book contains 466 pages altogether. He is a modern author it y , and one would expect him to be up to date in his knowledge of small-pox and its treatment by vaccination. Yet we find him writin g practically nothing about it his treatise. This, I take it , is an in the dication that medcal men prefer not to offer opinions on questions which they do Another great authoi t y , Dr Citron, devotes only twenty-seven lines in his work on Immunity to These modern authorities shirk the responsibility the of trying to put before the people the dangers of vaccination and small-pox. I propose to refer very briefly to living germs which, as reported in the Lancet, are found from In England, some time ago, a circular was issued to to 4,000 medical men asking for their experience as to the diseases introduced gives into the human system by vaccination. Only three hundred and seventy furnished replies; but they enumerated more than different diseases which had been in detroduced into the human system in the and desire to make it immune from one disease. Forty diseases were mentioned, 126 cases of erysipelas, fifty-three the cases of syphilis, twenty-two cases of erythema, and nine cases of scrofula, in addition to cases of cancer, convulsions, abscesses, blindness, paralysis, tubercuwho, losis, meningitis, diseased bones, and many other diseases. The returns, of course, include only cases in which the mischief has followed directly and obviously on vaccination, and show only a small proportion of the total evil wrought. Every authority on the question lays it down that the information obtained from the medical fraternity as to the diseases* arising from vaccination covers only a small proportion of such diseases, because the true facts are hidden. Syphilis is one of the most horrible and deadly of diseases. If I had to choose between running the risk of small-pox or being attacked by syphilis consequent upon vaccination, I would say, "" God preserve me from vaccination ! "" I would a thousand times sooner take the chance of falling ill of small-pox.",21
96,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The honourable member would not argue that the one thing is consequent upon the other?,22
97,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I am not arguing; I am giving authority. One writer saysThere is much evidence as to the ease and frequency with which such cases escape notice. In one of the cases of syphilitic epidemic after vaccination (of which Dr Creighton has recorded a score in the Encyclopedia BrUannica), which was tracked out from an accidental clue by an independent medical investigator, it was found that the eleven cases in question were entirely unknown either to the general practitioners or public vaccinator in whose district they resided. Syphilis, the worse and vilest of diseases, can be conveyed to your children and other members of your family by vaccination. When I last spoke on this subject, the press said that I was theorizing, and therefore I now quote the opinions of some of the highest authorities on vaccination. Dr Collins, having in mind the danger of syphilis, moved at the Londou Medical Animal Vaccination Conference in 1879-That, having regard to the fact that vaccination has in no way mitigated the severity nor lessened the frequency of small-pox epidemics; and, further, that it has on several occasions been the means of extensively propagating syphilis, as shown by Drs. Warlomont and Cameron-Resolve d : That this Conference condemns the present system of vaccination as mischievous in its results, and inoperative as a prophylactic against the disease it is designed to suppress. I could quote three or four more authorities on this aspect of the case, but my time will not permit me to do so. Let me deal now with that most terrible of diseases, tuberculosis, which today is claiming hundreds for every individual taken with small-pox. No disease is more fatal to the human race than tjie white plague, and from no source can it be conveyed more readily to the human system than from the calf. Go to any abattoirs, and you will find that calves are infected with tuberculosis, and the lymph taken from such calves may convey the disease to the human system. Thus, in the attempt to avoid small-pox, we risk spreading a disease a thousand times more dangerous. Mr. JOSEPH COOK: - Before lymph is used the calf from which it was taken is killed and tested to find out whether it was tuberculous.",22
98,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,They cannot eliminate the tuberculosis.,22
99,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Lymp h taken from a beast found to be diseased is not used.,22
100,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,They cannot positively detect the disease.,22
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,I have been told that there is nothing easier than the detection of tuberculosis.,22
102,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,I have here authorities who say that it cannot be detected.,22
103,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Koc h distinguished the bacillus as far back as 1885.,22
104,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Authoritie s agreethat the facts relating to tuberculosis in Great Britain and Germany are sufficient to justify a warning against vaccination. In Germany, where the population is vaccinated three times before arriving at manhood, that nation being according to authority the best vaccinated in the world, there are three cases of tuberculosis to every one case in Great Britain, where compulsory vaccination has practically ceased, having fallen greatly into disuse for the last quarter of a century.",22
105,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,That is one of the grossest exaggerations I have heard of. The statistics show that the statement is not true.,22
106,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I have the statistics, and they prove the statement. The honourable member professes to be opposed to vaccination, but he is trying to help the Government by a side wind. He is trying to save the position by misrepresenting the case.",22
107,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The case is quite strong enough without misrepresentation.,22
108,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The same facts have been noticed in other countries. An eminent authority in San Francisco has put forward an opinion which tends to show that we are doing the wrong thing by trying to stamp out small-pox. It is urged by a writer in the American Medical Liberty News, published in San - Francisco, that every person who has suffered from small-pox is immune from tuberculosis and any scrofulous disease. If that be so, we are doing the country a great in j u r y in tryin g to prevent smallpox by vaccination.",22
109,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Does the honourable member accept that opinion),23
110,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"It has been published in an authoritative journal. The medical profession is divided in regard to vaccination, but there is this to be said in favour of those who are opposed to compulsory vaccination, that they have no pecuniary interest to serve, their opinions being diametrically opposed to their financial interests. Oh"" the other hand, those who urge vaccination are biased in the first place, and, in the second place, influenced by material considerations, and, generally speaking, they - do not give a fair representation of the facts that come within their experience. It is held by authorities that the germ of cancer may be contained in lymph, and that it can scarcely be detected when the lymph is examined. It is a strange thing that the country that has been longest under compulsory vaccination has the largest number of cancer sufferers, and the country in which vaccination has been most recently introduced has the - smallest number. The inference is that by vaccination we convey from the cow to the human system a disease a thousand times worse than small-pox. Then, in a work, Recrudescence of Leprosy, and I ts Causation, published in London by Swan, Sonnenschien and Company, an authority saysIn India, the West Indies, Soutli America, South Africa, and the Sandwich Islands, vaccination is a prolific cause of leprosy, the most loathsome, incurable, and repulsive disease which affects the human race. Thus by vaccination we run the risk of introducing into the human system consumption, cancer, leprosy, blood poisoning, convulsions, eczema, erysipelas, and a number of other diseases.",23
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,I shall have to mine undone after this!,23
112,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I am afraid that the Prime Minister cannot. He, like anybody else, may get over the immediate effects of vaccination, but no man can say when he has got over the ultimate effects. ""Oue can never be sure. He does not know what germs may remain latent in his blood, waiting for an opportunity to become virulent and to penalize him for the operation that has been performed.",23
113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I hope that next time the honourable member is attacking me on the platform, he will remember that, and let me down lightly !",23
114,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I may say "" ditto "" to the Prime Minister. Good authorities in Germany have declared that, not only are these terrible diseases likely to supervene upon vaccination, but that they are the actual outcome of it . One authority states that in Germany defective teeth and eyesight have become notoriously common since compulsory vaccination was instituted.",23
115,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Is it stated that vaccination is a cause ?,23
116,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Yes ; since vaccination has been imposed defective teeth and eyesight have become common.,23
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Who says that?,23
118,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The authority is Mr Herbert Spencer, who, I think it will be admitted, did not talk about what he did not understand. To put a case in point, I may quote the following passage, which happens to be the evidence of an undertakerwho applied to Mr Lane,- in October, 1902, for a certificate of exemption. He based his objection on the knowledge of the dangers of vaccination which he had acquired in the course of his business. He .said he had placed many children in their coffins who had suffered terribly from vaccination, and mentioned incidentally that, of his own nine children, only the two unvaccinated had preserved sound teeth. That gentleman had had opportunities in the course of his business of learning what the effects of vaccination were, and he did not hesitate to declare that the teeth and eyes of the community were threatened by this idiotic policy of forcing vaccination on the people. Another remarkable fact is that statistics show that before vaccination was compulsorily imposed in England and Germany, there were few cases of measles and influenza. Those get diseases were enumerated in the vita l statistics to a very slight extent; but since vaccination has become common it is found that there is a growing in crease of measles and influenza, and that the risk of death from them, is greater than was formerly the case. Dr Knaggs and Dr Curtis Bennett, two London physicians, submitted to be fined rather than subscribe tp vaccination. Knaggs was fined at the Marylebone Police Court in 1903, and he defended himself by saying thatCow-pox and a certain loathsome disease are so much alike as to be dimcult to distinguish. He is not the only authority who alleges that there is practically no difference be1879 tween cow-pox and syphilitic disease. In any case, it is difficult to distinguish tween the virus of the one and the germral of the other.",23
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Apparently , the as honourable member is against vaccination under any circumstances.",24
120,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"An y man who had the seen what I have seen, read what I have Later read, and knows what has happened on Vaccination lately as the outcome of vaccination, would be indeed f it for some other place than Parliament-for a place where he to would not be free-if he were to support tion vaccination. I cannot conceive any sane man supporting vaccination if he knows anything about the history of it , and the results from it , throughout the civilized world. I have dealt with the effects of vaccination. The next question that arises is-Does it give munity from small-pox? Does it secure what we are after? Let me cite the tory of Leicester, a town in England, in only sixty-three. reference to this matter. At a when 90 per cent, of the inhabitants of than amongst the unvaccinated. the town were vaccinated, the deaths small-pox were twenty-seven per thouwhich the facts are quite clear. sand. But, in 1889, when the proporwriter tion of persons vaccinated had sunk to 5 per cent., the death-rate fell to 17.5; and, in 1901, it sank to 16; one of the brilliant lowest death-rates in the United K in g dom, despite the disadvantages of soil on and situation. The National Vaccine Establishment in England has published genious statistics intended to support the theory of vaccination, but when these statistics were investigated independently, it was found that they had been multiplied by vaccination. six, in order to make out the very worse case possible against non-vaccination. The experience of India tells strongly against vaccination. The policy has allayed endemics or reduced the number beof deaths. On the contrary, deaths from small-pox have increased since vaccination was introduced. In the north-west vinces, the disease has practically deciland mated the people in spite of vaccination.",24
121,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Can the honourable memDr ber quote the number of deaths amongst vaccinated persons in India?,24
122,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The authority before me statesIn India, where small-pox is endemic, and where vaccination has therefore a rich field in which to exhibit its potency, its influence is thus appraised by the Punjab Army Commission of - "" Vaccination in the Punjab, as else: where in India, has no power, apparently, over be the force of an endemic. The whole Indian experience points in one direction-that to the genesanitary condition of the towns .ind villages must we look for the mitigation of small-pox, of cholera and fever."" report for 1884-5 o n Similarly, in the North-west Provinces and Oude :-""We are brought face to face with the fact that, notwithstanding the existence of an active vaccination service, small-pox swept over Provinces just as if there had been none."" still, the resolution of the Bengal Government on the report of the Sanitary Commission in 1902, yields this striking excerpt :-""The Lieutenan't-Governor would be glad if the Sanitary Commission could arrange adduce some more direct evidence than is at present furnished of the efficacy of the vaccinain warding off the disease or mitigating its, of severity."" In other words, the report was against vaccination, and' the Governor of Bengal wanted to obtain a more favourable reportTake the facts about Sheffield in regard to this question of immunity. In welli mvaccinated Sheffield, the death rate per 10,000 was 192, whilst in ill-vaccinated hisDewsbury the death rate per 10,000 was So that there was a time higher death rate amongst the vaccinated Then from we have the case of Gloucester, as to The of the pamphlet before me saysI call Dr Hadwen to witness, because, as a town councillor of that village and a man of professional qualifications, who, unpro- tected by vaccination, was in close attendance the endemic all the time it lasted, he ought to know all the facts rather better than the infictionists who have perverted them to the use of vaccination. He affirms that, bisecting Gloucester east and west, the southern half contained 1,700 out of the 1,900 cases, although the' halves were equal in respect of The differentiation, of course, was in matters sanitary. The worse area presents the usual features- a preponderance of narrow streets, small houses, and bad drainage. Dr Hadwen, as the result of his Gloucesnot ter experience, declared vaccination to the most gigantic piece of quackery ever imposed among a civilized people. proI would further point out that, in Engand Wales, where there are millions of persons unvaccinated, small-pox is, practically speaking, absent. Does not that imply that something more than vaccination is required to remove the danger of small-pox? Occasionally, this disease is brought from well-vaccinated localities in the Old Land to localities where the people have not been vaccinated, and the latter then contract it . But it soon dies down, because it is essentially a tropical disease, and will not flourish unless it can find a lodgement in dirt. I repeat that, owing to the complete sanitary and hygienic conditions which obtain in England, the disease dies out rapidly and does not flourish as of yore. But what is the position in Germany, which the Minister has held up to us as a bright example of the efficacy of vaccination ? It is true that, up t ill 1869, vaccination appeared to benefit Germany. But, if the Minister had extended his research to a later period, he would have found that, in Prussia, the best vaccinated country in the world, there were, in 1872, no less than 124,000 deaths from small-pox. It is clear, therefore, that the man who points to Germany for the purpose of showing the efficacy of vaccination takes up an utterly untenable position. Even with triple vaccination that country, in 1872, was bowed down with an epidemic which carried no less than 124,000 victims to untimely graves. Over-vaccination in that country culminated in a worse attack of the disease than has ever been known elsewhere. It is well worth noting that, whereas in Prussia, during the years 1907, 1908, and 1909, the deaths from smallpox amounted to 41 per 10,000, 43 per 10,000, and 62 per 10,000 respectively, in England, where vaccination has practically fallen into disuse, the number of deaths recorded during the same years was only 21 per 10,000, 10 per 10,000, and 12 per 10,000 respectively. apparent, therefore, that in Germany the deaths from this disease were two to six times as many as the deaths from it in England, the home of the Jenner In stitute, which was founded by the father of vaccination. If time permitted, I could quote equally corroborative proof from other countries of the inefficiency of vaccination as a preventive of small-pox. I appeal to the Minister, as the father of a family, and a representative of the people, to remove the embargo which is now in juring the citizens of Sydney, to use his influence to induce the State authorities to lift the restrictions which are at present imposed there, and to substitute for them local isolation and improved sanitation, which are the only cure for this dire disease.",24
123,Mr BRUCESMITH,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Parkes) [4.8]. - I have no intention, either of supporting or opposing this motion. I desire to use it , however, as a peg upon which to hang one or two observations by way of an elaboration of the questions which I put to the Minister of Trade and Customs the other day. Upon that occasion, I asked him whether he had considered the advisableness of limiting the embargo which has been placed on this disease in New South Wales to much more restricted areas than the whole of the city and metropolis of Sydney. No less than 650,000 persons have been subjected to this embargo, and any one of these who wishes to enter any other State is bound to undergo the very much-debated operation of vaccination. I say very muchdebated, because I will not offer any opinion either upon its efficacy or its dangers. I have lived long enough to recognise that in every department of life is to be found expert knowledge, and I do not like to "" rush in where angels fear to tread,"" in discussing a question of this character, upon which whole volumes have been written. I will not express an opinion upon the subject of whether the disease prevalent in New South Wales at the present time is virulent small-pox. But one cannot shut one's eyes to the fact that though this disease has been in existence there for some months, tliere has not been a single death from it ; while, on the other hand, there have been a number of deaths from what medical men term "" heart failure ""-death s which have been attributed by medical men to vaccination. I am satisfied from my readl t is ing that originally vaccination was a very satisfactory means of rendering people immune from different diseases, and we all know that in cases of diphtheria antitoxin is today recognised as an almost in valuable preventive. I do not think that any one of us- I do not care how wise he may be-unles s he has given his life to a study of medicine, ought to speak with confidence on any of the aspects of this question.",25
124,Mr HIGGS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,But an honourable member can present the views of experts.,25
125,Mr BRUCE SMITH,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I do not wish any honourable member to lay down the law on this snbject as if he were an expert. There are parts of this motion which are distinctly hysterical, just as there were parts of the speech of the honourable member for Gwydir, which were distinctly hysterical. This is a question which requires to be handled with a good deal of coolness and hesitation. Until a quarter of a century ago, at most, it was generally understood that the condition of a living organism was some proof of its real condition. That is to say, that if an animal or a man or insect were found to be immune on the surface from any particular disease, it was thought that one could safely conclude that there were no germs of that disease in that organism. But medical men have demonstrated that very often diseases lie unobserved in a body for generations, and do not develop t ill later. The opinion of scientific men is that very frequently an animal from which lymph is taken may contain the undeveloped germs of a disease which existed in its progenitor very many generations before. Therefore, scientific men are beginning to doubt whether it is safe to take the lymph from an animal merely because it appears to be healthy today. When I hear a man talking law confidently I know that he knows nothing about it ; and when I hear a man talking medicine confidently, I conclude that he knows very little about it .",25
126,Mr HIGGS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,That is how the honourable meinber repays research. His remarks animadvert on an honourable member who has spent a lot of time in reading up this question.,26
127,Mr BRUCE SMITH,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"When men undertake great research they become very modest in their expressions of opinion; and for that reason, when men are loud-mouthed, I conclude that they have the proverbial little knowledge which is dangerous.",26
128,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The honourable member is positively insulting.,26
129,Mr BRUCE SMITH,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The honourable member may fit the cap on if he chooses to do so. I have not said that he was confident. I merely wish to show why I am not confident. The honourable member is thin-skinned if he assumes, because I have denounced confidence on this matter, that I was referring to him. I think his speech was a most modest one.",26
130,Mr HIGGS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Then what . is all this thunder about?,26
131,Mr BRUCE SMITH,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"There is nothunder. The point to which I wish chiefly to direct attention is that, in my opinion, because an average of seven o r eight cases of small-pox occur daily in. Sydney, there is no reason why the wholearea embraced in that city and itssuburbs should be placed under quarantine. In the case of plague, which is an infinitely more virulent and dangerous disease, we know very well that the practice adopted was to an fence in a small area round the houses in which the plague existed. A yellow flag was exhibited as a, warning to the public not to go near;-, policemen were watching, and the people-i of Sydney and its suburbs were held frees to do as they liked so long as they dich not trespass within those narrow limits.. We have today a much less virulent disease, yet every man, woman, and child 1 out of the 650,000 people in Sydneyis forced to undergo this much-debated, operation of vaccination before they can. enter another State, because they come-, from within an extensive area of quarantine. I quite approve of the Minister'sdesire to r i d Australia of the disease, but I put it to him that his purpose would 1 be just as well served if he would l i m it , the quarantine to small portions of thatcity, because if he leaves these areas unmarked he enables persons to go into theinfected smaller areas, and to move from i time to time into other suburbs and so spread the disease.",26
132,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Do you mean that in Sydney we should not allow people to» go from one suburb to another? Mr BRUC E SMITH - Yes ; I do not think they should be interfered. with so long as they do not go into the limited : areas which have been marked as diseased. If half-a-dozen cases existed in . Sydney in, say, half-a-dozen streets, those streets, or parts of those streets, would 'be cut of f , . as it were, from the rest of the community, and people would' be guarded ' and cautioned not to go within thoselimited areas, but theywould be perfectly free in other parts of - Sydney and ' its suburbs.",26
133,Mr WEBSTEH,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"That is isolation. Mr BRU CE SMITH - That is a very good word, and notwithstanding my honourable friend's suspicion of me, I accept his phraseology. If that isolation of the limited areas were adopted, the embargowith regard to other States would I bat lifted, and people coming from Sydney would be treated as if they were entitled go all over the Commonwealth so long as they had not gone within the small limited areas such as were adopted in the case of small-pox.",26
134,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Will you illustrate a case?,27
135,Mr BEUCE SMITH,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Suppos e that two cases have occurred at Darling Point, one at Woollahra, and one at Paddington. There are four cases. If those localities were marked off as limited areas, it would not affeot the people of the other suburbs. The public would be cautioned not to go within those areas, however they were limited, and the people in the rest of Sydney and its suburbs would be as free as the people of Victoria are today. Now, we must not forget that Victoria is acting somewhat in this way with regard to diphtheria. I have the authority of the honourable member for Werriwa for saying that in this State, during last month, there were no less than eleven deaths from diphtheria. That is recognised, notwithstanding anti-toxin, in its normal condition, as a more virulent - disease than is small-pox., yet there is no attempt to quarantine the whole of Melbourne and say that no man .from Melbourne and its suburbs shall go to New South Wales. Suppose that the people of New South Wales said, "" We want the Minister to quarantine the whole of Melbourne and its suburbs, because there have been eleven deaths from diphtheria, whereas we have had none from small-pox."" Melbourne people would cry out at once, "" Why do you not isolate your cases so that the people of Melbourne and its suburbs may be free to go, if they like, about the Commonwealth so long as they had not gone within those limited areas?"" It would be if the honourable member in charge of this motion will allow me to say so, an extension of his great anxiety for the community, because it would restrict the people of the healthy suburbs of Sydney from going into the limited areas in which this disease is known to exist. I think that to extend the quarantine area over the whole of Sydney and its suburbs, and put an embargo on 650,000 people because of that disease, was an excessive precaution. The Minister, I am quite sure, could get a better effect, and one which would be more pleasing to the people of Sydney, if he adopted limited areas, because it is a fact, as the honourable memto ber states in his motion, that this quarantine is most seriously affecting, not only commerce and trade, but the restaurants, the places of amusement, and, generally, many of the money-earning occupations of the people of Sydney. I know from my own observation that there is a sort of l u l l in that city. Many timi d people are afraid to go into public places lest there should be a danger of contamination. That could all be obviated, because, if the smaller places were limited, or fenced off, as was done in the case of small-pox there, they would say, "" Going into a theatre or a concert hall does not matter, because it is not within an infected area."" I suggest, therefore, to the Minister that he should consider the propriety of adopting an altered policy with regard to Sydney.",27
136,Mr HIGGS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Capricornia) [4.21] - I do not desire to speak at any very great length. I thought it rather ungenerous of the honourable member for Parke's to refer in nearly the whole of his spoech in what I considered disparaging terms to the mover of this niotion, who has, without a doubt, given a very great deal of attention to the subject. I am sure that h't does not set up for a moment as an expert, but he, like any other honourable member, is quite entitled to read what experts have to say, and form his opinions on the views expressed by those experts, both for and against vaccination. If Australia had to wait until we got experts into this House some cases would never be considered at all-som e questions 1 would never be discussed. We are very much like newspaper men. A newspaper man has to know something about everyt h in g ; he is able to form an opinion on most subjects, because he reads books and studies questions. To that extent we are like newspaper men. I think that the honourable member for Parkes was not fair to the honourable member in charge of this motion. I am very thankful to the latter, I may say, because I am opposed to vaccination-indeed , so opposed that in Victoria I have been fined a sum of £ 2 because I would not allow my youngster to be vaccinated. I do not believe in the system on what I consider to be logical grounds. If the Almighty considered itnecessary for us to be vaccinated for any disease, all our time would be occupied in being vaccinated for all complaints-fro m toothache to tuberculosis. I think the Minister will have to alter his view. believe there is a great deal in what the honourable member for Gwydir has said, that it is wrong to quarantine such a large area as that which is comprised within a radius of 15 miles of Sydney. I can well believe that where a number of persons are vaccinated with calf lymph and develop a fever it is quite possible, as they get better from the disease-becaus e it is really a disease with which they are afflicted by vaccination-the y give off, so to speak, the disease to persons with whom they come in contact. system that ought to be adopted is the one which was adopted in 1883, when there were isolated cases of small-pox in Sydney. As I went along a certain street-Liverpool-stree t was one, I know - I would see a house barricaded with gum saplings tied to posts, and a yellow flag hoisted. One was not supposed to enter the house, and if he did he was likely to be kept there. The persons so isolated were supposed not to go out of the house. That plan was adopted in several places throughout Sydney. Persons were able to move about freely. They walked through Liverpool-street, Oxford-street, and various streets, and were not affected at all. It was not very long before the disease was stamped out, although it was a pretty virulent attack. I support the motion, which I sincerely hope will be carried. I trust that if it is not carried the Government will so alter the system of quarantine that the moment a case of small-pox is discovered in a house in Sydney the house will be isolated, and the occupants kept from contact with the general public. In my opinion, that would meet the case. honestly believe that the sooner that plan is adopted the sooner we shall get r i d of the disease which is now afflicting the city of Sydney. Mr CONROY CWerriwa) [4.27] I think it was on the Sth July-som e two or three days after the proclamation of quarantine had been declared in Sydney - that I spoke in this House, and pointed out that never before in the world had such a large area been declared a quarantine area, and that the system of compulsory vaccination it would lead to was not in accord with the best medical knowledge of today.",27
137,Mr BUHNS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I think, sir, that we ought to have a quorum. I do not conI sider that this question ought to be discussed in a thin House. [Quorum formed.']",28
138,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Te n weeks ago I pointed out to the House that the proclamation of such a large quarantine area as that of Sydney was quite unknown before to the civilized world; that we ought to pay attention to the true quarantine laws, which assert that the greater the area the less effective the quarantine, and that a mistake was made by the Minister's proclamation. Of course, the The Minister acted on the advice of his responsible medical officers, and, therefore, it is not the action of the Government it self that I wish to challenge.",28
139,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Surely the Government are responsible for the issue of the proclamation ?,28
140,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The proclamation was issued on the advice of a medical man, who was, in the first instance, recommended for his present position by the Labour party.",28
141,Mr BURNS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,That has been denied.,28
142,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,It is absolutely correct.,28
143,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The State Government of New South Wales compelled all the Hawkesbury College students to be vaccinated before they would allow them to return to the State.,28
144,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"That was solely in consequence of the proclamation issued by the Federal Government. However, the point is that there is no instance in the world of a similar proclamation of a city. During the last twenty or t h i r t y years, the advice of medical authorities has been to the effect that isolation is the chief I factor in preventing epidemics. When I last addressed the House on this question, I quoted Sir James Simpson as holdingthat isolation was the chief measure for stamping out small-pox, and I also directed attention to various expressions of opinion on the subject. Sir James Simpson, Dr E . C. Seaton, and others, agree that panic vaccination cannever be relied on to check an epidemic; and I quoted the experience of the Sanitary Commission in India, where smallpox sometimes means the loss of 150,000"" lives in one year. In the report of the sanitary measures adopted in India in 1879-80, page 142, it is pointed out that small-pox is not a disease that can be controlled by vaccination in the sense that vaccination is a specific, although everything possible had been done to vaccinate every soul in the country. In the report of the Army Commission for the Punjaub, page 186, I find these serious wordsVaccination in the Punjnub, as elsewhere in India, has no power over the course of an epidemic. The severity of an epidemic closely connected with sanitary defects than is usually imagined. That is the opinion of doctors who have made a full inquiry into the subject. In a report of 1884-5, page 203, regarding Oude and the North-West Provinces, it is stated that ""notwithstanding the existence of an active vaccination service, small-pox swept over the district just as if there had been no vaccination."" Then I brought the experience down to Leicester of today, where Dr Millard, the well-known medical officer there, who is himself a pro-vaccinationist, has asserted that it is, very probably, much easier to deal with small-pox when there is no vaccination, because, when people are vaccinated, the operation, while not preventing the epidemic, yet modifies the disease to such an extent that it is not so easily recognisable. I regret to think that the vaccination performed in Sydney has been, in many cases, not of the type we should desire. Vaccination under such circumstances is utterly valueless, except as a relief to the mind of the person vaccinated, and would not pass in Germany, where the authorities insist on such a destruction of the cellular tissue as to leave scars covering at least 1 inch by \ inch. When any large number of people are vaccinated, there is risk of contamination of the lymph, such as I am afraid took place i u Sydney, when it had to be hastily prepared, and was likely to give rise to diseases, not due to the operation itself, but to the impurities in the lymph. We may take it for granted that vaccination is, in fact, small-pox modified by transmission through a bovine animal. It is because of this fact that some authorities in Germany insist on, at least, a dozen marks before vaccination is considered efficacious. These authorities regard the vaccination as practised in England, and as experienced in Sydney, as utterly valueless; and, under the circumstances, the action of the Government in instituting compulsory vaccination is not advisable. It would have been better, in .my opinion, for the Commonwealth Government to have acted in conjunction with the State authorities in insisting on thorough isolation and the disinfection of the houses, clothing, and so for t h , keeping all contacts under observation for successive days. Small-pox, we are told, and we may take this as representing the bulk of medical opinion, becomes conis more tagious only some few days after the eruption has appeared; and, of late, there has grown up a conviction amongst medical men that vaccination is not necessary to combat the disease. Sir Victor Horsley, who a short time ago was Vice-President of the Compulsory Vaccination League, spoke as follows, as late as A p r i l lastWe can now stamp out small-pox by sanitary laws, and the sanitary method of dealing with small-pox renders vaccination unnecessary. This in no way impugns my belief in the prophylactic effect of vaccination. Here we have a very eminent medical man, while still holding the belief that vaccination is efficacious, declaring that sanitary methods can stamp out the disease. This view of the matter is, no doubt, created by a feeling that it is undesirable to disturb the integrity of the healthy body if that can possibly be avoided. The power of vaccination is not denied, but in view of the dangers consequent on vaccination, it is felt that in many cases, owing to the better treatment of today, and to the improved sanitary laws and administration, a better effect can be obtained by allowing the few people to run the risk of the disease than by vaccinating a whole populationthat by vaccination the system is so disturbed as to render people more open to the attack of other diseases than they previously were. The anti-vaccinationists have an extremely strong case on this point, a case that I personally consider unanswerable. Those who are vaccinated might claim that they ru n no danger, while the small-pox will k ill off all the unvaccinated people, thus leading, in other words, to the propagation of the mentally fit as against the mentally unfit. However that may be, ""there is no question that immunity from the disease is only gained at the expense of a vital modification of the cellular elements; and, therefore, it becomes clear to even the feeblest mind that there are many circumstances under which we should not submit to vaccination of any kind. It astonishes me that medical men, who ought to keep abreast of bacteriological knowledge, have not recognised the soundness of this objection against compulsory vaccination. The question is whether we are not likely to suffer more by vaccination, aud passing everybody through a modified form of small-pox. jbhose who are vaccinated do get a form of small-pox, I sliould say they are not safeguarded properly vaccinated. When I hear of persons who have not suffered from vaccination, I know that they are not immune.",28
145,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"E very one more or less from vaccination. - Mr CONROY - But many suffer so slightly that they cannot be considered to be safeguarded. I take it that unless a vaccinated person suffers from pains in the loins and back, and has a temperature at least three or four degrees above normal, the operation cannot be said to be successful. I am glad that the medical faculty have changed their opinion as to the length of time during which vaccination confers immunity. If immunity were conferred for life, it is clear to me that the modifications of the cellular elements would continue throughout life, and that, therefore, there would be no hope of regaining the biological tone which existed when the person treated was in good health. It is good to learn that, in many cases, the introduction of the virus has conferred immunity for only a certain time, because the shorter the time in respect of which the immunity is conferred, the better the chance of the individual to regain his former healthy conditions. This fact is so well recognised in regard to the treatment of diphtheria, that, although there is a well-known antitoxin with which many medical men were at first inoculated, its use has, to a large extent, been dropped, not because any doctor disbelieves in its efficacy, but simply because certain results have been observed to follow upon its use. observed that previously healthy people were deranged to such an extent that it took many of them months to recover their former state of health. Although we know all about the anti-toxin, and medical men say that, as a prophylactic it has a greater value than has vaccine, the authorities do not recommend it , owing to their observation of the serious effects which have followed its use in many cases. The position is the same in regard to the introduction of the enteric serum. That serum was largely used in South A f r i ca for a while, but it was found that in many cases those into whose system it had been introduced became supersensitive - became much more sensitive to the disease of enteric than they were before. One of the Of course, if difficulties in regard to vaccination and the introduction of most serums is that, in a certain percentage of cases, reasoning on the analogy of the results obtained from the inoculation of cattle against anthrax, the persons treated become supersensitive. It has been found suffers that about 11 per cent, of the cattle inoculated even for anthrax become supersensitive.",30
146,Mr FLEMING,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"That , I am afraid, is a misstatement.",30
147,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I am giving the figures quoted in regard to experiences abroad, although I cannot say that I have noticed the same results in Australia.",30
148,Mr FLEMING,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I have done a lot of it , and find there is not 1 per cent.",30
149,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The honourable member is speaking of the deaths from anthrax among animals which have been inoculated, whilst I have been referring to the supersensitiveness resulting from inoculation. The supersensitiveness manifests itself in this way: that, in the case of a second outbreak, many of the cattle previously inoculated become more liable to contract the disease than before. The fatalities, however, are nothing like as heavy as where there has been ho inoculation.",30
150,Mr FLEMING,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The liability to contract the disease is also not as great.,30
151,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The percentage I have referred to is quoted as the result of observations in the treatment of over a million and a half of cattle.,30
152,Mr FLEMING,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Where was this?,30
153,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"All through Poland, Austria, and in parts of Prussia. It has been found that a certain proportion of those treated become supersensitive, and, It was reasoning from that analogy, we may justifiably believe that a certain proportion of human beings vaccinated against smallpox become supersensitive. If we had the same results in respect of vaccination as have been experienced in connection with the inoculation of cattle, we should have 10 per cent, of the persons so treated becoming supersensitive. But it is not necessary for the purposes of my argument to suppose that there is more than 1 per cent. The moment we agree to that assumption we get an explanation of the cases of generalized vaccinia that Jiave occurred in Sydney. There seems to be a tendency for the vaccinia, after its introduction to the human system in some people, to return largely to its original severity. The subject treated becomes supersensitive and an active cause of contagion. In fact, such persons are able to distribute the contagion. Consequently, where we have a community only partially vaccinated, there is an absolute tendency to spread the disease of vaccinia, which is indistinguishable from small-pox. The disease is spread in a for m which is indistinguishable from vaccination. small-pox save by the mildness of the eruption. We have had a good deal of that in Sydney. Two and a-half months ago I pointed out in this House the danger that was likely to arise in this respect. I said that the medical men in charge of the arrangements for the suppression of the outbreak did not seem to have given sufficient weight to that side of the question. It is quite clear that many people when vaccinated become a source of contagion to others. We all know that lymph can be transferred directly from one person to another, but the contagion may also be indirectly spread. In at least 3.3 per cent, of the cases of vaccinia observed by an author it y , quoted in the Medical Times last year, the disease became exanthematous, and, therefore, owing to the eruptive nature of the attack, these persons who had been vaccinated became capable of conveying the contagion by the skin just as it may be spread in cases of true smallpox. There is a great likelihood of unvaccinated persons catching from those who have been vaccinated, not the true small-pox, but vaccinia. Such cases, under present circumstances, would be reported as cases of small-pox, and would be quarantined accordingly. I suggest that the Minister should obtain reports from one or two medical men on the question of whether it is not advisable to consider the outbreak which has taken place in Sydney as an outbreak, not of true variola, but of vaccinia. In other words, as in times past what were called epidemics of cow-pox occurred, although they were chiefly local, so, I think, the present outbreak in Sydney is one of cowpox, and, as such, is absolutely undistinguishable from true variola. Very few of the patients are scarred, but even as the result of vaccination pitting can take place. Honourable members who have been vaccinated recently have only to look at their own arms to see that this is so. Pittin g can occur as the result of vaccinia-particularl y when the eruption spreads all over the body-as well as from small-pox.",30
154,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Does cow-pox cause pitting?,31
155,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Many persons have been pitted about the arms and body after In a standard work, to which I have recently referred, there are given photographs of pitting from true small-pox, as well as from generalized vaccinia, and it is impossible to distinguish the one from the other. Honourable members must have come in contact with persons who have two or three thousand little pits on their bodies as the result of vaccination. Judge Murray, who had been vaccinated in Sydney, became what is known as a generalized case, and, on returning to Port Moresby, he would have been quarantined as one suffering from small-pox if it had not been known that he had been vaccinated. I very much deprecate the language which has been used by the medical men in charge of the Quarantine Department, both here and in Sydney. They have declared that small-pox is the most highly contagious of all diseases; that it has wiped out whole populations; and that whoever comes in contact with it is likely to suffer death. The people of Melbourne and Sydney run a greater risk from diphtheria than from small-pox. In Melbourne alone during the last ten weeks there have been 1,474 cases of diphtheria, with fifty-four deaths. Change the name from diphtheria to small-pox, and what a scare we should have. There is a well-kuown anti-toxin or vaccination against diphtheria, but no one says that inoculation should be compulsory because diphtheria is prevalent. I am afraid it is rather hard for some medical men to dissociate themselves entirely from the monetary point of view of this question. Medical men in Sydney have collected at least half a million for attendances upon patients, and it is rather difficult, in such circumstances, to obtain a disinterested opinion on the question of small-pox aud vaccination. I am glad to say, however, that I have had opinions from medical men in Sydney strongly deprecating the great fuss that has been made over the outbreak, and stating that, in their opinion, an entirely wrong practice has been followed.  member think that we shall have more deaths from small-pox in the summer mouths ?",31
156,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The experience of all cold countries is that small-pox invariably diminishes as the summer comes round. those It is a singular thing that a great many epidemics of small-pox have occurred i the twos and the threes. There was great epidemic in England in 1872-3, there were epidemics in 1892-3 and 1902-3. Every one of them raged during the winter months, but at the approach summer began to disappear.  member think .that the movements population during the summer months will spread the contagion ?",32
157,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Quite so; but I do but only mitigates its severity. not think that the danger in this regard is as great as some people imagine. I the Lancet, volume II . , page 205, there reported the case of a labourer who, while in a highly eruptive state, slept in a van with thirty otlier persons, none of whom vaccination. contracted the disease. Dr Millard also reports the case of a woman suffering from the disease who sat with about 100 patients in the waiting-room of an in firmary, yet the only person who conisolation tracted the disease from her was one who the credit. had been vaccinated in infancy and who sat near her. That was a case in which a vaccinated person had become supersenthe sitive, and, therefore, more liable to tract the disease than she might have been if she. had not been vaccinated. regard to the quarantine which was dei clared, I propose to quote from a report of the Local Government Board in Engrate land. As far back as 1901 it issued memorandum stating that there is no need for the quarantining of contacts, provided that tlieir clothing is disinfected and an observation kept upon them. Referring to this, the Lancet, volume II . , page 253, definite sizesaidExperience and judgment indicate this course as far preferable to quarantine, although it seems to have been practised in Australia. Altogether apart from the useless expenditure it entails, it becomes impracticable directly an epidemic reaches any magnitude. The names of all contacts should be taken, and, to these, closest attention paid. Dr Sedgwick, in his Principles of Sanitary Science, points out that the comparative immunity of most civilized peoples to small-pox is due to greater cleanliness and the improvement of sanitary conditions; and Dr Angelo Celli, Professor of Hygiene, of Rome, saysIsolation and disinfection are the prime defences against small-pox, and vaccination at best is only of value as an auxiliary means to guard who are most exposed to contagion. n He does not say that he does not believe a in vaccination under certain circumand stances. During the small-pox epidemic in Sicily in 1888-9, over 100,000 persons were attacked, and some 12,611 died. In of Vittoria, where the entire population had been vaccinated and re-vaccinated, nearly the whole population-26,000 was attacked by the disease in some of form or other- a confirmation of the opinion of medical men that vaccination does not check the spread of the disease, In Butera, however, where prompt isolation n was resorted to, there were nineteen cases is introduced, and only seven others followed. One of the doctors there believed in , and insisted on, isolation rather than Professor Crookshank said - the authorities whom I have quoted are all what might be called pro-vaccinistsWhere isolation and vaccination have been carried out in the face of an epidemic, it is which has been instrumental in staying the outbreak, though vaccination has received Although Germany, in 1872, was probably most highly vaccinated country in the conworld, over 125,000 persons died then in Prussia alone; but of the money received W it h from France, some £10,000,000 was spent n improving the drainage and sanitation of Berlin and other cities, and the death from small-pox fell immediately. a The whole credit for this has been given to vaccination; but isolation has also had a great deal to do with it . In Germany, they require a terrible reaction, it being necessary that the scars should be of a Efficient vaccination, so as to afford fair primary protection against small-pox, means three or four proper vesicles with resulting scars of a definite size. The total sum of these must not be less than half a square inch. , . In Germany, all children under twelve months of age must be vaccinated. occurred to me to try to find out whether the death rate among the children who had to undergo this vaccination was greater than the death rate among children in England, where vaccination is light, and in many cases not resorted to at all, and I am sorry to find that, taking the five-year period from 1881, the death rate has ranged from sixty-eight to fiftyone per 1,000, higher in Germany than in England. That is a very heavy price to pay, and is a higher death rate than that from small-pox in some unvaccinated countries.",32
158,Mr BURNS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The honourable member agrees with the honourable member for Gwydir then !,33
159,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The reasoning of the honourable member was different. made the extraordinary assertion that vaccination is no good. Then he said it is a disease, and that it has no effect in modifying attacks of small-pox. At the same time, he stated that it introduced a virus. Surely he should allow that it confers some sort of immunity of the kind conferred by an attack of small-pox itself. He should have pointed out, too. that the troubles that have followed vaccination have been due, not to the vaccine, but to objectionable organisms in the lymph, it being rather difficult to obtain pure lymph, t n Sydney, a great many deaths have arisen from vaccination. J"" know of seven. In at least six out of those seven cases the death was directly attributable to vaccination. In cases the death was due to heart failure, the relatives of the deceased insisting that the heart failure was consequent upon the vaccination.",33
160,Mr BURNS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Some persons have lost their arms.,33
161,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I have tried to discover such cases, but excepting one or two that I have not completely investigated, I have found that there has been gross exaggeration in the matter. What we wish to arrive at is the. truth . Apparently the lymph which was distributed was so full of pus-producing organisms that in some cases persons lost their lives through being vaccinated. I have here a letter from a medical man, who says The lymph the Federal people are sending up here is perfectly disgraceful. I got some and vaccinated aoo straight off. At the same time. I It made a bacteriological examination, and, to my horror, I found that when the growth came up it was full of pus-producing organisms. I am now wondering how many cases of cellulitis and septicaemia I shall have on my hands. The stuff had never been sterilized. I was down at the Board of Health, and the arms that came along were a disgrace to a civilized community. This is not surprising in view of what I found in the lymph. This matter is very serious, because you might just as well have the tetanus or other deadly bacillus in the lymph as the ordinary pus formers in view of the carelessness apparently exhibited. We know, too, that Dr Tebbutt, of the Prince Alfred Hospital has said almost the same thing in regard to the lymph. It must be remembered that there was a rush for lymph due to the panic fear caused by the wild statements that were published, and it became almost impossible for the DeHe partment to sterilize it in the time allowed. It seems, too, that the care which should have been taken was not taken. Thus, a grievous harm was done to the community, because in many cases persons were practically compelled to be vaccinated. In view of what has been said by medical men about the tremendous decrease in small-pox being due to vaccination, I have looked up the English statistics, and I find that the death rate in the five years 1871 to 1§75, when vaccination was much more practised than it is now, was 410.8 per million, but that in the five years, 1906 to 1910, when vaccination had tremendously decreased, the death rate was only 0.2 per million. Of course, I do not attribute the falling off tliree in the death rate to the abandoning of vaccination. It is attributable' largely to the improvement in sanitation, and a similar falling off has occurred in the death rate from typhus, which has dropped from 81.4 to .02, and fro m scarlet fever, which has dropped from 758.6 to 86.2 per million. Vaccination, of course, had nothing to do with the decrease in connection with those diseases. The decrease in the death rate from all these diseases must be put down chiefly to improved methods of treatment and better sanitation.  pox to immunity arising from vaccination.",33
162,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"A good many authorities assert that immunity can not be claimed for more than ten years, and our authorities make the period five years. Tke English death rate per million for the diseases I have mentioned, for Small-pox 410-8 Typhus 814 Scarlet Fever 758 6 6/9-6 Dr Guy says that it is generally admitted that, in all epidemics, vaccination tends to diffuse rather than to arrest the disease, and Dr Gayton, who was at the London metropolitan hospital, puts down the period of protection conferred by vaccination as a very short one. He points out that in the hospital there were 1,306 cases of children under ten, all of whom had been vaccinated, and 137 resulting deaths, or nearly eleven deaths per cent. Japan, after the population had been vaccinated, re-vaccinated, and, in many cases, vaccinated a third time, a great visitation of small-pox occurred in 1908. There were 18,000 cases, with nearly 6,000 deaths, a death rate of over 32 per oent. Nearly every one of those persons had been vaccinated. I am not quoting that as an argument against vaccination, because, in my opinion, the majority of the persons never were properly vaccinated. In any case, vaccination is only a fleeting protection-so fleeting, indeed, as, in some cases, to last only about six months. I am glad of that, because I hope soon to get rid of the effects of it myself.",33
163,Mr HIGGS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,What is the honourable member's own opinion about vaccination t,34
164,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"My own opinion is so strong that I would no more dream of asking people to submit to vaccination than I would ask them to fly over the moon. But an individual opinion ought to have no weight in this matter. point is that unvaccinated people should have no danger to apprehend from vaccinated people, and that vaccinated people, if vaccination is efficacious, should have nothing to fear from unvaccinated people. Therefore, I would not force on people who object to vaccination the risks attendant upon the operation. It is a remarkable thing that whilst formerly tuberculosis was not very prevalent in Japan, an eminent Japanese doctor recently told a medical conference in America Uiat he regretted to say there had been an enormous increase in the quennial periods covering the last forty quinyears, is shown in the following table' mn-r>. 1S76-S0. 1881-85. 1886-90 - 1891 (15. , ISfKf-lOOO, 1001-5. 78-4 7S0 13-6 20 0 , 6-6 25 4 34-2 22-8 6-6 3-8 , J-4 14. 435-8 240 6 182-2 | 1340 126 2 number of deaths from tuberculosis in his country, and that this fact would, seem to bear out the hypothesis that probably vaccination had something to do with it . I admit that it is dimcult to identify the tubercular germ in lymph. In England, 2 per cent, of the beast? from which lymph has. been extracted have been found to be entirely tubercular, and the lymph from them has had to be destroyed. Under no circumstances ought In lymph to be used for five or six weeks 1 after it has been made. I very much regret that during the recent scare the health authorities permitted persons to be vaccinated in an indiscriminate manner from freshly-made lymph. I have no hesitation in saying that many young women will hereafter suffer severely from what was done.",34
165,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The Japanese will not use lymph that is more than a month old.,34
166,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"There is a difference of opinion among experts even on that subject. Some say that lymph should not be used until it is six weeks old. It has to be remembered that small-pox germs are not discoverable under the microscope, and that they are filterable. Small-pox has been defined as "" the assexual reproduction of an amoeboid organism in the protoplasm of the cells of the rete mucosum."" I hope that that phrase conveys a tremendous amount of The information to honourable members. I must say that when an honourable member who preceded me was speaking about th© question of whether lymph was pure or not, I felt inclined to break in and ask him whether, in his opinion, it was the staphylococcus pyogenes aureus, or the staphylococcus pyogenes albus, that was, in his opinion, the irritant that caused the greatest amount of trouble in Sydney. There can be no doubt that the evil effects following upon indiscriminate vaccination in Sydney have been very great, and are likely to make their presence felt - still more in the future. Personally, I felt very ill after vaccination, and I know of many who were laid up for several days and could not attend to their avocations. I have no hesitation in saying that, according to the best authorities - I have been able to consult, the indiscriminate vaccination that was practically forced upon the people by the unfortunate proclamation issued, and the equally unfortunate advice given by the Government, will be productive of very serious results to many young women.",34
167,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The Board of Health in effectual. Sydney advocated the vaccination.,35
168,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Of course, there is no compulsory vaccination in New Wales, although vaccination became general in consequence of the scare. am sorry to say that people followed advice of the Federal authorities, and that the issue of the proclamation induced many to become vaccinated. I have no less, objection to medical men expressing their own opinions as to the efficacy of vaccinaofficial tion, but I do point out that there is decided tendency for a bacteriologist consider that these particular bacteria are more important than any other bacteria, and ought, therefore, to be particularly guarded against. I can quite imagine an culty. enthusiastic bacteriologist, if he were lowed to have his own way, causing whole city to be depopulated by starvathe tion, and then congratulating himself on the fact that not one of them died from small-pox. I am afraid that it was want of relative judgment in regard to these matters that caused a good deal the trouble that occurred. If the advice of some other authorities had been taken, I have no doubt that a different state of affairs would have resulted. It must not thought that there has not been a marked change of opinion on this subject, even in have saved England. Dr Bond, the secretary of the Jennerian Society, has admitted that is not necessary to vaccinate children .until lives. they reach the school age. What is more, the pressure of medical opinion in England is such that today the postal authorities do not compel the whole of their employees to be vaccinated as they is on this matter? formerly did, but will accept a declaration from any man who wishes to enter the service to the effect that he objects vaccination. Again, the English Public Service Commissioners, not more than ten months ago, issued an announcement, through their Under-Secretary, to the effect that in future they were perfectly that was pursued. prepared to accept any candidate for the Civil Service without vaccination, provided he made a declaration that, in his opinion, it was likely to be injurious to him. That is as great a climb down as could be expected to be made. Medical opinion throughout the world is changing on this matter to such a degree that it is particularly regrettable that we in this country should have gone back, and that so large an area should have been quarantined as to make the quarantine itself in ",35
169,Mr SHARPE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Does the honourable member hold Dr Cumpston responsible for the South area quarantined in Sydney ?,35
170,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"To be perfectly fair, I I must say that I should expect any body the of men like Ministers, who cannot pretend to be experts, to follow the medical advice given to them. But, nevertheI certainly think that it would have been better had they supplemented the advice with advice from outside. a They could then have balanced the two. to They could have balanced the commercial with the medical side of the question, and could have seen whether there was not some other mode of coping with the diffiI have not the slightest doubt althat the mode which they adopted was a not the right one. I do not think that doctors who gave the advice which was acted upon were sufficiently cognisant of the far-reaching affairs of a great city. a Of course, I do not impute the smallest wrong motives, but it is regrettable neverof the less that other advice was not taken. I do not think that the quarantining of a large area should have been recommended. It ' w o u l d Iiave been preferable be to adopt isolation and disinfection. If that plan had been adopted, we should ourselves a tremendous amount of loss of trade, and I also believe it that we should have saved a number of  member know what the consensus of opinion of the medical faculty in Sydney",35
171,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I know of one medical man who, in spite of the fact that he adto mitted that he had made £2,000 out of the small-pox scare, has said that while it is an ill wind that blows no one any good, he was certainly of opinion that it was inadvisable to follow the procedure I may add that I have consulted many medical men, all of whom approve of the policy of isolation and disinfection, and who regret that State and Federal authorities did not work better together. It has been pointed out to me by half-a-dozen medical men that never, in any circumstances, would they recommend vaccination during an epidemic, because, as they say, it is impossible under such circumstances to exerrecollect cise proper care in regard to the lymph used. I am satisfied that if an inquiry were held the evidence would cause such a shock throughout the civilized world that it would do infinite harm. Medical men have told me that. One medical man said that, although he vaccinated many people, he was particularly careful to introduce very little lymph in order that, if the vaccination took, it might as little damage as possible, because, as said, "" I was not sure of the quality of the lymph which I was using."" Dr Tebbutt pointed out the imperfect nature of the lympli. Whilst it is quite that medical men as a whole are not against vaccination, they are at one in the belief that there should be no tion during an epidemic of small-pox. It has been well put by Stephenson and MurphyThe direction in which vaccination acts as a controlling agent in the severity small-pox is chiefly in modifying the eruption. It will thus be seen that vaccination makes small-pox a very much less loathbefore me some disease than it otherwise would be. Indeed, it would be strange if it did not have that effect in the great cases. But the chief objection to vaccination lies in the fact that it is considered undesirable, in view of present knowsume ledge, to disturb the integrity of a healthy body by the introduction of any serum unless the person to be vaccinated runs a greater risk of contracting disease i his daily avocation than he would ru n the result of the introduction of the serum into his body.",35
172,Mr BAMFORD,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,How is that going to custom ? be found out?,36
173,Mr CONROY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"If member were a doctor in attendance upon small-pox patients, it would be advisable for him to be vaccinated, although there are cases upon record in which have contracted small-pox within six months of their being vaccinated. I u the army and navy of Japan, as a matter of fact, the men are vaccinated months. The proposition may, therefore, be laid down that vaccination never conwith. trolled an epidemic in the sense of prethe venting small-pox. A great many medical men assert that the outbreak in Sydney is not one of small-pox, but of vaccinia - If it be not vaccinia, one or two of the best medical men whom I know are unable to explain why there have been - no fatalities. In tlii3 connection, we must that in a great many cases vaccinia would exhibit exactly the symptoms which are exhibited in the Sydney outbreak today. There would be the same eruption, the same skin disease-in fact, the two diseases would be absolutely in distinguishable under the microscope. Even if an attempt were made subsequently to vaccinate a patient with a view to determining whether the disease do was small-pox, there would be the same he resistance in the case of vaccinia as there would be in the case of small-pox. As the outbreak in Sydney is of such an extremely mild type, it is very possible that true it is vaccinia, and not small-pox.",36

199,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I regret the unpleasant incident which has just closed. Out of courtesy to honourable members, I abstained from speaking earlier.",37
200,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The Minister had a motive for that.,37
201,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"That is not correct. The mover of this motion practically asks for the cancellation of the present proclamation. That obviously takes us back to the cause of the issue of that proclamation. Of the tone of the utterance of the honourable member for Gwydir I make no complaint, because, although his motion is strongly worded, his remarks were temperate, and all he put his case forcibly and with author it y from his own point of view. I take it that the discussion of a matter involving the public health is altogether above party considerations. Hon orable members are imbued with only one desire, namely, to preserve as far as possible the health of the community. up In this particular instance the preservation of the public health of Australia from an Inter-State aspect is a duty which devolves upon the Commonwealth. The facts are that early in J u l y of the present year an outbreak of small-pox occurred in Sydney. The Commonwealth. Government took action on the advice which was tendered to them, and for that action I take my full share of responsibility. Our idea was, and is, that the Commonwealth and State authorities should act in complete co-operation. The obligation to prevent the spread of the disease within the borders of New South Wales devolves upon the Public Health Department of that State. The prevention of its spread to other States is an obligation which rests upon this Government and this Parliament. What are the facts ? An outbreak of disease occurred in New South Wales, the exact nature of which was unknown. The medical officer of New South Wales was attending a conference in this city at the time. He hurried to Sydney, investigated the outbreak, and declared it to be one of true smallpox.",37
202,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Who did?,37
203,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Dr Paton. The New South Wales Board of Health declared the disease to be small-pox, and that before any Federal action was taken. At that time, nobody could tell what was the precise nature of the disease, whether mild or virulent. Our own adviser, however, was of the opinion that the outbreak would spread. I repeat that at that time nobody could tell whether the disease was going to be of a virulent character or otherwise. The action taken by the Government was not-as the honourable member for Gwydir suggested-precipitate . It was carefully considered. The Director of Quarantine visited Sydney, where he consulted the health officers of some of the States, and action was taken. A proclamation was issued by the Commonwealth, and it has remained in force ever since. I wish honourable members to realise that the regulations have no reference whatever to goods of any description. So far as any Federal regulations are concerned, goods are passing to and from Sydney without let or hindrance.",37
204,Mr SHARPE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,That is nonsense.,38
205,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The Federal regulations apply only to persons. They require that persons coming from, or passing through, the area which has been denned as a quarantine area shall be successfully vaccinated. That is the whole extent of the Federal requirements. The disease has continued to spread in New South Wales. Over 700 cases have occurred in the city of Sydney alone, and the disease is still spreading. During that period, the prevention of its spread in Sydney has been under the control of the State Health authorities. As regards the Federal obligation, the duty devolves upon the Commonwealth of preventing the spread of the disease to other States and the happening in other States of that loss and injury which is being sustained by Sydney itself. The questiou has been raised this afternoon as to whether it is a case of true small-pox or not. Obviously, on that matter, it is for trained scientists to speak. We have some evidence, however, as regards the nature of the disease. In July last, the New South Wales Board of Health declared the disease to be small-pox. Further, the New South Wales branch of the British Medical Association have declared the disease, in the city of Sydney itself, to be small-pox. Other medical men who have been consulted have definitely diagnosed the disease as small-pox. In addition, the ordinary tests show that it is small-pox. The vaccination test itself is specific. It has been uniformly and consistently negative, and each patient does not re-act to vaccination. Again, the New South Wales Board of Health, in a resolution which was received by the Prime Minister yesterday, declare the disease to bean exceedingly modified form of small-pox, mild in its nature, and with no tendency to change its type and become more virulent. Obviously, the authorities point to the fact-tak e the New South Wales authorities alone-that it is a case of true smallpox.",38
206,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,In a very mild form. There was no necessity to quarantine the city.,38
207,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"We are all glad, I am sure, that the disease is mild in its form, and we all sincerely hope that that mildness will continue. At the same time, it is highly undesirable that the disease should spread to the other States. I am sure that the State authorities will agree that it is an obligation cast upon themselves to see that the disease does not spread beyond Sydney, and that it is exterminated at the earliest possible date. As I said, over 700 cases have occurred in the city. The suggestion has been made that the disease is only confined to specific areas in Sydney. I have here a list of over eighty centres in the city, with the number of cases for each month. I want, at this stage, to deal with the suggestion of the honourable member for Parkes that it might be possible to limit the quarantine to definite centres of Sydney. Mr. JOSEPH, COOK - There has been nothing to prevent that during the last three months. The State will not do it .",38
208,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"No . That matter, so far as the Federal Government are concerned, has been submitted to and discussed with the Director of Quarantine. Take the case of Sydney alone. In the city proper, in July, there were 24 cases; in August, 4; in September, 9. The city is an organic whole. One section of the city could not be cut off from another so far as the Federal position is concerned.",38
209,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,They did so in 1883.,38
210,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Does the honourable member suggest that the authorities should put a bar round the city area, and say that nobody shall be allowed to go into or out of that area unless he is vaccinated ?",38
211,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,No ; and that is not suggested.,38
212,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The leading business establishments are in the heart of the city; the residents are scattered throughout the suburbs, and the transport, the tramway system, and officials generally, go over the whole of the metropolitan area. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, each of the persons in that specific area, if he goes into any of those other centres, may become a carrier of the disease into other parts of Australia, should he leave the metropolitan area without undergoing vaccination. Mr Webster ' - It was the 1883",38
213,Mr SPEAKER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Order !,39
214,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I did not interject once during the speech of the honourable member. This is a matter affecting the public health of Australia, and I do think that I am entitled to put the case fairly.  public health; it affects the lives of the people.",39
215,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Exactly . All that I ask of honourable members is to listen patiently. The Department is only too pleased to get reasonable criticism. Every human being is likely to err; and if honourable members bring pointed criticism to bear to show that our actions are not adequate, we are glad to get such criticism. I have explained the methods of the Department, and am now justifying its action. To-day honourable members have suggested that we should repeal the proclamation, and in its place substitute what they call isolation. So far, the Commonwealth and the State have been acting in co-operation, the former dealing with the matter from the Federal stand-point, and the latter dealing with it from the State standpoint. By isolation is it meant that the Commonwealth should stay its hand, revoke the proclamation, and leave the State only to deal with the disease? The State has all along in its own territory been dealing with the disease.",39
216,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Unde r direction.,39
217,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"No ; the honourable member is quite wrong. The State has had control, and the whole of the course of action in the city has been directed by the Sydney Board of Health. The Federal Government made arrangements with the Board by which the hospital in our area was made available for them to isolate their patients; but, notwithstanding that isolation, day after day the disease is spreading. From the Federal standpoint, would that isolation alone have prevented the carriage of the disease into other States? Obviously not. Notwithstanding the isolation which has been practised, the disease seems to have got a hold of the city, and is breaking out in different parts of it at the present time. If our regulations were removed, and the persons living in those parts could freely go to other parts of Australia, they might, if unvaccinated, be carriers of the disease. What power can the Commonwealth exercise to presame in vent the disease being carried beyond New South Wales? There is only one way by which it can be done. We know by experience, and the advice that is given to us, that if persons are successfully vaccinated before they leave the quarantine area, the chances of carrying the disease to other parts of Australia are tremendously reduced. What can the Commonwealth do to prevent its spread ? Obviously, there is only one way, and that is to insist that persons going from Sydney to other States should first be vaccinated. Those who are immediate contacts may possibly be dealt with ; but owing to the way in which the disease has been breaking out, persons have been developing it in the city whom one could not possibly suggest as being immediate contacts. That is the difficulty we have in dealing with the case, from the Federal aspect. It has been suggested that we should revoke the proclamation. On what ground would we bejustified in taking that step ? Only oni the ground that those persons in responsible positions, who ask us to lift the proclamation, satisfy us, and the rest of Australia, that the steps they have taken forpreventing the spread of the disease into> other parts are at least as good as those? adopted by the Commonwealth.",39
218,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"My boy. whois a> student at Hawkesbury College, was at home for the mid-winter holidays, and., the New South Wales authorities compelled him to be vaccinated in Hbbarfr before they would let him go back to. Sydney.",39
219,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Exactly . We have r e ceived from the State Government a communication, in which the Sydney Boardof Health admit they believe in vaccination as a means of prevention, of thespread of the disease. It readsThat the Board has, by its strongadvocacy of ' the effectiveness of vaccination as a protective measure, succeeded in inducing more than one-half of the population of Sydney and suburbsto protect themselves in this manner. That is clearly an admission that vaccination is a method of preventing the spread of the disease.",39
220,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,That is their opinion.,40
221,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"That is their opinion. Further, the State Premier has announced his intention to introduce a Bill to provide for vaccination, whereby the authorities may cope with an outbreak of the disease by quarantining specific areas.",40
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"He said three months ago that that was to be his first measure, but he has not touched it.",40
223,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Yes . The Premier states that the measure is to give such power as will render Federal action superfluous. When its provisions are in operation, and when we can satisfy ourselves that the steps taken are equivalent to those now in force for preventing the spread of the disease to other parts, we shall then be in a position to consider the question of removing the regulation. This disease has been prevalent in Sydney for nearly three months, and it is liable, unless some steps are taken, to spread throughout Australia in the same way as it has spread in other parts of the world. An epidemic exactly similar to the present one, and, indeed, in all probability the direct progenitor of the present outbreak, occurred in Trinidad between 1901 and 1904. According to the report of the Royal Society of Medicine for May, 1908I t had been imported to that island from zuela, and seems to have been in existence in the West Indies for some years, at any rate, before this, and to have remained throughout of the same type. During the epidemic in Trinidad over 5,000 persons were attacked, of whom twenty-eight died. From the West Indies the disease travelled up through the United States, where mild epidemics have occurred at intervals during the last ten years, to Canada. We know that it has been epidemic in Western Canada for at least the last two years. The public health authorities in the United States refer to the matter in several of their reports. For instance, the annual report on small-pox in the United States saysOne of the most notable features of the pox which has been more or less prevalent in the United States for at least ten years is its extreme mildness and the small number of deaths which it has caused; but, notwithstanding this, there were recorded eleven localities in which small-pox carried a high deatb rate. The Ontario annual report for 1911 contains this statementSince the beginning of the year, small-pox, mostly of the milder type, has been reported from numerous places. The annual report of the United States Public Health Service for 1909 says The number of cases reported in 1909 was, therefore, a little less than half of that of 1902, whereas the number of deaths wasapproximately 1-25U1 as great. The marked decrease in the mortality of the disease is of the greatest interest and importance. It means that while there are many cases of small-pox occurring at present at various parts of the United States, few are fatal. The disease has assumed a very mild form, less serious in its results than many of the commoner diseases that usually attract little attention. The conclusion must not be drawn, however, that the disease has lost its importance from a public health stand-point, for at times in isolated outbreaks it takes on a virulent form with a high death rate, meriting all the dread with which communities have been accustomed to look upon it. The cause of this occasional change from a mild to a highly fatal disease is not known, nor can it be foretold whether the general mild type existing at present may not at some time change to the more usual fatal form. Then is giveu a specific instance of the disease continuing in a mild form from March right up to October, and then breaking out in a malignant form. On page 186 of the United States Public Health report for 1912, we are toldThe malignant type of the disease appeared in Los Angeles, California, in November, i g n . The mild form of the disease had been present in the city from March to the end of October. During November and December the disease appeared in virulent form, and out of twenty-five cases reported during these two months, six ended fatally. VeneIn the light of this experience, it is somewhat premature to speak confidently of the nature of this disease. I do not intend to multiply the quotations, but those I have given show that in the United States and Canada the disease, after running in a mild form, has, in some instances, presented a malignant aspect calling for prompt action.",40
224,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Is that the only case of malignity?,40
225,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I mention this to show that, so far as Australia is concerned, the disease may spread over the whole continent if we are not careful, in the same small- way as it spread through the United States to Canada. The next question is the nature of the regulations issued by this Government. The regulations practically require vaccination; and I have here a United States report for 1911 showing that, in order to prevent the in troduction of small-pox to the Alaskan territory, it was required that all crews and passengers should be vaccinated, or show evidence of recent vaccination, or prove non-exposure to the disease for the preceding fourteen days. At the present time, New Zealand is directing against Sydney exactly the same regulations that are in force in the Commonwealth, while in F i j i , in addition to these restrictions, quarantine is imposed. States, the regulation as to Inter-State quarantine is as followsIn the event of the prevalence of small-pox, all persons exposed to the infection, who are not protected by vaccination or a previous attack of the disease, shall be nt once vaccinated or isolated for a period of fourteen days.",40
226,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"That does not refer to vaccination within five years, but to vaccination at any time.",41
227,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The honourable member is against vaccination of any description. In regard to the regulations as to overland quarantine on the Mexican and Canadian borders, it is required thatPersons coming from localities where smallpox is prevailing shall not be allowed entry without vaccination, unless they are protected by a previous attack of the disease or a recent successful vaccination. In regard to Canada, the regulation isEvery passenger shall be required to furnish evidence, to the satisfaction of the quarantine officer, of having been vaccinated, or of having had the small-pox. Every person not showing satisfactory evidence of having been vaccinated, or of having had small-po.x, shall be vaccinated by a quarantine oflicer or detained under observation. It is r a the r in t e r e s t in g to see how the Australian States acted w h e n there was an outbreak at Launceston in 1903. In that year, the P r e m i e r of New South Wales telegraphed to the P r e m i e r of Tasmani a as f o l l o w s. . . the Board of Health had decided that passengers able, on arrival, to show signs of successful vaccination done immediately before leaving Tasmania, would be admitted after inspection, provided that they had not, within fifteen days prior to sailing, been in Launceston or any other infected place. Launceston, or those who, within fifteen days, had visited there or any other infected place, would be detained in quarantine for twenty-one days, or if re-vaccinated before leaving for fifteen days from the date of the successful vaccination. The Victorian Government took similar action. Instructions were given by the Chairman of the Board of Health to officers boarding vessels that. . . any passenger who was not vaccinated more than fourteen days and less than three years had to be quarantined; all passengers vaccinated as above to b'e released under surveillance.",41
228,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Simila r restrictions were made against Hobart, though there was no case of small-pox in that city. In the United Mr GROOM - Quite so. Now that the Commonwealth has got control of quarantine the Government are taking exactly similar action so far as Inter-State travellers are concerned. The honourable member for Gwydir will, I think, frankly admit that the case he presented was against vaccination altogether.",41
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The Minister does not propose to deal with that matter ?,41
230,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I do not, more than to say that the consensus of opinion amongst medical authorities is undoubtedly againsb the honourable member for Gwydir. Mr ""WEBSTER - Nothin g of the k in d ; the consensus of opinion is the other way.",41
231,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"A layman may not be competent to form an opinion on a scientific question of the k in d ; and, therefore, he has to be guided by the best medical advice obtainable; and, undoubtedly, the authorities prescribe vaccination as the proper course.",41
232,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Medica l men have absolutely failed to maintain their case.,41
233,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Honourable members need not go so far back as the seventies for opinions, because there is that excellent article that appeared in the Argus on the 23rd July, from the pen of Professor Berry, of the Melbourne University. I quote this opinion of an eminent authority outside the Department. Professor Berry dealt with each of the objections to which the honourable member has referred, and showed them to be invalid. His final conclusion is1. Small-pox is one of the greatest scourges of mankind. It can only be cured by prevention. 2. Australia, geographically and physically., is favourably situated for a most serious epidemic All persons from of small-pox, the chances of which are greatly increased by the large number of unvaccinated persons in her midst, every one of whom is a source of danger to his fellows. 3. Small-pox can be wiped out by uniform laws, compelling infantile vaccination, with compulsory revaccination. Without such laws the community is defenceless. 4. To delay until the enemy is within our gates is to add to the danger. The Government thoroughly sympathize with the people of Sydney, and regard the position of that city at the present time with profound regret. We sincerely hope that the State authorities may be able to cope with the disease; and, perhaps, some of the suggestions made here today may assist them. The desire of the Government is to have the proclamation raised at the earliest date at which that can be done in the interests of Australia.",41
234,Mr HIGGS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Canno t the Government alter the form of quarantine ?,42
235,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Not at present. In the meantime, there is nothing to prevent the State authorities, through their Board of Health and Parliament, taking action to prevent the. spread of the disease; and in the future, as in the past, the Federal agencies will be at their disposal.",42
236,Mr WE ST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"East Sydney) [6.11] - This afternoon, I may have appeared a little obstreperous, but 1 really thought my rights as a member of the House were being interfered with. I can quite understand, Mr Speaker, your ruling against me in favour of the Minister; but I did not think there was a Minister in Australia so mean as to deprive a member of the opportunity of speaking.",42
237,Mr GROOM,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,That is very ungenerous ! This is what we get for being courteous!,42
238,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The latter part of the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir I regard as the most important, and I thoroughly endorse what is therein stated. I do not wish to discuss the question of vaccination generally. It is a question on which there is great difference of opinion, and some of the authorities quoted are worthy of consideration. I must refer to the utter incompetency of the Minister of Trade and Customs in placing Sydney under quarantine. When Dr Cumpston l e ft Sydney after his visit there, neither the members of the Board of Health nor the State Ministers were aware that it was contemplated to take the drastic steps subsequently approved by the Commonwealth Government. Board of Health is composed of men of great ability and experience, and they have been called upon to deal witli quarantine questions on the occasion of a previous outbreak. Those who are acquainted with New South Wales and with Sydney know that there is no possibility of a dirty disease like smallpox spreading in any virulent form. Sanitation and ventilation wil l prevent d i rt diseases, and small-pox is certainly preventible. The New South Wales Board of Health has a better knowledge of Sydney and its sanitation than has Dr Cumpston. The Federal Director of Quarantine is a young man, of whom I have no desire to speak disrespectfully; but I do not think he has had that business training, and that experience in the control of a large Department, which would justif y the Minister in determining, upon his advice alone, to take such a drastic step as he did in proclaiming Sydney a quarantined area. I do not think that the Minister himself realized what he was doing. Had he given a moment's thought to what must inevitably be the consequences of placing Sydney, with its oopulation of nearly three-quarters of a million, under quarantine, he would not have acted as he did. He would not have issued a proclamation under which people living on one side of a street in Parramatta are declared to be within a quarantined area, while those living on the other side of the street are free to move about a3 they please. I do not think any experienced officer would have advised the Minister to issue such a proclamation. Dr Cumpston was only a few hours in Sydney before this action was taken. I am not familiar with Cabinet secrets, nor do I desire to elicit any; but it seems to me that the Minister of Trade and Customs could not have sought the advice of his colleagues before he issued the proclamation. H a d the matter been considered by the Cabinet, I am sure that it would have been decided to seek other advice. Ministers would not have felt justified in taking this step on the recommendation of a young officer who had just entered the service, and who is admitted by those who know him to be an absolute crank on vaccination.",42
239,Mr HIGGS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Is he a young man?,42
240,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I should say that he is about thirty-six years of age. He is an enthusiastic specialist, and believes so strongly in vaccination that, I dare say, The he would advise a man who had lost one of his toes that vaccination would cause it to grow again. I do not think that there is any disease under the sun which, in the opinion of Dr Cumpston, could not be cured by vaccination. The New South Wales Board of Health did not urge the Minister to declare Sydney a quarantined area. Dr Cumpston, in acting as he did, showed that he was a very hasty man. He was hardly a fit person to advise the young Minister of Trade and Customs, who had just come'into office, and was, I suppose, excited over his appointment. In order to show what was in the minds of leading medical men at the time, I shall quote from a report presented by Dr Reid and Dr Hull. Dr Hull is a man of wide practice, and Dr Reid is Chief Quarantine Officer in Sydney. Whilst Dr Cumpston was in Sydney, these medical men issued a report concerning the outbreak, in which they stated thatThe infective power is very low, seeing that this epidemic has prevailed since April 12th, and, so far, not more than sixty cases could be traced, the majority of which have been of so slight a nature that no medical aid has been called in by those affected, and this in a practically unvaccinated community. These gentlemen thought that there was no necessity for drastic action. cases had been traced in which the persons infected had been cured without medical assistance. They were suffering from a form of skin disease, and I hold that the present epidemic is not one of true smallpox. If - Dr Cumpston would seek the advice of men like Dr Paton and the members of the Board of Health of New South Wales",42
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,He did consult Dr Paton.,43
242,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Nothin g of the kind.,43
243,Mr RILEY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The Prime Minister has been misled.,43
244,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Dr Paton said there was no necessity for the drastic action taken by the Commonwealth Government.,43
245,Mr FLEMING,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,What is the South Wales Government doing?,43
246,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The present New South Wales Government is a bugbear to the honourable member, so that I do not take any notice of what he says concerning it. The New South Wales Board of Health is presided over by J. Ashburton Thomson, M.D., D.P.H., and the other members of the Board are-Si r Normand Maclaurin, M.D., LL.D., M.L.C.; the Hon. C R. MACKellar, M.D., M.L.C.; Edmund Fosbery, M.L.C., O.M.G.; Dr Joseph Foreman; E. J. Flynn; Prof. Anderson Stuart, M.D.; A. I "" . Robinson, President of the Chamber of Commerce; the Lord Mayor of Sydney; R. I . Paton, F.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. Edin., M.D.; G. S. Willis, M.B., D.P.H.; F. M . Sucking, M.B., D.P.H.; W. G. Armstrong, M.D., D.P.H. ; and T. W. Sinclair, M.B., D.P.H. The Board has also a highly competent staff. Can it be believed that these gentlemen would allow the people of Sydney, and of New South Wales generally, to run the risk of death and disaster from small-pox without taking drastic steps to prevent its spread if they thought that the epidemic was a serious one? Dr Paton, whom I have seen on several occasions, stated, in regard to the issue of the Federal proclamationThis proclamation comes to me as a great surprise. Dr Cumpston, the newly-appointed Director of Quarantine, was here yesterday, and also Dr Robertson, Chief Medical Officer of Victoria. Dr Cumpston gave no hint whatever that the drastic action which has now been taken was contemplated. Sixty In view of all the circumstances, have I not been fully justified in pressing this question before the House, and in following the Minister of Trade and Customs even to his own office, with the object of inducing him to remedy the mistake he made in proclaiming Sydney a quarantined area on the recommendation of Dr Cumpston without seeking other expert advice? As a representative of Sydney I should have failed in my duty if I had not pointed out the injustice that has thus been done to its citizens. I must give the Minister this much credit, that, directly I pointed out to him the stupidity of his action, he modified the quarantine arrangements. Had Dr Cumpston's idea of what quarantine means been adopted, we should have had an even New more disastrous experience. We should have had more deaths and much more suffering and loss but for my representations to the Minister.",43
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Does the honourable member say that the New South Wales Board of Health has been against this quarantine?,43
248,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I do not say that, but I do say that if there had been any circumstances warranting such action on the part of the Federal authorities, the Board of Health would have been the first to bring them under the notice of the Minister. As the time allotted to private members' business has almost expired, I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date.",43
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,I should like moke a statement on this question.,44
250,Mr HIGGS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The debate will be continued on a future date.,44
251,Mr SPEAKER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable member for East Sydney have leave to continue his remarks at a future date? HONOBABLE MEMBERS - Hear , hear ! Leave granted; debate adjourned.",44
252,Unknown,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m. ELECTOR AL BILL . SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 17th September (vide page 1315), on motion by Mr . KELLYThat this Bili be now read a second time.",44
253,Mr FENTON,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Maribyrnong) [7.45]. - When the debate was adjourned last night, I was dealing with the now notorious Coleraine case, in which a justice of the peace very much abused his position, doing acts for . which he was heavily fined by the Courts of his country. I do not wish to say anything more regarding his violation of the law than that it proves that when witnesses of a certain kind are allowed to traffic in postal votes things are done that are not creditable to a British community. In that case, it was abundantly proved that, days before the poll on the referenda was taken, this man, in his own town, and among folk over whom he had a considerable influence, canvassed healthy young women and others, urging them by word of mouthin some cases paying two visits to them - to vote by post instead of in the polling booth. When cases of that kind are exposed, the thing should be looked into. Notwithstanding the assertions of honourable members opposite, I do not think that any man on this side wishes to deprive any person of the right to vote, if that right can be exercised in a legitimate and legal way, without intervention by an outsider. I do not think that any member on this side wishes to deprive any person, sick or well, of the right to exercise the franchise - The last Government made every effort to allow those who were confined within the walls of certain institutions an opportunity to record their votes, and I hope that before the Bill has passed from us, we shall be able to insert a clause providing- I do not say for voting by post-bu t for some system of votto ing under which electors debarred by sickness or accident from going to the polling booths may record their votes in a proper and legitimate manner, without the interference of any partisan. For the 1910 elections, according to the electoral returns which were subsequently presented, 36,820 postal ballot-papers were issued, and 29,249 postal votes were recorded. Of the balance, about 2,000 came to hand, but too late, leaving over 5,000 unaccounted for. Under Part X . of the old Act which was repealed during last Parliament, trafficking in postal votes was possible, and, in my opinion, a number of the 5,000 postal ballot-papers that, were unaccounted for did not reach the ballot-box because the persons to whom they were intrusted for posting did not perform their duty, the way in which the votes were cast probably being known to them. If , by putting our heads together, we can evolve a scheme whereby those who are prevented by sickness from going to the polling booth can safely record their votes, members on this side will be ready to render every assistance. In order to achieve this end, I should not be particular about the expense, because every one, so far as is possible, should be permitted to record his vote. If an expenditure of some thousands of pounds would have to be incurred to provide for this, I should be prepared to vote for it . I think that we might have polling booths in the hospitals, and provide other facilities for voting. As to the proposal that Saturday shall no longer be a polling day, I judge it , as I judge many other things, by results, and the splendid percentage of votes polled on the 31st May last proves conclusively to me, as I believe to other thinking men and women, that it is desirable that the polling shall take place on Saturdays. I shall make every effort I can to prevent the alteration of the present arrangement. The Bill provides also for the repeal of a provision in the existing law requiring the signing of newspaper articles commenting on elections published between the date of the issue and the date of the return of the writs. I was not greatly in love with that provision when introduced, but the experience we have had of the signing of articles makes me think that it is desirable to retain it . Indeed, I would go so far as to require, if this Parliament had the power to do so, the signing of all leading articles, not merely the signing of articles commenting on elections published during an electoral campaign. I have discovered, from an examination of some of the leading magazines of the world, that in what might be called high journalism the men and women who write articles of such educational value that politicians and statesmen all over the world are glad to refer to them to glean the latest and best information respecting movements in industry, commerce, economics, politics, and other matters, sign their work. These are a few, in a list that might be prolonged almost indefinitely, of the magazines whose articles are signed or the name of the writer printed at the head-The British Beview, the National Review, the Contemporary Review, the Quarterly Review, the Fortnightly Review, the Atlantic Monthly, the North American Review, the Hibbert Journal, and the Political Science Quarterly. If the writers of articles in those journals are prepared to publish their names, why should the writers in our daily press hide behind anonym it y ! The leading journalists of the world are only too ready to connect their names with their articles, and I see no reason why the writers to our daily press should not do the same. Those who have had anything to do with country or provincial journalism are aware that practically everj reading man or woman in a r town of even fairly large size knows exactly who has written each leading article that appears in the local newspaper.",44
254,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Any studies the leading articles of the metropolitan journals can tell who writes them.,45
255,Mr FENTON,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Every writer has a peculiar style of his own, and one accustomed to reading leading articles can tell from a few sentences who the writer is, but I see no reason why these articles should not be signed.",45
256,Mr KING OMALLEY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,S i g n in g would make a market for the brains of writers.,45
257,Mr FENTON,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Yes . During my electoral campaign I came-into contact with quite a number of persons differing from me in politics-busines s and commercial men, eminent journalists, and othersand it was the general opinion that the compelling of the signing of articles was a most desirable reform. I believe that if a vote of the people were taken on the subject, the verdict would be overwhelmingly in favour of the retention of the provision in the electoral law requiring articles to be signed. Personally, I think that every trained journalist should get credit for his literary compositions. In the short time at my disposal I cannot deal with all of the many provisions of the Bill , although I hope to speak at greater length on some in Committee; but I wish to say a word now regarding the proposal that a Judge of the H i gh Court or of the Supreme Court of a State shall fix the boundaries of our electoral divisions.",45
258,Mr RILEY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,It is one of the worse proposals in the Bill .,45
259,Mr FENTON,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,It will certainly receive considerable opposition from me.,45
260,Mr TUDOR,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,It would bring about mere office distributions.,45
261,Mr FENTON,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Yes . A Judge might be ever so eminent in the law, but he would be dependent on the Surveyor General for expert advice regarding boundaries, and on the electoral officials for information on electoral matters, such as community of interest and other questions. I do not say that the ""three-commissioner"" system is the best that could be devised, but the last Victorian Commission, composed, as it was, of the Chief Electoral Officers of the Commonwealth and the State and the Victorian Surveyor-General, was above suspicion, and discharged its duties faith full y and well. Such a Commission could be trusted by both parties, and could do the work better than any Judge. I one who understand that it is proposed that after Parliament has once reviewed a proposed redistribution recommended by a Judge, and has referred it back, it shall have no second opportunity of review. Although members of Parliament may be regarded as interested parties in this matter, I shall be slow to forfei t my right of review in the manner proposed. I claim that I should be allowed to discuss every phase of a proposed electoral distribution. Whilst the ' three-commissioner'' system 1 may not be the best possible, it is certainly preferable to giving the determination of the matter to one individual.",45
262,Mr FLEMING,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,A system of that kind worked very well in New South Wales under Judge Murray .,45
263,Mr KING OMALLEY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,It did not work very well for us !,45
264,Mr FENTON,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"We want the assistance of the practical man who knows something about survey, of the man of the world who knows something about community of interest, and of the man who knows something about the electoral system. These different elements are required to be taken into consideration for the proper redistributiou into electorates of any country. This proposal will meet with my stern opposition, and I trust that we shall receive assistance from honourable members opposite in endeavouring to frame an Electoral Bill that will be creditable to this House. I am sure that if the Bill were to pass into law in its present shape, most thinking men and women in Australia would be of opinion that the Federal Parliament had taken leave of its senses. I trust that honourable members opposite will take part in the discussion on the Bill, and will no longer suffer from tongue-tiedness. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They are all Caucus-bound.",46
265,Mr FENTON,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Such an exhibition as has been givan in the conspiracy of silence maintained on the Government benches has rarely been seen in a Parliament. I do not believe that honourable members opposite approve of this Bill in its entirety. To believe so would be to give credence to a libel on their common sense. I hope, therefore, that they will be no longer ""gagged,"" but will give the electors an opportunity of knowing their opinions. I wonder what their constituents are thinking of them. In my opinion, they will be judged very severely indeed for remaining silent when such an important Bill is before Parliament.",46
266,Mr FALKINER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,We are trembling.,46
267,Mr FENTON,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The honourable member will tremble like an aspen leaf when the next election approaches, and will then regret that he did not take part in the debate on so important a measure. It is all the more necessary that we should hear the opinion of the supporters of the Bill, because the Minister who introduced it furnished such meagre information in respect to its fundamental principles. We ought to hear from some other Minister before we read the Bill a second time. Even if Ministers, wishing to maintain Cabinet secrecy, are silent, surely the more independent spirited of honourable members opposite will stand up and show the people that they are not being "" gagged.""",46
268,Mr FALKINER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,There is plenty of time.,46
269,Mr FENTON,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I should like to see honourable members on both sides following each other alternately throughout the debate. Even the Minister of Home Affairs, who is officially responsible for this bantling, keeps out of the chamber most of the time. Apparently, he is ashamed of it himself, and does not seem to care about fathering the measure. Whenever honourable members on this side have spoken in a straightforward manner regarding the Bill, they see nothing but shamefaced expressions opposite to them. We are called upon to pass the second reading when only one mouth has been opened in support of the Bill. Finally, I have to say that the measure is to be condemned because it opens the door to bad practices, will violate the secrecy of the ballot, and will disfranchise thousands of electors. These defects, which stand on the face of the Bill, ought to be wiped out. We claim the support of honourable members opposite in eradicating them. The measure ought to be supported by some better arguments than were advanced in the foolish party appeal made by the Honorary Minister. By furnishing such arguments, if they can, honourable members opposite will be carrying out the high national duties for which they were sent to this House.",46
270,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"West Sydney) [8.7] We may well ask ourselves why this Bill has been introduced. As far as I know, there is no precedent for a Government to introduce a Bill to reform the electoral machinery necessary for ascertaining the will of the people, as their first measure, except the case of Sir George Reid, who, in his short-lived and ill-fated Ministry, mentioned in a Governor General's Speech only one measure, and that a proposal for a redistribution preceding an immediate appeal to the people. It is perfectly well known that Sir George Reid's Government's position in this House was, as a result of a projected defection of his supporters, perfectly hopeless. But this Government is in quite another case. They have a majority. They have come here, so Ministers constantly avow, to get on with a policy. Every week end we are treated to dissertations upon the intent of the Government during the coming week to get on with tlieir policy. They avow their resolute - determination to go on with their policy. There is nothing to stop them from getting on with it . They have a majority. The Government are able, whenever they bend their efforts determinedly to the work, to get their legislation through this Chamber, whatever fate may await it elsewhere. They know this perfectly well. Yet the first measure of the Government is one to reform the electoral machinery. It is not pretended for a moment that this is part of the Government policy. Since this House met, the Government have put a policy-suc h as it is-before us. This is not part of a policy for this Parliament at all. It is a means for ascertaining at a future election the will of the people in respect of the composition of the next Parliament. there is a policy to be given effect to in this Parliament. Where is it? Why does the Government not go on with its policy? We have a r i g h t to ask that question in such a case, where a Government, as the result of an appeal to the people, have been returned with a majority to this House, returned to do certain definite things, where they have the means of putting their business on the notice-paper in the order they please. This policy is alleged to be urgently needed. But this Government have deliberately decided to bring forward measures which have no relation to its policy at all. What is the reason why the Government have introduced this measure? It is perfectly clear that they have introduced it for the purpose of fooling the electors. They have introduced it for the purpose of endeavouring to make the electors believe that they are feverishly anxious to get on with their policy, but that, owing to the obstructive tactics of this party, they are unable to do so. Therefore, there is no alternative but to prepare for another election. That is their object. To that they direct every effort. But there is not one fact that justifies their attitude. Their policy, such as it is, can be introduced. ought to have been introduced long ago. The only measures that have been introduced are this Bill and the A u d it Bill . The one is a Bill to enable the Government to appeal to the electors at the close of this Parliament, .and the other is a Bill to enable them to prolong the recess. There is a method in the madness of this Government that must strike every elector who looks at it fairly. Here we have a Government bringing down a Bill , the very nature of which makes its introduction at this stage a most suspicious circumstance, and one which demands explanation. But not only do we obtain no explanation for the introduction of electoral reform legislation at the very beginning of a new Parliament, but we get no explanation of the Bill itself. It is true that the Minister who introduced it said a great deal. But one may say a very great deal without explaining anything. It is - true that he abused the party to which I belong. It is true that he attempted to couple us, by an insinuation which he was not courageous enough to maintain, with the But criminal classes of this country. But he did in no way attempt to explain this Bill . We have it thrown on the table, and now, in the second day of its discussion, we have heard not one word from anybody except the Minister who introduced it , saving a few remarks, disjointed and disgruntled, from the Prime Minister. A more petulant and childish display it has never been my lot to witness. It would have been quite inexcusable in anybody. It was absolutely inexcusable in the Prime Minister of this country. Whether it is his vanity that has quite overbalanced his reason, whether he is blown out with his own conceit t ill he thinks he is not as other men, I do not pretend to say. But I wish to say to him a few words in season. I would like to prick the bladder of his egotism by telling him that he is the honourable member for Parramatta although he is Prime Minister. In other words, he is our equal, and we expect him to behave as a man to other men, and not as a child in a kindergarten. I come now to the Bill , unassisted by that very necessary explanation of its provisions which is due to the House and the country. What is the policy of this measure? Before I answer that quesIt tion, let rae ask another. What ought to be the basic principles of any electoral machinery which seeks to give effect to democratic government? I think that the basic principles of democratic electoral law are these: There must be an opportunity afforded to every sane adult man or woman, other than criminals undergoing sentence, to exercise a vote; there must be ample facilities offered to all adults for enrolment, and when enrolled to record their votes. And , lastly, measures must be taken to insure at once the - purity and secrecy of the ballot. These are the three basic principles. How long mankind in general, and our race in particular, have been fighting to achieve these, history can tell us. I am convinced that the people of this country will not allow an inroad to be made upon any one of these principles. Every step that we have gained has beeu gained as the result of a determined and persistent struggle, and we shall do well therefore to hold it with all our strength. Let us now look at the Bill . It purports to be a Bill to reform the electoral machinery now in existence. It is introduced at this stage ostensibly because there were grave irregularities-whole sale impersonations-at the last elections. It is alleged that those irregularities practically prevented the true will of the electors from being expressed. We were told this in effect again last evening by the Prime Minister. It was on this ground he sought to justify his present attitude. This charge of impersonation and fraud is a recrudescence of the charges that were made soon after the recent electionswild, baseless, wicked accusations without an atom of justification, and unsupported by a solitary fact. A f t e r three and a half months of office, with all the machinery of the law at their backs, these gentlemen have been unable to substantiate any one of them. The country then ought to know that it is not because the present electoral machinery has broken down-no t because it permitted of wholesale fraud at the last elections-that this measure has been introduced. On the other hand, one thing is abundantly clear: the present electoral machineryand all institutions must be judged by results-ha s given better results than any other ever used in this country. Both in the aggregate, and in the percentage of votes recorded, there was, at the last election, an enormous increase. I submit that actual experience is the best possible test to which any institution or legislation can be subjected. Judged by that test, the present electoral machinery is admirably adapted to ascertain the will of the people. Yet we are asked to believe that the existing condition of things is such that not a moment must be lost in introducing amending legislation. AV. Hughes. Before dealing with the Bill itself, I wish to remind the House and the country of what the results of the last election actually show, because my honourable friends opposite have exhibited a most regrettable condition of political myopia, being apparently quite unable to read facts which are as plain as holy w r it . They have been going about this country as meu who have been choused out of their constitutional right to a majority by some cunning wholesale frauds. They ought to have a great majority in this Chamber, but by some hocus pocus it has not manifested itself here to the extent that it ought to have done, and the electoral machinery is to blame. They have asserted over and over again that they had a majority of the electors behind them. I shall show from the returns which have been supplied by the Chief Electoral Officer, and I have taken the trouble to work out the results of the voting at the last election, both for the Senate and for this House, that bhis is not so. They have not a majority of the people behind them. The actual figures are very in structive. The result of the Senate poll upon the general count is:-Liberal , 958,122; Labour, 948,168. In South Australia there was a fourth Liberal candidate in the person of Sir Josiah Symon. Conceding that the votes recorded in his favour were all Liberal votes, and allowing one-third of them to the highest Liberal, the Liberal Senate vote in South Australia would be advanced to 88,829 instead of 82,829. But in New South Wales there were three candidates for the Senate in what was termed the Socialist interest. The highest of these candidates polled 21,817 votes. It has to be conceded that these votes, at any rate, were cast against the Liberals. In New South Wales, the contests, both for the Senate and for the House of Representatives, showed that invariably the Senate Labour vote was inferior to the Representative Labour vote by, approximately, the votes there polled by the Senate Socialist candidates. A few instances of this may be given. In the electorate of Hunter, 12,884 votes were cast for the Labour candidate for the House of Representatives, 10,956 for Labour candidates for the Senate, and 1,099 for Socialist candidates for the Senate. In Newcastle, 17,865 votes were cast for the Labour candidate for the House of Representatives, 16,015 votes for Labour candidates for the Seriate, and 1,582 votes for Socialist candidates for the Senate. Richmond, 7,286 votes were recorded for Labour for the House of Representatives, 6,778 votes for Labour for the Senate, and 1,077 votes for Socialist candidates for the Senate. In the division Robertson, 10,143 votes were cast for Labour for the House of Representatives, 9,061 votes for Labour for the Senate, and 600 votes for Socialist candidates the Senate. In West Sydney, 17,658 votes were recorded in favour of Labour for the House of Representatives, 15,584 votes for Labour for the Senate, and 1,168 votes for Socialist candidates the Senate. Crediting, therefore, these 21,817 votes, which were undoubtedly cast against the Liberal party, to the Labour total, and the additional 6,000 votes on behalf of Sir Josiah Symon to the Liberals, the Senate figures stand thus: Liberal, 964,122; Labour, 969,985. So much for the Senate vote; now for the House of Representatives' .vote. results in all the States, omitting "" inThe dependent "" results, were-Labour 921,099; Liberal, 929,620. B u figures do not include the votes cast against Liberals in the Hume, which of numbered 11,236 for the House of Reprethe sentatives, and 9,382 for the Senate; in Gippsland, where they numbered 12,671 for the House of Representatives, and 10,738 for the Senate; and in Koothat yong, where they numbered 11,540 for the House of Representatives, and 10,229 for the Senate, nor against Labour in Melbourne, where they numbered 7,320 "" freedom of the press."" for the House of Representatives, 8,557 for the Senate. Taking the Senate figures for these constituencies, and creditopportunities ing them in their proper order, the sults stand-Labour , 951,448; Liberal, their 938,177. Even then there are unacthat counted for the uncontested seats of H in marsh, Kalgoorlie, and Angas. The views of the electors may be fairly taken from the highest Senate figures in those divisions, allowing in Angas an increment of one-third, owing to the presence of a fourth Liberal candidate in the person of Sir Josiah Symon. The figures thus ing obtained readHindmarsh ... 22,027 ... 8,571 Angas ... 7,896 ... 13,601 plus 600 abolish Saturday polling. Kalgoorlie ... 17,548 ... 3,994 [50] Arriving thus at a complete and final In result of the House of Representatives elections, all things being considered, we get the following:-Labour , 998,919; Liberal, 964,943. These figures, I venture to say, will withstand all the of criticism which my honourable friends opposite are able to bestow upon them. I submit that they show exactly where we are today, so far as the majority of the for electors is concerned. But my honourable friends have a majority of members in this House, and they are entitled and expected to bring forfor ward their policy. They have not done so. They have deliberately chosen to in troduce a measure useful only for the purpose of testing the opinion of the people at the next elections, and couched it in terms which compel us, and were intended to compel us, to regard it as a gage of battle. This measure was introduced in such a way as to accentuate its obvious purpose to a point that, happily, The is not usually reached in this House. Bill itself contains ample proof that , it is in no sense of the word to be ret these garded as a legitimate and bond fide' effort to reform the electoral machinery this country. Let us look at it . In it Government propose, broadly speaking, to do five things. They propose to abolish Saturday polling, to close the roll one month before the issue of the writis, one month before it is closed under the present law-to compel each elector to sign his name to his ballot paper ; to restore the postal vote and the In the and first place, let us inquire whether the Bill is calculated to extend the of the people for regisretering their opinions and expressing will. If it is, I say, emphatically,, we ought to adopt it . If it is not,: d - we ought to reject it . I think that the electors will be guided entirely by the. answer which is given to that question.. In my opinion this Bill does not extend the opportunities of the electors of the country. Under the pretence of extendthe franchise the Bill restricts it , and under the pretence of preventing fraud Labour. Liberal. the Bill encourages it . Let us look at the facts. The Government propose to I suppose that at least 1,000,000 out of the 47,471 26,766 2,000,000 electors on the roll, male and female, find on Saturday their greatest opportunities for leisure; that is beyond question. On that day their week's work is done. They have before them leisure and respite from their daily toil. On that day they can freely exercise their franchise. On that day they are as free as their employers. it is a feeble argument to advance to a party that is indifferent to those whose only opportunities for leisure are on a Saturday, but to the people of Australia, it will , I think, appeal rather strongly. There is no day on which the worker can vote so readily as on Saturday. Until the last election there never was an opportunity given to him when he could be absolutely free from any influence which his employer could possibly bring upon him. Although the law says that the employer must give the employee two hours away, there are wheels within wheels, and ways by which the employer can make his influence felt, and it was not until the last election that a man could vote absolutely free from in fluence, and no matter what his employer thought or did. This measure, in troduced on the specious pretext that it is to extend the franchise, begins by deliberately taking away the best opportunity open to the people to exercise the franchise. That is their idea of extending the franchise. This is a restriction that affects not 77,000 sick persons, but 1,000,000 healthy ones. That is their first great reform. they propose to close the roll one month before it is now closed. I take it that the proof that the extension period during which persons can put their names on the roll is justified is furnished by the rolls themselves. It is proved by the fact that more people were enrolled at the last election than ever before. My honourable may say that there were more people on the roll than were entitled to be enrolled. The Chief Electoral Officer has explained how that is, and he entertains no doubt at all that in the overwhelming of cases such duplications were perfectly explicable and perfectly regular. today for some figures in connection with this matter. One of the things I do complain of-and I think that we all have a right to complain-is that although measure deoends for its justification facts, we have no facts before us. I asked today how many persons were put on the roll witl>in one month before the issue of Mr Hughes. the writ. If we had the information we should know how many electors the proposed amendment is going to cut off. 1 venture to say that many thousands of persons got on the roll within one month of the prescribed time. It is of no use I admit to talk about what electors ought to do, to say that they ought to be sleeplessly vigilant. They ought, but they are not, and honourable members on the other side should thank God for it . During the greater part of the time people take very little interest in politics, but they wake up with feverish anxiety a few weeks or days before the election, and go about-' trying to make up for lost time. Just before the last election they came in their thousands to t ry to get on the - roll. One of the most inexcusable and most unjustifiable acts that the present Government are committing under cover of introducing this "" reform "" amendment of the electoral law is to prevent tens of thousands of persons from having an opportunity to record their votes. I will not read the report of the Chief Electoral Officer. The Minister, perhaps, ought to place a copy of it on the table. It setsf o r t h the views of the Chief Electoral Officer on the allegation that there were many more people on the roll than there were people in the country. One of the best things the ex-Minister of Home Affairs did was to make a provision under which people could get on the roll up to the date of the issue of Then the writs. I know, of my own knowledge, of hundreds of people in my own district who did not get on the roll, i u of the spite of compulsory enrolment, until then. perfectly Those are two of the Government's electoral "" r e for m s . "" They will assuredly disfranchise thousands of the people of this country. One prevents the electors friends from voting on Saturday, which is their best day; the other denies opportunity to thousands of getting on the roll. And they call these things electoral reforms! majority Then they propose another ingenious scheme. It is that every elector shall sign I asked his name before he records his vote. Nothing in the history of reactionary legislation ever equalled such a proposal. These honourable gentlemen propose to dothis this in the face of experience which would on be sufficient to convince any ordinary man. What was the complaint at the last election? That sufficient facilities were not afforded to electors to record their votes. There is a gentleman now lodging a petition against an honourable member because there was such a congestion in the polling booth that there was no opportunity for the people to record their votes. In the face of this fact, which is generally known, it is deliberately proposed to prevent a man from voting until he signs his name. Imagine the state of 'things that must result. As everybody knows, the average elector, when he goes into a polling booth, is easily flustered. It is very difficult to get an orderly and rapid procession through the polling booth in any circumstances. The signing of names, which must be done in the presence of officers, will cause such a block as must inevitably prevent a rapid and effective poll being taken. It is, in short, such a proposal as will make a fair representation of the opinion of the electors impossible. These three things the Government have done in this Bill . The Honorary Minister, in that spirit of kindly Christian courtesy which always distinguishes him, said, the other night, that there was a connection between the criminal classes and ourselves. That insult may be allowed to pass. Coming from where it did, it will not hurt us, whomever it hurts. But there is a connection between us and the workers of this country, and we are able to say that a great many of those who vote for us will find this embargo press more heavily upon them than upon the supporters of the party on the other side. The workers of this country, perhaps, are not as facile penmen as some gentlemen who sit in high places, but they are men, and as electors they ought not to be prevented from recording their votes by any absurd, reactionary and medieval proposal such as this. That is what the Government propose to do for the people of this country.",46
271,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,There is no vision in the Bill which says that a man cannot record his vote on Saturday. See proposed section 88A.,51
272,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The honourable member means that the Bill does not provide that the poll shall not be taken on Saturday?,51
273,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Yes .,51
274,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I do not say that ; but I ask why is the alteration proposed if it is not intended to take away this right ? What is the matter with Saturday ? It is the people's day. It is the very best possible day on which the elector [50]- 2 could exercise his franchise. If they do not mean to destroy Saturday polling, why alter the law? What would the honourable member say if it were proposed to strike out the prohibition against Sunday trading? Would he not say that that was a blow at religion and the practice of Christianity in this country? What would he say if those who sought to do this thing said that to remove the prohibition against Sunday trading ""did not make Sunday trading imperative? The Bill proposes to keep electors off the roll , and to prevent them voting if they get on. That is what the Government propose to do for the people of the country. What do they propose to do for their friends? What is their placard in the front window? There is the restoration of the postal vote, and the ""freedom of the press."" The postal vote is their trump card. D u r i ng the election we heard a great deal about the postal vote, and we have heard a great deal about it since. It is the palladium of liberty-it is going to ring down to the ages as the achievement of this Ministry. Let us look at the matter. The other night the Honorary Minister said that 77,000 of the sick and suffering were prevented from voting, and that the vote was going to be restored to them. The statistics on which the honourable gentleman relies are those of Mr Knibbs, who, as a statistician, occupies a very distinguished place, not only in this country, but throughout the civilized world. I am bound to say, however, that the Government do not always accept Mr Knibbs' statistics. A little while ago, when Mr . Knibbs issued a table to show that vaccination, as a matter of fact, is not a preventive of small-pox, the Government apparently had an interview with pro- him. Anyhow, the next morning Mr . Knibbs' recantation appeared, in the press, with a declaration that his statistics did not mean that at all. Now we have the statement that Mr Knibbs says there are 77,000 people who might come under this clause. How are these statistics obtained? We are not told. Of course, the man in the street is asked to believe that, as a fact, 77,000 people are disfranchised because of the abolition of the postal vote. There is not one atom of truth in that statement. First of all, a very large proportion of those persons voted at the last election, although there was no postal The Honorary Minister himself that they had.to parade their before the public; and they cannot do that and at the same time be prevented from voting. Then, of course, there are quite a number of persons too sick to go to the poll; for when a person is really sick, he does not bother about he cannot be very sick when politics have such a stimulating and attractive for him. The 77,000 is melting away. The Honorary Minister and his friends rely particularly on the women of Australia-it is to them that this great, inexcusable, and cowardly injustice has been done. This is their Is it a fact that the women of Australia have been prevented voting? Is it a fact that this proposal is intended to restore the vote to them ? Let us see what the postal vote did before, because, after all, one can only judge of the future by the past. election of 1910 there were 36,820 postal vote papers issued, and, of these, 29,000 Were used. The remainder, some 6,000, went astray, and from that day to this no one has been able to trace them. in this way that the Government to introduce a system in which there is no possibility for fraud, by which will be able to vote free from any influence, and which, in short, will maintain the secrecy of the ballot. serted that the very corner-stone of this postal vote edifice is the wrong that is done to the women-to the mothers of our children. Let us this statement. Happily, the mothers of our children are not confined to any one spot, but are fairly distributed all over the Commonwealth. Children are not the peculiar of the women in any one State; and yet the returns of the results of the postal voting would lead one to that At the election of 1910, there were more postal votes cast in Kooyong than in the whole of Western Australia, were as many postal votes cast in Victoria as in, practically, all the other States put together. So far from there being any coincidence between the birth-rate and the number of postal votes-and ought to be if there is anything in their argument-the State in which the birthrate is the lowest, namely, where the flag of Liberalism has never been pulled down-showed more postal ttr. Hughes. vote. votes than did Tasmania, where the said birth-rate is the highest. The postal vote infirmities is supposed to be a convenience for the people in the widely-scattered districts; but the returns show that it was in the fashionable suburb of Kooyong, and throughout Victoria, where the settlement is closer than in any other State, that politics- postal votes were most used, while in the wide open spaces of Western Australia, interest and the prolific orchard districts of Tasrapidly mania, there were hardly any. What a miserable, hypocritical, canting cry this is that the postal vote is introduced for the sake of the women-for the sake of the mothers of our future children. The story. figures I have quoted are official, and cannot be denied. Are they not a clear from exposure of the hollowness and absolute rottenness of the foundation on which this case rests? The postal vote was useful in Kooyong, not because there are more mothers there than at any other place At the Sir JOHN FORREST - I suppose there are some people who are ill ?",51

What does the Commonwealth rest on ? On an absolute faith by the people in the purity and secrecy of and tliere the ballot. What is this postal voting? Is it not open voting? When I look at the black-letter insertions in the Bill , and see the precautions there taken to conserve the secrecy of the ballot I find that even there by the Ministry there is a recognition of the fact that that secrecy is in danger. But in the booth there is no Victoria- danger; there the secrecy of the ballot is safe. There is an independent officer, and a compartment into which one voter goes at a time. There is no friend, no earnest and enthusiastic dropper-in, to suggest effective which way the elector shall vote. We do not hear, ' My dear, I do not wish to 1 you which way to vote, but Jones is such a fine man; vote for him . "" Canvassing not allowed in the booth, nor may an elecing tor be influenced on his way to the booth. ballot. I give honourable gentlemen opposite as much credit as I give to anybody else in this matter, but they do not appear to realise the danger of this proposal, that the fight of the people has all along been against ODen voting. voting was open, although the people had votes, they used them in the way wealth beeu restrained, desired; and it is only since the ballot has been secret that wealth has been little foiled. Secrecy is the very essence of our electoral system; destroy that, and you destroy the system. provide that votes shall not be counted on a station where there is a booth, because the squatter would then know which way the electors had voted. provide that votes shall not be counted in a workshop where there is a booth, and for the same reason. We should taking a reactionary step if we permitted postal voting- a system which undermines the secrecy of the ballot. I am not posed to, but, on the contrary, heartily favour of, some means being devised whereby the sick shall be able to vote. At every hospital there ought to a booth. This would cover a large percentage of lying-in cases as well as other cases, because, medical man knows, the percentage of persons who use lying-in hospitals is i creasing every day. An officer attend at the hospitals, and thus obviate the necessity of any woman leaving her bed. If this can be done, I do not why it ought not to be done. So far as the sick generally are concerned, they ought to have a vote, and I desire that they should; but I do not propose to allow the machinery proposed in this B i to be put in motion. Under cover of this humorous side. Bill , it will not be the sick in bed, women in bed, who will vote, but those who, in one way or other, come under influence, and cannot get away from the influence, of those in high places. The power of money today cannot be exagi gerated. Not for one moment do suggest that there is any such vulgar thing as open bribery-that is utterly beside the question - but there that insidious influence that is so and so hard to resist. Everybody knows that it exists, and I say tell deliberately that not one member of the party opposite would suggest that, in reis spect of the elections generally, open votshould be substituted for the secret Leaving this matter, I come now to the question of the "" freedom "" of the press. or Freedom is going to be restored to the press. The press "" g a g "" is to be taken When off. What the people are asked to believe is that by some law the press has freedom of speech denied, and criticism stifled. What utter a nonsense it is to say anything of the k in d ! What was there that the press could have said before the last general We election that it did not say? To what length could it have gone that it did not go?- I have just been reading in the Library some of those admirWe able articles which appeared in the Age and the Argus. I cannot see how they could have been improved for the be purpose for which they were written. There was nothing they could suggest which they did not suggest. There was opnothing they should have said, from the in stand-point of their party, that they did not say. 'Every suggestion calculated to tur n the voter away from the Labour be party was made. There was no kind of criticism to which they did not resort. They said everything they desired to say, as every and the only condition imposed upon them by the law was that they should, at the n - foot of each article, publish the name of could the writer. As they became case-hardened, it was their ingenious custom to write two or three names at the foot of each article. see And so we learned that So-and-So and So-and-So, "" in consultation,"" had written tliese articles to express the views of the proprietor of the Age or the Argus, as the case might be. This was a doubtfully l l legal practice, but it was not without its I do not suppose any or the one took very great exception to it . I certainly did not. But the point which the I wish to emphasize is that the press said everything it could have said; that it had absolute freedom to say whatever t liked, and that all that was asked of I it was that the writer of an article dealing with political matters should sign his name to it . Even that was not done, is because three men could hardly be the authors of oue article. The press had full liberty. But what was, and is, the position of our party ? In New South Wales, the press gave me every freedom. I was allowed to say what I wished to say. So far as I know, I have never had one word cut out of any communication I have made to the press in New South Wales. Bub I have never been able to say that of the press of Victoria. It seems to be the idea of the Victorian press that they are to determine not only whether views shall be expressed at all, but if they are to be expressed, to what extent tliey should be subject to their censorship. The press has liberty. It is we who are gagged. Tliese, however, are the two proposals which our honourable friends opposite are going to carry out. They are going to restore the postal vote and the freedom of the press. These are great boons, for which the people of Australia will be profoundly grateful. When our friends opposite were before the country, the high cost of living was their great cry. were going to reduce it. The man in the street, who has to pay a little more now than he had to pay then, may say, "" Well, whab are the Government going to do ? "" to which his friend, Bill, will reply, ""The Government are going to restore the freedom of the press."" says the man in the street, "" What about preference to unionists ? they not going to abolish it?"" shakes his head doubtfully, and says""They are going to restore the postal vote."" These are indeed stones for bread. This is the manner this Government carries out its policy. This is the way in which it duces machinery for reforming the elecboral laws of the Commonwealth. away the real privileges aud the real means by which the people are able to express their opinions-and did express them ab the last election-and place it restores the postal vote and the freedom of the press. The postal vote cry is a hollow sham ! The people cry for bread and it gives them So far as the statement that alone make use of the postal system is concerned, it is noting that one-half of those who voted by post at the general election in 191.0 were men. The present Minister and Customs, as quoted the other day Mr rtiighes. by the Leader of the Opposition, signed the following report as chairman of a Select Committee, and thus gave expression to an opinion which I trust will have some weighb wibh his colleaguesThe evidence justifies your Committee in finding that many persons who voted by post had not reason to believe they would be more than five miles from their polling place on the day of election, and were on that day within the limit. It would appear that the voting facilities provided have been used contrary to the intention of the Act. The Committee went on in its report to unreservedly condemn postal voting. The Government now propose to reintroduce the system. They say, however, that they are introducing it wibh precaubions and safeguards. That bhose safeguards are likely to be effective I do nob bhink for a monienb. Unless bhis Governmenb propose to introduce such safeguards as will really confine the system to the use of sick persons, and take such steps as w i ll prevent the violation of the secrecy of the ballot-and that, I take it , can hardly be done unless an officer attends each person voting by post- I shall certainly not They support their proposal. In conclusion, I wish only to say of this measure that, although we have .every right to complain of the time at which it has been introduced, and of the maimer in which it "" But,"" has been introduced, it is still a matter of concern to the people, and we ought Are not in any way to allow the manner of Bill its introduction to prejudice its consideration in the House. We are here to do what is right for the people irrespective of all other considerations, and therefore, in which speaking for myself, I shall give to this Bill the consideration I would give to it intro- if it were introduced by my own party. I shall vote for those provisions in which It takes I believe, and against those in which I do not believe. I do not for one moment set myself against postal voting as such. But I do set my face rigidly against any attempt to violate the. secrecy of the in their ballot. I set myself againsb any abtempb to enable the able-bodied elector who can go to the poll to cast his vote by post. Whatever is to be done under cover of a stone. doing something for the sick must be done women in such a way that it will be confined to vote the sick, and the sick alone. worth As for the other proposals in the Bill , they must be treated on their merits. ofTrade The measure, as it stands, appeals to me as an utter sham. I am prepared to . make it a real reform. In my opinion it has been introduced, not for the purpose - of reforming the electoral machinery, but to fool the people. But it will not fool them. The elector is becoming wiser and wiser each day. He will understand why it is that the Government in troduced this Electoral Bill instead of bringing forward their substantive policy. He will want to know why it is that something is not done by way of introducing legislation acceptable to both sides. He will ask himself why a Government, situated as the present Government is, does not introduce measures that both sides can consider. He will want to know all these things, and no wild vaporings will save this Government from the in evitable condemnation which must come to tliem for their actions i u respect of this and other matters. I regret that the Government have introduced this Bill . My attitude towards this measure will be as I have said. I do not believe that it is a bond fide attempt to amend the law; I do believe that it is a mere posturing to the gallery. I shall endeavour, however, since we are here to do our duty to the people, to make iti a real and effective amendment of the electoral machinery of the Commonwealth, which, at - the same time, is more perfect now than ever it was-machiner y which, at the last - election, was the means whereby a larger number of electors recorded their votes tha n at any previous election, and which stands today the most up-to-date piece of electoral legislation i u the world.",52
276,Mr WH IRVINE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Flinders-Attor ney-General) [11.12] - I do not intend to - occupy the attention of the House very long at this stage. As has already been pointed out by the Prime Minister, this Bill , with the exception of two or three broad matters of principle embodied in it , and which have been debated already to a considerable extent, deals mainly with the machinery of our electoral law, and, therefore, essentially consists of necessarily disconnected amendments of a piece of legislative machinery which, unlike the last speaker, I do not consider is at all perfect. I shall not attempt to follow the honourable member for West Sydney an his language, which was strong, and sometimes almost abusive of the Government for introducing this Bill . honourable member impugned our motives. I would remind him that for our motives, - HS well as our measures, we are ultimately responsible to the electors. I do not propose to say anything in defence of those motives except what is pertinent to the discussion of the measure now before the House. The honourable member, in launching his speech, asked why the Government did not bring in its policywhy it had interpolated this measure before the policy which it had put before the country and the House. I would remind him that that policy was set out in a document which was laid on the table of this House, containing twenty paragraphs dealing with different matters, and that the first of these twenty paragraphs is as follows: The Government, holding that an efficient Electoral Law is the real foundation of a sound Parliamentary system, will introduce a B i ll to restore the postal vote, to modify the provisions in respect to absent voting, to remove unnecessary restrictions on public discussion of public questions, and to make other necessary alterations. Of what has the honourable member to complain? The first measure brought before the House is a measure to give effect to the first plank in the policy of the Government. I can assure the honourable memher for West Sydney that if he and his colleagues will give us reasonable assistance in passing this measure, they will find that we shall proceed with the utmost expedition to the next planks, and give the House an opportunity to deal with them. We have had from a great many honourable members opposite the cry perpetually reiterated that we are by this Bill making an attack on the secrecy of - the ballot. There is not a provision in ib which makes any attack on the secrecy of the ballot. Some honourable members seem to think that the secrecy of the ballot involves an elector not telling any one for whom he is going to vote; that anything in the Bill enabling an elector to inform tliose with whom he is in contact how he intends to vote is an infringement of the secrecy of the ballot. It is of the essence of freedom in the exercise of the franchise that every citizen shall have the fullest opportunity, if he so desires, to say for whom he is going to vote, and to persuade others to vobe in the same way. Every citizen should have the right to exercise his powers of persuasion to the utmost to cause other citiThe zens to vote as he is going to vote. Will any honourable member opposite say that he has not occasionally tried to influence persons to vote for particular candidates? The secrecy of the hallot, as I have always understood it , means, not that electors shall not have the fullest liberty to say for whom they are going to vote, and to induce others to vote for the same persons, but that they shall have the right, if they so desire, to conceal from the world their intentions in regard to voting. That is the meaning of the secrecy of the ballot, and there is nothing in the Bill that impugns it . Of course, it w i ll be excellent political capital if my honourable friends opposite can succeed in making it appear that the Bill is an attack on the secrecy of the ballot. By doing that, they would forge for themselves a weapon of great value. But there is nothing in the Bill to justify such a statement regarding it . The restoration of the postal vote was not only one of the most important planks of the Liberal party of Australia, but is, in my opinion, absolutely necessary to do justice to a cousiderable section of the people. There is hardly a member on the other side who has attacked the provision for establishing the postal vote who has not proclaimed himself in favour of giving an opportunity to the sick and infirm to record their votes. But what are the alternatives they propose? The honourable member for West Syduey has said that he would open a polling booth in every hospital. I have no objection to that, but it would go but a short way to meet the case. Other honourable members opposite, when asked what they would propose, have made the suggestion that a poll clerk, or Returning Officer, with scrutineers, and the whole electoral paraphernalia, should travel around the country recording the votes of the sick and firm in their own homes. We know that that is impracticable in a country like ours. One of the main objects of the Bill is to obtain a pure and clean roll. All honourable members will admit that to be desirable, if it can be done. To the question, Is there need for nn amendment of the law for this purpose? I reply yes. _ Is the roll at present pure or perfect? Will any honourable member opposite say that it is?",55
277,Mr FENTON,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"^-NO; and it never will be perfect. Mr W . BT. IRVINE - It is impossible, for reasons that I shall give in a moment or two, to obtain a perfect r o l l ; our population fluctuates and moves about so much. But those charged with the responsibility of administering the electoral law say that the roll is at present swollen beyond all measure.",56
278,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Is that a condemnation of the system or of the administration?,56
279,Mr WH IRVINE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I am not going to condemn the administration. A d ministration fails sometimes because of those who are administering, and at other times because of defects in the system; I am speaking of defects in the system. We have this extraordinary.discrepancy that, whereas, according to the Commonwealth Statistician, the number of persons eligible for enrolment is 2,585,000, the number of names on the certified list, which is a very much reduced roll, is 2,760,000, or 175,000 more than the estimated number eligible for enrolment. Yet the honourable member for West Sydney says that he knows of hundreds, and even thousands, within his electorate whose names should be on the roll but are not there. That emphasizes the need for a rigid review of the position.",56
280,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I say that, throughout the Commonwealth, thousands of persons were, prevented from voting because their names were not on the roll, or appeared there incorrectly. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am not able to verify the statement, but, accepting it for the purposes of my argument, I say that those thousands must be added to the present excess of 175,000, which emphasizes the need for a clean roll. On the authority of the Chief Electoral Officer, let me tell the House what are the main reasons why the roll is so largely swollen. I do not say for a moment that the in the cause is fraudulent practices, or even to any great extent fraudulent practices. We have no means of estimating to what extent fraud or carelessness, or other such causes, are responsible for the position. But one cause is the inefficient mode of ascertaining the names of those who, having died, should be removed from the roll. The certificates of death are forwarded once in three months to the Electoral Department, but, as the electoral officers complain, and with justice, in a large number of cases it is impossible for them to identify the names on the certificates with names on the rolls. They get notice, for example, that John Richards has died in the Melbourne Hospital, and they may find twenty persons of that name on the roll, and, of course, cannot proceed on such information to strike off any of them. On the other hand, the death may have been recorded under such circumstances as to make it very likely that the John Richards who has died was a particular John Richards; but it is only when they are certain that the officials strike off any name.",56
281,Mr SHARPE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"How does the Bill provide for this? Mr W . H . IRVINE - The matter is not dealt with in the Bill , because it can- had not been tested. not be so dealt with, except indirectly. Inefficiency in the matter of recording transfers is another great cause why the roll is swollen. It seemed to be astounding, but I have it on the authority of the Electoral Registrar himself, based on information from the Statistician, that, on the average, some 500,000 persons change their place of residence every twelve months - in this country. That is one of the great difficulties of the position. Unfortunately, the law in regard to the registration of transfer is not carried out by tliese persons- I do not say fraudulently or with evil intention, but from carelessness or ignorance. In the large proportion of cases they, after making a change of residence, send in an original claim for enrolment. They are entitled to be enrolled immediately on making this claim, and their cards are then sent to the metropolis of the State, to be compared with the other cards that are kept in the office there. If it is found that any person thus claiming enrolment is already enrolled for another subdivision, steps are taken to remove his name from the roll for that subdivision. But this machinery for the amendment of the rolls is not perfect, even at the best of times, depending as it does entirely on the identification of names, which is very difficult. And it becomes unworkable on the approach of a general election. There is then an enormous increase in the claims for enrolment. All the associations and organizations of both sides in politics are stirred into unusual activity, with the result that claims for enrolment and transfer are multiplied enormously. So much so. that the officers of the Department are quite incapable of dealing with them, and the machinery breaks down. I will give an example. not intend to speak to-night, or I should haye had the papers here. I made quiries myself of the electoral officers in Victoria shortly after the last election, wishing to obtain information concerning a number of claims which had passed through the ordeal and been tested, or left untested, at the time when the certified roll was issued. The officers were unable to tell me. But, three or four weeks later, they made an estimate; and they informed me that, in the State of Victoria, not fewer than 50,000 claims were put through within a few weeks after the certified rolls were issued. Those claims The officers estimated that there were at least 25,000 cases in Victoria alone which represented actual duplications existing at the time. Honourable members may be sure that the officers would not over-estimate, in a matter of this kind, so as to minimize the efficiency of their own system. Under a system like that, it cannot be said that the machinery is at all perfected for the purpose of obtaining a reasonably accurate roll. How is that defect to be cured ? First, as to the undue swelling of the roll from the enormous number of applications made just prior to an election, there seem to be two ways of coping with the difficulty. One is to provide that nobody shall be entitled to have his name entered on the roll merely by putting in a claim, but that his claim must pass through a test before his name is placed on the roll. The other method is the provision adopted in this Bill , which I will explain more full y in a moment. The first method is undoubtedly, in many respects, the most scientific way of attaining the object in view-that a man must establish his right to get on the roll. If he leaves it t ill so late that, in consequence of the accumulation of thousands of cases, the electoral officers cannot investigate his claim, and that renders it impossible for him to get on the roll, it is his own fault But the difficulty about that method is that it would, I think, lead to considerable objections, because it would place in the hands of the electoral officers a responsibility which I , for one, do not think they would fail in honestly endeavouring to perform; but, still, it would enable them to deal with particular cases, to choose their own order of dealing with cases, and that would mean that certain persons would be placed on the roll before others. I did I am sure that the House would not approve of any system which would leave it in - to those charged with the examination of this accumulation of cases to pick and choose as to who should be put through first and who last. But, still, if the House thinks that such a system would be free from danger, the Government are quite prepared to accept a modification of it. It would, on the whole, be more effective than the present proposal. I admit that. But, after full consideration, and upon the advice of the Chief Electoral Officer himself, it was decided to adopt the system that is embodied in this Bill. That system I will explain. In order to give time to the electoral officers who are working the card system to make, as nearly completely as possible, a scrutiny of the enormous number of claims that come in just before an election, it was said that we must close down on claims for one month before the issue of the writ.",57
282,Mr FENTON,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,We should disfranchise thousands of people by doing that.,58
283,Mr WH IRVINE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Not long ago the system in vogue in most British communities-and , I think, speaking from recollection, in most of the Australian States-provide d for a yearly, and in some cases a biennial, revision of rolls.",58
284,Mr MATHEWS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,That was done to keep people off the rolls.,58
285,Mr WH IRVINE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I am not dealing ing with why it was done. There is nothing easier than to attribute motives, and to say that things of this kind were done with the desire to disfranchise people. That, I say, was the ordinary method. It was recognised that you must have some examination of those who claimed to be entitled to be on the voting list: and that was the method adopted. This Parliament has gradually extended - and very properly extended-the system, so as to give an opportunity of voting to those who are not on the roll at the time it is printed, but who come of age afterwards, or, for some other reason, become entitled to vote. I am not arguing whether the system adopted was a good one or not. The present system has that great advantage. I do not believe thai honourable members on either side would think it wise or safe to alter the system to one under which you would have names added up to the very last day, so that many thousands, and tens of thousands, of claims could be put in at the last moment without any scrutiny or examination at all.",58
286,Mr FENTON,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Pu t on a few more officers, and the Department will get through.",58
287,Mr WH IRVINE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"It is quite impossible to do it . If this card system is to be worked-and I , for one, am not a particular advocate of the system-it is a mere mechanical device",58
288,Dr MAEONEY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,It is the best up to date.,58
289,Mr WH IRVINE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Perhaps it is the best mechanical system that could be adopted. At any rate, it is the one that has been adopted. But to work this system it is essential that you should have officers who are thoroughly trained. The Chief Eloctoral Officer will tell you that it has taken him years to train the staff to the proper mechanical working of the system. It is impossible to put on casually extra men before an election, and trust them to do the work properly, even though tlieir honesty, in a political sense, might bo above suspicion. They would not be trained to the work.",58
290,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,It is better to have more oflicers than that some electors should be kept off the roll.,58
291,Mr WH IRVINE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"It would be impossible to achieve the object by havmore officers. You could not do it if you doubled, or trebled, or even quadrupled the number. You must have officers who are trained for the purpose. You can only work such a system by means of thoroughly trained officers. That is the opinion of those who are engaged in the working of the card system. The oflicers say that the only way in which they can do the work properly is by one of the two methods which I have explained-eithe r to say that Ave will not put on the certified rolls at all the names of any persons making any claims that have not been first examined, or else to allow at least a month before the issue of the writ for persons to send in their claims, in order to give time for the work of examination to be properly done.",58
292,Mr ANSTEY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Coul d not the work be done by stopping transfers for a month before an election? That would get rid of a large part of the work.,58
293,Mr WH IRVINE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"That would not meet the difficulty. It is not caused by those who come forward in a regular manner and say, "" I want to transfer my right to vote from the electorate where I formerly lived to the one where I live at present."" The difficulty is with the many thousands who ought to have put in claims for transfer, but, instead of doing that, put in claims for original enrolment.  rhat. It is because those who put in claims for transfer are generally left off the roll. That is my experience. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Why ?  are neither on the old roll nor the new one.",58
294,Mr WEBSTEH,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"That occurs frequently. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I do not see how that can be so, because, unless I . am misinformed, a man who desires to obtain a transfer, under the provisions of the Act , signs his card, and gets on the roll for the electorate to which he has transferred; and unless his name be subsequently removed for some good reason, he remains on the roll, and his name will be included in the certified roll. The roll is printed usually at the beginning of the year. that an election comes, as it did this year, in May. What takes place is this: Every electoral registrar throughout Australia has his printed roll in the form of a book. On one side is printed the list of names; on the other side is a blank sheet. A man comes in and claims to get a transfer. name is written on the blank, and that adds his name to the roll. The corresponding duty on the other side is performed when the officer gets a notice from the Chief Electoral Officer of. a State after the card scrutiny that that same name should be removed from the roll where it is printed. The officer then draws his pen through it . Prom that document, remodelled and altered from day to day, the certified rolls are printed.",59
295,Mr TUDOR,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The trouble is that plenty of persons who see the printed roll thiuk they are still on it , though their names may be struck off the certified roll. Plenty of persons have been struck off the certified roll who thought that their names were properly on the roll, and they have never had notice from the Department that they were objected to. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I have heard complaints of that kind, but to what extent what the honourable member complains of has occurred I do not know.  cases. Mr W . H . IRVINE - It maybe so, but we must have some machinery to enable the officers to strike off names.",59
296,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"There were 5,000 cases in East Sydney.",59
297,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Admittedl y it is a very difficult problem. Mr W . H . IRVINE - It is. All that I desire is that honourable members will at least give us credit for an honest attempt to meet the difficulty. If they can show us a better way than that which we have chosen, we are quite prepared to adopt it. The actual swelling of the roll is caused by the names that ought to have been removed remaining on the roll, and by the great number of transfers which remain uninvestigated for a considerable time. A p a r t altogether from fraudthere is no reason to suppose that, except in a few cases, there has been fraud-the system has undoubtedly given us a roll that has been swelled to a considerable extent. The question is : How are yon Suppose going to remedy it?",59
298,Mr WEBSTER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The swelling of the roll was clue to the novelty of the system, I think.",59
299,Mr WH IRVINE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"P a r t l y . The system is getting into better working order. There is no doubt about that. But yet there is that great defect in it His that immediately before an election great numbers of claims are made. In order to rectify the difficulty, the officers .point out, with a good deal of justice, that their powers only go a certain length. They cannot themselves examine into the facts of cases outside. They can only go by their own records. Beyond that, whether a man has l e ft a particular division, whether he ought any longer to be on the roll for that division, and, if not, what other roll he ought to be on, are questions of fact which the ordinary machinery of the Electoral Department cannot deal with at all. At present the Department has to rely entirely upon the police, who are supposed, to make inquiries. It is not part of the ordinary duty of the police. They are not the servants of the Commonwealth. They are not directly responsible to us. The duty which they perform in this regard is performed more as a matter of grace by the State authorities for the Federal authorities than anything else. They are not specially paid for this work, and we cannot expect that they will completely or accurately perform their duty in this connection. As a matter of fact, they do not.",59
300,Mr TUDOR,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,They do splendid work.,60
301,Mr IRVINE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I am not saying anything at all against the police. They are a very useful force. But we can hardly expect a Department whose members have other duties to perform to take up this irksome task-whic h does not fall directly within their functions-and to render thoroughly efficient service. The result is that their slight inefficiency causes a gradually accumulating excess of persons on the rolls whose names ought not to be there. On account of a public utterance of mine, the accusation has been levelled against me that in inviting political associations to aid the Department in this process of cleansing the rolls I was doing something wrong. I desire to say now that political associations and bodies which take the keenest interest in politics can alone help the Department in cleansing the rolls.",60
302,Mr SAMPSON,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"They have been of the greatest help to the Government of New Zealand. Mr W . BT. IRVINE - It is not as i we were introducing something which is new.  part of it . We have experienced it before. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I do not think that the honourable member full y understands my point. The present law provides that any person may object to the name of another person appearing on the rolls, but that he must first lodge a deposit of 5s. What is a still more serious bar, he incurs the possibility of having, to pay £ 5 costs if some Returning Officer who is not a judicial officer should, in the exercise of his discretion, decide that his objection is frivolous. The result is that objections by the public generally are absolutely unknown. Thus the cleansing of the roll has not been carried out. One provision in this Bill which will be a most valuable aid to the purification of the rolls is the abolition of the 5s. deposit, and of the possibility I have mentioned. Several Honorable MEMBERS - Oh , oh ! Mr W . H . IRVINE - Honourable members opposite seem to think that the right to lodge an objection to any name which appears on the roll is tantamount to a right to get that name removed from the roll. It is nothing of the kind. It is merely an intimation to the Department that there is a case which requires to be looked into. No Department would strike a name off the roll merely because it received an objection from any man, either with or without the 5s. deposit.",60
303,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,What is the procedure adopted 1 Mr W . H . IRVINE - The objectors notify the Department that there are a number of cases which require to be in quired into. It then becomes the duty of the Department to specifically direct the police bo make inquiries into tliose cases.,60
304,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Tha b work oughb to be done by a deparbmenbal officer, no matter at what cost, and not by a political partisan.",60
305,Mr WH IRVINE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The honourable member says that that work ought to be done by a departmental oflicer, no matter at what cost. If it can be done by a departmental officer it ought to be done by him, and I would remind the honourable member that in this Bill we take power for such an officer bo do ib, because one of its most important provisions ref lates to the appointment of electoral in spectors for the purpose of undertaking this very work.",60
306,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The Government would nol have struck out the provision providing for a deposit of 5s. if they had in tended to employ inspectors for that purpose. Mr W . H . IRVINE . ^ I can assure the honourable meinber that inspectors are to be appoinbed for that very purpose. But the honourable member does not supposethat we will appoint an army of electoralinspectors, equal in number to the police, in order to relieve the latter of their duty. We propose to appoint responsible electoral inspectors i u relation to each electoral division, and sometimes, if necessary, to portions of divisions. These officers will be charged with the responsibility of seeing that that work is done. What more can we do? If anything more can be suggested, and it is not beyond the means of the Treasurer, we are willing to undertake it .",60
307,Mr FENTON,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Why should the cost be considered ? We should make every effort to get a pure roll. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I quite agree with the honourable member. But we ought uot to appoint an army of inspectors.,60
308,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I understand that in formation oan be lodged now by any person, without that person being called upon to pay anything. Mr W . H . IRVINE - But that would uot be a formal objection under the Act. The Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth, and the Chief Electoral Officer in each State, are high officials charged with a serious responsibility, and they must be allowed to exercise some discretion. I say that they ought to be able to receive information from any source whatever as to defects in the roll.",61
309,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Are the inquiries in reference to objections to be held in open Court ?,61
310,Mr WH IRVINE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,No .,61
311,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,How is a person to whose name objection is taken to be notified of that objection? Mr W . H . IRVINE - He will be fied by communicating with the address which is given on the roll. How else can it be done?,61
312,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"What notice is to be given to him ] Mr W . H . IRVINE - He will be notified that his name is to be removed from the roll, but he will be given an opportunity to show cause why it should not be so removed. If we have high officials, we ought to entrust them with the responsibility of removing names from the roll, subject to an opportunity being afforded to the persons affected to show why their names should not be removed. An additional facility for purif y in g the roll is provided in this Bill . It has frequently been a subject of complaint that, no matter how active one may be, it is impossible to satisfy oneself that a mau has lef t the electoral division for which he is enrolled. One may know that he has left an electoral subdivision, but in the very large areas embraced in our electoral divisions it is impossible to assure oneself that he has left his division. Consequently, we have provided in the Bill that any person may lodge an objection to a man's name appearing on the roll on the ground that he has lef t the subdivision for which he is enrolled.",61
313,Mr RILEY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Is it proposed to notify the person to whose name objection is taken ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Certainly . come now to the other argument which has been adduced, namely, that the proposal in this Bill constitutes an attack on the secrecy of the ballot. This contention is mainly based on the provision which requires that the butts of ballot papers must be numbered and signed. Under the law as it now stands, it is impossible to set aside an election on the ground of fraud or personation, no matter how close the voting may have been, unless ib can be shown thab personation has been indulged in to an extent which has rendered it impossible for that election to be a true reflex of the will of the people. It has been put forward by the Department-and I think with a good deal of reason-that it is desirable in any perfect system of electoral law that the Court of Disputed Returns, which has ultimately to determine whether or not an election has been properly conducted, should be afforded an opportunity of identifying the votes which are notialleged to have been the subject of personation. Honourable members opposite may think there is too much danger in that.",61
314,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Potentially , every vote will be made open to inspection. Mr W . H . IRVINE - "" Potentially "" is a very wide word. I wish to show how very small is the possibility. Before the House rejects such a useful provision, and it is one which in some form or other exists in many countries, including some of the Australian States, such as Queensland  bheir names there. Mr W . H . IRVINE - W h e the r the particular mebhod which we have adopted in this Bill , after the fullest consultation with our responsible officers, is the best that can be devised is a matter for free and open consideration in Commitbee.",61
315,Mr JH CATTS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,I b is a very good job that the Governmenb are climbing down. Mr W . H . IRVINE - This proposal is absolutely free fro m any danger if it be properly administered. The only real difficulty about it is that it may cause considerable delay. It may make the conduct of elections somewhat more lengthy than it otherwise would be.,61
316,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"It is impossible to carry out. I Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable member is always prepared to pronounoe judgment before he has heard the evidence. Mr J. H. CATTS - Unde r Ecrutineer could track a vote. Mr W . H . IRVINE - If that be so, it is an absolute condemnation of the proposal. But I venture to think that it is not so. Mr J. H. CATTS - If watches the person signing the butt, takes the number of the ballot-paper, and watches for that number when the votes are being counted, he cannot avoid knowing how the elector voted. Mr W . H . IRVINE - There is no necessity for the number to be put on the front of the ballot-paper. members will see that this is a matter for regulation.",61
317,Mr BUHNS,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,That is worse still. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Some honourable members seem to think that every regulation framed by the Government will be framed with the intention of allowing fraud to be committed.,62
318,Mr KING OMALLEY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The r e are 70,000 people in Australia who cannot write. None of these would vote uncier this Bill, because they would not care to exhibit their ignorance. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I do not propose to enter into a detailed discussion of that clause at the present time. Every word of it , no doubt, will be made the subject of discussion in Committee, when honourable members will probably be full of suggestions. If they can suggest any better way of carrying out this necessary principle, again, I say, we are prepared to consider it and accept it , but I do not think that they will find any better way. It has been very carefully thought out, with the view of securing the necessary advantage of a possible identification by the ^ o u r t of Disputed Returns, while, at the same time, preventing the possibility of identification by scrutineers or other persons. The Minister himself has intimated that the object is to print the corresponding numbers on the back of the butt, and the ballot-paper, so that they may not be seen by any person. That is not expressly provided for in the Bill , but if that is a safe thing to do, and will still secure identification, there is no reason why it should not be done. In Queensland, I believe, the method is adopted of turning down the portion of the ballot paper on which the identifying number is, and gumming it . it, any Mr HUGHES - Eve n so, tliere is an objection to the delay, the congestion in the booth, the necessary hindrance to free voting. It will take some time to write one's name. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I have already a scrutineer intimated that that is not at all a reasonable objection to raise to any such provision. The question is whether the time which will be taken is not full y justified by the additional security you have for an absolutely clean vote, and for an effective scrutiny, and the necessary identification for that purpose. We shall have the fullest opportunity of discussing all Honourable these matters in Committee. So far as I can judge from the general tone of the debate, honourable members on the other side are looking for every evil motive that they can possibly impute to the Government in bringing in this measure. Their criticisms with regard to principles of policy involved in the Bill are criticisms to which nobody on this side can take exception; but where they point at every little clause and say there is in it an indication of fraud on the part of the Government, an indication of a desire to act corruptly, to do something wrong, that is a kind of argument which we cannot meet.",62
319,Mr HUGHES,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"We had no explanation of the Bill at all from the Honorary Minister. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The principle of postal voting is one which has been attacked on grounds which one does not like to characterize as insincere, but which certainly are entirely insufficient. It has been claimed that postal voting opens the door to fraud, and that there has been an abundance of proof of fraud having been perpetrated during the years in which the postal vote was in existence. That claim is ludicrous when one looks at the cases. The only instances which have been brought forward can be counted on the fingers of one's two hands, some not being proved, and others being of such a trifling character that they are not worth regarding when we consider the tens of thousands of people who have from time to time exercised the franchise in that way. Yet, when we venture to suggest that there haye been cases of personation in connection with the absent-voting system, which gives the fullest opportunities f o i fraud, whether exercised or not, the very honourable members who have broughl forward those cases say, "" You are accusing the whole people of Australia of f r a u d . "" The position is an absurd one. I do not intend to take up any more time at this stage. whole of these matters will be debated in Committee, and I hope that when that time comes, I shall have an opportunity of dealing with some of the objections which have been brought forward by interjection. ' Mr WEST (East Sydney) [10.5] - I feel confident that honourable members generally will agree with me that no more important piece of legislation could be brought before the House than an Electoral Bill . 1 honestly believe that honourable members on the other side have brought forward this Bill as a challenge to honourable members on this side with a view of trying to make it a test question at the next election. The Honorary Minister, in his introductory speech, gave us no grounds for the proposed alterations in the law, and the Attorney-General, I suppose, regards the measure as the greatest freak he has ever seen introduced into a Parliament. On all the main issues, on all those principles which are dear to honourable members on this side, the honourable and learned gentleman was very silent. It seems to me to be a piece of humour to ask honourable gentlemen on the other side to introduce a liberal Electoral Bill . I remember the days when I had to use the stump and the tar barrel for the purpose of getting adult suffrage in New South Wales, and when, in my boyhood, I assisted the Democrats in Hyde Park, London, in trying to get the lodgers' vote. I know how each of those reforms was complicated with technicalities. According to my reading of the history of the Conservative party, there are only four things which they think are essential to the progress of the country, namely, the Navy, the Military, the Police, and the Constitution. obtained those four things, the Conservatives tliink that they have done all that is necessary for the people. The right of the Democrats to the franchise, the improvement of industrial conditions, the factories law, the housing law, the educational law, have had to be fought for, and our opponents who sit on the opposite side represent those we had to fight. To suggest that we are likely to get from them a liberal election law is, I think, one of the greatest pieces of humour it is possible for a man to utter. We all know the history of the struggle to obtain the' secret hallot-the greatest blessing that has ever been conferred on mankind. The Mr BURNS - I draw attention to the state of the House. [Quorum, formed.]",62
320,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I am trying to impress upon the House what a piece of humour it is to expect from the honourable gentlemen who sit on the other side a liberal franchise, or an opportunity for the Democrats of Australia to f u l ly and freely record their votes. Our opponents do not want the Democracy to have control of Australia. Why did they fight us so bitterly at the last election ? Because the Democracy had got control of the reins of government, and had done something in the in terests of the masses, and vested interests had not got that service which was expected. If that was not the whole object of the Liberal party, what was there in the contest? Their whole aim was shown in a determined effort to eradicate the national sentiment, which ran through every act and deed of the Labour Government. In their efforts to remove that Government from office, the Liberals went so far as to tell deliberate falsehoods. I do not say that they were liars, but I do assert that they said that which was not the truth . The first contentious measure which the Liberal Government brought down to this House was this measure to alter the electoral law. Under the existing Act, at the last election, in some cases, 75 per cent, of the people voted, while in other cases 80 per cent, voted. What was wrong with that? At each succeeding Federal election, the percentage of voters has risen. When such a fine result is obtained, surely the Government have some other object in altering the electoral law than has been put before the House by the Honorary M i nister ! He told us that under the present Act there are possibilities of fraud. The Having Attorney-General did not tell us that fraud had been committed. What M i nisters want to make out is that there were possibilities for fraud. There is a possibility of honourable members on the other side being nothing else but frauds. I have as much right to make that remark as a Minister has to say that, under the present electoral system, there are possibilities of fraud. Tn introducing the Bill the Honorary Minister told us that '144,000 persons in Australia committed some misdemeanour or offence under the Electoral Act. He said that a large number of persons were brought up on charges of drunkenness, and that it ought to be worth their while to give an extra vote, or give a vote, and do their best for the Labour party. His remark aroused my anger, and I did, sir, that which perhaps was unruly, and caused you to rise from your chair, and use rather strong language to me. How could a Democrat like myself, representing Democrats as I do, sit down under the stigma that the persons said to have been under the influence of drink were amongst those who voted for the Labour party? However, I am not much worried about that accusation, because I honestly believe that those unfortunate brothers and sisters who have fallen by the way, and need a Christian to help them, will naturally turn to members of my party.",63
321,Mr RILEY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I beg to call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum, formed.']",64
322,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"When the Government announced this Bill it was thought that they would propose some improvements in the electoral law. As a matter of fact, the Bill is simply a challenge to the Opposition. In Great Britain, when there is a change of Government, the new Government recognise that their predecessors have been put in power.by the voice of the people, and that their legislation entitled to respect. This Government, however, with its magnificent majority of one, soke upon themselves to challenge the Opposition on principles that we deem vital. The present Government have no mandate to make the proposed radical alteration in the legislation of their predecessors. As a Democrat I , of course, desire that every one entitled to a vote shall have every facility afforded him to exercise that vote, and urge that the cost should be no impediment. And if the people are to vote, then, in the name of the Supreme Being, let the secrecy of the ballot be observed. Any electoral law that violates that secrecy cannot meet with the approval of an Australian Democrat; it is entirely at variance with the aims and ideas of those who exercise the franchise. I have had considerable experience during the last thirty or forty years in the work of an ' election agent, and, in my opinion, all the double-voting and other abuses we hear so much about are a mere myth. To indulge in such offences does not pay, and, therefore, they are not indulged in. I remember once "" having a lark "" by impersonating v. mayor of Sydney, a man who was much more popular than myself, but who was hardly known to any one. No harm was done in that case, because the mayor exercised his vote all right, but the next day the Sydney Morning Herald came out with a great story about the occurrence. Where are the abuses to justify 'he proposals of the Government? The Attorney-General pointed out that there was a larger number of persons on the roll than there should be. As a matter of fact, the roll which I obtained for the purposes of ' my election were fourteen months old, and were not accurate. We advised every person whose name did not appear to send in a card, whether they had done so previously or not, and the result was that 6,000 persons became entitled to vote. Under our present system the excess of names cannot be avoided, bnt omissions may be rectified up to the last day. I may inform honourable members that in the two months from the 31st May to the 31st July last, while the scrutiny was going on, I made inquiries as to the changes which had taken place in that period, and in one subdivision I found that out cf ninety-one hotels twenty-three is had changed hands, and the original owners hud left the district. In Blighstreet, where the Union Club is situated, there were not more than 270 votes, and yet we found that twenty-five of the electors had removed. Mr W. H . IHVINE - Did their names remain on the roll?",64
323,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Yes . Mr WH . IRVINE - There could not be a better proof of the necessity for investigation.,64
324,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I am as anxious as anybody that the rolls should be perfect, but the proposals of the Government are likely to cause injury. I think the Attorney-General will agree that it is better that a man's name should appear twice on the roll than that he should not have a vote as all.",64
325,Mr WH IRVINE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,I quite agree with that.,64
326,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The Attorney-General tells us that there are 500,000 changes of residence in Australia each year, and we ought not to pass a measure which wil l have the effect of assisting and keeping those persons off the roll. As to the deposit of 5s. on making an objection, I do not desire to be offensive in referring to honourable members opposite and their organization, but Mr W. H - IRVINE - The result of retaining the provision for that deposit would mean that only rich people could lodge an objection.",65
327,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"This is lovely! I do not blame the representatives of the Liberal League for going round and endeavouring ro get votes; but if they find that a person has moved from one street to another they lodge an objection. Tho elector has no opportunity of knowing that an objection is lodgod, and it is no use sending a notice to his address, for, while Australian electors do not shoot their landlords, they sometimes ""shoot the moon."" That is, they do a moonlight flitting. Another objection I have is that canvassers go round and mark the roll. I saw the roll marked by one of the scrutineers appointed by the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, and it was marked just as the roll was marked. by my scrutineer. Many people object to a name on the roll without being able to assign any reason for their objection, and I think that the provision in the existing law, that a sum of 5s. shall be deposited in respect of each objection, is a very one. It prevents many frivolous objections from being lodged. The power to lodge wholesale objections is a dangerous one when placed in the hands of an unscrupulous person.",65
328,Mr KELLY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"TJndo r this Bill an objection must be signed before a highlyplaced official; and any person other than an official who, without reasonable cause, signs an objection, is liable to a penalty of £ 5 .",65
329,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I am quite aware of that; but it is too late to take action after election haa been held. What we need to do is so to frame our electoral machinery as to give no opportunity to designing persons to prevent electors from rightfully exercising the franchise. In that little cellar in Pitt-street, of which honourable members opposite know, some [51] very funny things are done. Some of the greatest humbugs and the biggest political rascals in the world are to be found there. The Honorary Minister knows to whom I am referring. I am given to understand that the Prime Minister will agree to leave being, granted me to continue my remarks tomorrow.",65
330,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,It is too early yet to adjourn.,65
331,Mr FRAZER,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Then I think we ought to haye a quorum. [Quorum formed.],65
332,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I have been trying ever since I saw this Bill to learn what motive actuates the Government in endeavouring to prevent a general election taking place on a Saturday. We had no explanation of this matter from either the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs or the Attorney General. Saturday is a suitable and convenient day for all persons to go to the polling booth. A man and a woman with a family cannot leave home together to record their votes; but Saturday, being a universal half-holiday, a husband is able, after recording his vote, to take a turn at looking"" after the little ones while the wife exercises the franchise. It is all very well for those who have servants and motor-cars,, and all the opportunities that wealth provides, to say that any day of the week will,do; but it seems to me that this proposal on the part of the Government is one of those darts with which they wish to stab honourable members on thiB side of the House.",65
333,Mr AGAB WYNNE,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"When the election takes place on a Saturday, it spoils the wise attendance at all our football matches.",65
334,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I am a keen lover of sport, and, if I could afford it , I , like the Postmaster-General, would go to the races; but I cannot.",65
335,Mr KELLY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Does not the honourable member see that the Saturday provision to which he refers offends the susceptibilities of quite a number of persons in his electorate 1,65
336,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I am glad that the honourable member has referred to that matter. My initials are "" J . E . W . , "" and I prethe sume that the honourable member is alluding to the Jewish section of the community. . I - would remind him, however, that the Jewish Sabbath closes at 6 p.m.; and that it was to meet the convenience of the Jewish section of the community that the hours pf polling were extended until 8 p.m.",65
337,Mr KELLY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Why give a Jew only two hours in which to vote, while the rest of the community have twelve?",66
338,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"I think a good many of my Jewish friends are patriotic enough, if necessary, to vote earlier in the day. If the Government could prove that Saturday is an undesirable day",66
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,The trouble is t h at we cannot prove anything to the satisfaction of honourable members opposite.,66
340,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The Government cannot prove that they are any good. I think that we ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.] The holding of the last general election on a Saturday proved both convenient and satisfactory. Saturday is set apart as polling day in South Australia, and I am sure that the Minister of External Affairs does not object to it . I am at a loss to account for the action of the Government in this respect. Coming to the question of the freedom of the press, I do not think that the Ministry are really sincere in their statements regarding the press "" gag."" read the daily press must admit that during the last general election they had every facility for publishing electoral news and articles bearing on the election. All that the existing law requires is that during the progress of an election any article dealing with political questions shall be signed by the writer. An y person writin g in the public press on matters reflecting upon any party ought to be prepared to sign his name; and an article to which a man does not care to append his signature because, perhaps, it is a fabrication or a distortion of facts, ought not to be published in a reputable journal. The daily newspapers gave the Liberal party very great support. In Great Britain the Times, the Morning Post, the Daily News, and like journals, always give the largest amount of space to the reports of speeches of members of the Government, no matter to what party they belong, because they look upon the Government as being responsible for the administration of the affairs of the country, and the Opposition, being irresponsible, gets less space. B n t what do we find here ? Let me take-as an example the issues, of the Sydney Daily Telegraph from the 12th to the 31st May. In that period, the leaders of the Government party were given 36 f t . 10 in . of space, and members of the then Opposition got 133 f t . 6 in ., or 350 per cent. more. What is true of the D a i l y Telegraph may be said of all the - other daily newspapers in Australia.",66
341,Mr KELLY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,Will the honourable member confess that the Labour newspapers did not print a single speech delivered by a Libera] 1,66
342,Mr WEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The Labour newspapers are very small' sheets, limited in"" their circulation. I trust that the day will come when both sides will have their views properly reported in journals of their own. In no other part of the world where parties are BO evenly divided as they are here are all the daily newspapers on the one side.",66
343,Mr OBCHAKD,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"Would , the Worker give space to a special article contributed by a Liberal ?",66
344,Mr WJEST,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"The Worker is a weekly theet, which goes to members of the association. It cannot be compared with a daily newspaper.",66
345,Mr KELLY,INCAPACITATED OR ILLITERATE,"If it ceased to be so partisan it would get a bigger circulation. Those who Mr WEST - It would do the honourable member no harm to read it . But , with leave of the House, I shall continue my - speech when the Bill is next before us. Leave granted; debate adjourned. House adjourned at 10.48 p.m.",66
