1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., prayers. WAR EXPENDITURE . COMMITTEE. Mr M'OBGAN - I ask the Prime Minister whether or not, when investigations by the War Expenditure Committee disclose fraud against the Commonwealth, the committee has the authority to act promptly to bring the culprits to justice and protect the interests of the Commonwealth. If not, will the right honourable gentleman state on whose responsibility either criminal or civil action may be instituted? '",4
2,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"The War Expenditure Committee has no authority to institute legal proceedings against anybody. Its authority is solely to report to me and to the Parliament. The law officers of the Commonwealth institute whatever investigation may be warranted by matters disclosed in the reports of the committee. If they believe that a prima facie case has been established, they tender an appropriate recommendation to the 'Attorney-fGeneTal. I have no doubt that the law would he invoked in circumstances which warranted such action. NA WAR.",4
3,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Will the Minister for Repatriation state whether or not the Government is making special provision for the repatriation in civil life of Australian prisoners of war who may shortly 1>e returning to this country? In view of the lengthy - period of imprisonment they have undergone, is it not likely that very great difficulties may have to be overcome in this regard? If the matter has not yet .been dealt with, will the honourable gentleman give consideration to it at an early date?",4
4,Mr FROST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"When Australian prisoners of war return to this country, they will again come under the control of the Army, and those suffering from dia' abilities will eventually pass to the control of the Department of Repatriation. All arrangements have been made for their re-establishment in civil life. and read BED CROSS BECBEATION HUT, GREENSLOPES.",4
5,Mr CONELAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Las t week, I asked the Minister for the Army whether or not he had conferred with the Minister for Repatriation in regard to the erection of a Bed Cross recreation hut on a suitable site at the 112th Australian General Hospital, Greenslopes. Has the matter yet been dealt with ? MT. FOBDE - Since my return from Brisbane, I have had a conference with my colleague, the Minister for Repatriation, and with Mr Richardson, chairman of - the War Service Homes Commission. Three blocks of land adjacent to the 112th Australian General Hospital, Greenslopes, just across Mary-street, are to .be made available as a site for a Bed Cross recreation hut. Steps will be taken by th6 Department of the Army, in collaboration with the Department of the Interior, to implement this decision. 1939-43 STAB.",4
6,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The Minister for Air will have noticed that the Minister for the Army intends to adjust anomalies in connection with the issue of the 1939-43 Star. Hundreds of members of the Air Force have been omitted from consideration in connection with the award of this decoration. I refer to men who served in Britain. . Many of them became casualties, and discrimination has been practised against them because they are not members of air crews. Will the .honourable gentleman ensure that the consideration of their eligibility will be equal to that extended to men who have had service in New Guinea and the Middle ' East?",4
7,Mr DBAKEFORD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I have not read the statement of the Minister for the Army, .but I assure .the honourable member that consideration has been given to the award of this decoration to airmen who have served in certain areas. The point that he has now raised will be taken into account by my department. NA SCHOOL-BOYS.",4
8,Mr HARRISON,INTERSTATE TRAVE L BY,I ask the Attorney General whether or not he authorized the Minister for Transport to announce to the House last Tuesday that prosecutions would be instituted against four Geelong Grammar school-boys ? Is the right honourable gentleman aware that this morning the press published a statement by the Minister for Transport that the Attorney General and his department had not seen the files in the case before the right able gentleman announced last night that these prosecutions would not be instituted ? Does he not regard this statement as a deliberate public slur on his department?,5
9,Dr EVATT,INTERSTATE TRAVE L BY,"My colleague, the Minisuniform ter for Transport, made a statement of the facts, and then added that he had authorized a prosecution. . As I to the House yesterday, the authority to consent to a prosecution is vested by the law solely in the Attorney-General and officers specially authorized by him. Yesterday, the Solicitor-General received some reports in this case, including the report that had been made by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, the House, and other information from the Department of Transport. He made certain recommendations on the facts, and in relation to the law. In view of the special circumstances of the case, including the consideration that school-boys were concerned, I considered it best give a decision at once, and I announced it at once.",5
10,Mr HAYLEN,INTERSTATE TRAVE L BY,"Will the Minister for Transport consider the desirability of making special travel facilities available to all scholars during school vacations, was done on behalf of certain pupils of Geelong Grammar School? . Mr Ward - The matter of air travel does not concern my department, and I am consequently unable to deal with the provision of special air-travel facilities enabling the sons of a few privileged people to travel round the countryside. However, I consider that whatever restricaccommodation tions are imposed should be applied .uniformly. Special provision ought not to he made for the scholars at any school, solely because their fathers happen to be influential members of the munity or because the fathers of some exscholars hold influential positions. I have not yet received from my departmental officers « report covering the whole of this incident. When I receive it, I shall consider what recommendations I should make in order to ensure the uniform application of whatever restrictions may be imposed. Some members of the community have been seriously inconvenienced by reason of their inability to travel at will, or to honorreturn to their homes. I have in mind particularly men who arc employed by,the Allied Works Council, and thewives and mothers of men who are serving in the forces. I shall certainly consider the matter further, with a view to ensuring application of the restrictions and the avoidance of differential treatment in the enjoyment of whatever special explained facilitiesmay be provided.",5
11,Mr MCEWEN,INTERSTATE TRAVE L BY,"Does the Prime Minister consider that the national security authority vested in the Government by the Parliament is properly exercised if citizens of this country, whether school-boys or not, having legally moved from one State to another, arc prevented to from returning to their home States at a time when accommodation is available on interstate trains, without finding themselves involved in a breach of the law?",5
12,Mr CURTIN,INTERSTATE TRAVE L BY,"In the circumstances supposed by the honourable member I to should say that it would be quite unreasonable if citizens of Australia who had lawfully - moved from one State to another, and desired to return - to the State from which they had lawfully departed, were prohibited from availing themselves of train accommodation which as could be used without varying the reguthe lations. I say quite frankly that the purpose of the transport restrictions is, not to prevent members of the public from travelling, but to ensure that train accommodation will be available for those whose business is of greatest national moment; there may be other persons, whose business is less important, for whom cannot be provided. Cognizance must be taken of the fact that the travelling facilities available are not equal to .the demand; consequently, the calls that are made upon it must be comexamined in some order of priority.",5
13,Mr ANTHONY,INTERSTATE TRAVE L BY,Did the Minister for Transport issue a statement to today's press,6
14,Mr SPEAKER,INTERSTATE TRAVE L BY,That question has already been asked.,6
15,Mr ANTHONY,INTERSTATE TRAVE L BY,It is not the same question.,6
16,Mr SPEAKER,INTERSTATE TRAVE L BY,"I have ruled that the question has been asked. Moreover, it is competent for the Chair to rule that a sufficient number of questions has heen asked on any subject.",6

25,Mr CURTIN,INTERSTATE TRAVE L BY,"I am sure that the honourable member for Richmond has every desire to respect the rules and procedure of this House, and also your authority, Mr Speaker. I ask the honourable member, having regard to what is requisite in this place, to express regret for what has occurred, so that the matter may end there.",6

41,Mr FADDEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Hav e you received a notice of motion from me, Mr Speaker?",7
42,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - Yes . It is entirely out of order. The right honourable gentleman has notified that he proposes to move the adjournment of the House to discus3 my ruling. A ruling can be discussed only on a substantive motion, and not on a motion for the adjournment of the House. Mr FADDEN; (Darling Downs-Leade r of the Australian Country party) [3.0]. 41 - I accordingly move That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the moving of a motion of no confidence in Mr Speaker. I do so because it is a matter of national, importance Mr SPEAKEiR - Order ! The right honourable gentleman must hand in his motion in writing. He may only state the reasons for suspending the Standing Orders and may not discuss any other matter.",7
43,Mr FADDEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,I tender my motion in writing.,7
44,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,I have received from the right honourable gentleman a written motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders to permit of a motion of no confidence in Mr Speaker.,7
45,Mr FADDEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"I take this action, because the matter is of national importance, having regard to the incidents that have just occurred in the House. I desire the suspension of the Standing Orders in order that honourable members may give consideration to your action in denying the honourable member for Eichmond (Mr Anthony) the right to ask a question, and also your denial to honourable members of the right to raise and discuss a point of order.",7
46,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,Order ! .The right honourable gentleman may only give reasons for the suspension of the Standing Orders and may not give details of his proposed subsequent motion.,8
47,Mr FADDEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"My reason for moving for the suspension of the Standing Orders is your denial of the right of the honourable member for Richmond to ask a question when you did not know what the question was or was likely to be, and also your denial to members on this side of the House to raise and discuss points of order. The honourable member for Richmond rose to ask a question and before you had heard five words you ruled him out of order.",8
48,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,Order ! The honourable member is again canvassing the merits of a proposed subsequent motion.,8
49,Mr FADDEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,Tou r action was a definite violation of the privileges orable members and the Standing Orders of the House.,8
50,Mr WHITE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Balaclava) [3.4] - I intended to ask the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) a question. I was not aware whether the question that the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) tried, to ask was the one that I intended to ask.",8
51,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,Order ! The honourable member is canvassing a prospective question.,8
52,Mr WHITE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"I cannot see that I am. Mr SPEAKER, - The honourable member must state why the Standing Orders should be suspended.",8
53,Mr WHITE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,You may have apprehended what the honourable member for Richmond intended to say.,8
54,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,Order !,8
55,Mr WHITE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"This Australian Parliament is the only place wherein the representatives of the people can seek information from Ministers. You did not give the honourable member for Richmond an opportunity to ask his question. Therefore, I disagree with your ruling and support the motion. [CO] Mr 'SPEAKER - Order ! The honourable member can say all that on a subsequent motion if this motion should be carried.",8
56,Mr WHITE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,I have already said it.,8
57,Mr MENZIES,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [3.6] - The question before the Chair is that the Standing Orders be suspended to eniaible a motion to be made relating to the conduct of the Chair. I am not going to discuss the particular incident which gave rise to this motion, because I cannot do so at this stage, but I do say to honourable members on both sides of the House that any question which involves the decision of the Chair is not only one of first-class importance in a deliberative assembly, but also one of very great urgency. It is not a matter which should be allowed to rest. It should not be allowed to give rise to running discontent. It is a matter which should be disposed of in the interests of everybody with the greatest promptitude. For that reason, I hope that the Government will accept this motion in order that the whole matter may be disposed of before of hon- these proceedings end.",8
58,Mr CURTIN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Fremantle - Prime Minister and Minister for Defence) [3.8] - I address myself to the argument of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies). Standing Order 287 prescribes the procedure whereby action may be taken in the event of objection being taken to a ruling of Mr Speaker. The standing order readsIf any objection is taken to the ruling or decision of the Sneaker, such objection must be taken at once, and in writing, and motion made, which, if seconded, shall be proposed to the House, and debate thereon forthwith adjourned .to the next sitting day. That means that the motion must be made and seconded immediately after Mr. Speaker's ruling has been given. Mr M!ENZIES - I had that very standing order in mind when I suggested that the Standing Orders should be suspended because that standing order does not permit of debate on the motion until the following day, and, in the interests of every one, including Mr Speaker, this matter should be disposed of now.",8
59,Mr CURTIN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"The Standing Orders were devised by our predecessors. They conform with those of the House of Commons. This standing order was devised so that debate on the ruling of Mr. Speaker would he postponed until heated feelings, which perhaps would prompt mistaken judgments, had cooled. It was considered by the framers of the Standing Orders that consideration as to whether Mr Speaker's rulings should be upset or confirmed should be adjourned until the following day. The right honourable gentleman says that we should deal with this matter now. My point is that Parliament itself, over a long period, has prescribed as the most suitable occasion on which to debate Mr Speaker's ruling the day after the ruling has been given. The Leader of the Australian Countiy party (Mr Eadden) has moved for the suspension of the Standing Orders in order to do now what the Standing Orders say should be done at the next sitting. I quite agree that urgent matters affecting administration can be dealt with more expeditiously than the Standing Orders prescribe, but I consider that it would be a cardinal mistake to set aside the procedure laid down by the Standing Orders to determine whether Mr Speaker's ruling should be confirmed or dissented from.",8
60,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Barker) [3.13] - I have witnessed many occasions on which motions for the suspension of the Standing Orders have been made, but never an occasion before on which it was deemed necessary that the maker and supporters of the motion should state why the Standing Orders should be suspended. However, I do that now. The motion made by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Eadden) is not a motion of disagreement with Mr. Speaker's ruling. It is a motion that the Standing Orders be suspended to enable him to make a motion of no confidence in Mr Speaker. I recall a precedent for this. The Prime Minister (Mr Curtin), when he was Leader of the Opposition, moved a vote of no confidence in the Chairman of Committees.",9
61,Mr CURTIN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,But I did so upon notice.,9
62,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"I know. I nm about to refer to that. There is a distinction between the two cases. In the onu case, the motion concerned the Chairman of Committees; but, in this case, it concerns Mr Speaker. I am quite sure that the intention of the Leader of the Australian Country party is to challenge, not Mr Speaker's ruling, but his partiality, good sense and judgment. Those are matters which should not be left until tomorrow, but should be decided on the spot, after due debate. We have witnessed this afternoon the naming and suspension of two honourable members. It would be quite easy for others to be named. I am quite satisfied with the name my parents gave me. In no sense is this a motion of disagreement with Mr Speaker's ruling. This is far deeper and far graver than that, for the motion challenges the partiality, good sense and, virtually, the honesty of the Chair. Having that in view, I said to the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) as he left the chamber, after his suspension, that he should consult Speaker Lenthall's ghost.",9
63,Mr SPENDER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Warringah) [3.15] I support the motion. This is not in any real sense a challenge to a ruling of the Chair. It is an endeavour, because of certain events to which I cannot refer, to express our lack of confidence in Mr. Speaker's impartiality in discharging his important duties. But even if objection were being taken ,lo a ruling, the reasons given by the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) would have no application to this particular case. The Standing Orders provide for cases of emergency. When a matter of urgency arises, the Standing Orders may be suspended on a motion, duly moved and seconded, without notice. There is an important reason why the motion submitted by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Eadden) should be accepted by the Government. This is not a party matter; at affects the undoubted right of a. private member, at a time when practically all authority is vested in the executive, to question Ministers on matters of national and public importance. This afternoon, that right has been denied to honourable members by a display of partiality by the Chair. Consequently, members of 1ht» Opposition seek to challenge the manner in which Mr Speaker has discharged his duties by submitting a motion of no confidence in the Chair. I cannot understand why, in those circumstances, the Government does not facilitate a debate on the subject.",9
64,Mr MCEWEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"lndi) [3.17] - The motion submitted by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) will provide honourable members with an opportunity to give reasons why, following recent occurrences in this chamber, the House should express its lack of confidence in the Chair. The Chair performs a simple, but tremendously important, ""function, namely, to ensure that, within the limits prescribed by the Standing Orders, the elected representatives of the people shall be given an opportunity to perform their parliamentary duties. Honourable members have the right in this chamber to state their views and to claim that certain action should or should not be taken, and within the limits of the Standing Orders, to seek information from Ministers. The honourable member for Eichmond (Mr Anthony) rose in his place and attempted to ask a question. That was quite proper.",10
65,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Order ! The honourable member is now canvassing the merits of what will be a subsequent motion, and the Chair will not permit it.",10
66,Mr MCEWEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"I do not desire to infringe your ruling, Mr Speaker. I am merely seeking some room for manmuvre for the purpose of stating reasons why honourable members should be given an opportunity to express their lack of confidence in your ruling. We cannot do so without examining the functions of the Chair and the rights of honourable members. An honourable member has the right to stand in his place and ask a question, just as a Minister has the right to reply or to refuse to reply to it. The honourable member for Richmond attempted to ask a question.",10
67,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,Order ! The honourable member is now canvassing whether my ruling was correct.,10
68,Mr MCEWEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"I am not. When you interrupted me, I was stating a fact and I claim that, speaking to this motion, I am in order in relating the facts of recent occurrences. The honourable member for Richmond attempted to address a question to a Minister. I know, from what he told me, that the nature of the question"" was different from what the Chair presupposed. Now, the Chair is human and is capable of making an error of judgment. But an error of judgment - must not be permitted to nullify the rights of honourable members. No more serious calamity could come upon us than a curtailment of the rights of private members as the result of a ruling by the Chair. The practices in parliaments arise in two ways, first, from decisions of the Parliament itself, as contained in the Standing Orders, and secondly, and even more importantly, from precedent. A precedent which may be established on this occasion is that the Chair shall be regarded as possessing the gift of second sight.",10
69,Mr FADDEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,Clairvoyant .,10
70,Mr MCEWEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Mr Speaker will be regarded as being able to read in an honourable member's mind the question that he intends to ask. If , in the opinion of the Chair, the question should not be asked, Mr Speaker will have the right to order the honourable member to resume his seat. That occurred this afternoon. It would be a complete negation of the democratic system of government and of those principles of freedom about which so many words were uttered on a thousand platforms during recent months, if an honourable member, upon an imagined interpretation of what he intends to say, can be ordered by the Chair to resume his seat, and upon his claiming the right to express himself, be suspended from the service of the House. The second point which justifies an examination of the question whether the Chair, as the result of its recent decisions, is entitled to retain the confidence of the House, arises from the fact that this afternoon an honourable member rose in his place and said, "" Mr Speaker, I rise to order."" The Standing Orders clearly provide that at any time an honourable member may rise in his place and state a point of order. When he has done so, Mr. Speaker shall uphold or reject it. Again, there can be no more serious infringement of the rights of honoraible members, nor can anything be more calculated to change the course of parliamentary discussion than to deny to an honourable member the right to question a decision of the Chair by taking a point of order. These are circumstances which not only justify a discussion on the motion of which notice has been given by the Leader of the Australian Country party, but also make it imperative that the Government shall lend the assistance of its authority to facilitate an immediate debate. This afternoo.n,_the House was to debate tremendously important business with far-reaching domestic, financial and international implications. Must we con- sequent motion. duct that debate in the atmosphere of an impending motion that the House lacks confidence in the Chair? Surely, that would be >a completely wrong, improper and unjustifiable course for the Government itself fo permit, and I am surprised that the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) has not already said: ""The impartiality of the presiding officer been challenged, and the Government will facilitate a debate on the subject."" Although, the outcome, I fear, would not be in doubt, the Government should per- House. mit the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable honourable members to debate the motion.",10
71,Mr HARRISON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"-Wentworth) [3.26], - This motion challenges, not the ruling of the Chair, but the right of Mr. Speaker to occupy it. The Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Eadden) has moved for the suspension of the Standing Orders in order to give the House an opportunity to debate a motion of no confidence in Mr .Speaker. Mr. Speaker occupies his position because House believed that he would impartially interpret the Standing Orders. The only method .by which an honourable member may signify his lack of confidence in the impartiality of the Chair is to move the suspension of the Standing Orders. This matter strikes at the root of parlia- order. mentary procedure. If honourable members have no confidence in the iChair",11
72,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Order ! On the motion for the suspension of the Orders, the honourable member miay not discuss the merits of the motion of no confidence in the Speaker.",11
73,Mr HARRISON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,Honourable members elected Mr Speaker in the belief that he would impartially interpret the Standing Orders.,11
74,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,Order ! That has nothing to do with the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders.,11
75,Mr HARRISON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"The House is debating a motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders in order to allow honourable members to discuss a motion of no confidence in the Chair. This is a matter of the gnavest importance, aud the culmination of a series of incidents in this House. Mr SPEAKER, - Order!

79,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Order ! It is most difficult when the sword of Damocles is suspended over one's head to restrict the debate; but I cannot allow honourable the members on either side of the House to canviass in any way on the present motion the merits of a .possible subsequent motion.

82,Mr HARRISON,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"I consider that I have the right to ask for ;a direction from the Chair. I regard this motion as being of the utmost importance not only to the political parties represented in this House, but also to every honourable member. If we are not afforded the right to discuss the substantive motion which the Leader of the Australian Country party desires to move, we shall be prevented from doing the work we were sent here to do. We shall be deprived of the right to express our opinions, and so will not be able to fulfil our functions as representatives of the electors. A decision which would have that effect would strike right at the roots of Parliamentary practice .and, in fact, of democratic rights.

85,Mr ABBOTT,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"New England) [3.32j. - I support the motion, for I consider that it is essential to debate, without delay, any complaint that may have been lodged against the conduct of the Chair.

The importance of the Speakership eannot be discussed on this motion.",12

87,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,The honourable member is still out of order.,12
88,Mr ABBOTT,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"When the authority of the presiding officer of this House is impugned in any way whatsoever, I do not consider that the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) should attempt to prevent the matter from being discussed immediately. The right honourable gentleman referred to a particular standing order which supported his contention. I direct attention to Standing Order 407, which readsIn cases of urgent necessity, any standing or sessional order, or orders of the House, may bo suspended for the day's sitting, on motion, duly made and seconded without notice. It ill became the Prime Minister, who has a wide knowledge of the Standing Orders, to fail to mention Standing Order 407, hut to spend his time in telling us a long story about the practice of the House of Commons. I submit that we are entitled to an immediate opportunity to discuss a matter which affects our rights as members of the Parliament and which, in fact, brings into question that fundamental consideration of democracy, freedom of speech and expression, which the Minister for Information (Mr Oalwell) is attempting to suppress outside of this chamber by attacks upon the newspapers.",12

90,Sir EARLE PAGE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Cowper) [3.35]. - Althoug h the Prime Minister has said that the .substantive motion which the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) desires to move could be debated tomorrow, by moving dissent from Mr Speaker's ruling, unique circumstances exist which make it desirable that the subject shall be dealt with at once. There should be no delay in coming to a decision when the privileges of honourable members are threatened. Ever since the establishment of this Parliament, 44 years ago, it has been the practice for honoraible members, at the beginning of each sitting day, to ask questions without notice. I understand that this practice is not recognized in the Standing Orders. In fact, one of the reasons for revising the Standing Orders",12
91,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,Order ! The right honourable member is sufficiently conversant with the Standing Orders to know that he cannot canvass that subject on this motion.,12
92,Sir EARLE PAGE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,I am replying to the point made by the Prime Minister. The asking of questions without notice is integral to our parliamentary system.,12
93,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,Order! I have already ruled that the right honourable member may not discuss that subject.,13
94,Sir EARLE PAGE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"I desire to submit, sir, that if the right to ask questions without notice be denied to honourable members",13
95,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Order ! The right honourable member is obviously defying the ruling of the Chair. He cannot, at this stage, deliver a lecture to the House or to the Chair on the reasons why questions without notice have become the practice of this House. That has nothing to do with the motion before the Chair, which is, whether the Standing Orders should be suspended to allow a certain subject to be discussed. Any debate at this stage must be confined to that question.",13
96,Sir EARLE PAGE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"I am endeavouring to reply to a point raised by the Prime Minister, who stated that, according to the Standing Orders, the substantive motion of the Leader of the Australian Country party could be debated tomorrow. As the Prime Minister was allowed to submit his case, I consider that I should be allowed to state my reply.",13
97,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Order ! The right honourable gentleman is reflecting upon the Chair. The Prime Minister made no reference whatever to questions. He stated that the purpose which the Leader of the Australian Country party has in mind could be achieved in two ways, either by the method now proposed to be adopted, or by the giving of notice of his intention to move a motion of dissent from my ruling or of no confidence in the Chair.",13
98,Sir EARLE PAGE,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"I desire to submit reasons, why the first alternative should be adopted. If the second alternative were chosen honourable members would be prevented from asking questions, until the motion had been dealt with, for it would take .precedence over other business on the day on which it was listed. I . suggest, therefore, that the matter should be disposed of immediately. It is necessary, of course, for dissent from a ruling to be indicated immediately, which, in itself, shows that there is urgency in the matter. I consider that if the procedure suggested by the Prime Minister be adopted the rights of private members to ask might disappear entirely.

Question so resolved in the negative. PRIVILEGE.",13
99,Mr MCEWEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"lndi) [3.45] - I raise a question of privilege under Standing Order 111, which readsAn urgent motion directly concerning the privileges of the House shall take precedence over other motions as well as orders of the day. I shall conclude with a m o t i o n involving privilege. The question that I raise touches the r i g h t s of honourable members in this Parliament. In order to consider ihose rights, we must have in our minds a clear picture of the circumstances in which this Parliament came to ihe constituted, the nature of its functions, and how those functions are performed, by honourable members. The purpose of the Parliament is to give effect to the Australian Constitution, under which it was established as the supreme legislative authority in the Commonwealth. Prom its deliberations and decisions emerge all those matters which affect the safety and security of the nation, as well as the rights and freedoms of the people. The Parliament is composed of honourable members who have been elected to it in accordance with the law to represent their respective constituencies, and its functions are discharged deliberatively. The rules that govern debate are contained in the Standing Orders. The democratic structure embodying the rights of the people is affected by decisions concerning their livelihood and the security of the nation as a whole. Fair government can be assured only if full opportunity be given to those who have ibeen elected to act in accordance with the rights conferred on them by the Standing Orders, which are modelled substantially on those of the mother of all parliaments, the House of Commons. The Parliament functions on a party basis. The party which has the majority of members in this chamber composes the Executive, which in time of war is clothed by the Parliament wdth almost unlimited authority to act without reference to the Parliament. Members of another party or of other .parties compose the minority in the Parliament, and upon them devolves the duty and responsibility of safeguarding the interests of the people, by examining acts of the Government, and, so far as security permits, bringing to the light of day >all matters which they consider ought to be ventilated. The present system will continue to function only so long as the deliberations of this assembly are presided over by a Chair which exercises the utmost impartiality as between the majority and the minority representation, and gives decisions that are beyond question, safeguarding at .all times the individual rights of the representatives of the people. privilege ? The Standing Orders place well-defined limits on the length and subject-matter of the speeches that may be made from time to time, and the occasions on and frequency with which an honourable member may address the Chair. The sole function of the Chair is to ensure that the deliberations of the assembly shall be conducted in an orderly manner and in conformity with the Standing Orders. For the Chair to arrogate to itself the right to interpret the intention of an honourable member before he has said sufficient to disclose his mind would be not only to infringe completely the rights of honoraible members, but also to negate the whole system of government. The question of privilege to which I direct attention relates to a recent decision of the Chair. An honourable member, in accordance with established practice, rose to address a question to a Minister upon a matter which had arisen from an executive act that had been performed under the canopy of .the National Security Act. The Chair assumed the responsibility of deciding that the honourable member intended to ask a question that already had been answered and was, for some reason, improper. Perhaps that is not the most important basis upon which the rights of honourable .members could be limited or denied. Traditionally in British parliarments, the rights of members have been secured through the ages only as the result of continuous struggle. That those rights, and through their exercise the privileges of the people, will remain safe only so long as unceasing watch is maintained over them, is beyond question.",13
100,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,I invite the honourable gentleman now to state his question of privilege.,14
101,Mr MCEWEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"The question of privilege is that an honourable member is entitled to ask ,a question and, concurrently, to raise a .point of order. Under the comprehensive system of rules which govern the debates in this House, many decisions have been made by the Chair. Surely it is not claimed that on every occasion the 'Chair, in the different persons who have occupied it",14
102,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"Is the honourable gentleman satisfied that in his most recent, remarks he has stated his question of",14
103,Mr MCEWEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"I am not. Mr .SPEAKER-So far, he has not touched on a question .of privilege. I have been very generous in the forbearance that I have shown towards him.",15
104,Mr MCEWEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"I propose to deal with two separate questions of privilege. One arose from the decision of the Chair to forbid an honourable member to conclude a question, and the other from its refusal to hear further an honoraible member who rose in his place and said merely: "" Mr Speaker, a point of order."" Mr SPEAKER,-If those are the only grounds on which the question of privilege is raised, I am sorry that I have to rule the honoraible member out of order, because no question of privilege is involved. If the honourable member so desires, he has means for testing the ruling of the Chair.",15
105,Mr MCEWEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,Then I must ask the Chair a question.,15
106,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"The Chair does not propose to be catechized. I have ruled that there is no question of privilege, and that the honourable gentleman is out of order.",15
107,Mr MCEWEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,In rising to speak to a question of privilege,15
108,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. I have ruled that the reasons he has advanced do not constitute a matter of privilege.,15
109,Mr MCEWEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,Will the Chair hear my motion ?,15
110,Mr SPEAKER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,That would not alter the position.,15
111,Mr MCEWEN,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"A m I to understand that I am not entitled to suibmit a motion? Mr SPEAKER, - The honourable gentleman is to understand that I have ordered him to resume his seat.",15
112,Mr SPENDER,WANT OF CONFIDENCE I N,"I rise to a point of order. Is not a question of privilege involved when an honourable member seeks to enforce a right, either on his own 'behalf or on .behalf of another honourable member? Secondly, does not the determination of privilege ultimately rest with this House, irrespective of iany standing order? If so, on what ground does the Chair refuse to hear the motion of the honourable .member for lndi? Mr SPEAKER,- I have stated that it is not necessary for the Chair to give reasons for its ruling unless' it so desires. The honourable gentleman does not suffer from any physical defect which would have prevented his hearing what I said to the honourable member for lndi. The matter has been ruled out of order. If any honourable member disagrees with my ruling, he has his remedy. NA BILL 1944. Message recommending appropriation reported. In committee (Consideration of Administrator's message) : Motion (by Mr Lazzarini) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an aet to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Ecvenue Fund a sum for war pensions. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr Lazzarini and Mr Chifley do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Mr Lazzarini, and read a first time. - SECOND READING. MI \ LAZZARINI (Werriwa-Minister for Home Security) [4.3] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this measure is to provide £12,000,000 out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the payment of war pensions. The bill is similar to others submitted to Parliament from time to time for the purpose of appropriating an amount from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for .payment into a trust account to enable pensions to be paid at rates - which have already been approved hy Parliament. The balance of appropriation now remaining is sufficient only to meet .pension payments during the present month. Expenditure on war pensions during the present year is estimated at £11,900,000. The expenditure last year was £11,004,000. The additional expenditure is due to the increase of the number pensioners arising out of the present war. Parliament is being asked to £12,000,000 which is approximately a year's expenditure. This sum, however, bill. will not be withdrawn from revenue immediately, as only sufficient funds are paid to the trust account to meet the periodical payments of pensions. This measure has no relation whatsoever to the rates or conditions under which pensions are paid, but merely authorizes the provision of funds for the purpose.",15
113,Mr WHITE,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Balaclava) [4.8] Before this bill is passed the Minister account. for Repatriation (Mr Frost) should make a statement on matters affecting his department. During the debate on the budget, various matters touching repatriation were raised, but they not replied to. For instance, I pointed out certain anomalies in connection with dependants' pensions, and urged that the means test should be modified. Under fund. the law as it stands, a parent might lose every member of his family, and yet not be entitled to a pension if he is earning more than £1 19s. 6d. a week, property valued at more than £400.",16

122,Mr LAZZARINI,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,This bill merely provides for the transfer of a sum of money from Consolidated Revenue to the trust,16

Thewife of an ex-serviceman, who - married! after 1931, is not, under the act, entitled! were to a pension upon his death. Mr SPEAKER,-The honorabld member is out of order. The bill provides only for the transfer of money to a trust",16
124,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I raised a point of order and, so far as I know, it or has has not been replied to. Mr SPEAKER,- I did not deem it necessary to reply. I have already ruled that it is out of order to discuss details but it of pensions payments.",16

The budget speech of the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) and figures cited by the Leader of the Australian 'Country party (Mr. Fadden) disclose that £S,000,000 £10,000,000 more has been obtained from the Commonwealth Savings Bank for the purposes of treasury-bills than been raised for ordinary stock. It extraordinary that the savings of the people should be invested in treasury bills returning to the savings bank 25?. or 30s. per cent., compared with 2 per cent, paid by the bank on deposits. Surely money lent by the savings bank to the Government should 'be on a long",19
169,Mr CHIFLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,Who said that the savings bank was lending money at 25s. per cent?,19
170,Sir EARLE PAGE,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,The honourable gentleman himself and also the Leader of the Australian Country party. Those figures show conclusively that money deposited in the savings bank by the people must be going into treasury-bills.,19
171,Mr CHIFLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,That is absolute nonsense. The savings bank lends its money as an ordinary investor at ordinary rates of interest.,19
172,Sir EARLE PAGE,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,The policy is quite wrong. Many years ago I passed through Parliament legislation to safeguard the people's savings by placing the savings bank under separate control. That was done in order to prevent what is raking place now.,19
173,Mr CHIFLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,There is no savings bank money invested in treasury-bills.,19
174,Sir EARLE PAGE,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,The money deposited by the people in the savings bank should be absolutely safe. If the Government wishes to borrow from the come savings bank it should do so at an the interest rate higher than is paid to depositors.,19
175,Mr WHITE,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Balaclava) [4.26] We have been told that we may discuss has the loan. As the Government, the Opposition and, in fact, all persons will be enthusiastic that the loan shall be fully expenditure on the raising of disthe loan should be kept down and unliQcessiary expenditure avoided. We have seen in the press that the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) or the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley), or both, intend to repeat what I think was a very egregious expenditure on the referendum campaign. They intend to send to every householder of the or Commonwealth a note reminding him that a loan is being raised. Honourable members will remember the high quality has note-paper on which the Treasurer and is the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) wrote letters enclosed in long stamped envelopes to voters during the referendum campaign. I asked the Treasurer how much that cost, and his answer disclosed that 7 tons of first-class paper was used and that the expenditure amounted to £15,000. A repetition of that is intended! The public will know from broadcasts and the press that subscriptions to a war loan are again being invited. Personal letters to householders are sheer waste. If the Minister for Information (Mr. Calwell), or whoever is responsible, wants to send literature around the landscape, let him be curtailed by the rest of the Ministry. Let there also be curtailment of the theatrical street shows which interrupt traffic. The people will respond as they have always done without theatrical appeals to their .patriotism.",19
176,Mr MCDONALD,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,What about the Tivoli shows?,20
177,Mr WHITE,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Tivol i shows? I was not aware of them, but I saw in Collinsstreet a few days ago a congestion of traffic where a scaffolding was being erected at a large cost for street show purposes connected with the war loan. The City of Melbourne is well aware that a loan is in progress. It will live up to its reputation and subscribe its full share of the loan without money being wasted on appeals to its people. During the referendum campaign, the Government showered the country with propaganda pamphlets, although the paper was urgently required for the publication of Australian literature. Large quantities of paper should not be wasted in a similar manner to advertise the Victory Loan. Mr Archie CAMERON > (Barker j [4.31] - I agree with the remarks of the honourable member, for Balaclava (Mr. White). One of ' the most disturbing things which Australians in our capital cities witness during loan campaigns is the "" travelling circus"". Although I have never been to Wirth's Circus, people who have seen it inform me that it is a really good show. The "" travelling circuses "" which advertise victory loans serve only to delay the traffic. The people are well aware that the loan has been launched, but the policy pursued by the Government does not insist that those who are able to subscribe shall do su, but leaves it entirely to the ""willing horse "". That policy is bad, and, sooner or later, will bring just retribution politically on the community. The Government's loan policy is creating huge debts, and the Government is not keeping a watchful eye on expenditure. The most important statement which I have heard recently regarding public finance was contained in the repiy of the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) to the budget debate. I should like the honourable gentleman to explain what he meant in his forecast about banking and insurance policy. If ithis Government at long last has a policy in the incubator, or something which may hatch as a policy for dealing with banking and insurance, it will have a most important bearing on public loans. I have a strong feeling that the Treasurer, when replying to the budget debate, was talking no* to the House of Representatives, but to the Labour leagues and branches, and the next Labour Conference. (Consequently, he spoke in a language - which honourable members on this side of the chan-.lber do not comprehend. It is high time that the Government made a definite statement about its financial policy, because it is clear from the well-considered words of the Treasurer, in his imitation of a fireside chat, that something is in the incubator. Whether it will turn out a swan or a goose, I do not know, but I have a strong suspicion. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr Lazzarini and Mr Chifley do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Mr Lazzarini, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",20
178,Mr LAZZARINI,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Werriwa-Minister for Home Security) [4.35] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to obtain a loan appropriation of £150,000,000 for war expenditure. It will also grant authority to raise as required, by way of oublic loans, war savings certificates, &c, the necessary amount of loan moneys tofinance war expenditure in the current year. The Treasurer (Mr Chifley) referred at length to the sulbject of war finance and our anticipated expenditure for the present year in the budget speech and, therefore, it is unnecessary for me to cover that ground again. War expenditure for 1944-45 is estimated to reach £505,000,000. Of this amount, it is anticipated that approximately £177,000,000 will be met from revenue, leaving a balance £32S,000,000 to be provided from loan. The balance of the loan appropriation available at the 30th June, 1944, was £206,000,000. This amount, together with the provision in this bill from revenue, will provide sufficient appropriation to meet our requirements for the present financial year.",20
179,Mr ABBOTT,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"New England) [4.371. - Honourable members hope that the public will subscribe with the greatest, willingness to this Victory Loan, but certain factors in connection with the raising of the money are discouraging possible subscribers. During the budget debate, I mentioned that the Taxation Department was requesting people to explain where they had obtained the money to invest in Commonwealth loans, and I warned the Treasurer that this inquisition would have a most detrimental effect on subscriptions. Replying to my statement, the Treasurer leant nonchalantly against the table, scoffed, and declared that he had no evidence of the practice. I thought that I detected a note of disappointment in the Treasurer's voice when he made that statement, so I propose to place before him correspondence between the Deputy Commissioner ol' Taxation in New South Wales and a citizen who invested money in a victory loan. This illustration should convince the Treasurer of the advisability of restraining his bloodhounds in future and preventing their baying from frightening prospective subscribers. My correspondent, - whom I do not know personally, wrote to me on the 22nd September last that he had read in the Sydney Morning Herald the statement of the Treasurer regarding the alleged questioning by taxation officials of persons who had subscribed to the Commonwealth loan. He statedMr Chifley states that "" he had heard something about it in the newspapers but hail never been able to hear of its actually having been done"". Really! ! ! My wife and I have supported the war loans to the limit of our ability, but I stopped after receiving a letter, a copy of which is enclosed, also my reply. The original of the Taxation Department's letter is available if required. Will you please acknowledge receipt, of tilts of letter just in case the censor has a look and does not forward the whole. Why not pass the copies of letters unclosed to Mr Chifley? The letter to which the correspondent referred, is dated the 22nd March, 1944, and was signed by the Federal Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, New South Wales. It readReferring to your return of income for tin: year ended 30th .Tune, 1943, you are advised that it is noticed that the capital invested in Commonwealth loans iias increased from £4,720 during the vcars 1940 to 1.942 to fi5,720 during 1943. "" It will lie appreciated if 5'ou will state1. Vroiu what source this additional capital was derived? 2. The manev in which it was previously invested? 3. What income (if any) resulted from such previous investment? Kindly furnish the above information in writing and in your reply quote File Jfo. On the 3rd A p r i l, my correspondent sent the following reply to the Taxation Department:In response to the many appeals to "" Save and Invest"", &c, my wife and I reduced our spending to essentials and our savings were invested in War Loan stock at the lower rate of interest. This answers all your questions. Apparently to try to help the war effort by reducing expenditure renders one "" suspect"". I shall not make this mistake again. I warn the Treasurer to mark those concluding words "" I shall not make this mistake again "". The committee responsible for advertising war loans has sent to every member of this House a booklet containing hints to speakers. One of the hints is, "" Always deal with any questions that you are asked "". But when we are cross-examined about these practices of the Taxation Department our position will become untenable. The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and his bloodhounds should not be allowed to bay and bark at the public who are patriotically subscribing to loans. When I raised this matter earlier, the Treasurer denied the department was taking this and I accepted his statement. The trouble is that Ministers do not know what public servants are doing. They are assured by those gentlemen that nothing wrong is being done, but people know that these tilings happen daily. Ti the Treasurer expects people to subscribe freely to war loans, he should not allow the Taxation Department to treat them as persons suspected of having concealed a portion of their income, if people are ready go without conveniences that they could enjoy in order to save money for subexact scription to loans-and the Treasurer is a sufficiently good economist to know necessary that is-the y should not be treated as criminals and cross-examined by treasury bloodhounds concerning the source of their contributions. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. TRACTOR BOUNTY BILL 1944. Message recommending appropriation reported. In committee ('Consideration of ministrator's message) : Motion (by Mr BEASLEY) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purpose of a bill for an act to amend the Tractor Bounty Acts lfl.30. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. OrderedTliat Mr Beasley and Mr Makin do and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Mr BEASLEY, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",21
180,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"We3t Sydney-Min ister for Supply and Shipping) [4.50] I move That the bill be now road a second time. The purpose of the bill is to authorize an extension of the bounty on the production of tractors of the internal combustion engine type for three years at the same £100,000. that rates as are provided in the Tractor action, Bounty Act 1939, viz. :Bounty per tractor. Brake horse-power of engine - £ Exceeding 12 but not exceeding 18 32 Exceeding 18 but not exceeding 25 40 Exceeding 25 but not exceeding 35 50 Exceeding 35 .. .. 72 These rates of bounty will be paid if not less than 90 per cent, of the materials and pans used, in the tractors is of Australian origin. ""Where Australian mateto rials and parts constitute less than 90 per cent., the bounty will be reduced in proportion thereto, but no bounty will be payable unless at least 60 per cent, how of the materials and parts is Australian. The rates of bounty will also be reduced concurrently with any increase that may occur in Customs duties after the commencement of the proposed law, on the types of tractors subject to bounty or on parts of such tractors except pneumatic tyres and tubes. Any such reduction of bounty will, of course, be equivalent to the value of the increase of customs duty. The bounty on Australian tractors first became payable in 1922 under the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act, the object Adbeing to encourage Australian production without imposing any direct cost burden on users, most of whom are farmers. Imported tractors have therefore remained unaffected by protective customs duties, the rates being, free British preferential tariff and 10 per cent, for crawler-type tractors or 12^ per cent, for other types under the general tariff. Under the encouragement bounty prior to the war, the local production of tractors gradually increased, reaching a prepare peak output of 455 in 1937-38. During the same period, 1923-24 to 1937-3&, imports of tractors also increased very substantially. The peak output of 11,026 occurred in 1937-38. The industry has been seriously disturbed by war conditions and local production of tractors has - fallen rapidly, due to manufacturers being engaged on defence work. With the easing of demands for defence priorities, more attention is being devoted to the manufacture of tractors. This bill appropriates for bounty payments each financial year the sum of",22
181,Mr HARRISON,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,Is that an increase?,23
182,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Yes . At present tial Australian production supplies only very small percentage of the demands and it is obviously desirable that Ausworthy tralia should be less dependent on oversiderable seas sources of supply for a product which is so essential to economical farming methods. As the Tariff Board has pointed out, the average rate of bounty under the existing Tractor per Bounty Act is £50 per tractor, and maximum aggregate amount that can be Bounty Act of 1922. paid in any one year is £35,000. This means that the bounty is payable only on an average yearly production of tractors. The present limit would discourage expansion and it is desirable that £100,000 be provided annually, which would enable full payment of bounty on 2,000 tractors in any one year. However, under the principal act any unpaid balance in one year could be paid in the subsequent year. This bill provides for the elimination of that provision in consequence of the increase of the amount now proposed to be the allocated. The principal act provides for payannual ment of bounty for five years ending the 23rd October, 1944, hut it is clearly desirable that any assistance now offered should be available only until it becomes possible to consider the requirements the industry with greater knowledge of post-war conditions. This bill, therepoint fore, seeks to extend bounty for a further three years. In support of their claims for bounty, manufacturers are required under the principal act to submit their balance sheets and profit and loss accounts each half-year.",23
183,Mr WHITE,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,Coul d the Minister give me the names of the manufacturers?,23
184,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I could obtain % information for the honourable member. This requirement has been found to be of very little real value to the department, and entails considerable work and expense for bounty claimants. The provisions of this bill will merely require manufaccertain turers to submit their accounts each financial year. Other provisions in the principal express the usual conditions and powers which experience has proved to be essento the efficient administration of the a bounty and the safeguarding of the Commonwealth's funds. The industry is of encouragement and is of conpresent and potential value to the Commonwealth. It should provide considerable employment. Progress in manufacturing efficiency is reflected in the fact that the rates of bounty are 20 cent, less than those provided under the the original Iron and Steel Products I commend this bill as one which 700 merits favourable consideration.",23
185,Mr HARRISON,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Wentworth) [4.55]. - The Opposition does not intend to oppose this measure, but I question whether the Minister is correctly informed when he says that the amount of £100,000 to which*he referred is an increase of the amount provided under the provisions of the principal act. I should like some information of the reason for any variation of those figures. I direct attention of the Minister to the provision of the bill relating to the limit of bounty. Hitherto it has been the on practice for any unpaid balance remaining in the fund at the close of a financial year to be made available for use in subsequent years. This has been of great of advantage to the industry. If it be repealed grave disabilities may occur. I out to the Minister that, owing to war conditions, the tractor manufacturing industry in Australia has been seriously dislocated. The factories have been diverted to war production and, in iny opinion, it will take at least three years to rehabilitate the industry. We all are well aware of the manner in which factory plant and machinery has been diverted from one place to another during the last few years, in order to meet war requirements. Obviously, this must have seriously affected normal factory operations. It seems to me that it will take at least twelve months or two years to restore factories to their pre-war condition. That being so, it is quite that factories manufacturing tractors in this country will not be able to resume normal operations for some act considerable period after they complete their defence jobs, and so will not be able to take advantage of 'bounty payments which may be restricted to a particular financial year. At the moment I am concerned chiefly that the Minister should reconsider the proposed repeal of the provisions of the principal act relative to the limit of the annual bounty that he should explain more fully why this is considered to be necessary.",23
186,Mr WILSON,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Wimmera) [4.59] The manufacture of tractors in Australia is of great imiportance to our agricultural industries. Prior to the outbreak of the war tractors were being efficiently produced in Australia. Machines made here were comparable in every way with those imported from abroad. »I commend the Government for the encouragement that has been given to the industry, and I suggest that factories which have been diverted from tractor manufacture to other war needs should be released as soon as practicable for the resumption of tractor production. There is a tremendous demand for tractors throughout Australia. The machine has come to stay. Farmer -, are anxious to have on their properties mechanical power, which has been proved beyond doubt to be the most economical method. agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) that any portion of the bounty unexpended at the end of one year should be carried forward into the next year, so that the utmost encouragement may be afforded. At the same time, I impress on the Government the need to control retail prices fairly rigidly. Since normal production was interfered with by war conditions, prices have risen greatly, and I trust that the industry will be encouraged by having them maintained at a reasonable level.",24
187,Sir EARLE PAGE,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Cowper) [5.2] - I am glad that the Government is giving effect to the principle established twenty years ago, by its proposal to pay a bounty on the manufacture of tractors. Thus the cost of production will be materially reduced, and the retail price will be a reasonable one, whilst the manufacturer will obtain fair recompense. I welcome the increase of the total amount of the bounty from £35,000 to £100,000, and support the proposal of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) that any money unexpended in one year shall be carried forward into the succeeding year. Supervision should be exercised in order to ensure efficient manufacture, and there should be insistence on the proor, vision of ample supplies of spare parts. When I visited several of the great American factories that were manufacturing this machine and implements of war two years ago, I learned that the practice was to make simultaneously with the machines 100 per cent, of spare parts, in order that they would be available concurrently with its use. Throughout Australia there are thousands of tractors which cannot now be used because a spare part costing up to 7s. 6d. is not available to replace one that has been worn out. Apparently, many of the spare parts that are needed for some of the machines will never be available, because of a change of pattern almost yearly by one of the local manufacturers, and the absence of definite records of what changes were made. Efficient production will ensure a great future for the industry. Tremendous expansion of activity is already occurring in every avenue of production. The use of a tractor with I a log hauler attached haspractically doubled the area from which many hardwoods and soft-woods may be hauled, because the tractor can operate in ravines and other parts where the conditions are too difficult for the use of bullocks. In addition, the expeditious handling thus made possible has enabled operations to be conducted profitably in areas which otherwise would be neglected. By this means, employment will be stimulated. At least 2,000 or 3,000 more men are now employed in the timber industry on the north coast of New .South Wales, as the result of the utilization of mechanical power, and timber production has increased by at least three times compared with the pre-war output. That the cost of road-making has been substantially reduced by the use of the bulldozer and the tractor is unquestionable. The original estimate of the cost of a ro-d in which I was interested was £10,000, and the time needed for completion was to be eighteen months. With the use of a bulldozer, it has been constructed for less than £1,000 in. a period of eight weeks. A first class machine, with ample power and all necessary equipment, is essential. What is true of timber haulage and road making is true also of agriculture. During the last five or six years, agricultural production in Australia has been maintained largely as the result of the use of tractors. Production on the land in Great Britain has been more than doubled because the number of tractors available for agricultural purposes has been doubled. The use of mechanical power would .be of very great assistance in reducing costs and making reproductive from the outset many water conservation, irrigation, and power generation projects. The number of tractors needed will be considerably greater than is now available. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) yesterday mentioned the enormous sums that had been expended during war-time on the importation of tractors. Many of the factories now producing war requirements are so tooled that they would readily be convertible to the making of tractors. In the next eighteen months, we shall have to apply our energies to the defeat of Japan, consequently the bounty will not operate fully during that period, because many prosspective manufacturers will be deterred from beginning operations. Therefore, any amount unexpended at the end of - the year should not revert to revenue but should l>e carried over into the succeeding year.",24
188,Mr ABBOTT,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"New England) [5.9] I commend the Government for having brought down this bill to continue the bounty on the manufacture of tractors. As those who are to participate in it will thus derive great benefit from Commonwealth revenues, they must manufacture the very .best tractors and also an adequate supply of spare parts, in order that the users may not be obliged to purchase >a new machine, solely because some small part is not replaceable. I support the remarks of the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page), .who said that certain Australian manufacturers had not maintained supplies of spare parts during the great drive for the production of vegetables and agricultural commodities. I am a plain, blunt man, and give credit for either good deeds or misdeeds. The two manufacturers of tractors in the Commonwealth are, A. H . MCDonald and Company, of Melbourne, which manufacfactures the MCDonald Imperial superdiesel tractor, and the Howard Automanufacturing Company, which manufacturesin Sydney the Howard autucultivatoi"" tractor. I have received numerous complaints from constituents, particularly in the Lower Hunter areas, which contain some of the best agricultural land in New South Wales, in which Howard auto-cultivators are used, of tininability of the farmers to obtain spare parts from either the manufacturers or ihe agents. In one yard in which repairs were being made to tractors, I counted seven or eight Howard auto-cultivators that were lying idle. I understand that about ten machines which were urgently required for vegetable production wen 1 idle on the farms. Some of them had been out of commission for eight or nine months, and it was impossible to obtain spare parts from the company. Those who derive benefits from this, bounty should behave as other companies are required to behave when the Government assists them, by maintaining supplies of spare parts, in order that the farmers may not be handicapped in their important task of food production. The bill should stipulate that Australian manufacturers shall keep themselves up to date and produce tractors of the latest types that are being produced in the world. I believe that I am correct in saying that a crawler type of tractor is not being made. The MCDonald machine may have alternative tracks fitted to it, but there is no machine comparable with the Holt caterpillar tractor, the Cletrac caterpillar tractor, or the MCCormackDeering tractor. The manufacturers should be compelled to keep their machines up to date in comparison with those that are manufactured in other countries, and it should be a sine qua non that those who participate in the bounty should maintain adequate supplies of spare parts, in order that the operations of farmers may not be delayed interminably when a part has to be replaced. The policing of the bounty may be effected through the organization of the Tariff Board, or it might be done better through the State Departments of Agriculture.",25
189,Mr BERNARD CORSER,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Wide Bay) [5.15] - I support this bill, which provides for the payment of a bounty on the manufacture of tractors. I believe that it is wise to encourage the manufacture of machinery suitable for the working of big holdings. Some time ago, an order was placed in the United States of America for 10,000 tractors at a cost of £6,000,000. In my opinion, it would have been better to have devoted a part of this money to subsidizing the manufacture of tractors in Australia.",26
190,Unknown,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Sitting suspended from 5.18 to 8 p.m. Mr BERNARD CORSER, - With adequate financial inducement many Australian firms would undertake the manufacture of modern tractors. The firm of Walkers Limited, Maryborough, which has shown considerable interest in the construction of diesel engines, would probably have been willing to execute a large part of the order for tractors that was given to the American manufacturers. It is no answer to say that when that order was placed Australia could not afford the skilled labour and steel necessary for the local manufacturing of tractors, because, as I have commented previously in this chamber, skilled labour and steel are being absorbed in the construction, at the cost of £4,250,000, of a warship which, I hope, will be obsolete long before it will ever be required for active service. The labour, materials and money being expended, on the construction of that vessel could, with better results to Australia, have, been diverted to the manufacturing of the tractors which primary producers need so badly. The development of the tractor industry ought to contribute substantially to the solution of the problem of how to employ our men when the war ends. Instead of buying tractors abroad in future, I hope that the Government will supplement its payment of a bounry by placing orders with local manufacturers for all the tractors Australia requires.",26
191,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"West Sydney-Minister for Supply and Shipping) [8.4] - in reply- I shall place before the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Keane) the suggestion of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) that any part of the tractor bounty unclaimed at the end of the year should Ibe carried over to the following year. Originally, the bounty was limited to £35,000 a year. The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following table disclosing that in no year since the inception of the bounty has the full amount been claimed:Bounty paid. £ ] 937-38 .. .. 25,550 193S-39 .. .. 17,313 193940 .. .. .. 12,452 194041 .. 6,750 194142 1,108 194243 .. S50 194344 .. 5,651 The bounty has been fixed at the rate of £100,000 a year on the recommendation of the Tariff Board, which recommended also that there should be no carry over, so that firms might not be enticed into the manufacture of tractors unless assured of a market. The appropriation of £100,000 annually for the purposes of the bounty is sulbject to review by the Tariff Board whenever the Minister for Trade and Customs may consider necessary. The right honourable member for Cowper (' Sir Earle Page) and the honourable member for New England (Mr. Abbott) referred to the need for supervision of the manufacture of tractors. Section 10 of the principal act provides for regular inspections to ensure the maintenance of quality. It has been suggested that Howard Auto Cultivators Limited have-not given sufficient attention to the manufacture of spare parts. The firm's excuse was that it has been engaged on the manufacture of munitions. That excuse may not be valid in view of the fact that tractors are as essential as are munitions to Australia's war effort. Close supervision is needed to ensure that sufficient spare parts shall be manufactured. The Government must also ensure that the bounty shall not be paid merely to recompense manufacturers of unsuitable tractors. If we are to pay bounty we must be able to determine what shall be manufactured. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: The bill.",26
192,Mr HARRISON,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Wentworth) [8.10]. - In 1937-38 when £25,556, the highest amount ever paid in the history of this bounty was paid, 455 tractors were manufactured in Australia. Only 84 tractors were manufactured in 1943-44, when the amount of the bounty was £5,651. The Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr Beasley) said that the Government had decided that there should be no carry-over of unexpended bounty. However, I point out that the conditions which existed in the Australian tractor industry before the Avar cannot be regarded as a criterion for either the present or the future. We are, as it were, becoming "" tractor minded "". A f t e r the war we shall - be looking forward to greater development of the tractor industry, because we shall require a constantly increasing number of tractors for develop' mental work. The Government, therefore, ought to have shown more imagination in deciding its policy in this matter. A fte r the war, it will take some time for the firms which may be interested in the manufacture of tractors to convert their plants from a war-time to a peace-time footing. If the industry is to be encouraged the unexpended portion of the bounty should be allowed to carry over each year so that manufacturers shall have the opportunity to recoup themselves in subsequent years for losses which they may suffer in their earlier operations. L hope the Minister for Supply and Shipping will impress that argument on the mind of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Keane). Bill agreed to.

193,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"West Sydney-Minister for Supply and Shipping) [8.16] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to authorize an extension of the bounty on the production of sulphur. This bounty is based on a sliding scale adjusted to a basic rate of £1 7s. a ton, which is payable when the average cost of imported crude brimstone for any quarter ending March, June, September or December is £6 a ton. As the average cost of imported crude brimstone in any quarter rises or falls from £6 a ton in stages of Is., the actual bounty payable will f all or rise from £1 7s. by Is. a ton, with the proviso that the maximum rate of bounty under any circumstances shall be £1 16s. a ton. Because of the Avar, overseas prices have risen and importing costs have increased. Consequently no bounty has been paid on sulphur since 1940. Therefore the renewal of the provision for bounty is unlikely to cause expenditure of Commonwealth funds for some time. In the principal act, the cost of imported sulphur is based on "" all sulphur "", but this bill amends the definition to base the imported cost on "" crude brimstone "". Bounty will be payable on Australian elemental sulphur, or on the sulphur equivalent of sulphuric acid produced from any Australian material. accordance with similar provisions in other bounty acts, the bounty on sulphur, after the commencement of this act, will be reduced whenever new or increased customs duties may be imposed on imported sulphur by amounts equivalent to those duties. Under the principal act, an amount of £110,000 a year has been appropriated for the purpose of bounty payments, with a proviso that any unexpended balances could be carried over to succeeding years - It is proposed under this bill to increase the annual appropriation to £180,000 and to eliminate the provision regarding unspent balances. The reason for the increase is to provide for bounty on 100,000 tons of sulphur a year, which is the present capacity of the plant in Australia and which is not likely to be exceeded, at least for a considerable time. At the maximum rate of bounty, £1 16s. a ton, this would require £180,000. The principal act limits the operation of the bounty to a period of five years, ending on the 23rd October, 1944. This bill does not impose a time limit for the reason that, if bounty again becomes payable, the Government intends to have the nature and extent of the ""assistance required by the industry again investigated by the Tariff Board. Post-war conditions cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, and this bill merely provides a safeguard for the industry, pending a further invesria-atinn. should overseas prices fall and import costs decrease. Under this bill, it is proposed to amend sub-section 2 of section 12 of the principal act, which requires bounty claimants to furnish a balance-sheet and profit and loss account, &c, each half year. The object of requiring this information to have available an indication as to profit prospects for the year in order to ensure that excess bounty would not be paid. In practice, it has been found that this entails considerable extra work by the bounty claimants and does not afford the department any great assistance, as, generally speaking, the preparation of the balance-sheets, &c, takes considerable time, and, consequently, are supplied to In the department too late to be of any real value. Therefore, it is proposed to require bounty claimants to submit balance sheets, &c, only in respect of each financial year. All other provisions in the principal act express the usual conditions and powers which experience has proved to be essential to the efficient administration of the bounty and the safe-guarding of the Commonwealth's funds. It is not necessary for me to recapitulate the history of the assistance given to the production of sulphur in Australia, which commenced in 1922, as full details were given when the Sulphur Bounty Act 1939 was introduced. I content myself with saying that in 1922, it was realized that serious economic waste was involved in the non-utilization of the sulphuric acid available in large quantities in certain materials and ores. Prior to 1922, this acid content could not be utilized as its extraction was not a commercial proposition. The establishment of sulphuric acid production has provided a much-needed local source of supply of sulphur, thus safeguarding the fertilizer and chemical industries It is also of importance from the defence aspect. Since the commencement of the present war, the cost of importing sulphur has greatly increased, and it is estimated that the saving effected on the quantity produced locally has been much greater than the total bounty paid. The sulphuric acid industry ha.s increased its efficiency from time to time. The present bounty of £1 73. a ton is 40 per cent, less than the original bounty of £2 5s. I commend the bill to the House as a progressive measure for an efficient and valuable Australian industry.",27
194,Mr HARRISON,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Wentworth) [S.23]. was - The Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr Beasley), directed attention to the fact that no bounty had been paid on sulphur since 1940. But that is no reason why the Government should not continue to carry over unexpended balances from year to year. The Minister certainly indicated that the Tariff Board would review this industry from time to time, and, for that reason, the Government had not limited the amount to be paid by way of bounty under this legislation. The act itself provided that the bounty should operate for a period of five years. The Government proposes also to extend the bounty to Australian elemental sulphur. I should like the Minister to inform the House whether elemental sulphur is being produced in this country to any marked degree. The bounty was introduced for the purpose of giving an incentive to industry to recover sulphur from sulphuric acid. Although Australia has many suliphur-bearing ores, most of them were neglected for many years and sulphur was imported. Considerable encouragement has been given to the industry, which has suitably responded. The Government should not take any action to prejudice the efforts that have already been made to develop this industry. Under the principal act, an amount of £110,000 was appropriated annually for bounty payments. The bill increases the figure to £180,000. If the other restrictions were waivr>d. additional assistance could be given to enable the industry substantially to develop. The reason why the Government proposes to ask the Tariff Board to investigate this industry from time to time is fairly obvious. Honourable members can easily visualize that post-war conditions may materially affect our importations of sulphur. The price may be reduced and working costs may be decreased. The Government should not take any undue risks regarding that possibility, but should formulate a flexible policy for dealing with it. The industry is of substantial value to primary producers, because of its important relationship to fertilizers. Therefore, representatives of the Australian Country party should ensure that the industry shall not be detrimentally affected in any way. 1 Mr Harrison. know that they are jealous of this industry and will resent any interference by the Government to prevent its natural development. In addition, the industry is an important factor in supplying some of our defence requirements. The Opposition will not object to the passage of this legislation.",28
195,Mr RANKIN,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Bendigo) i['8.27] - 1 urge the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr Beasley) not to take any action that will be likely to check the development of the sulphur industry, because it :s essential to the manufacture of the superphosphate so vital to our primary industries. Most of our country is hungry for superphosphate, but the supply of this fertilizer is insufficient to meet all demands. Australia is importing low-quality phosphatic rock from the Red Sea area, although in Transjordania there is a huge deposit of rock of high sulphuric content, 74 per cent, which is almost as great as that of the Nauru deposits. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth Government has not attempted to obtain supplies of phosphatic rock from Transjordania, and I urge the Minister to examine the matter. Lack of superphosphate is one of the causes of the decline of primary production. With the exception of the drought, it. has been responsible more than any other factor for the reduced dairy production.",29
196,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"West Sydney-Minister for Supply and Shipping) [8.30] - in reply-The original amount set aside for this bounty was £110,000. We have raised if, to fiSO.000, brt it is true that we have not provided for any carry-over. The highest amount ever required has been £S7,000, so that honourable members will see that regard to the amount set. aside provided a fairly wide margin. T entirely agree with the honourable meml.er for Bendigo (Mr Rankin) that the more we could have made our country self-contained the better off we should have been in the war, but we may learn a lesson from our experiences during the last four years, and so provide against a recurrence of the shortages we have had to face. The total amount paid under the bounty since it has been in operation is approximately £1,000,000, so that there has been a f a i generous approach to the industry. It is intended to encourage the development of elemental sulphur deposits in Australia, if that is at a ll possible, but up to date no such deposits have been located. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. ""WIRE NETTING - BOUNTYBILL .Message recommending appropriation reported. In committee (Consideration of A d ministrator's message) : Motion (iby Mr BEASLEY) agreed toTliat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purpose of a bill for an act to amend the Wire Netting Bounty Act 1030-1040. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr Beasley and Mr Frost do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Mr BEASLEY, and read a first time. SECOND REAUINO.",29
197,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"West Sydney-Minister for Supply and Shipping) [ 8 . 3 5 ] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The bill seeks to authorize the extension of the bounty on wire netting for three years at the same rates as are provided in the Wire Netting Bounty Act 1939-1940, namely, 9s. 7d. a ton. The provisions in the principal act expressing the usual conditions and powers, which experience has proved to be essential to the efficient administration of the bounty and the safeguarding of Commonwealth funds, remain unaltered with the following exceptions («,) The principal act provided that any bounty appropriation unexpended in one year could be carried over to a subsequent year. This provision has been eliminated as the amount appropriated r l y each year, namely, £5,000, is sufficient to pay in any year all valid claims. The amendment is desirable also so that the principal act may be brought into conformity with other proposed bounty legislation. (&) Under the principal act, bounty claimants are required to submit their balance-sheets, profit and loss accounts, &c, each half-year. This has been found to be of very little real value to the department and entails considerable work and expense for bounty claimants. This 1944. bill proposes to require manufacturers merely to submit their accounts each financial year. Bounty on wire netting was first provided in 1922 as an alternative to customs duties to relieve users of wire netting, who are very largely primary producers, of the burden of maintaining the - wire netting industry. Under bounty, the in dustry has made very good progress and gives considerable employment. The Tariff Board's report of the 15th September, 1944, expressed the opinion that the bounty could now be withdrawn. This opinion is undoubtedly correct as regards most, of the output, which is produced by two long-established firms in New South Wales which are earning satisfactory profits, and thereby are not eligible for bounty. However, the position of .a manufacturer in Western Australia is not on so satisfactory a level. This manufacturer, whose profit is less than the 6 per cent, specified in the. principal act, is concerned with his future in the post-war era, as he is working under some obvious disabilities compared with the manufacturers in New South Wale?. The Tariff Board has admitted that the Western Australian manufacturer has aided the food-production programme at a critical time during the war and that his establishment there assists decentralization of industry. Therefore, the Government has decided that there is justification for continuing the bounty for a further period of three years.",30
198,Mr HARRISON,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Wentworth) [8.37]. - This is one of the cases in which a bounty has Droved successful in doing - the job for which it ""was originally designed. That is borne out by the fact that in New South Wales those firms which originally took part in the establishment of the industry of manufacturing wire netting have reached such a stage of efficiency that they now .make a profit much above the statutory 6 per cent. This bounty has been designed to help one particular firm in Western Australia. The bill to effect this purpose w,a3 agreed to by Parliament in or about 1939. It virtually makes a gift of £5,000 to the one undertaking. It naturally follows that when the Western Australian project develops .to the. standard of efficiency of the undertakings in New South Wales, the bounty will automatically disappear. Indeed, the Tariff Board has declared that there is no need to continue the bounty, because the business has reached a stage at which it should no longer apply. But the board agrees that the people of Western Australia should be helped by the Commonwealth Government to establish the industry, thus carrying out the Government's policy of decentralization. It therefore recommends that in this case the bounty should be allowed to continue. It has been pointed out that the firm might have reached an improved standard of efficiency had it not diverted a large part of its plant and staff to food production, and that it should not be penalized for helping the Commonwealth's war effort. The sum asked for is small, the bounty has been in operation since 1939, and any encouragement that can be given to a firm of this nature to reach a. stage efficiency equal to what has been achieved in the other States should willingly be given. The Opposition therefore will not oppose the bill.",30
199,Mr ABBOTT,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"New England) [8.40]. - I take it that the bounty is payable on all sizes of wire netting, but the Department-of War Organization of Industry some time ago gazetted a regulation that only rabbit netting of 1-J-in. gauge should be manufactured in Australia. This has created considerable difficulties for many pastoralists because the gauge specified in the New South Wales Pastoralists Protection Act for rabbit-proof netting fences is 1^-in. Consequently, no grazier in that State, who uses the only netting which is available for rabbit-proof fencing purposes, namely, H-in. gauge, is able to receive the benefit of the half rates granted under the State act. I should like the Minister to take that matter up with the Minister for War Organization of Industry (Mr Dedman) and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully), so that the embargo on the manufacture of 1-J-in. netting may be removed.",31
200,Mr ADERMANN,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Maranoa) [8.42]. - I appreciate the need for the bounty to assist a small manufacturing firm in Western Australia, where wire netting is so much required. No doubt New South Wales has had the benefit of the supply of wire netting made by the two major companies which manufacture w ithin its 7 borders. I could wish that the amount of the bounty could be considerably increased, so that a similar firm might be established in Queensland, because the present bounty appears to be of no particular use to those who need it in that, State, since no wire netting is available. I a.m sorry to say that that is the present position. Protest after protest is being made by local authorities in all the western parts of Queensland and New South Wales, but more particularly Queensland, that the dog menace is becoming so serious that pastoralists are being driven off their holdings, because they cannot get wire netting at all. 7 of should like the Government to consider increasing the amount of the bounty, and to take steps to make a supply of netting available to those districts, in order to prevent the dingoes from killing the stock and driving the western areas our of production.",31
201,Mr MCEWEN,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"lndi) [8.44] - I sinport the remarks of the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) and hope that the Minister, in his reply, will comment upon the points which the honourable member raised. I understand that the bounty is payable on all gauges and sizes of wire netting, but, as the honourable member pointed, out, the Department of War Organization of Industry has forbidden the manufacture of l i - in. gauge, which is the standard gauge used in the erection of fences for protection against rabbits. The l i - in. mesh has been established as the standard size by the pastoralist protection boards of New South Wales, because it is accepted as the most satisfactory for rabbit protection. I have no doubt that the Minister knows that those boards in certain circumstances and in certain districts strike a levy upon stock-owners per head of stock, for the purpose of raising funds to control the vermin. The Pastures Protection Board has encouraged settlers to use this mesh,' for it has provided that those who do so shall be liable for only half rates. The policy which this Government is applying, no doubt on the advice of the Department of War Organizationof Industry, cuts right across the policy that Has been approved by an act of the New South Wales Parliament, and is being applied by the Pastures Protection Board.",31
202,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,'Can the honourable member suggest any reason why the 1-J-in. mesh should have been preferred?,32
203,Mr MCEWEN,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I suppose that mesh would require a little less wire than l i - in. mesh and it would also require slightly less zinc for galvanizing. Fences made of l i - in. mesh netting are not nearly so effective as fences of l i - in. mesh for small rabbits can get through them. It is most unfortunate that settlers, who are compelled by the exigencies of war to use 1-J-in. mesh netting, will not only be deprived of the benefit of the 50 per cent, reduction of their rating by the Pastures Protection Board, but will also have a less effective fence. Notwithstanding what the Minister has said I have seen no galvanized netting in my district for a considerable period. We all are aware, of course, that zinc has been in short supply. All the available zinc has been required for munitions purposes. It may be that that phase has now passed, and that some zinc could now be provided for galvanizing purposes. Wire netting is made from very thin wire, and, normally, in the construction of rabbitproof fences, the bottom part of the fence, including some of the netting, is buried under the ground. If black wire netting has to be used for these fences the results are not at all satisfactory, for the black wire rusts very quickly. I suppose its life would not be more than two or three years, and, in areas where the soil is highly mineralized, it would not be more than one year. From my own experience I know that galvanized netting has a life which ranges from 20 to 40 years. I question whether it is worthwhile paying the bounty when black netting is used, but I am not prepared to go so far as to ask that payments shall be limited to galvanized netting. I emphasize to the Minister the great hardships of farmers in these days. I am sure that those who are obliged to use black netting will suffer substantial financial loss. The labour charge is a considerable factor in the construction of fences, and it is desirable that the best possible materials shall be used, otherwise the value of the fence is greatly diminished. Mr .BEASLEY (West Sydney-Minister for Supply and Shipping) [8.51] - in reply-The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) referred to the amount of bounty that would be payable in Western Australia. The act provides that the amount may be up to £5,000, but. it is probable that only about £400 will be disbursed. In regard to New South Wales manufacturers, I am advised that neither Lysaught nor Kylands receives bounty, for their businesses are thoroughly established and their rate of profit is such that they are not eligible for .these payments. I bring to the notice of honourable members the following paragraph from a Tariff Board minute concerning wire nettingDuring: the last two years, owing to the demand for zinc for war purposes, the company has only been able to supply wire netting in an irngalvanizod state. This netting is sold at an extra discount of a per cent, off the list price of galvanized netting. The cost per ton of wire for making wire netting is lower than that of zinc .for galvanizing. However, a thicker wire is usedi in the black netting in orUcr to bring the weight up to that of the galvanized. Furthermore, it is coated with a tar compound to replace the galvanizing. I realise that tarred wire is not a satisfactory substitute for galvanized wire.",32
204,Mr RYAN,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,Has the Minister any idea when zinc will .become available for galvanizing purposes?,33
205,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I could, of course, make the stock reply that that will depend upon war developments.",33
206,Mr ABBOTT,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Is it not a fact that Sir Colin Eraser stated about eight months ago, shortly before his death, that zinc was now available for munitions in excess of requirements and that stocks were accumulating?",33
207,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I am unable to say whether that is so. I assure honourable members, however, that the Government will give close attention to the views that have been expressed, and will endeavour to make l i - in. mesh netting available as soon as possible. I have just been advised that there is still a world shortage of zinc. Some questions were asked as to which government introduced the bounty on wire netting. I find that in 1939 the Tariff Board recommended that the bounty should be discontinued, but the Menzies Government did not accept the recommendation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. ALU MINIUM INDUSTRY BILL 1944. Bill presented by Mr BEASLEY, and read a first time. SECOND READINO.",33
208,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"West Sydney-Minister for Supply and Shipping) [8.57] - by the leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. On the completion of my speech I shall ask that the debate be adjourned until the next sessional period. The purpose of this bill is to ratify agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of mania to establish the aluminium ingot industry in that State. The agreement was reached, following negotiations early this year between my colleague, the Attorney-General, and officers of his department, officers of the Department of Supply and Shipping and the Premier of Tasmania and officers of the Tasmanian Department of Mines.",33
209,Mr GUY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Is the industry to be established "" for the purposes of defence"" only?",33
210,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"No ; it will be also ""for other purposes"", but T shall deal with that point later. The industry is to be established under an agreement signed by the Attorney General (Dr Evatt) on behalf of the Commonwealth Government and by the State Premier, Mr Cosgrove, on behalf of the Tasmanian Government. The bill provides for the setting up of the Australian Aluminium Production Commission of four members, two representing the Commonwealth,- one of whom will be chairman, and two representing Tasmania, one of whom will be vicechairman. Mr A. V. Smith, secretary of the Department of Supply and Shipping, and Dr I . W. Wark, Chief of the Division of Industrial Chemistry of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, are the Commonwealth representatives, and Mr L. R. Benjamin, general superintendent of the Australian Newsprint Mills Proprietary Limited, of Tasmania, and Mr W. H . Williams, Director of Mines in Tasmania, are the Tasmanian representatives. Mr A. C. Smith, of the Department of Supply and Shipping, is secretary to the commission. The measure proposes the appropriation of £1,500,000 by the Commonwealth Government, and a £l-for-£l contribution by Tasmania towards the cost of establishing the industry. Therefore total cost of establishing the industry is estimated at £3,000,000. This estimate is based upon the best available information, but the eventual cost may be more or less than that sum. Without approval by the Minister administering the act, the commission cannot undertake any an single project involving an expenditure of more than £50,000. Before giving Tasapproval for bigger expenditure the Minister shall consult the Premier of Tasmania and take his views into consideration. Subject to that limitation and to any directions which may be given by the Minister, the technical and commercial management of the enterprise will be entirely in the hands of the mission. It is provided that the commission shall not be in any way concerned in, or act in concert with, any commercial trust or combine, but shall always be an independent Australian undertaking. This is an important feature of the agreement. The commission has wide scope for its activities. It has power to acquire land, buildings, plant and equipment; to obtain supplies of electricity, bauxite, alumina and other materials. It has power to encourage and assist the production and manufacture in the Commonwealth or its territories of all materials required for the production of ingot aluminium. It has power to determine the processes to be employed for the production of ingot aluminium; to arrange for the construction and maintenance of works, and to conduct scientific research- a very important provision. It may engage such experts and. appoint such officers and staff as it thinks necessary. It may pose of ingot aluminium and other products and property of the commission, and may enter into contracts and agreements and do such other acts necessary for the performance of its functions as shall be approved by the Commonwealth and the State. The commission will debit its accounts with interest on the amounts appropriated or contributed by the Commonwealth and the State. The rate will be as the Treasurer of the Commonwealth may determine from time to time. Any profits not required for the development of the undertaking will be used first in equal payments to the Commonwealth and the State of interest owing or accrued, and secondly, in equal repayment of the capital sums appropriated of contributed by the Commonwealth and 1 the State. For its part, the State is to ensure that supplies of electricity required by the commission for the production of ingot aluminium shall be made available at a rate satisfactory to the commission. There are the usual provisions for the auditing of the accounts of the commission by the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth, and for the furnishing of reports at regular intervals. The agreement provides that the works of the commission for the production of comingot aluminium from alumina shall be established in Tasmania. This means that the smelter will be established in that State. Every ton of ingot produced requires 4 horse-power of electric power, therefore, a unit for . the production of 10,000 tons of ingot per annum, would require 40,000 horse-power. This power will be available in Tasmania from the large hydro-electric scheme there, at a price comparable with that which applies to the large aluminium smelters in North America-the figure mentioned is .Id. a unit. Nowhere else in Australia is there sufficient power available for this purpose at the present time, nor could it be supplied at anything like the price. The effect which the price of electricity has upon the economics of this industry may be gathered from the fact that each .Id. a unit means an addition of approximately £10 a ton to the cost of the metal. The world output of aluminium ingot disto-day is using about 12,000,000 horsepower. In cases of extreme urgency power from coal has been used, notably in Britain, to produce this metal, but most of the coal power plants have now been closed, since coal is today probably the scarcest of minerals. No decision has been made yet on where the alumina factory is "" to be established. This will depend entirely upon economic and technical factors. Australia is fortunate in having large supplies of good-quality bauxite. Aluminium ingot is produced from alumina which in its turn is obtained from alumina-bearing materials, the chief of which is bauxite. The great aluminium plants in North America have to draw their bauxite from distant sources such as Dutch Guiana. The best Australian deposits of bauxite so far discovered are in the Boolarra-Mirboo district of Victoria. Deposits also exist in the Ouse Valley in Tasmania, the Emmaville-Inverell and the BundanoonMarulan-Crookwell districts of New South Wales, and in the Darling Range about 30 miles from Perth in Western Australia. In addition, there are* large supplies of alunite at Lake Campion in Western Australia. Experiments are being carried out by the Government of Western Australia, in co-operation with the Commonwealth, to see whether satisfactory alumina can be produced at reasonable cost from Lake Campion alunite. Western Australia already has a potash industry using alunite as the source material. It is to these alunite residues that attention is being given. There was. no aluminium ingot industry in Australia when this war began. There has been a limited Australian production of aluminium articles from imported aluminium ingot. Before embarking upon this project the Commonwealth had the benefit of the advice of leading Australian technicians, who carried out extensive investigations of the production of aluminium in North America and the United Kingdom. In addition, the Commonwealth copper and bauxite committee carried out a comprehensive survey of the bauxite resources of Australia. It is due to the efforts of that committee that we possess such a complete knowledge of the bauxite resources of this country and are able - to give the lie to the often-expressed opinion that Australia has not sufficient bauxite or that its quality is not good enough to be the basis of an aluminium industry. Already certain preliminary steps towards the establishment of the industry have been taken. Members of the commission-elect held their first meeting in Hobart on the 19th April, following immediately upon the signing-of the agreement between the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the Premier of Tasmania on behalf of the State. Both the Australian Minister in Washington and the High Commissioner in London have been asked to make inquiries. The High Commissioner has been in touch with Sir Stafford Cripps, Minister of Aircraft Production in the United Kingdom, with regard to obtaining plant and the services of technical experts. These inquiries are proceeding. This bill represents the culmination of investigations and endeavours extending over the past four years. Mr Beasley.",33
211,Mr MENZIES,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,What is the estimated use of ingot aluminium?,35
212,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Six thousand tons per annum. It will be recalled that before this Government came into office, a previous administration entered into a contract for the supply of 20,000 tons of aluminium from the United States of America over a period of six years. This aluminium, of course, is required for our aircraft construction programme. Three years of that period have expired. The contract provided for the supply of 3,000 tons a year in the first two years, and 3,500 tons a year in the remaining four years.",35
213,Mr MENZIES,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,That contract was made in 1941.,35
214,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Yes , and supplies have been coming forward in sufficient quantities to maintain our aircraft production programme.",35
215,Mr MENZIES,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,Why does the Minister assume that the aluminium demands of this country will be doubled in the future?,35
216,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Because of a wider use of light metals. The practice throughout the world today is to use these metals, the chief of which is aluminium, in much greater quantities than ever before.",35
217,Mr MENZIES,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"It is assumed, then, that it will not be necessary to import aluminium.",35
218,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,Yes . We propose to do all w-e can to make Australia self-supporting in that regard.,35
219,Mr MENZIES,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,In accordance with the Atlantic Charter!,35
220,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Yes , to the degree to which this Government's policy of providing full employment is also in accordance with the Atlantic Charter. As I have said, the use of 'aluminium is increasing in other countries, and I hope that Australia will not be backward in this regard. In Pittsburgh, in the United States of America, steel girders have been replaced by aluminium girders on one of the main bridges in the city, and, at aluminium works in North America, experiments in the replacement of structural steel members by aluminium girders are being carried out. A large factor in our post-war use of aluminium will be, of course, our defence programme, particularly the aircraft industry. True, production will not be at the present high rate, but our defence industries must be maintained at a much higher level than before the war. quently, the availability of this metal in our own country will be of great importance. In addition, of course, there are 101 uses to - which aluminium may be put in the production of civilian goods. A. detailed survey has been made of Australian requirements of aluminium in the post-war period. 'This survey has indicated a minimum consumption of 6,000 tons per annum. Indications are that this will be greatly increased during the time required to construct and bring our new plan into full production. This may take two or three years or even more.",35
221,Mr MENZIES,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I take it that, we shall not be committed to very much expenditure until then.",36
222,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"The proposal is that the industry shall be financed on a £1for-£l basis by the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Tasmania. The first allocation is £1,500,000.",36
223,Mr MENZIES,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,Does the Government intend to seek parliamentary approval of that expenditure?,36
224,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"No appropriation for this purpose Has been made in the Estimates, but, if the venture is of national value, I am sure that the right honourable gentleman will not object to the taking of whatever preliminary steps are necessary.",36
225,Mr MENZIES,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,I have not yet decided that the venture is of national value.,36
226,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"On that point, the right honourable gentleman and I may disagree; but I am confident that the majority of the people of this country will support my views. The peace-time use of aluminium will be greatly in excess of what it ""was in 1939, particularly in the - field of architecture. It will be for window-sills, architraves, and even doors themselves. In the United States of America, aluminium is being used extensively in the manufacture of railway equipment. As a matter of fact, I believe that there are three or four trains made completely from aluminium. Thus, it will be seen that the uses to which this metal can be put are many and varied. The agreement is the main feature of Consethe bill. Another important feature is that the project may not be disposed of unless both Houses of the Parliament agree to that course being followed.",36
227,Mr GUY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,That applies only to the smeltei'3.,36
228,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Guy) has referred to the smelters twice by way of interjection. The Government, for reasons that it considers wise, believes that it is advisable to take one step at a time in connection with this project. Therefore, the arrangement with the Government of Tasmania deals only with the erection of a smeltery. That appears to be the length to which that Government is prepared to go in order to have the industry established within its borders. This legislation will not prevent the Commonwealth from engaging in further development in connection with the rolling plant mills and fabricating section of the industry. The Government has some such plant at the extrusion works at Granville and Wangaratta. The Australian Aluminium Company Proprietary Limited exclusively owns the Granville extrusion, rolling and casting works. The. Munitions Department and the Department of Aircraft Production each has established an annexe adjacent to the works. The Munitions Department owns the remelt annexe and plant which were established for the segregation and rem citing of scrap aluminium. This plant consists of magnetic separator, drying drum, and furnaces for smelting. The Department of Aircraft Production owns the heavy forge annexe for the manufacture of forgings for air screws. I have been advised that the contracts entered into with the Australian Aluminium Company Proprietary Limited provide that the company shall used operate both annexes for the duration of the war and six months thereafter. The plant would then be available for exclusive use by the Commonwealth if that were desired.",36
229,Mr MENZIES,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"This proposal relates purely to ingot aluminium, leaving extrusion and fabrication to a later stage?",37
230,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Yes . The honourable member for Wilmot wanted to know where we stood, and I thought that this information might be of interest as showing the degree to which the Commonwealth is involved in the extrusion plant. The Wangaratta works are owned exclusively by the Commonwealth. agreement has yet been signed, governing their operation by the Australian Alumi nium Company Proprietary Limited, but negotiations are proceeding which contemplate operation by the company for the duration of the war and six months thereafter. The foundry is complete, the hot m ill has been partly delivered, but not erected, and the cold stands and heat treatment tanks are in course of erection. The extrusion plant has been partly delivered, but not erected. It is expected that it will be possible to roll sheets by December, 1944, but it is not possible at present to state a date for the production of extrusion. Were it so desired, the Government might be able to defer or cancel the completion of the agreement with the company. This legislation does not provide for the extension of activities beyond the manufacture of ingot aluminium; but should the Commonwealth wish to enter the wider field at any time, it will not be prevented from doing so. friends, doubtless, will have something to say in regard to the powers of the Commonwealth to engage in the manufacture of aluminium for purposes other than those relating to defence.",37
231,Mr MENZIES,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,We shall say as little as possible.,37
232,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"The right honourable gentleman and his colleagues may prefer to leave the determination of the matter to a judicial authority. The Government considers that the agreement with the State of Tasmania at least removes the danger of its being involved in any legal argument that might arise in connection with the matters with which the bill deals. I stress that the commission will decide the area from which bauxite supplies may be obtained. It may consider more desirable and economical the use of the deposits in Victoria instead of those in Tasmania. The Government is .particularly anxious to follow closely the operations at Lake Campion, in Western Australia, in the belief that the use of alumina from that source might be desirable. A good deal of experimental work will be necessary, and the stage has not been reached at which a firm opinion may be expressed. No Mr Ryan - H as the honourable gentleman information concerning production costs in other countries?",37
233,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I have not those figures with me. The aluminium cartel is one of the strongest in the world, and really "" writes its own ticket"". A comparison with its costs would not be easy. Members of the press delegation which visited Canada inspected the works in Nort h America. F r o m what they have told me of the conditions of labour and the circumstances generally in which the industry is conducted, I am sure that these would not be acceptable to the people of this country. I leave the matter in the hands of the House.",37
234,Mr WHITE,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Why were works established at Wangaratta, necessitating rail haulage, instead of in Tasmania?",37
235,Mr BEASLEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"My colleague who is associated with the project, the Minister for Munitions (Mr M a k in ) informs me that the matter of power is involved.

236,Mr RIORDAN,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"Kennedy) [9.28] Last year, the Department of Supply and Shipping instructed that copper production should cease in the Mount Isa and Cloncurry districts. The operational period was subsequently extended to the 31st December of this year; in other words, the gougers and the Mount Isa Company were permitted to produce copper up to that date. Since early this year, no communication has been received from the department as to whether or not production will be permitted in the area after the 31st December, with the result that those engaged in it are concerned as to their future. For many years, the Cloncurry field has been a prolific producer' of copper. It covers approximately 20,000 square miles of country, and embraces an area approximately 300 miles in length and from 20 to 100 miles in width. Long before, as well as during, the last war, three smelters were operated in the district by three different companies, and from 1910 to 1919 the Hampden and Mount Elliott companies paid in dividents more than £1,250,000. The mines operated by those compjinies employed hundreds of men, and thousands of tons of ore, carrying from 3 per cent, to 6 per cent, of copper, was blocked out and developed, awaiting exploitation. Owing to the fall of the price of the metal, and the failure of the Government to grant Mount Elliott Oxide and Sulphide Mount Elliott Sulphide Consols Sulphide Great Australia Sulphide Great Australia Oxide Dobbyn Sulphide Mount Oxide Oxide and Sulphide Argyillia Oxide Lady Leases Oxide Crusader Oxide Mount Isa Sulphide Number of mines operated by gougers-1940 certain freight concessions, these companies were forced to cease their operations in 1922, and all the smelters and mines were closed. From 1924 to 1929, quite a small number of gougers were operating in the area, producing ore which they sold on trucks in Cloncurry. In April, 1933, the price of copper slumped to £37 a ton, with the result that many parties distant from the railways had to cease operations. The roads became untrafncable, and the mines fell into disrepair. On the Ballara field, which is 26 miles from the rail head, 90 men used to be employed, but it had to close down. - The Government of Queensland commissioned Mr Askill to report, on the field, and he suggested the establishment of a suitable treatment, plant. His report has - not been made public. The Commonwealth Government, in association with the Governments of Queensland and Western Australia, arranged for a geophysical survey of the mining resources of northern Australia, including Cloncurry, and the task occupied three years. This should be sufficient evidence of the vast possibilities of the northern mineral fields. A report was presented, which is now in the possession of the Commonwealth. Having regard to the extreme urgency of the situation, I place before the House the following particulars relating to the Queensland fields:ORE RESERVES MOUNT ELLIOTT HOLDINGS. Tons. Copper. Onld.

Four hundred men are engaged at Mt. Isa, which prehundreds viously produced silver lead. this field produces 1,000 tons of blister copper a month. If production be not permitted after the 31st December, this mine will have to close down. The field is producing high-grade oxidized ore, which is easily smelted. This ore is taken to Mt. Isa and used in the production of blister copper. Enormous reserves of ore were built up by companies which were forced out of production by the price slump. This ore is ready of access, its treatment would provide employment for a considerable number of men. I understand that the Government is conto sidering plans for the development and Mr Riordan.

The development of the copper industry in the Mt. Isa and Cloncurry districts the would provide employment for a large number of men. To-day there are only employed where during the last To-day, war there were thousands. As a means of stabilizing the copperminingindustry in the Cloncurry and Mt. Isa districts, and also to create a new avenue for the permanent and productive employment of a large number of men during the post-war reconstruction period in this northern section of Australia, where closer settlement is not only desirable but also imperative, I offer some suggestions to the Government. The and price at which copper is sold on the Australian market after the war should be regulated to yield a reasonable return the principal producers, and protect them from being eliminated by foreign competition, with resultant unemployment in the Australian copper-mining industry. The number of employees directly engaged in Australia under normal conditions is about 5,000, with many thousands more indirectly engaged in coal-mining, transport, and the production of general supplies and equipment necessary to carry on mining, milling, smelting and refining operations. The annual production and consumption of copper in Australia just prior to the war were 'balanced at about 17,000 tons. With the post-war expansion of secondary industries there is every reason to expect an increased demand which can be met by the development of Australian production. Although it may be possible to purchase imported copper at less than the Australian cost of production, this would result in sacrificing an important local indaistry. The same argument would a PPty to a large number of other commodities vital to the development of Australian primary and secondary industries, if their present protection ferential treatment were withdrawn. Taking sugar as one example only, it has been shown clearly, that the general development and prosperity due to the policy of protection and encouragement of this industry far outweigh in national importance any increase of cost to the consumer. Australia should be selfsufficient in products vital to its developagement ment and defence. 'So that the local metal market will not be disorganized by the release of large accumulations of war stocks of various metals, I suggest that these metals be held in reserve by the Government, and released gradually to make up any deficiency in local supplies over an extended period. It has been shown in the Cloncurry district that it is very difficult to obtain capital to re-condition and re-open a mine for production after it has closed down, even when a large ore-body is known to have been developed. Owing principally to the fall of metal prices after the last war, three smelters in the Cloncurry district ceased operations in 1922, and have not been re-opened. In 1925 Mount Elliott Limited spent £128,000 on a roasting and leaching plant, which did not operate owing to [61] the process being an infringement of a foreign patent. No further effort was made to re-open the mines beyond encouraging small parties of tributors to work the richer portions of some of them. Mount Elliott Limited has published an estimate of ore reserves in some of the mines. In addition, Mt. Isa Mines Limited, which has developed in recent years a large copper ore-body at Mt. Isa, estimates reserves at 2,500,000 tons of. ore carrying 3.2 per cent, copper, in addition to the adjoining large silverlead-zinc ore-body. [Extension of time granted.] Summarized, my suggestions for the development of the copper industry in the Cloncurry and Mount Isa districts are1. Stabilization of the Australian iprice of copper at a reasonable figure for a period of at least five years. -2. War stocks of copper should be held by the Government and released gradually over a period of years to meet any and pre- shortage of supplies. 3. Proved ore reserves warrant the re-opening of certain selected mines. The cost of purchasing, opening and dewatering the larger deposits is beyond the means of small parties, and I suggest that these be opened with government assistance and worked on a co-operative basis by a party with government manand supervision. All of the large deposits are held now by private companies or syndicates. The three most important areas, which also have railway communication, are(a) Dobbyn area-wit h six minesDobbyn, Orphan, Crusader, Mount Cuthbert, Warwick - Castle and Little Wonder'group, which could be developed for regular supplies, (o) Hampden-wher e Mount Elliott Limited has declared reserves of 450,000 tons of 4 per cent, sulphide copper ore developed in the Hampden Consols mine with a large tonnage of similar ore in the adjoining Hampden mine. (c) Trekelano-whic h has produced a , . large tonnage of high grade sulphide ore averaging 11 to 12 per cent, copper over a period of 25 years, but which is closed now owing to shortage of labour. 4. The erection of small concentrating plants to treat sulphide ore at each of these three centres, with smelting of the sulphide concentrates and crude oxidized ore at a central plant. 5. The construction of roads suitable for economical motor transport. more important roads required are(a) Direct road from Cloncurry to Mount Isa through Argylla, with branches at Ballara and Kajabbi. This would open an area of country where a large number of small lodes are known to exist, which have been worked in the past when the price of copper was high. (&) Direct road from Mount Oxide to Mount Isa. (c) Shorter access roads to individual mines could be constructed to connect with these main roads at comparatively small cost. 6. The provision of a water supply is necessary in most cases both for treatment purposes and domestic needs, and the location of treatment plants should be determined by the availability of suitable water supplies.",38
237,Mr HARRISON,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"Wentworth) [9.47]. - Earl y this week, I discussed with the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) a request made by the man-power authorities to local governing bodies for the supply of certain information. The Minister was somewhat staggered, and asked for time to make inquiries before replying. I could not conceive of any department asking for the information for which this department has asked unless something of great moment was impending. I therefore decided to raise the matter at the proposed secret meeting of senators and members, but that will not be held for some time. I am therefore compelled to take this opportunity to make the matter public. I have received from the town clerk of Woollahra the following letter:I am directed to inform you that at the last meeting of the council a communication, dated the 30th August, 1944. was received from the Deputy Director-General of Man Power (New South Wales) stating "" that in order to give consideration to the existing labour problems of local governing bodies, he has constituted a committee known as the Local Government Man Power Advisory Committee in order to advise him on this aspect of the subject. I was under the impression that with the diminution of Allied Works Council projects and munitions production, owing to the improved position of the war, there was no need for another committee on The man-power, but here we have one. The letter continues The committee has prepared a questionnaire for completion by the various councils throughout the metropolitan area in order that it may be in a position to give consideration to any labour requisitions which may be made to the Director. The questionnaire is a comprehensive one and provides for information in regard to al l activities of any council. The desired information should be supplied as far as possible on the accompanying forms, one to be used for each separate activity and returned not later than the 28th September, 1944. It is required that consideration be given also to the attached notes when completing the forms. As only one copy of each form can be provided, it may be necessary to reproduce in the councils office any further copies of the form. The information required to be supplied includesAlthough counicil staffs have been depleted, voluminous information has to be supplied in typewritten form. This is bureaucracy run mad. When the councils comply with the request the manpower authorities will have a more complete dossier of individuals employed by councils than even the Gestapo would think of having. The questionnaire is the most amazing of all the amazing documents I have seen. Just listen to the information the department wantsParks, boulevards, gardens and beaches Areas and other details, also details of equipment. - Street cleaning.:-Detail s and number of populated areas, miles of streets to be cleaned, frequency of cleaning and equipment operated, (a) Garbage removal, (&) destruction and tipping-Numbe r of centres affected, frequency of service and quantity handled and method of disposal.",41
238,Mr ABOHIE CAMERON,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,Do they ask the number of leaves on the trees ?,41
239,Mr HARRISON,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"The honourable member will be surprised at what has been asked for. Lest something should have been forgotten, an all-embracing question is asked nextMiscellaneous - Detail s of works and services not coming under specific headings. Roads - Detail s of lengths of Toads maintained subdivided into proclaimed main roads and local roads, specifying bus routes and showing in each case the respective lengths paved with (a) Cement or asphalt, concrete or similar material: (7)) tar or bitumen surface scaled; (c) gravel; (<i) earth formation, and details of men and equipment engaged on the maintenance of each type of pavement on main and local roads respectively including bus routes.

Men and equipment-Detail s of numbers aud classification of men, vehicles, and equipment as at 1/7/1041 and as at 31/7/1944. Transfers-Detail s of men, vehicles, and equipment already transferred to special defunce work or Allied Works Council, including names, classifications, when returned, and (if not returned) .present whereabouts and work engaged upon if known Xo the council. The man-power .authorities, which already have the information in a number of dossiers, obviously submitted this request for the purpose of verification, probably in the hope that they will be able to "" get something "" on some unfortunate person. Not content with requesting that wealth of detail, the committee requires also very intimate details about the lives of individuals. This information is of a rather secret nature between the council and the employee, but now it will be included in the dossier of another public committee and be subject to check, crosscheck, and counter-check. This Gestapo - organization, which is limiting and directing the activities of local governing bodies and of individuals, has requested the following particulars in regard to employees:(<i) Name in full aud .private address ot each employee. (6) Age. (c) Identity caTd number. (<i) Marital condition, (e) Number of dependants. ' (/) Medical classification by official certificate. (#) Capacity in which employed-general . (7i) Particular nature of duties. (t) Number of staff in particular section as at 1/7/1941 and 31/7/1944. This information to be furnished in respect of each section or branch of that council's activities must be grouped separately. The council decided to ask me to protest against its being required to furnish the voluminous information which I have read, in addition to the detailed returns that have already been supplied. In fact, the last return was furnished as recently as the 11th May last, and the information filled sixteen foolscap sheets. The staffs of local governing bodies have already been reduced to a minimum. Honourable members have only to see the condition of the streets, gardens, and parks to know that it is almost a physical impossibility to draw any more staff from the municipalities. Mr BUSSELI. - Is the upkeep of parks and gardens more important than winning the war?",41
240,Mr HAEORISON,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"Complianc e with the request of the man-power authorities in this instance is not likely to assist in winning the war, because long ago every available man was drawn from the staffs of local governing bodies, so that even garbage cannot be removed at certain periods. The health authorities have taken action to ensure that the health of the community shall not be affected. The manpower authorities are promoting a "" paper "" war. I shall give to the honourable member some information that will stagger him. There are sources of manpower that can be drawn on without unduly fretting municipal councils with requests for information, which can be used only to bolster up a newly formed branch of a department. Any honourable member who has knowledge of the formation of .a new department knows that until it gets a staff, files and stationery, it has no prestige. In the same way, until this committee recruits staff and compiles dossiers, it will not be worth a "" cracker "". Supplying this information will not make one more man available for other work. Before attempting to extract the last ounce of blood from the municipalities, the man-power authorities should look farther .afield. After the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) had suggested the holding of a secret meeting of the Parliament to discuss man-power, and particularly staffs of government departments and men employed on defence projects, consternation reigned in some quarters. I believe that a certain project in Sydney was working a double shift of 55 hours with payment for overtime, but immediately the holding of a secret meeting was mooted, this was reduced to one shift of 44 hours. I should like the Minister for Air (Mr. Drakeford) to explain to me what became of the second shift. [Extension of time granted.] The Minister for Munitions (Mr Makin) may be able to give me some information about a matter concerning his department. Recently, a request was made to the manpower authorities to provide an additional 250 hands for a certain job. After the man-power authorities had examined the work, they withdrew 300 hands from it. If this project were examined very carefully, another 300 men might possibly be withdrawn from it. Usually at this time of the year, the man-power authorities make an attempt to find hands for fruit-preserving and jam-making factories, and comb most of the retail stores and banking institutions for young women. If the man-power authorities require additional assistance for government projects, they will probably be able to find it in the government departments and on other government works, where the keenness of the employees has slackened since the Prime Minister's announcement that the war was moving away from Australia. It has also recently come to my knowledge that a certain contractor on the cost-plus system, who - had a staff of men working on board a ship in Sydney Harbour, charged the Government 24 hours a day for them. When the Man Power Department investigated the claim it was found that one shift of men were sleeping on board the ship, but the contractor was charging the Government the full working time of 24 hours for all of them. That shows that in almost every instance where the Government dips its fingers into an industrial enterprise some one takes advantage of it, in regard to either the number of men, the cost incurred, or even the distribution of broadcasting licences. The same sorry spectacle is to be seen right down the line. As the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) is not present, I trust that the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt), who is at present in charge of the Mr Harrison. business of the House, has taken copious notes of my observations, and will draw his colleagues' attention to them. Requests for information of this kind at this juncture represent simply the quintessence of foolishness and stupidity. The Minister should take the matter up with the Director-General of Man Power, to ensure that local councils shall"" not be unduly harassed by this desire to establish one more department under the aegis of the Minister for Labour and National Service.",42
241,Mr BURKE,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"Perth) [10.8] - It has been brought to my notice from time to time that a very desirable National Security (Landlord and Tenant) Regulation introduced for the benefit of the dependants of men in the fighting services has been much abused in actual operation by some of the people whom it was designed to help. As the Attorney General (Dr Evatt) knows, I have been approached on the subject by an organization in Perth, and also by a member of the Western Australian House of Assembly. I have also received the following letter from a woman resident of Maylands:I am writing to yon now to see if you will add your voice to the number already trying to have the act amended so that at least private owners can have their own homes even in preference to soldiers' dependants. In our case, we were willin g to share with the tenant, but the tenant refused to share with us. I became ill with worry, being forced to suffer such hardship at the place where we had managed to get a couple of rooms. Our tenant (after eleven months) decided to allow us to use one room which we had locked, and had never let to them, but we had to make a door out to the sleep-out, as she refused to allow us to enter the front door. Being so desperate we were forced to sign an agreement which refused us the use of the kitchen and the bathroom. We had managed to borrow a little electric cooker, but as it failed the first time we used it , and we have not been able to replace it , I am at present cooking over an open fireplace in my own front room and using a baby's bath and wash-house troughs for myself, husband and two children to bathe in . Don't you thing the soldiers' dependants are carrying things a bit far? The husband in this case is stationed at Fremantle, and is home every night except one night a week. The tenant's excuse is that her two young children are not well, and she wants to give them a fair chance. We have two children, and they need a fair chance, too; after all, this is their home, and we pay the rates, and have taken the responsibility of trying to get a home together, and we need some consideration. I hope that you will at least do your best to have the act amended, as it is causing great hardship to hundreds of people. I ask that a magistrate should be allowed a discretionary power to order that the tenant shall share the house with the owner who desires to return to it, or extend to him some other reasonable consideration. The regulation should be amended to that effect. The mere knowledge that the magistrate has that power will have the effect of making the tenant adopt a reasonable attitude when an owner desires repossession of his home or portion of it. I have known the man mentioned in the letter for many years. At the beginning of the war he sought to enlist, but was rejected for medical reasons: Since then he has been working for the Allied Works Council, most of the time on the Kalgoorlie aerodrome. Work on the portion on which he was engaged has now cut out, and he has returned to the city. His wife and children went back to Perth, but were unable to find a place to spend the night, and the wife was compelled to go to her home, which had been let to a tenant. The woman in the house would not allow her to enter by the door, so she entered by the window. The tenant went out, and next morning called the police to have the owner's wife evicted, even although the house is big and could easily 'be shared. The owner, who is a carpenter, undertook, if allowed back into the home, to build in the verandah to make a sleep-out, and use that to live in. I have spoken to a person associated with the appeals of soldiers' dependants. He tells me that in many instances he is able to make arrangements with the dependants of soldiers. In cases such as this he has endeavoured at times to use a measure of coercion, which he is not entitled to do, and has tried in all ways to make some of these people see that in the present desperate housing circumstances they should make every endeavour to use the accommodation to the best advantage, and recognize that owners who return have some rights. He agreed also that the actions of some of the tenants tended to make the position of ordinary soldiers' dependants practicably unbearable. We must ensure that the fullest possible protection shall be given to all at a time such as this, when housing is such an urgent need. Most certainly we must protect the interests of dependants of members of our fighting forces. We must also ensure that some individuals shall not be enabled by their selfish attitude to make more difficult the problem of housing people who desire to share their homes which they have let to tenants. I trust that the Attorney General will look into this matter as I understand it comes within his jurisdiction. There is a need for the exercise of discretion. I do not think that magistrates would use such discretion unfairly. Rather would they take the opportunity to bring what may be regarded as moral pressure to bear on persons to share with the owners the homes which they occupy. If the Attorney-General can frame regulations to meet this case, he will make much easier the circumstances of many unfortunate people.",43
242,Mr MCEWEN,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"lndi) [10.17] - I support the remarks of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Burke). The case which he has brought to the notice of the House is almost identical with a case to which I drew attention in this chamber about a week ago. On that occasion I stated that, during the absence of his wife in hospital, the owner of a large weatherboard house at Cobram had let his home. Subsequently, he found that he was unable to regain possession of the dwelling, and that half of it had been sub-let to another tenant. After many months of pleading and cajoling, during which this man and his wife were assured by various solicitors that, under the existing regulations, they had no remedy at law, they were permitted eventually to occupy a sleep-out and a very small room which has no stove or internal lighting. When she wishes to enter or leave the portion of the dwelling which has been allocated to them, the wife, who is not long out of hospital, has to clamber through a window. That is the unfortunate position of these people who, after years of saving, managed to acquire sufficient capital to purchase a home of their own. I trust that the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) will direct his attention to this matter as soon as possible.",44
243,Dr EVATT,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,A conference will be held during the forthcoming recess to consider these regulations. It will be attended by representatives of all interests concerned.,45
244,Mr MCEWEN,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"The main matter to which I wish to direct the attention of honourable members to-night is the serious drought which is affecting the whole south-eastern area of the continent, with the exception of the coastal belt. I speak of this matter with some knowledge, as I live within the affected area, and I assure the Government that the drought conditions now prevailing are unprecedented at this time of the year. Australia has experienced several severe droughts. Probably the most outstanding of these occurred in 1902 and 1914 when great national loss was suffered, and many thousands of farmers were ruined. To-day, the recorded rainfall over the whole of the wheat area of Victoria, and, I think, the central and southern wheat belts of New South Wales and adjoining areas of South Australia, is the lowest on record for this time of the year. Recently I travelled from Albury to the South Australian border by car and it was almost impossible to find a paddock coloured green by a crop-this , in what should be one of the flush months of Spring! One can travel for hundreds of miles through this normally fertile region without seeing green grass, crops, or even haystacks, because this is the culmination of a succession of very dry years. I believe that it is not an exaggeration to say that there will be vast areas from which practically every head of live-stock will have to be removed unless horses, cattle and sheep are to be allowed to die on the properties. No matter what helping hand the Government might hold out, this"" would represent tragedy in the lives of many thousands of good Australians. Certainly it would represent a tremendous national loss. I ask the Government, in view of what is not merely a local disaster, but a really national disaster of great magnitude, to consider making available a substantial sum of money for drought relief. It may be argued that the making of grants for this purpose is the responsibility of the States. That argument would carry some weight if the drought were confined to the borders of a particular State, but there is ample precedent for action by the Commonwealth when drought is widespread. The present drought covers a very extensive area and unless some extraordinary and rapid change of weather occurs conditions can only become worse and worse. Normally, farmers in this drought area do not look forward to a break in the season until April, May, or even June of the succeeding year. It can be seen therefore that a long period of drought may have_to be faced. I understand that a Premiers conference will be held in Canberra next week. I suggest that before that meeting takes place, the Government should consider the desirability of making available a substantial sum of money for drought relief, and so be in a position to discuss with the State Premiers the possibility of employing State instrumentalities to determine who shall be entitled to relief, and who shall make the actual distribution. In addition to a straight-out grant for drought relief, the Government might reasonably take into account the higher value of wheat today. Eroni a strictly business point of view, the Government would be justified in making a further distribution on account of the wheat now held in various pools which have. not been wound up. A further advance on account of such wheat would be a tremendous help to wheat-growers. Obviously, drought relief in the form of a bounty on the wheat produced this year would be of little use. A reasonable form of relief might be a grant to tide wheat-growers over this period and enable them to sow next year's crop. Many thousands of those who are involved in this disaster are farmers who, in the past, have harvested substantial crops for which they were paid low prices, and who still have some equity in the various pools from which they hope to obtain further dividends. I shall not discuss today's values of wheat, except to say that, wheat is being sold for export at a price at least three times as high as it was at the outbreak of war. In the circumstances, it is not unreasonable to ask the Government to have regard to the higher value of wheat in the various pools, and on that basis to make a further advance to wheat-growers. A matter which is causing concern to many individuals and organizations, such as municipal councils and subbranches of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, is the acquisition of land, principally rich agricultural land, by persons of alien birth. There are in existence comprehensive regulations which, on occasions, have been reviewed by the Attorney-General-sometime s on my representations-whic h control the acquisition of land by aliens. Those regulations do not entirely deny to aliens the right to acquire land, and they certainly place no limit whatever, other than Treasury conditions, on the purchase of land by people who are in the category of friendly aliens. Frequently, permits to purchase land arc issued to naturalized British subjects, who were formerly nationals of nations which are now our enemies. I shall not, at this stage, argue that any country which claims to be free should deny to persons who become naturalized subjects the right to buy land, but I do contend that the persons who have a prior claim to the rich agricultural land of Australia are the men who, today, are in uniform, fighting for this country. In my opinion, it is an intolerable state of affairs that any man now with the forces who hopes on his return to Australia to take up land in his own district, should find, should he be lucky enough to return, that some Italian or other foreignborn person, however worthy, is the owner of the land which he hoped to acquire. The acquisition of land by aliens is going on to such a degree that I am receiving an increasing number of protests from persons within my own electorate. Generally, the regulations which control the acquisition of land by aliens, or which prevent such acquisition, are sound, and I have not much to say on that subject. There are, however, certain localities where there already exists a substantial aggregation of persons of alien birth. In my own district, Shepparton and Myrtleford are examples.",45
245,Dr EVATT,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"What , type of alien has settled in the Shepparton district?",46
246,Mr MCEWEN,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"They are mostly Italians and Albanians. Shepparton is becoming the focal point for Albanian immigrants. Of 86 Albanians who came to Australia in one year, 82 gravitated to Shepparton. That fact is evidence that these people tend to form themselves into communities. Many of them are good citizens; some of them have fought in pur Army; but nothing will convince me, or the parents of the men who are fighting, that these aliens, however worthy as citizens, should be permitted to become the owners of rich land in districts from which our own young men have gone to fight. I suggest that certain localities where aggregations of aliens exist should be declared "" closed "" areas, in which no person of alien birth, whether naturalized or unnaturalized, should be permitted to become the owner of freehold land or to acquire additional land, until the expiration of a prescribed period after the cessation of hostilities. Worthy naturalized citizens who wish to own land in Australia may seek it in the wide opeu spaces. I hope that the Government will heed my suggestion, and also that it will do something for the sufferers'from drought conditions.",46
247,Mr DRAKEFORD,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"MaribyrnongMinister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation) [10.35]; - Recently , a statement appeared in the press which indicated that members of the Royal Australian Air Force who were on loan to the Royal Air Force and were serving in the India and Burma theatres were not given proper consideration. In the Melbourne Age, of the 23rd September, under the heading ""Forgotten on. Burma front-Australian s with R.A.F."", a critical article appeared. This is apt to give a very distorted picture of the conditions under which Australian air crew personnel are serving in India and Burma, unless the full facts are given and understood. In the first place, it should 'be clearly stated that those members are serving on attachment with the Royal Air Force under the Empire Air Training Scheme Agreement, in exactly the same manner as those serving in the United Kingdom, the Middle East and elsewhere. The same conditions apply also to members of the forces of the other dominions similarly attached to the Royal Air Eorce. The general conditions of service are laid down in an agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Governments of the Dominions, and are known to all Australian air crew personnel, wherever they may be serving with the Royal Air Force. Honourable members may recall that, in June, 1943, I made a very comprehensive statement in this House in explanation of the policy and administrative principles that had been approved for adoption in relation to the granting of commissions and promotions of Royal Australian Air Force air crew personnel. These principles have since been implicitly followed, irrespective of the location of the personnel concerned. That statement also was published in the Royal Australian Air Force official journal Wings in order to ensure that personnel serving in all theatres would be made aware of the policies governing commissions and promotions. The time promotion system for both officers and airmen applies in exactly the same way in India as in other theatres of war in which the Royal Australian Air Force is serving. The commissioning policy is the same; that is, .there is no limit to the number of commissions that can. be granted to personnel on operations, and every member, if not recommended, has the right to make application for a commission. To superintend the application of this policy insofar as personnel in India and Burma are concerned, a Royal Australian Air Force liaison office has been established at New Delhi, and is directly responsible to the Air Officer Commanding, Overseas Head-quarters, London. I admit that New Delhi is a long way from London. They come under the jurisdiction of that officer, because they are serving under the Empire Air Training Scheme Agreement, .and are overseas. It is known that the liaison officer and his staff in India have not spared themselves in safeguarding the rights of Australian air crew in that Mr Drakeford. command. The liaison officer has frequently visited all units in which they are serving. He is aware of each member entering the command, of the member's seniority, and the full details of his service, including the time at which he may become eligible for promotion under the time promotion schemes. I do not merely accept an assurance. When complaints have been made from time to time, steps have been taken to have them brought under notice with a view to having the matter checked, so as to ensure that the men shall not be overlooked. The liaison officer is responsible for the transmission of recommendations for commissions or promotions to Royal Australian Air Force Overseas Head-quarters, London. It is known that he has been doing that work in a very systematic manner, and in strict accord with the approved policies. The statement has been made at times that the percentages of commissions granted are higher in Australia than overseas. My earlier statements on this matter apparently need reiteration. The percentages of personnel holding commissioned rank, in comparison with the total numbers of personnel serving in the various theatres of war, are 11 per cent, over the Royal Australian Air Force as a whole, both here and overseas, 9 per cent, of the personnel serving in the South-West Pacific Area, and 27 per cent, of the personnel serving overseas. Honourable members will agree that 27 per cent, is a high proportion. When I mentioned the matter on an earlier occasion, the number of members of the Royal Australian Air Force in Australia holding commissions was one in twelve, and in Great Britain, where the.fighting was mainly being done at,the time, it was one in five. Over all, it was one in ten. Those figures have been improved considerably by air crew members having become commissioned; now, the proportion of the men serving overseas who hold commissions is better than one in four.",46
248,Mr WHITE,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"The reason is, that 9S per cent, of the men in England are in air crews and, under, this scheme, are entitled to commissions.",47
249,Mr DRAKEFORD,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"Under the scheme, 33 per cent, is entitled to be commissioned on graduation, and additional men to subsequent promotion. I want to remove the impression that the percentage of our men holding commissions is lower than the percentage in other air forces. It is very high. I say emphatically, after inquiry, that the percentage of commissions is higher in the Royal Australian Air Force than in any other Australian fighting service. I regret that details of the proportions holding commissions in each of the overseas areas, namely, the United Kingdom, France, Middle East, India and Burma, are not readily available; but the figures I have cited will demonstrate that a comparatively high rate obtains in relation to members of the Royal Australian Air Force serving overseas. Australian air crew personnel in the Indian and Burma theatres are by no means forgotten or overlooked, as the press article alleged. Everything possible is being done to further their interests, and to ensure they shall be administered in accord with the general policies. sonnel in India and Burma admittedly are sorving under different conditions. I assure honourable members that the basic policies concerning the granting of commissions, promotions, repatriation, and other matters are being applied. The press article also referred to mail facilities and lack of comforts. Certain delays are inevitable in regard to mail and parcel services, because of the irregularity of shipping between Australia and India. The sevenpenny air-letter service established recently now available for the transmission of letters from Australia to Australian airmen in Burma and India. These new arrangements, with the existing airgraph service which has operated for a long time, and the ordinary surface mail facilities and cablegrams, should prove most satisfactory. (No effort is being spared to ensure the implementation of the best mail arrangements possible in all the circumstances. I stress that the Australian Comforts Fund is fulfilling a very important function, by including the Royal Australian Air Force personnel in India and Burma in its distributions of comforts.. This is in accordance with its general policy. A further very pleasing recent development is that the Australian Comforts Fund and the New Zealand Patriotic Fund authorities have provided the Australian Society at Calcutta with the necessary finances to establish and maintain a hostel at Calcutta for Australian and New Zealand personnel on leave, that institution being regarded by the Australian High Commissioner in India as a very important amenity for the benefit of our airmen serving in that theatre. I understand that action is being taken to establish that hostel, which I feel sure will be very greatly appreciated by our men. With regard to the publicity aspects to which the article drew attention, it is agreed that,- in the initial stages of service in India by our airmen, little publicity concerning them reached Australia. A considerable change has since taken place. This may be gauged by the fact that the press releases concerning them numbered four in April, six in May, thirteen in June, five in Per- July, and five in August, apart from the several broadcasts, based on the work of the Royal Australian Air Force in that theatre. Several articles concerning India and Burma by authors in the force have also appeared in Wings. Several page articles, which I have read, have poor appeared in Wings and have been available to the men in India, proving that those men are not being overlooked or forgotten. Honourable members will be interested is to know that some time ago approval was given to three press relations personnel being sent to India. These will provide first-hand information on the work of the Royal Australian Air Force in that area for war correspondents on the spot, and will maintain a steady stream of information to Australia for submission to the press in this country. That organization will also be used as an additional medium for the dissemination of current news from Australia. I have made full inquiries as to the circumstances associated with the reference in the latter part of the press article to the non-acceptance by the official publication, Wings, of a special article written on the Burma front by a well-known Australian journalist, who prepared it at the special request of the then editor of Wings. The journalist, on his return to Australia, offered to submit the article, but the new editor of the magazine, not knowing of the arrangement that had been made, did not accept it for publication. I admit that an error of judgment occurred. I regret that such action was taken, and. conveyed an expression of my regret to the journalist, informing him that, if he would now furnish the article, I would arrange for its publication in Wings. There the matter stands at present.",47
250,Mr RANKIN,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"Bendigo) [10.46] - I draw the attention of the Government to the very serious position of the farmers in the northern and north-eastern parts of Victoria and in the western Riverina. I support the honourable member for lndi (Mr MCEwen) in his statement that the people in those parts of the Commonwealth are confronted with colossal disaster from the agricultural point of view. I visited the area west of Ihe Loddon River last week, and the Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) intends to go there on Saturday week. I hope that ne will take careful note of the conditions prevailing in that area and will report on them to the Government. I regret that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) is not in the chamber to-night, because I believe that the granting of the necessary relief to those people is beyond the capacity of the Government of Victoria. I hope that the Commonwealth Government will recognize the tremendous loss with which this country is threatened owing to the drought conditions prevailing. Many of the settlers will be forced off their holdings. Throughout the fertile area from Ultima to 'Charlton and through to Ouyen, not a crop will return sufficient wheat for seed purposes this year unless abnormal rains are experienced immediately. In many places the crops cannot recover under any conditions. Unless extraordinary rains are experienced, there will not be a living beast throughout those areas by January, except where irrigation has been provided. One can travel over many square miles of country without seeing a dam with water in it. The farmers there have been encouraged by the Government to grow wheat, and a period of eighteen months is occupied in the production of a crop. I trust that the Government will take into consideration the representations of the wheat-growers' organizations that those who fallowed land and prepared it for wheat should receive recompense on an acreage basis. Those who have been encouraged by the Government's promise of a bushel subsidy on oats, to plant additional acreages, should also receive some recompense. If the Government does not do something to relieve them, that great fertile area will be practically deserted by the settlers who have struggled there for generations.",49
251,Dr EVATT,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,To what area does the honourable member refer?,49
252,Mr RANKIN,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"The district west of the Loddon, and west of Balranald in the Riverina. Areas in the western Riverina which carried over 500,000 sheep are today carrying approximately 100,000 sheep. Many farmers who have lived there practically the whole of their lives say that there will not be 20,000 sheep left by Christmas unless exceptional rainfalls occur. These people are not in that position owing only to the fact that no fodder is growing for their stock, but also because chaff and oats are unavailable. Even in the northern areas of Victoria chaff is rationed. People who are asked to produce butter-fat can obtain a certain quantity of concentrates, but it is essential that they should get chaff. The Minister for Agriculture in Victoria, Mr. Martin, has done his utmost to meet the difficulties of the people, but when they go to town on market day, even though they have herds of 50, 60 or 70 cows, they can get only three or four bags of chaff. The production of butter-£at will be reduced tremendously owing to that fact, and the position is one that only the Commonwealth Government can relieve. It could obtain fodder from Tasmania and New Zealand. If the Government desires production to be maintained, it should deal with this serious situation immediately. The people throughout the wheat growing areas have an interest in the wheat pools, and Nos. 5, 6, and 7pools should be finalized. 'The Government should see th.it those people recompensed on the basis of the present prices of wheat; not the prices at which wheat is sold for local milling purposes, for the production of breakfast foods, and for use by poultry-raisers and dairymen, but at the present world price. It is essential that that be done. The settlers should be encouraged to remain on the land, so that, when the drought breaks, they will be able to supply foodstuffs for the devastated countries ' of Europe. In the interests of common humanity, Australia should provide that food. If the Government wishes those farmers to continue to produce as in the past, the responsibility rests upon it to take prompt action. It should be prepared to expend public money in order to keep on the land people who have fought for generations against many hardships. Those are the people on whom Australia depends in order to keep this country solvent, and enable it to take its proper place in the world.",49
253,Mr HAYLEN,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"Parkes) [10.54] - I pay tribute to the new publication of the Department of Information which bears the title of Action, copies of which were made available to honourable members to-night. Reference has been made in the press recently to lack of publicity abroad regarding Australia, and this journal is highly suitable for telling story of Australia's action from the time when its troops were sent to the Middle East until they were fighting in New Guinea. The publication is worthy to rank with any journal of the kind that has appeared in Great Britain or the United States of America. For that reason I have taken advantage of this opportunity to draw attention to its excellence, and to suggest that it should be circulated where it could best tell the effect. story of Australia's part in the present war. I notice in the credit list the name of Damien Parer, who recently lost his life while taking photographs for the United 'States of America, also that of Harold Dick, the Sydney Daily Telegraph photographer, who killed in an air accident in Queensland. About twenty photographers were rehoped sponsible for the pictorial side of publication, and many journalists have are contributed to its success. Action covers the field of war from the infantryman to the paratrooper, and this gives me an opportunity to pay tribute to pressmen who have been referred to as the "" paragraph-troopers "" of this war. Particular mention should be made of those journalists associated with the Department of Information in the publication of Action. It is a splendid job.",50
254,Mr WHITE,COPPER PRODUCTION INMOUNTISAAN D,"Balaclava) [10.55] The Minister for Air (Mr Drakeford) referred to a newspaper article in which it was stated that airmen on the India and Burma fronts had been overlooked in the matter of promotion. I have not seen the article, but I point out that the position could be helped if the Australian liaison officer at Delhi were to inform commanding officers of the promotion procedure. In the Royal Australian Air Force, it is necessary for the commanding officer to recommend a man for promotion before he is promoted. The procedure is different from that in Great Britain and other dominions where some steps are on a time basis, and many English commanding officers do not know our system. The fact that 27 per cent, of our men overseas have commissions is not extraordinary. Under the terms of the Empire air training scheme, up to 50 per cent, is permitted. Moreover, the men themselves should be informed the that if they do not receive their promotion in due course they should apply for it. I have received many letters from men on the India front, and nave referred them to the liaison officer. These men have rendered very gallant service and do not complain unnecessarily. When I was in England in Flying Training Command, I circularized commanding officers informing them of the Australian procedure in regard to promotions with good",50

265,Mr MENZIES,ACQUISITIO N OE GOODS BY,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. What have been the losses of wheat by fire, storm, tempest and flood since the Wheat Boa.vd cancelled its insurance policy, and to what extent have premiums or other moneys been put aside to meet these losses? 2. What has been the extent of loss by fire to stock, plant and machinery in the ownership or under the control of the Government, for which no insurance provision has been made in the ordinary commercial way? 3. Are these losses a charge against the growers or the consumers, or will they be met out of revenue?",53
266,Mr CHIFLEY,ACQUISITIO N OE GOODS BY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The estimated losses in respect of wheat for - the period from 22nd December, 1942, to 30th June, 1944, including claims which have not yet been finalized, total £158,200. These losses were abnormal, the sum of £124,500 being involved in respect of damage due to severe storms in Western Australia on five days in February, 1943. The claims on insurance companies in respect of wheat losses for the three preceding years averaged less than £17,000 per annum. The approximate premium income in respect of wheat for the same period was £96,600. 2. The Commonwealth acts as its own insurer in respect of ordinary Commonwealth permanently owned property, such as departmental buildings, equipment, stocks, &c. No policies are issued in these cases, and losses are not specially recorded, nor are premiums charged. The actual losses on this property would, however, be negligible in relation to the annual premium value of the property calculated at ordinary commercial rates. Losses to the extent of approximately £76,850 (mostly bush-fire losses) were incurred in respect of other commodities, which like wheat, are covered by an internal Commonwealth insurance arrangement. 3. The losses in respect of the commodities referred to in 1 and 2 are financed by premiums charged to the various controlling authorities, e.g. the Wheat Board, at ordinary premium rates based on the experience of insurance companies over a period of years. On this experience it is not anticipated that there will be any final deficiency which would have to be met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in respect of these transactions.",53
267,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,ACQUISITIO N OE GOODS BY,"the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice I. At what price was the last sale of wheat to the United Kingdom made? 2. What quantity was involved? 3. What is the latest offer by the United Kingdom for 5,000,000 bushels or more?",53

269,Mr BREEN,ACQUISITIO N OE GOODS BY,"the Attorney-General, upon notice I. Has the Commonwealth Government power to acquire wheat in the post-war years to f ill Australia's quota for international relief in terms of the International Wheat Agreement? 2. Can the Commonwealth Government acquire wheat to meet Australia's quota under the same agreement for export, thus precluding the States or an individual or groups of citizens from exporting wheat?",53
270,Dr EVATT,ACQUISITIO N OE GOODS BY,The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows:1 and 2. I have referred the matter to the legal officers of the departments concerned. The question is a complicated one and an opinion will be made available as soon as possible. HIGH COURT.,53
271,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,ACQUISITIO N OE GOODS BY,"the Attorney-'General, upon notice I. When did the High Court last meet in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Alice Springs? 2. Is the High Court deficient in the number of justices necessary to enable it to administer justice in all States at reasonable times? 3. If so, does the Government propose to take remedial measures?",53
272,Dr EVATT,ACQUISITIO N OE GOODS BY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:I . The High Court last met in Brisbane this year, in Adelaide in 1942, in Western Australia in 1937, in Tasmania in 1939. As to Darwin and Alice Springs, I point out that the law makes no provision for the court sitting at any place other than that at which a registry has been established. As a registry has not been established at either of those places, the court has not sat at either place. The recent sittings of the Full Court of the High Court at Adelaide was cancelled by the justices, but the court sat in original jurisdiction. There were five cases down for trial before the Ful l Court. I understand that the sittings were cancelled by a majority of the justices, partly by reason of difficulties of transport and partly by reason of the small number of cases. 2 and 3. As to the question whether the court is deficient in the number of justices, I point out that the Honourable Sir Owen Dixon has now left Washington to resume his seat on the High Court bench. However, the - question whether additional justices are required is a matter of general governmental policy and will be kept in view. AUSTRALIAN ABUT : RESEABGH COUNCIL",53
273,Mr FORMS,ACQUISITIO N OE GOODS BY,"On the 21st September the honoraible member for Balaclava (Mr .

AUSTRALIAN WRITERS.",54
274,Mr HAYLEN,ACQUISITIO N OE GOODS BY,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Will he investigate allegations in a recent issue of The Journalist that local authors were ""sweated"", being paid £12 for a 30,000-word novel which netted the publisher £200? 2. As the paper to print these novels comes from the newsprint pool, and many thousands of these novels are printed at a cheap rate, will he take steps to prevent exploitation of the Australian writer, by fixing the remuneration to the author as well as the profit to the' publisher? 3. Will he also consider the question of expired copyright, whereby these 'publishers raprint novels on which copyright baa been lost by effluxion of time, and on which no payment is made, thus depriving local writers of an opportunity to sell their material and frustrating the efforts to develop Australian writing? 4. Will he consider the fixing of a sum to be paid by publishers for the use of books on . which copyright has expired, the money to go into a trust fund for the encouragement of Australian writers?",54
275,Mr CURTIN,ACQUISITIO N OE GOODS BY,"The honourable member's question involves, among other things, rights under the copyright law. Inquiries will be made into this matter. Consideration will be given as to whether the Government is m a position to take any action with regard to other phases referred to by the honourable member. OWEN G>UN.",54
276,Mr RANKIN,ACQUISITIO N OE GOODS BY,"the Treasurer, f e because of special upon notice I. Is it a fact that several months ago Mr Evelyn Owen, inventor of the Owen gun, informed the' Attorney-General that the Taxato tion Department had advised him. that the net amount he might expect to receive from the a payment of £12,500 or thereabouts in royalties on the gun would be about £1,700, which would not meet his present liabilities? 2. Did Mr Owen communicate with the Commissioner of Taxation in July last his liability fOT taxation on royalty payments; if so, what was the text of the 3. Did Mr Owen's invention save the Gomore than £2,000,000 and thousands with of Australian lives? 4. If so, *wiiy has there been such an inand ordinate delay in dealing with the question They of taxation liability and Mr Owen's request that his tax claim be waived as a considerafor handing over certain patent rights? 6. Does he consider that Mr Owen, who has rendered such a signal service to the nation, is deserving of something better than a threat of bankruptcy because of his taxation liability?",54
277,Mr CHIFLEY,ACQUISITIO N OE GOODS BY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows;1. The Commissioner of Taxation is not aware of any such advice having been given to Mr Owen, though rt is quite .probable that Mr Owen did discuss the extent of his liability with the Taxation Department in Sydney. The tax as calculated by the Commissioner is very much less than is suggested in the question. 2. Yes. The text. of the reply was that the royalties paid in respect of the gun were subject to taxation, that the provisions of the pay-as-you-earn taxation in relation to the transition year will have the, effect of substantially reducing the liability, and that it was desired that be would submit copies of his agreements with Lysoghts with regard to the assignment of the patent rights. The Commissioner subsequently advised Mr Owen, after examining the agreements, that his liability to tax. in respect of the royalties was not affected by the agreements. 3. The Treasurer is not in a position to answer this question. 4. There has been no inordinate delay in dealing with the question of the taxation liability or his request to waive the tax claimed in consideration for handing over the patent rights. Mr Owen's return for the year ended 30th June, 1944, was only forwarded to the department on Sth September, since when the basis of the appropriate assessment has been receiving the Commissioner's consideration. I understand that arrangements have been made by Mr Owen's representative to discuss the figures with the Commissioner personally. 5. The Commissioner of Taxation has never issued any threat of bankruptcy to Mr Owen, nor could any such threat be issued prior to the determination af the actual liability. In the meantime, all that can be said is that Mr Owen's representations both to the Commissioner of Taxation and to the Commonwealth Government with regard to the transfer of the patent rights will receive due consideration. BANKINGANDMONETABYPOLIC Y.",54
278,Mr SMITH,ACQUISITIO N OE GOODS BY,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. What amount of central bank credit has been used to finance the war since the Labour Government took office 7 2. Have treasury-bills been issued for the full amount of such credit? 3. Are treaaTiry-biHs given to private banks oa security for the compulsory deposits of surplus funds? 4. What amounts of treasury-bills, if any, have been given as security? 5. Is the central bank credit that has been created listed as forming part of the national debt of Australia? 6. If it is part of the national debt, will taxation collections 'be used to pay interest on such part of the debt, and to whom or what institution will such interest be paid? Mr OniixEY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. and 2. Central bank credit has been made available by the Commonwealth Bank against treasury-bills to finance the amount by which war expenditure has exceeded the available revenue and .public loon raisings of the Government. The amount of treasury-bills discounted by the bank for war .purposes since this Government took office and at present current is £342,780,000. 8. No.. 4. See answer to 3. 6. Treasury-bills form part of the national debt. 6. The answer to this is broadly ""Yes"", although, since the departments of the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Savings Bank are the principal holders of treasury-bills, part of the interest is returned to the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to this extent taxation is not needed to pay the interest. A small part of the interest is paid to other holders of treasury-bills, such as trading banks and State savings banks.",55
