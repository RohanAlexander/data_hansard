0,NA,Unknown,"get practical and business-like propositions and not visionary ones. Let us consider the proposal to make power alcobol from sugar cane. I presume it is generally admitted that from the cassava plant, which of all commercial starch-bearing plants, chemists are agreed produces most alcohol, it is possible to manufacture' 40 gallons of power alcohol per ton. I believe it has been proved up to the hilt that it is possible to get only from 18 to 20 gallons of power alcohol from a ton of sugar cane. For the purpose of comparison I take £1 7s. 6d. as the cost of producing a ton of cassava which will make 40 gallons of power alcohol. This gives the approximate basic cost of power alcobol for raw material as 8£d. per gallon.",40
1,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"If I wished to float a mine, I should like to get the Minister to write it up.  bers will realise that I am trying to give the House the information in my possession. I shall touch upon other points later on. It is generally admitted that, a ton of sugar-cane will make from 18 to 20 gallons of power alcohol. If the growers want to get 30s. per ton for their sugar-cane, and contend that that is the lowest cost of production, then the cost of power alcohol made from sugar-cane at 30s. per ton will be for raw material Is. 6d. per gallon as compared with 8£d. per gallon for raw material, if the power alcohol is made from cassava. Stating the matter in the reverse way, if the basic material cost should not be more than 8^d. per gallon' of power alcohol produced, the sugar-cane would need to be sold at 13s. per ton. I do not think that any honourable member connected with the sugar industry will contend that sugar-cane can be produced at that price, and give a reasonable return to the grower.",40
2,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"No ; but unfortunately it is being sold at that price now, because there is over-production.  member, who seems to know a good deal about these things, will the sugar-growers be satisfied to sell their cane for the duction of power alcohol at 13s. per ton ?",40
3,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"No ; and it is estimated by Mr Seymour-Howe that the industry will be able to pay the in £2 per ton.  the matter appears to Mr SeymourHowe, or to any one else, but it is admitted that 40 gallons of power alcohol can be produced from a ton of cassava. One ton of sugar-cane will produce only 18 to 20 gallons of alcohol. Either the sugar cane-growers must sell their cane at 13s. or 14s. per ton in order that it may compete successfully with cassava as a raw material for the production of power alcohol, or the difference between 13s. per ton and 30s. must be made up to them by the payment of bounty. This would necessitate increasing the proposed bounty from 4d. to Is. per gallon. Reference has been made to the Tariff Board. I remind honourable members that two or three gentlemen gave evidence in favour of this scheme for the production of power alcohol from cassava, and others were invited by advertisement in the press to come forward in opposition to it. I know that some people intended to do so, but did not. The board's inquiry was held in public, and evidence was taken on oath. All persons interested must have been fully aware of it, and the investigation was wholly in accordance with law, precedent, and business practice. The honourable member for Perth (Mr. Mann) urged, as an objection to this bounty, that the manufacture of power alcohol from the sources mentioned in the bill will inevitably raise the cost of food. Mr SPEAKER. - If the honourable member is replying to the discussion in . committee this morning he is not in order.  the general principles of the bill, reviewing generally the arguments that have been advanced against it, and endeavouring to give the House fresh information. The Fuel Research Board in London is very miich interested in the manufacture of power alcohol within the Empire. The petrol supplies of the Empire are very unsatisfactory, and scientists of the highest standing have given their approval to the basis of the scheme laid down in this bill. The honourable member for ""Wide Bay pro- (Mr Corser) and the honourable members for Macquarie (Mr Manning) and for Lilley (Mr Mackay) showed, a clear understanding of the relevant facts of the scheme. If it is not a commercial success the Government will pay nothing. The company's proposal is backed by a capital of £25,000, provided by the Plane Creek Sugar Company, and guaranteed by the Queensland Government, and a Similar amount is to be invested by the British Distillers Company. These are business people who presumably know what they are doing. They have shown their faith by investing their capital. We know very well that even if the whole of the molasses available in Queensland were converted into power alcohol the production would be equal to only about one-tenth of the total requirements of the Commonwealth. The Plane Creek Power Alcohol Company was registered in Brisbane in December last, a distillery is in process of erection, machinery is en .route to Australia, and it is hoped that power alcohol will be produced within a few months. The partners in this company are the Plane Creek Central Milling Company, the Australian Estates and Mortgage Company Limited, the Distillers Company Limited, and the International Sugar and Alcohol Company Limited. The capital is equally divided between the Australian and British companies. There will be three Australian directors, and only two British directors, and Mr Alexander Innes, chairman of the Plane Creek Sugar Mill, will be permanent chairman of the Alcohol Company. By agreement the management will be in the hands of the directors of the Plane Creek Sugar Mill, who will have the right to call upon the British companies for all technical advice they require, and for the use of such of their patents, rights, or processes for production of power alcohol as may be applicable to Australia. Honourable members know, as well as I do, that the mere co-operation of the greatest aggregation of distillers in the world with their tical, technical, and all-embracing knowledge of the distillation of power alcohol, and the fact that they have invested their money in this venture, constitute almost a guarantee that it will be a success from the commencement. With regard to cassava, approximately, 140 farmers have already planted experimental areas in the districts supplying the Sarina Sugar Mill. Last year the Queensland [81 Government sent an agriculturist to Java to study cassava growing. That is a most appropriate place for its study, because, last year, 6,500,000 tons of cassava was produced there. The planting in Queensland has been carried out under Government supervision, and I understand that the State Government spent, at least, £2,000 in sending the expert to Java, and bringing back the plants. Only the specially-selected tubers which the Government imported from Java have been planted, and, in spite of the fact that they were two months old at the time, and that the planting was done at an unfavorable season of the year, the growth has been good, and the prospects of a reasonable return from the first year's cultivation are distinctly encouraging. Although I described this proposal as modest, I say, deliberately, that any further practical proposals will be very carefully considered by the Government, regardless of whence they emanate, or the source of supply to which they relate. But before the Government will submit to the House any definite scheme for assisting other ventures it must receive, aud thoroughly examine, concrete proposals. Much has been said of prickly pear. I do not know of any developments that would be to the greater advantage of Australia than a scheme which would turn to profitable account a pest that is over-running so many millions of acres of land in northern New South Wales and Queensland, but the proposal to produce alcohol from this source has not yet advanced to a commercial stage. I have in my possession confidential papers relating to Dr Sinclair's investigations. They tend to confirm the statement. I made in the House this mornthe ing, that the production of power alcohol from prickly pear is not yet beyond the laboratory stage, and until it is placed on a commercial basis no proposition can be considered by the Government. The people pracinterested, however, have asked the Government to assist them by lending the services of a responsible chemist to help them with their further investigations. The Government proposes to do that, because it realizes the magnitude of this proposal, and the desirability and urgency of testing it thoroughly. I turn now to the objections which have been voiced by some honourable members who have spoken, concerning the position of the Accounts Committee in connection with these power alcohol projects. I introduced this bill in June of last year, and I then made a definite promise that its further stages would be postponed u n t i l the report of the Public Accounts Committee had been received. I made that promise in the last Parliament, which has gone to the limbo of the past. We have today to deal with things as they are. I invite the enthusiastic co-operation of all lionorable .members to help in solving the many difficult problems with which we are faced. Seeing that we have now reached the stage at which I made my previous promise, I am prepared to say, on behalf of the Government, that the consideration of the bill will be postponed if the Public Accounts Committee will , within two or three weeks, submit a report on this very important question. If that report is not received within that time, I will place upon the table of the House the notes of the evidence given before the last Public Accounts Committee, so that honourable members may be in possession of all the information it is in my power to obtain for them. I would again place the simple issues before honourable members: This is not a bill for giving a bounty on the production of power alcohol from molasses. No bounty is asked for on molasses. It is a bill to encourage the production of cassava, for, without a crop supplementary to molasses, we cannot hope to manufacture any reasonable proportion of Australia's power alcohol requirements. Question resolved in the affirmative.. Bill read a second time and committed pro forma. HOUR OF MEETING .

In committee (Consideration of Governor General's message): Motion (by Mr Bruce) proposed- . 'That it is expedient that au appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a .bill for an act relating to the encouragement of prospecting for petroleum' oil.",40
4,Mr R GREEN,PRECIOUS METALS PROSPECTING,"Richmond) [3.39] I should like the Prime Minister to give me some information. Will any part of this appropriation be used for the purpose of encouraging prospecting for oil in the mandated territory of New Guinea ? Also, what will be the amount of the appropriation ? ' Mr Bruce (Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.40] - The Bill will not provide for the encouragement of prospecting for oil in the mandated territory. It will deal only with State and Federal territory in the Commonwealth. The' amount of the appropriation will be £60,000. Mr R. GEEEN (Richmond) [3.41] The mandated territory is virtually a part of the Commonwealth. A peculiar situation, which puts - that territory in a different category from Australia or Papua, has arisen there. In Australia Dr Wade has, after due investigation, made a re-port to the Government, and we also have a report by him regarding Papua. I understand, also, that the Government is financing an oil company to explore for oil in Papua. In the mandated territory nothing has been done to explore for o i l , except the sending of an expedition, which BILL. touched only the coast, and a short distance inland. The exploration work whichthat expedition did was possibly very good, but it covered only a relatively small part of the possible oil-bearing area of New 'Guinea. My complaint at the present moment is that the mandated territory of New Guinea, which is really a part of the Commonwealth, and where there is more likelihood of finding oil than anywhere else in the Commonwealth, is not included in this proposal. Apparently the Government will leave it to interested persons to prospect for oil there. More consideration might be given to the claims of the Australian companies that are exploring for oil there. They should reap some of the benefit of the subsidy. I approve of the cancellation some time ago of the offer of a reward of £50,000 for the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, for if any one finds oil in commercial quantities he will not mind spending the £50,000 reward to celebrate his good fortune. Assistance should be given in the initial stages of prospecting. It would seem that everything that isfor the good of the mandated territory isspragged. I recognize that international difficulties might arise if; oil were found in the mandated territory. Oil appears to be responsble torday for 60 per .cent, of the international misunderstandings that arise. ' Under the mandate of the League of Nationswe are not allowed to. fortif y the territory, and if we should find oil in large, quantities: there the discovery might avail us nothing if. another country attempted to take it from us. Leaving all that on one side, however, I hope that even at this late hour the Government will reconsider its decision and permit prospectors in the mandated territory, as well as those on the mainland, to share in this subsidy. After all, only an artificial boundary separates Papua from the mandatedterritory.",42
5,Mr BRUCE,PRECIOUS METALS PROSPECTING,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.4-6] - I understand perfectly the views expressed by the honourable member for Eichmond (Mr E. Green), and. I agree with him that probably New Guinea is the most important oil-prospecting area under the control of the Commonwealth. But this bill has not been designed to cover any great effort in oil exploration. The amount involved is only £60,000. It is really the outcome of the visit to Australia of Dr Wade, whose report was at least sufficiently encouraging to justify the Governmeut in making the amount available. have, as the honourable member remarked, spent considerable sums of money in oil exploration in - the mandated territory, and I regret that the results have not been more satisfactory. Possibly we shall have to spend still more there, but I do notthink that the matter can be dealt with adequately in this measure, which is merely the fulfilment of. the forecast in the Treasurer's budget speech of last year. I ask the. honourable member not to ojvuose the motion, for it is. always open for'him to make representation to the Government on the bigger question of its policy with regard to oil exploration in the mandated territory. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported and, by leave, adopted. Ordered That Mr Bruce and Dr Earle Page do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing, resolution-.

6,Mr BRUCE,WESTERN AUSTEALIA GRANT,"Flinders-Prime Minisr ter and Minister for External Affairs) [3.50] - I m o v eThat the House do now adjourn. I take this opportunity of remedying an omission from my speech in the Addressin-Eeply debate yesterday. One of my main purposes in participating in that discussion was to offer my congratulations to both the mover (Mr Gullett) and the seconder (Mr Abbott) of the motion for the adoption of the - Addressin-Reply. Although it is somewhat late, I congratulate both those honourable gentlemen on their efforts, in what must always be a trying ordeal. They acquitted themselves with great credit. It augurs well for the future of this Parliament that it is able to obtain recruits of such a high calibre. We Mr THOMPSON (New England) [3.52] - I direct the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Pratten) to a great injustice that has been done to a number of firms in Australia through the delay in the' delivery of their imported goods on account of the British seamen's strike. It happened that quite a number of ships that were in Australian waters before the introduction of the last tariff, were unable to discharge their cargo on account of the strike. In consequence of this delay the goods became dutiable, and although the department has been approached with a request that, in the circumstances, the duties on them should not be collected, its attitude has been most unsatisfactory. It must appeal to honourable members as unfair that increased duties should be imposed upon these goods, for they wore in Australian waters before the increases were announced. T should like the Minister for Trade and Customs to explain to the House the policy of his department in cases such as this. I consider that the firms concerned have been most unfairly burdened.  Trado and Customs) [3.53] - There is a legal difficulty in the way of doing what the honourable member desires. During the last Parliament I had, on several occasions, to explain the practice of the department in answering . similar questions. The legal position is that it iB obligatory on the Minister to collect the duty current on the date of importation and the date of entry. That position can only be altered by parliamentary action at some future date. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bouse adjourned at 3.54 p.m.",43
