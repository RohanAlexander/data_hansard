2,Mr GUY,Unknown,Is the Minister for the Army aware that a man named Anthony Vye Georgio Paddon was proceeded NA DEPARTMENT. TRANSFER OF OFFICERS TO SYDNEY.  - for Trade and Customs whether a large number of Commonwealth officers resident in Canberra have been transferred to Sydney in order to do duty there'in connection with transactions under the LeaseLend Act of the United States of America ? Does the honourable gentleman consider that the transfer is fair to those officers ?,11
3,Mr HARRISON,TRADE AND CUSTOMS,"The answer to the initial inquiry is ""Yes"". The reason is, that the Government of the United States of America is rapidly taking control of all vital and essential commodities for export, and our setting up of an organization in Sydney is necessary in order that we may avoid delay in obtaining a fair proportion of those commodities that we need. Expeditious handling of the matter is essential in order come any possibility of unemployment, due to our failure to obtain vital raw materials. The endeavour was made to secure the necessary accommodation in Canberra, but it was found that office, hotel, and housing accommodation was not available, and that there is not here a field ±n which the labour required for the work of this particular department may be recruited.  for Customs state the number of families which it is proposed to transfer from Canberra to Sydney? What is to become of the houses they vacate in Canberra? Are they to be sub-leased to other tenants? How is the work whch those officers previously did in Canberra to be done after their transfer?",12
4,Mr HARRISON,TRADE AND CUSTOMS,This move represents an amalgamation of the Import Licence Section with the newly established Division of Imports Procurement. The officers previously engaged in the Import Licence Section will be transferred to Sydney. Arrangements regarding the disposal of their houses are in the hands of the Department of the Interior. NA COMMISSION.,12
5,Mr FADDEN,SECRET FUNDS ROYAL," by leave- I have to inform the House that, ,at the request of the Commonwealth, the Government of New South Wales has made available the services of Sir Percival Halse Rogers, a justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, to act as a royal commissioner to inquire into certain matters - affecting public administration which were referred to in Parliament last week. The commissioner will inquire into and report upon (1) the circumstances under which public moneys were used for or in connection with the activities of the Australian Democratic Front, and to whom and for what purposes such moneys were paid; (2) By whom, to whom, for what purposes and under what circumstances payments totalling £300 were made in the month of March, to over1941, to one J. Winkler, and what became of such moneys; (3) The circumstances attendant upon the making of trunk-line telephone calls from the rooms of the Minister for Defence Co-ordination at Canberra on Friday, the 12th September, 1941, and Saturday, the 13th September, 1941, and in particular whether in the course of such conversations or any of them there was any disclosure of the Government's budget or financial proposals to any and what person; (4) what material the printers and/or publishers of the following newspapers, namely, the Advertiser, Adelaide; the Herald, Melbourne; the Telegraph, Brisbane; the Sun Neius-Pictorial, Melbourne; and the Courier-Mail, Brisbane, had before them when they published in their issues of the following dates, respectively:-the 18th September, 1941; the 19th September, 1941; the 19fch September, 1941; the 20th September, 1941; and the 20th September, 1941, paragraphs referring to such trunk-line telephone calls, and from whom, by whom and under what circumstances such material was obtained. A preliminary hearing of the royal commission will take place at the Supreme Court, Sydney, at 10.30 a.m. on Friday, the 3rd October, at which persons who desire to be represented before the commission should attend. As the Attorney-General (Mr Hughes) has announced, Mr W. W. Monahan, KC., and Mr E. J. Hooke, of the Sydney Bar, have been briefed to assist the commission. It is anticipated that the taking of evidence by the commission will commence in Canberra on Wednesday, the 8th October, at an hour to be fixed.",12
6,Mr HUTCHINSON,SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"What is the reason for naming certain newspapers in the terms of reference to the royal commission, and omitting to name other newspapers which published identical matter ?",12
7,Mr FADDEN,SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"The matter was placed in the hands of the Solicitor General, who conducted an investigation in order to ascertain what newspapers were affected. If other newspapers published similar material they, too, will be included in the terms of reference. Inquiry is being made into that matter.",13
8,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"Are the terms of reference sufficiently wide to allow the royal comission to hear evidence with respect to the reasons why the Government acted against the Communist party by means of counter propaganda? Will it be competent for the royal'commission to call witnesses in order to disclose the nefarious activities of this organization in Australia, and to expose those responsible for them?",13
9,Mr FADDEN,SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"If the honourable member will place his question on the notice-paper, I shall bring it to the notice of the Attorney-General and the Solicitor General.",13
10,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"It has been under the notice of the Attorney-General for two years, and he ought to have done something in regard to it.",13
11,Mr FADDEN,SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,He has been very active in respect of it. NA TRAINING. EXEMPTIONS.,13
12,Mr DUNCAN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"HUGHES - Can the Minister for Labour and National Service yet make the statement which he promised about a fortnight ago, regarding man-power and reserved occupations, pspecially with respect to rural industries?",13
13,Mr HOLT,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"I intimated to the House 'ast week that I hoped to make this statethe ment at an early date. I now hope to do so in the course of the budget debate. Last week, I mentioned the revision of exemptions which had been made desirable '.n order to ease the labour situation rural areas. I have since been in personal touch with the Premiers of all of the States, and have asked them to have a survey made urgently through the State Departments of Agriculture and other appropriate State instrumentalities, in order that the Commonwealth may be advised of their likely man-power needs in connection with the forthcoming harvest. It has been represented to me that in some of the States, more particularly in Victoria and South Australia, the problem will not be met simply by retaining the existing labour in rural areas, but that such labour will need to be augmented in some degree if the harvest is to be garnered. I have informed the Premiers that, so soon as they are in a - position to communicate their needs and to suggest ideas as to how the problem may be met, a conference of appropriate Federal and State officers will be arranged in order that necessary steps may be taken to overcome any labour shortage.

Motion (by Mr FADDEN) agreed toThat Government Business shall take precedence over General Business tomorrow. BUDGET 1941-42. In Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from the 25th September (vide page 581), on motion by Mr FADDENThat the first item in the Estimates, under Division No. 1 - The Senate-namely , "" Salaries and allowances, £8,470"" be agreed to.",13
14,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"Fremantle-Leade r of Opposition) [3.13] - What we have to consider in this budget is, in effect, the problem of the ways and means of war. I put it in that way because I think it is that the whole world-and more in particularly our enemies-shoul d know that whatever may take place in. this Parliament this week will not in any way affect the complete unity of the Australian people, or the determination of this Parliament as a united body to prosecute the war to a successful conclusion. We are here concerned with how we can best and most fairly organize the nation so as to secure the greatest possible degree of efficiency in the cution of the war, and in that way the more early attain victory. Ways and means of war involve a consideration of the relationship of people to one another, and of how we shall get those things which are requisite for the conduct of the war. The war is a physical thing. It is fought by fighting men, supported by the economic strength of the civil population. The fighting men have the first claim upon anything the country can do. The families of the fighting men have the first right to any special privileges that the country is capable of conferring in time of war. It is important that we should ever keep in mind the fact that no amount of legerdemain in the form of either fantastic theories of credit inflation, or of taking money from the poor, can add anything to the physical capacity of the country to wage the war. We cannot fight this war by inventing money; we can fight it only with guns and material.', with the physical things that soldiers and fighting men use, and we cannot add to the sum of those things by merely taking away from the lowest paid and most poorly circumstanced sections of the community that which is essential to their physical strength, and therefore to their morale. The Labour party regards this problem as one of social organization. When a government begins to tax incomes of £150 for the purpose of financing the war, it is beyond all doubt taking everything that the people in receipt of those incomes possess. Such persons are being called upon to give everything except their lives. Everything they have must go. Their standards of living go at once. They are the first victims of the sacrifices imposed by war. Our view is that, apart from the soldiers and their families, the persons on low incomes should be the last victims of financial policy. It is no new thing for the Labour party to be in opposition to the financial policy of the Government. We were opposed to it a year ago. We have been opposed to it in principle for more than 25 years, and more particularly since 1924. Our conception of how to organize Australia socially and economically is different, apparently, from prosethat of the Government, and different from the plan upon which this budget is founded, and upon which the last budget was founded. Let us consider the problem of the fighting forces. Without divulging actual numbers, I can say that there are about 400,000 men in the fighting forces of Australia today, and they have a great number of dependants. They are the men who are doing the real work of war. Behind them the workers are performing the task of providing the fighting forces with the equipment of war. The Government, since the war commenced, has made six proposals indicating its opinion of what is a fair thing to do for the fighting forces of Australia. As a matter of fact, in iN'ovember, 1939, in this very chamber, the present Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) contended that the Government's first proposal was to pay to the soldiers 5s. a day, and a meagre 6d. for each child. I merely cite that example without regarding it as a proposal, because it was put forward by the present Minister for Commerce at a time when he was not a member of the Government. Thus, I shall disregard it, and discuss the proposal which the Government actually brought down on the 5th November, .1939. That proposal was to pay to the soldiers 5s. a clay, with Is. deferred pay, 2s. 6d. for a wife, and 9d. for each child. It was not acceptable to this Parliament, and therefore the Government brought down its second proposal, which still prescribed 5s. a day and Is. deferred pay for the soldier, but raised the rates for his dependants to 3s. a day for the wife and Is. a day for each child. Improved conditions had been extracted from the Government. In December, 1939, as the result of constant pressure from this side of the chamber, the Government brought own its third proposal, which was to ii'rease the deferred pay of the soldier (< .> - ' j. a day after embarkation. That was one more concession wrung from a government which, apparently, was not disposed to regard the soldiers as having i lie first claim on the financial resources of this country. A year passed; in November, 1940, the Government introduced its fourth proposal which provided for an increase of the child allowance to Is. 6d. a day. The Government's fifth proposal was introduced in December, 1940. It provided that the soldier was still to get 5s. a day, and 2s. a day deferred pay, the wife 3s. a day, and Is. 6d. a day for each child, and, in addition, a wife with a child, or children, was to be given an extra 7s. a week. The 4xth and latest proposal of the Government provides that the soldier shall be paid 5s. a day, with 3s. a day deferred pay after embarkation; the wife is to get 3s. a day and Is. 6d. a day for each child; whilst a wife with a child, or children, is to receive 7s. extra a week, or if without children, she will get an extra 3s. 6d. a week.",13
15,Mr HOLT,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,Chil d endowment operates 'n addition to those rates.,15
16,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"Yes , as it does hi respect of the the rest of the community. It will be seen, therefore, that since men were first invited to volunteer for service in the fighting forces of a country which, if the fighting men are worsted, will be lost and its liberties destroyed, six successive steps have been taken by the Government, each of which has been taken, not as the result of its own conception of what is the fair thing - n do, but as a grudging concession to either political opposition in this chamber or to public opinion in the country. In the present proposals of the Governsum ment, as set out in the budget speech of the Treasurer, the soldier is still to get nnly 5s. a day in addition to his deferred nay. I shall take a wife with two children as the basis of my remarks in respect ->E allowances for dependants of soldiers because, having regard to the fact that child endowment operates in respect of the families of soldiers as for the rest of the community, that appears to be a seasonable basis. The wife of a soldier is to get. £1 Is. a week for herself and 7s. a week extra on account of having a family, and also 21s. for her two children. That makes 49s. a week. She will receive also 3s. a day allotment from her husband, making a total of 70s. a week. I emphasize that this woman's husband is away with the fighting forces and thai she is under the constant strain of great mxiety; yet she is to be paid £1 a week less than the basic wage! I put it as fairly and as temperately as I can that that is not the way in which this country should evaluate the services which the fighting forces render to Australia in this war. That is one of the cardinal objections to the budget which we on this side have. We say to the Treasurer that the £6,000,000 which he proposes to incur as an annual liability-to be redeemed in the future by some other government-is an obligation which should be met out of the present resources of the country and be paid now to the fain Hies of the soldiers.",15
17,Mr FADDEN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"The whole of the £6,000,000?",15
18,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"The Government is already committed to pay about £350,000 of that amount to the wives of soldiers us a charge on this budget.",15
19,Mr FADDEN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"About £300,000.",15
20,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"1 made a liberal estimate. The Treasurer now says that £300,000 of that £6,000,000 is to' be met out of present revenues and paid this year. The budget contemplates that thai amount, which represents the extra allowance to be paid to the childless wife of a soldier, is to be paid to her at once. I do not wish to be misunderstood. A of between £300,000 and £350,000 is to be paid out of revenue this year to the wives and families of soldiers. We submit that the whole of the £6,000,000, including the £300,000, should be paid to the soldiers and their families in the present year. We say that it is reasonable and proper to regard that payment as the primary obligation of this country, in addition to the other obligations that are recognized in the budget. The Treasurer properly makes no demur about many other items of expenditure which he says this country should meet this year. No other item of expenditure in this budget which all agree should be met in this year can be considered by reasonable beings to constitute a greater obligation than that of treating our soldiers and their families fairly. I decline to say, or to accept the argument if it be put forward, that this country cannot afford to pay £6,000,000 more to the families of the fighting services in this present year out of this budget. Honourable gentlemen opposite may ask where the money is to be obtained. I am not in control of the Administration, but I am certain that economies could be effected, taxes revised and adjustments made, which would enable at least £6,000,000 to be found. [ put it to the Government, and to the Opposition and the country, that we are really evading our obligations to the soldiers by saying to them that when they return from the war they shall be paid the £6,000,000 which is now promised in this budget. It is the constant practice of the Government when confronted with the argument that soldiers and their families should be treated more fairly than they are being treated to answer that argument by increasing their deferred pay. The Government knows that that practice does not increase the present resources of the soldiers and their families, or enable them to meet their present problems. It merely passes a liability on to posterity, and means that in the post-war period the soldiers will be included in the same category as bondholders or ordinary lenders of money. A soldier has a stronger claim on the finances of this country than has any money lender. I pass that aspect of the subject by saying that a budget which contemplates leaving the wife of a soldier who is fighting overseas with less resources than the basic wage on which to maintain herself and two children is fundamentally a budget which ought not to be acceptable to this Parliament. I do not propose to indicate other of new or additional expenditure that might reasonably be budgeted for. I merely say that the Labour party, if it held office, would feel an obligation to increase invalid and old-age pensions.",15
21,Mr SPENDER,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"The Labour party might feel the obligation to increase those pensions, but would it do so?",16
22,Mr CUB,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,TIN - Yes .,16
23,Mr SPENDER,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,Where would the Labour party obtain the necessary money ?,16
24,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"I know that the granting of an additional Is. a week to invalid and old-age pensioners would impose-upon the budget an extra burden of £1,000,000 a year. I say that quite frankly so that the country may fairly understand what is involved, and know that I am not entering an unrealisticworld.",16
25,Mr FADDEN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,B y what amount would the Leader of the Opposition increase invalid and old-age pensions?,16
26,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,I would increase them immediately to at least 22s. 6d. a week.,16
27,Mr BADMAN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,The original policy of the Labour party was to increase those pensions to 25s. a week.,16
28,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"The Labour party, upon assuming office, would immediately increase invalid and old-age pensions to at least 22s. 6d. a week, and if I had charge of the Treasury I would ascertain how far, having regard to all the requirements of the country, I could go beyond that figure.' I have said that I would find £6,000,000 for soldiers and their dependants. The granting of an additional Is. a week to invalid and old-age pensioners would increase the amount to £7,000,000.",16
29,Mr MCEWEN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,The Leader of the Opposition has criticized the Government for having increased the soldiers' pay shilling by shilling. Tell us the whole story about invalid and old-age pensions!,16
30,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"The Minister's colleagues, with the assistance of all the items experts of the Treasury, have been engaged for ten or twelve weeks in examining all the minutiae of the economic and financial resources of the country. Now I. am asked to answer offwithout hand, where I would get this, and how I would do that. I say to the> Minister definitely thatat least I would provide £6,000,000 for the families of soldiers, authority. and at least I would raise invalid and old-age pensions to 22s. 6d. a week. I would he ready to incur, in the present year, for those purposes, an expenditure' of at least £7,000,000 more than the amount that the Government proposes. That is clear. I do not wish to hide anythis thing. It would not be fair to the country for us to seek to dodge real issues. But those are two items which I would increase, as a part of the proper way in which to organize the social life of the country. And I would do these things on a basis of greater equity than proposition. is at present the case. However, the Government does not propose - to ""increase invalid and old-age pensions and has adopted towards soldiers' pay a different course from that advocated by the Oppofair sition. When I ask for improvements the general set-up of the community, Government says in effect that there not be any. The Government also declares that must take from the community a very large sum of money. New imposts in^the budget are to increase receipts from come tax by £5,500,000, whilst loans are to bring in an additional £25,000,000. Individuals will be so taxed that the Treasury will derive from them an addideferred tional £3,000,000; companies will provide an extra £2,500,000. Furthermore, perthey sons and companies are to lend comcontribution. pulsorily to the Government £20,000,000, and £5,000,000 respectively. Those repredebts sent the new sources of revenue from the community which the Government conlar templates. The underlying idea is that by compulsory loans the community will be forced to reduce expenditure upon' civil consumption so that greater proinstance! duction will be made possible for purposes. Even the lowest ranges of come are called upon to make what is called a "" national contribution "". I put it to the committee that Parliament, at this juncture, is not obliged to adjust differences which exist in State taxes unless that adjustment can be effected Sir. Curtin. impairing the physical standard of the community as a whole. The right remedy for having' seven taxing authorities is to substitute one taxing",16
31,Mr FADDEN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,Giv e us the practical remedy.,17
32,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"The Government, of which the honourable gentleman is the leader, is in charge of the country at juncture. It could take the requisite steps, if it had the courage to do so.",17
33,Mr FADDEN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,What steps?,17
34,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,The steps to bring about one taxing authority in Australia.,17
35,Mr SPENDER,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,It is a very simple,17
36,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"The Government declares that its proposal is based upon its desire to adjust what would be an unimpost upon a citizen in one State of compared with that borne by a citizen the in another State, because of the canfact that States have varying rates of taxes. How does the Government make this adjustment? It admits we that the adjustment will not be permanent, but will remain in force only during the war. At the conclusion of inhostilities, the Commonwealth will owe money to the citizen who lives in a lightly taxed State. He is placed in the same category as a soldier, who will receive pay. Under the Government's plan, irrespective of the State in which reside, citizens will make a national But when the war ends, citizens in lightly-taxed States will have due to them by the Government, whilst citizens who are in receipt of simiincomes but who live in heavily taxed States will not be similarly placed.",17
37,Mr MCEWEN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"T u Quoensland, for war Mr. Curtin - In Queensland, and inin some other States. As the Commonwealth does not tax an income of £100 a year, I shall take as the bedrock figure for purposes of illustration, an income of £150 a year earned by a person with no dependants. In that case, the national contribution would be £31 Is. from which has to be deducted Federal tax and State tax. In the highest taxing State, the latter sum would be £7, so that the national contribution would be £4 Is.",17
38,Mr SPENDER,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,What a terrible thing!,18
39,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"This is an example of what the Government describes as "" equality of sacrifice"". A man who earns £150 a year and who has no dependants is to be called upon to pay, in this manner, nearly £1 a month.",18
40,Mr FADDEN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,That is on a taxable income of £150.,18
41,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,The proposition is simple. The national contribution is £11 Is. of which the highest taxing State receives £7; the taxpayer's post-war credit will be £4 Is.,18
42,Mr ANTHONY,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,The State Government will get £7 of the £11 Is.,18
43,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"That is so. I have taken a case which, from an arithmetical point of view, is the worse examplethat of a man without dependants in receipt of an income of £.150.",18
44,Mr FADDEN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,Taxabl e income?,18
45,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,No ; actual income.,18
46,Mr FADDEN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,Actua l taxable income.,18
47,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"I put it to the committee that the State taxes which have been imposed upon those in the lower ranges of income during the past ten years have, in themselves, been a great deprivation to those taxpayers. They have been excessively severe; but they were imposed for the purpose of getting this country out of a previous crisis. The poor had t,o carry the burden of that struggle. Why must £4 Is. be taken by the Commonwealth in addition to State taxation from a person receiving only",18
48,Mr FADDEN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,Because we want to finance and win the war.,18
49,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"No ; the Government gave a number of reasons. One was that it wished the people to spend less money. When we come to incomes in the range of £800 to £2,000 a year, however high the tax, however great the national tribution, there is no obligation on persons in those categories to suffer anything that can be described as in the nature of deprivation. So far as equity of sacrifice is concerned, there is a vast difference between the burden placed on the man with an income of £150 and the man on a much higher income because, after meeting the whole of what is called the national contribution, the latter has suffered no deprivation in respect of food, housing and the ordinary amenities of life. The only restriction he has suffered is in respect of his investible margin.",18
50,Mr FADDEN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,What does that mean: does it not mean unemployment?,18
51,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"I am now dealing only with what is called equality of sacrifice for the purposes of war. I have described war as a physical thing, and I also describe sacrifice as a physical thing.. That kind of budget which obliges one family to go without boots and does not oblige another family to go without boots does not impose equality of sacrifice, and. demonstrably, to impose a national contribution on those in receipt of income*below £300 a year is to cause absolute deprivation of some of the essentials of life. But it does not mean the same thing to those in the higher ranges of income. What happens to the man with an income of £300 per annum who desires to send his son to a university or to pay for some other form of training? Possibly the son has enlisted in the armed forces and the father hopes to set aside something for the boy on his return. He cannot continue paying the insurance premimri on his own life in order to provide capital for the son when he returns; but the man who has an income of £2,000 or £3,000 a year could do so.  £150 a year ? his deferred pay.",18
52,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"I am not denying that the deferred pay would be useful, but I am insisting that £6,000,000 could be more usefully expended now in order to maintain the standard of life of the dependants of the men in the fighting forces. We are fighting this war with physical things-wit h guns, with mateconrials and men; we are not fighting it with money. It is all very well to say that the contribution of £33 from an income of £250 can be paid. Of course it cau be paid; but the man who pays it cannot retain the same outlook on life as that of a man who, with an income of £3,000 a year, has to pay £1,543. The latter would still have nearly £1,500 left. We are told that there is to be equality of sacrifice, but will there be equality of purchasing power in these two men? If both have to look for a house and one has £1,500 after he has paid everything and the other has only about £220 after he has paid everything, who will get the house?",18
53,Mr ANTHONY,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"What about the man on £1,000 a year? Mr. Curtin"" - The national contribution of a taxpayer in receipt of £1,000 a year is £282. That still leaves him with over £700. No physical hardship is imposed on the man with an income of £700 or even £500 clear of national contribution. We may deprive such a man of an opportunity to invest for his old age; we may deprive his wife of the opportunity to give all sorts of entertainments in her home; we may rob this country of a great deal of fashionable glamour; but we are not imposing any physical hardship on a man or woman when he or she is left with a net purchasing power of over £500. The childrenof such people will not be 3tinted of bread or the other requirements of existence. But when we step down into those categories of income receivers below £300, having regard to their obligations and the fact that so many of them are soldiers, we are not really diverting civil consumption to military purposes, but are greatly endangering the physical capacity of the country to withstand the demands of the war, for the majority of the workers in the factories and the majority of the men in the fighting forces are in receipt of less than £400 per annum. I remind the committee that the Dominion of New' Zealand had a system of compulsory loans, but that in the last budget presented to the New Zealand Parliament there is no continuation of that policy. I find that the Leader of the Opposition, who holds viewsopposed to those of the Labour party, congratulated the Government on having abandoned it .",19
54,Mr ANTHONY,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,Ne w Zealand has not abandoned taxation.,19
55,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"I quite understand the necessity for taxation for the purposes of the war. however high it must be. But this is not a system of taxation; it is a system under which certain persons will pay £44 per annum as a national contribution. When the war is over, the Government will repay £25 to some persons in some States and £8 4s. to some persons in other States. I do not believe in this system of compulsory loans which will bring in a total in the present year of only £25,000,000. Receipts from the sale of war saving certificates have reached a considerable sum each year. I warn the Government that the policy of compulsory loans, if adopted, will probably dry up that source. Thousands of people in Australia regularly contribute from their incomes for war saving certificates. The Government cannot expect not to lose money from that source if it imposes a national levy of the sort contemplated. In two years the sale of war saving certificates has brought £23,00,000 into the Treasury.",19
56,Mr SPENDEH,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,Not a very good effort for two years.,19
57,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"A very good effort, indeed ! The Prime Minister knows that war saving certificates purchased voluntarily have yielded £11,500,000 per annum. At the very best, he proposes by compulsion to obtain £20,000,000 per annum from the people.",19
58,Mr SPENOEK,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,Does the Leader of the Opposition think that the purchase of war saving certificates has affected the standard of the living of the people?,19
59,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"No , I do not believe that voluntary contributions in any way affect the standard of life of the community, because those who find that they have the money to spare give it, believing that to be their duty. The people of Australia have subscribed money. It must be borne in mind that, apart from the subscriptions to war saving certificates, the public of Australia has subwith scribed to the ordinary loans. The Minister cannot tell me that there not been very many subscriptions small amounts to loans.",19
60,Mr FADDEN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,There have been.,20
61,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"Does the honorabout able gentleman then think that his compulsory savings plan does not threaten, not only sales of war savings certificates, but also the subfunctioning scription of small amounts of from to £100. to war loans? This is a free country, and its people voluntarily to its aid with their resources of hood and wealth. Does the honourable gentleman not think that he is proposing acceptance of a system which will not yield much more than the volunof tary system? The honourable gentleman wants to equate, as he thinks he because can, the purchasing capacity of people on the same income in different year States. He wants to correct the problems of federation in order to have a more effective war campaign. He gains nothing by that effort; on the contrary he espouses a principle which can be suspected of being a preliminary step to the applicamay tion in a larger measure of that principle to the defence of the country! Having instituted compulsory savings, the Government would say, "" Wo have pulsoriJy called, up loans. Why not compulsorily call up men for service seas ? """,20
62,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"Hear , bear!",20
63,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"I fully expected honourable member for Barker to say that, but this Government has professed time and time again to be opposed to the honourable member's ideas.",20
64,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,This Governan ment will have to come to that decision,20
65,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"Well , I do not intend to help it to come to it by accepting principle at this stage. It is not conscripout tion to borrow from the public, loans really put the assets of the into safer custody than would be the if the Government did not become responsystem, sible for the ultimate repayment. The Prime Minister has said that even the voluntary loans, and even withPrime out doing justice to the soldiers, have he is still dependent on central of bank finance. He has made with the banks what he call3 a firm agreement under which they are to accept the decision of the Commonwealth Bank the use of certain deposits. I point out that what has happened in this country since the war began is, by and large, that the Commonwealth Bank, as a central bank, has ad£50 vanced accommodation to the Commonwealth Government. As the result, the come Commonwealth has paid money to the manmanufacturers who have paid it to the workers, and that money has filtered to the trading banks, whose iuvestible funds have become available for the purpose earning interest. Now, that fact is accepted by the Government as being true, that is why this "" firm"" agreement has been reached. I find that in the 1940-41 the trading banks' advances decreased by £17,000,000 and that government and municipal securities rose by £24,000,000. What has happened is that the trading banks have lent less to the public and more to the Government. That be considered the proper thing to do. very but what has happened? On the 30th June, 1940, the interest-bearing deposits comof the trading banks amounted to £268,195,000 as against £268,408,000 on over the 30th June last. But deposits not bearing interest have jumped from a total of £170,000,000 to £189,000,000. Thus, the banks have an additional £17,000,000 of funds on which they do not pay in the terest, and they have an additional £24,000,000 worth of government securities on which they are earning interest. I simply cite those examples. I say to the Treasurer and to the country that I cannot agree that because there has been issue of credit by the Commonwealth --'t to the Government, therefore, a new field of profit-earning should he opened the up for the private trading banks. Withdivulging anything which I believe because that I ought not to divulge, I rich say frankly that the amount of case national credit which the banking including the Commonwealth Bank, has made available to the Government for the prosecution of the war during the last two years is itself complete proof that everything the banks said-and , worse, everything they didwhen the Labour Government was in power from 1929 to 1931, was motivated not by sound banking practice, or by conpaper sideration for the national interest, solely by the desire to destroy a governresponsive ment that they did not like. Where the money to come from? That was cry. It all had to come from the people.",20
66,Mr SCULLIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,""" Real "" money!",21
67,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"Yes , "" r e a l "" money; we heard of it until we were sick of it. In those days, you could not issue credit to the nation through the banks in order to employ people at useful work; but the honourable gentleman says, there £60,000,000 of it in this budget? For what? To provide work for the people of Australia, or to assets for the future of this country ? In rhe sense that an insurance policy can be construed as an asset, we should "" Yes"" to that. If we like to regard anything done for the safety of the country as part of an insurance proit gramme, I should say "" Yes "". But hanks could not provide such money order to construct water supply systems, or health services for inland cities, order to develop Australia's wealthnational producing capacity, when thousands our men were unemployed and unvalues, counted capital resources were idle in this land, and people were hungry because they could not get jobs of of any description. With memories not of those times I say that, despite the things the banks now unsay and the opposite courses they are now ready to pursue, simply because a government of the type they like is in power, this Opposition is not prepared to permit the credit of the nation, however it is made available, to become a source of parasitism for sectional private interests, 'therefore, one fundamental objection which we take to this budget is that places the national credit at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government in --uch a way as to permit a third party to make a profit out of it. We submit that nothing requires doing in respect of the management of national credit for the purpose of prosecuting the war which the Commonwealth Bank itself is not entirely competent to do. The honourable gentleman's "" firm agreement "" is not worth the on which it is written, because the but Commonwealth Bank Board itself is too to the interests that I am now was criticizing to handle this matter as the it should be handled. The honourable gentleman and, I think, his colleagues, know of recent discussions which certain of my colleagues have had with representatives of the Commonwealth Bank Board. I say nothing about those representatives except thisand I say it after a great deal of reflection- I do not consider that Sir Claude as Reading's conception of how this country is can be best served is in the best interests of Australia as a nation. I shall make no further reference to the produce Commonwealth Bank Board. Boiled down, the basic differences besay tween our views and those of the Government are that the Government does not treat the soldiers fairly; that does nat treat persons on the lower the ranges of incomes fairly; and that in it does not, having regard to the economies of Australia, treat the manageor in ment of national credit in a truly way-that , whereas we regard of the budget as an accountancy of human the Government looks at it as an accountancy of material values. We do not object to the highest possible degree taxation of all whom such taxation will involve in any physical deprivation.",21
68,Mr SPENDER,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,A general phrase; what does that mean?,21
69,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"Le t us say the greatest possible taxation of incomes of £500. or £600, and over. When the honourable gentleman was Treasurer, he tried to catch me on this same point. He then said that it was not possible to do anything, but he moved step by step towards it the very proposition I had then made. I have not the least doubt that - before this war is over, no person with an income of £1,000, £1,500, or £2,000 a year will be said to have that income as his personal right. If we are to fight this war collectively, we must have some application immediately of what people are describing as the ""new order"". But there is nothing of a new order in allowing people at the top of the income scale to meet all of their financial contributions to the war without having to go without anything requisite to their subsistence. The honourable gentleman sometimes talks about non-essential industries. If we are dealing with essentials, and we are obliged to restrict civil consumption, we must not allow the restricted supply of civilian goods to be the subject of competition between a man who has £1,500 to spend and another who has only £150 to spend. The correct way in which to trtjat that problem is by rationing.",21
70,Mr SPENDER,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,That is precisely what the Government is doing.,22
71,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"It is the very reverse of what the Government is doing. Obviously, if one man with a wife and three children has £1,500 to spend after he has met all of his obligations under these schedules, and another man with a wife and three children has a margin of only £220, there is no equality of competition in . the market for services or goods as between those two persons. The honourable gentleman has put forward a budget of taxes as though that could establish some equality of sacrifice of purchasing power for an everfalling supply of commodities. Let it be made certain that the man receiving £1,500 a year can get no more loaves of bread, no more suits of clothes, and no more wireless sets than the man earning £250 a year. That is the right way to tackle our economic problems-o n the basis of reasonable justice and equal opportunity for all. We are opposed to the budget because of the principles upon which it is founded and the plan that has been formulated in order to carry it out. For this reason I move That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""while that the expenditure requisite for a maximum prosecution of the war should be provided by Parliament, the Committee is opposed to the unjust methods prescribed by the budget, declares that they are contrary to true equality of sacrifice, and directs that the plan of the budget should be recast to eusure a more equitable distribution of the national burden.""  cannot accept the amendment in its present form. May's "" Parliamentary Practice lays down, and the practice has been followed consistently in this House, that no amendment may be moved which is not relevant to the grant under consideration. Each resolution for a grant of money is by a distinct motion, which can be dealt with only by being agreed to, reduced, negatived, or withdrawn. It is further laid down by May that the committee can attach no conditions or expression of opinion to a grant. The proposed amendment is therefore not in order, and I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that, in order to effect his purpose, he should move that the amount be reduced by a nominal sum.",22
72,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"Then I m o v e That the first item be reduced by £ 1. I do so for the following reason:That, while agreeing that the expenditure requisite for a maximum prosecution of the war should be provided by Parliament, the Committee is opposed to the unjust methods prescribed by the budget, declares that they are contrary to true equality of sacrifice, and directs that the plan of the budget should be recast to ensure a more equitable distribution of the national burden.

73,Mr MORGAN,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"the Minister for the Army, upon notice I. Did the Army authorities thoroughly test out a device known as the ""Wales differential"", an Australian invention designed to overcome single wheel spin, a major weakness in difficult terrain in conventional motor vehicles? 2. Were such tests made over two years ago at the instigation of the Army authorities? 3. Were such tests satisfactory? 4. Following such tests, did the Army authorities add such equipment to its stores list and requisition for same to the Department of Supply and Development? 5. Did that department investigate the manufacture and nominate a firm for the manufacture of such equipment about twelve months ago? 6. Has the business board withheld authority for such manufacture and the consequent establishment of a new Australian industry? 7. Has the business hoard or other authorof ity entered into negotiations with any organization with overseas affiliations or control for the testing or installation of alternative equipment? 8. What is the limit of authority of the Department of the Army to purchase equipment without reference to the business board?",23
74,Mr SPENDER,COMPULSORY MILITAR Y,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Tests were carried out with two vehicles fitted with Wales differentials. 2. These tests commenced approximately two years ago. 3. The tests were satisfactory from the point of view of mechanical operation. 4. A proposal for the purchase through the Ministry of Munitions of a quantity of differentials was submitted to the business board for consideration. 5. Investigation into possible manufacture was carried out by the Department of Munitions about twelve months ago. fi. The Board of Business Administration, which is an advisory body, gave careful consideration to this matter, in close collaboration with the Business Manager of the Department of the Army and recorded that it was unable to recommend that approval should be given for the adoption of the device. The opinion of the Ministry of Supply, London, has since been obtained by the Department of the Army. The report received supports the recommendation made by the business board. 7. The business board has not entered into any such negotiations as those referred to. No information is available as to any other authority having done so. 3. £10,000. ROYALTY PAYMENTS ON WAR MATERIALS.",23

79,Mr CALWELL,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETARY COMPANY,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited was permitted to import lead pencils painted with a gold paint and bearing the inscription ""BHP. Safety Bonus-Safet y Pays.

IMPRESSMENT OF RIFLE S. Mr .SPENDER - On the 24th September the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Duncan-Hughes) asked the following question, without notice:Is the Minister for the Army in a position to make a statement regarding the recent announcement that .303 rifles were to be Made in impressed from members of rifle clubs? Whiit is the present position, and what is the attitude of rifle clubs in the matter? I now inform the honourable member that directions to commands to implement a recent War Cabinet decision to provide for the impressment of .303-in. rifles are in the course of preparation. These will be issued in the near future. The War Cabinet decision was to impress all .303-in. rifles with the exception of the following : (a) Those held by persons for the purpose of earning their living (e.g., buffalo-hunters); (6) Match rifles BOARD : which it was agreed at a conference between General Brand and the AdjutantGeneral would include only those rifles of service pattern which had been imported into the country for match purThe matter of impressment of rifles and the method of implementing it have been discussed with the chairman of the Commonwealth Council of Rifle Associations, who is in accord' with the arrangements. In addition to the above, thcof the Victorian Rifle Associaare as tion has been co-opted to assist in working out the details of impressment. PETROL RATIONING .",25
83,Mr SPENDER,INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"On the 25th September the honourable member for Lang (Mr . Mulcahy) asked, without notice, whether, in view of the hardship suffered as a as a result of petrol rationing by persons whose means of livelihood are depenrate dent on motor trucks, instructions would issued to the State Liquid Fuel Control Boards that truck-owners should receive a more liberal allowance, and also if inquiries would be made as to whether the number of motor vehicles to be seen at golf courses and beaches at the weekends are not using petrol for pleasure purposes. The Minister for Supply and Development has furnished the following reply :.Sufficient petrol is made available to meet the minimum requirements of all essential services. On the production of satisfactory evidence as to essentiality of a service and the inadequacy of an existing ration, State Liquid Fuel Control Boards are empowered to grant an increase. Private users are granted an arbitrary ration equivalent to approximately 1.000 miles' running per annum, and their allowance varies from 2 to 6 gallons a month According to the horse-power of the vehicle. TASMANIAN STEAMER FARES.",25
84,Mr HARRISON,INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"On Thursday, 25th September, the honourable member for 'Bass (Mr Barnard) asked the Minister for Transport a question, without - notice, concerning the - rates of secondclass fares for sea transport between Tasmania and the mainland. On inquiry, I have ascertained that the Acting Prices 'Commissioner recently approved an increase of the fare by 5s. for the journey by sea between the mainland and Tasmania to offset higher costs that have been borne by the company as a result of the war. Many methods of securing the increased revenue were examined, but the increase of second-class fares was, in all the circumstances, considered the most satisfactory. NA PARLIAMENT.",26
85,Mr MENZIES,SERVICE MEN AND MEMBERS OF,"On the 28tb August, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. James) asked the following question, forbidding without notice:Is the Prime Minister aware that the commanding officers of various sections of the defence forces have issued instructions to all members of those forces that they must not take grievances to members of Parliament; is the Prime Minister aware that those instructions mean that service men have no appeal to other than those who inflict punishment upon them and that the men have been denied their civil rights; if the men have no appeal to their local members, to whom can they appeal ? I have now been advised that the position in the three services is as follows:Navy - Unde r regulation 123 of the Naval Forces Regulations, naval personnel are forbidden to take their grievances to members [24] of Parliament. The King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions, Article 10, which are applicable to the Royal Australian Navy, provide a means for naval personnel who have grievances to represent their complaints to superior authority. Briefly stated, a naval rating may make a complaint to his captain. If he is not satisfied with the decision of his captain, he may request that his complaint be forwarded to the rear-admiral commanding, and if still not satisfied, he may rcquest that it be forwarded to the Naval Board, of which the Minister for the Navy is president. Army - On the 9th June, 1941, a Military Board circular was issued to commands drawing attention to the fact that from the number of .representations made to members of Parliament or directly to high Army authority, it the appeared that - members of the Military Forces, particularly those who have not served previously, were ignorant of the procedure by which they might seek redress of any grievance. This procedure, as laid down in Military Regulations, provides that if a soldier considers himself wronged, he may complain in succession . to (a) - h'is company, &c, commander; (&) his commanding officer; (c) his brigade commander; (d) his formation, & c . commander; (c) if out of the Commonwealth or on war service in the Commonwealth, the officer in chief command of the force to which he belongs; and (/) the Military Board. Commands were instructed that regulations in regard to the redress of grievances were to be explained (not merely read) to all members of units at frequent intervals and that members of the Military Forces were to be informed not only of their opportunities, but also of the delay which must arise if they attempted to secure redress in unauthorized ways ant: that they were committing a breach of military custom and regulations if they did so. It wst? further instructed that each commanding officer, when bringing under notice the provisions of the regulations, should make it clear that members of the forces will not be penalized in any way as a result of lodging a genuine coinplaint or grievance in the proper manner. Air Force - Instruction s are in existence members of the Royal Australian Air Force to take grievances to members of Parliament. The importance of an adequate system for the ventilation of individual or collective grievances, and the need for the existence of satisfactory machinery to give effect thereto, are, however, fully appreciated. An elaborate process has therefore been provided in A ir Force Regulation 153, which provides that if an airman considers himself wronged, lie may complain in succession to («) his flight commander; (ft) his squadron commander; (c) his commanding officer; (</) the air or other officer commanding the command in which the airman is serving: (e) if outside Australia or on war service in Australia, the officer in chief lominnnd of the force to which he belongs; and (/) the A ir Board. In addition, a member of the A ' r Force may make a complaint to an inspecting officer. Regulation 153 further provides tn»t any authority to whom a complaint is made or referred shall not attempt to prevent or dissuade any airman from carrying his complaint to a superior authority in accordance with the regulation and that each authority mentioned shall cause the complaint to be investigated and if it appears that the airman has suffered a wrong, shall cause the wrong to be fully redressed, if full redress is within the power of the authority, or, if investigation or full redress is not within the power of the authority, shall refer the complaint to the next superior authority in order that it may be investigated and redressed as far as possible. It will be seen that, whilst members of the forces arc forbidden to take their grievances to members of Parliament, adequate provision has been made whereby they may have their grievances fully ventilated. NEW GUINEA : TRANSFER OF CAPITAL",26
86,Mr SHEEHAN,SERVICE MEN AND MEMBERS OF,"the Minister for External Territories, upon notice I. What is the estimated cost of the proposed transfer of the Now Guinea capital from Rabaul to Wan T 2. What government buildings is it proposed to erect at Wau? 3. What town planning scheme;: are under consideration, and has any decision yet been reached regarding the lay-out of the town? 4. Is it the intention of the Minister to the town planning scheme and proposed government buildings to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for report?",27
87,Mr MCDONALD,SERVICE MEN AND MEMBERS OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The decision of the Commonwealth Government is that the Administrative Headquarters should be transferred from Rabaul to Lae. The committee which investigated the question of the transfer estimated in 1038 that an expenditure of £370,000 would be involved. Reliable estimates of the cost under existing conditions arc not yet available. 2. The transfer is to be made to Lae, not Wau. It is proposed ultimately to provide at Lae buildings sufficient for the office and residential accommodation of the complete personnel of the Administrative Head-quarters. For the present it is proposed to restrict expenditure to a minimum and to utilize existing buildings at Lac and Snlamaua and to erect at Lae such temporary buildings as may be. necessary. 3. The Administrator of the Territory has been asked to submit detailed proposals in connection with the proposed transfer including plans for the layout of the settlement at Lae. The engineering member of the committee which investigated the question of the selection of a site for the Administrative Head-quarters submitted his views and a plan for a town on modem lines at Lae. 4. The matter will be considered when the plans for the complete Administrative Headquarters at Lae are prepared. DEFENCE FORCES: DEPENDANTS' ALLOWANCES; ACCOMMODATION AT DARWIN; LEAVE ; COMMISSIONS ; ALLOWANCES TO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT; AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE ENLISTMENTS.",27
88,Mr MORGAN,SERVICE MEN AND MEMBERS OF,"the Minister for the Army, upon noticeWill he take appropriate steps to ensure that deserted wives and dependants of members of the fighting services will receive their allowances as of right from date of enlistment and not ii.t the discretion of such member? SITE.",27
89,Mr SPENDER,SERVICE MEN AND MEMBERS OF,"The purpose of dependants' allowance is to meet current maintenance expenditure, and the question of payment to deserted wives involves the investigation of so many complicated questions of fact that it would not be a practicable arrangement to pay allowances from the date of enlistment as the honourable member suggests. The regularefer tions provide that a claim by a deserted wife and dependants for allotment from the pay of a member of the Military Forces shall be subject to investigation as to the merits of the case. If claim is upheld an allotment is enforced by the prescribed authority.

95,Mr SPENDER,SERVICE MEN AND MEMBERS OF,"I appreciate the honourable member's desire to satisfy himself that equal opportunity to gain commissioned rank is afforded to all members of the forces according to their qualifications, and I am in accord with this principle so far as it is practicable.

I assure the honourable member that the matter raised by him is constantly under attention to ensure observance of the principle of equal opportunity, but as it is not apparent that any useful purpose would be served by submitting to the House the list he suggests and as a considerable amount of research would be involved in its preparation, I am unable to accede to the honourable member's request.",28
