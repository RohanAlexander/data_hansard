2,Mr SHARP,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"I rise on this occasion to represent the opposition in this matter as shadow minister for transport. Obviously this relates to my own responsibilicies ties within the opposition's ranks and, as it also deals with matters regarding aviation, am also on this occasion representing my operations. colleague Senator Parer who is the shadow minister for aviation---obviously not a memflight ber of this House but a member of another place, so I shall be representing him on this occasion as well. I am pleased to see also that a number of my colleagues from this side of the House will be speaking on the amendments brought forward in the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 as they deal with a wide range of issues regarding transport, indeed, with every sector of transport-aviation, road, rail and maritime transport. So it is quite a comprehensive bill dealing with all aspects of In doing so, I might commence with the amendments that are related to aviation. This, of course, is an omnibus bill bringing together many different changes to transport legislation in the one bill. The aviation components of the bill before us deal with changes to the Air Navigation Act 1920. The principal purpose of those, as I understand them, is to place restrictions and requirements on the ownership of shares by Australian airlines. I think I am right in saying that it is to do with the sale of Qantas and other airlines, that it reflects government policy in its attempts to privatise certain airlines and imposes requirements in relation to foreign ownership and so forth. by The opposition has no argument with that aspect of the legislation. The next aviation component of the bill deals with the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Act 1959. It reflects concerns about the amount of insurance for passengers on commercial airline operations, and it comes as a consequence of a campaign that I have been involved with for some 18 months-ever since the Monarch aircraft crash of June 1993 in which seven people were killed. I knew six of the seven people who were killed. The crash took place in my electorate and I initially carried out some very minor investigations to see whether I could assist the families of the victims of the crash. In that process, I discovered the inadequaof our requirements regarding insurance. It appeared that, in reality, insurance was not I compulsory for certain commercial airline Indeed, it was possible for passengers to climb aboard a commercial airline in Australia, thinking that they were properly insured, only to discover that they were not properly insured. Even many of the ones who were insured were not aware that the liability for insurance companies amounted to a maximum payment of $180,000 per person affected by an airline accident. So it became apparent to me-and, of course, to a lot of other people-that our arrangements regarding insurance for people who flew on commercial airlines were inadequate. It seemed totally inequitable that it was compulsory to have third-party insurance for cars yet it was not compulsory for airlines to have insurance for people who travelled on their services. It was also inequitable that, if you had an accident on an aeroplane, the maximum payment from an insurance company was $180,000. The experience with Monarch proved the point very well. Members of this House would be interested to know that, 20 months after the Monarch crash, families of the victims of that crash have not received a cent from the company that insured Monarch. Not one single cent has been paid by Avsure, which is owned by Rural and General Insurance Ltd. This is despite the fact that Monarch held a paid-up insurance policy. Despite that fact, none of the families of the victims has received a cent from the insurance company. This gives us an opportunity to reflect on other accidents that have occurred. Another accident that affected people in my electorate took place in 1980 when an Advance Airlines plane crashed at Sydney airport. A number of people were killed in that accident, most of whom came from Temora. Their case ultimately took 14 years to resolve. It was not resolved until about April of last year. Fourteen years after the crash, insurance and other claims were finally settled. I think that, after 14 years, each family of the victims of the Advance Airlines crash received a grand total of $45,000. You can see from both of these examples that insurance arrangements for commercial airline passengers in this country have been most inadequate. I raised these matters in a speech I made to the House in May last year. I am pleased to say that the minister responded to that in June or July of last year by ensuring that insurance is compulsory and by ensuring that the maximum payout is increased from $180,000 to $500,000, which is the subject of this amendment before the House today. Even though it is a sizeable increase in the maximum payout that a victim of an air crash can receive, it still leaves a great deal of inequity. If those people on the Monarch crash had been made, say, paraplegics as a consequence of the crash rather than being killed, the maximum payment they could have received from insurance would have been $180,000. I put it to the members of this House: do we honestly believe that $180,000 would adequately compensate people who have been made paraplegics as a result of an accident? Anybody who thinks about it would realise that $180,000 would be lucky to cover the medical costs involved in an accident such as that. Certainly, $180,000 would not be sufficient to cover medical costs as well as provide sufficient income for those people to survive on for the rest of their lives. Compensation of $180,000 is totally inadequate. Whilst this amendment increases the amount, I pose the same question: is $500,000 adequate to cover all of the costs incurred by people involved in an aviation accident, given that they have to meet the cost of their medical expenses as well as have sufficient funds left aside to provide them with an income for the rest of their lives? Even $500,000 will not be sufficient to provide people with all their needs-to cover their medical bills and have enough set aside for the rest of their lives. Whilst it is an improvement, I still do not think it is adequate. It is inequitable because we have seen many examples of somebody being made a paraplegic as a result of a car accident and receiving several millions of dollars in compensation. Whilst it was not a consequence of a car accident, a family member of a member of this House was involved in a very unfortunate and tragic incident which caused them to seek compensation. The amount of compensation that person received is adequate-it is in the millions of dollars. I draw this to our attention because on a day-today basis we see people involved in incidents and accidents who are permanently affected as a consequence. Some victims are made quadriplegics or paraplegics, some lose a limb, or some are unable to work for the rest of their lives and they receive millions of dollars in compensation; yet, if the same consequence occurs to a victim of an air crash, the maximum sum they can achieve is $500,000. I put it to the members of this House that $500,000, even though it is an increased amount over what was there before, is still inadequate to compensate the victims who survive air crashes and suffer long-term damage to their health or to their physical well-being. It is an improvement but, in my mind, it is not good enough. Some would say, 'Surely you can sue the company because airlines are owned by big companies or by rich people.' Let me deal with that issue. In the case of the Monarch victims, the company was a two-dollar company. You might try to sue the owners or directors of that company to see whether you could get further compensation for the injuries incurred, or the losses incurred, as a result of that Monarch crash. But the reality with a two-dollar company is that a great deal of expense would be involved in taking the matter to court, and the likelihood of getting any money out of a company such as that is virtually zero. The owner of Monarch-in this case a fellow by the name of Greg Scarf-has so far got away with the outrageous events of that accident completely scot-free. Despite the fact that he still operates a very substantial business, still lives a very prosperous lifestyle, law is such that you cannot get to those sorts of people and get compensation from them. So you are dependent on governments setting in place proper insurance arrangements so that you can at least go to an insurance company and try to get money from it in a proper, reasonable and fair fashion. It raises the whole issue of how we look after people involved in aviation accidents. I would like to think that we could go beyond these sorts of amendments and look at other means by which we could further ensure that people involved in accidents are properly compensated. I would like to be able to involve people such as Greg Scarf, who as I mentioned earlier owned these airlines, in the future in these sorts of compensation claims. I think it is immoral that people who operated such an unethical and shonky airline as Monarch were able to get away with it scotfree, without having to fork out a single solitary cent, without bearing any punishment for the manner in which they operated their airline. This measure is designed to more adequately compensate people involved in aviation crashes. For that reason, the opposition is happy to support the bill. I know, as a consequence, people in the industry will say that this is a bad measure because it will add further costs to the operations of airlines. There is no doubt that it will add further costs, and I do not deny that possibility. But I pose the question to people who own these airlines: do they genuinely believe that, if they were made a paraplegic, a quadriplegic or were hurt permanently as a consequence of an aviation crash, they could live on $180,000 for the rest of their lives, after paying all the medical costs involved in that accident? The truth is that they could not. I doubt they could do so even with half a million dollars. Whilst people in the industry will complain about this measure and say that it adds cost to the operations of their airlines, I think any fair-minded person would say, 'This just has to be so.' It certainly will not disadvantage individual airline operators vis-a-vis competition because it will affect every airline operator. They will all have to pay the cost. Their the competitive position against one another will not be altered. For that reason, I think this amendment should be supported by both those in the industry and by all members of this House. It will be certainly supported by those people who have been affected by aviation accidents over the years and by all people in the community. It is a good amendment. In my view, it is not yet adequate enough because it still does not place a person involved in an airline accident on par with someone involved in a car accident, or a workplace accident or in an accident caused by some other event. Whilst those people can get several millions of dollars in compensation, someone involved in an aircraft crash can get only $500,000. At least it is a positive step forward. The other component of the legislation deals with some internal arrangements to the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 in a similar fashion to the way that it deals with internal arrangements to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990 and to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983. In each case, the legislation gives the minister the right to express views to those government business enterprises. In return, it gives the minister the right of a proper and well-argued response from those government business enterprises. One would think that this would go without saying. If the minister responsible for a particular government business enterprise wanted to express a view to that enterprise, one would think that the GBE's board members and staff would listen and willingly respond to that view. But we have seen the need for this measure in recenttimes. For example, another government business enterprise, the Civil Aviation Authority, is an organisation which in my view has not acted in a responsible fashion. As a member of the aviation safety inquiry, I hear examples on a weekly basis of exactly why that statement is correct. When we have an organisation that has had claims made against it that, on many occasions, it has misled the Minister for Transport e Mr Brereton) and the public and that senior management on occasions has even misled the board of the organisation, we need to have the legal right for the minister to express a view to that government business enterprise and for that enterprise to respond to the minister's views in a well-argued and rational fashion. This is a necessary amendment and, again, is one which the opposition will not be opposing. We hope that the minister will find this a useful tool. As in many of these government business enterprises, the minister has the opportunity to give a direction. For example, the minister gave a direction to the Civil Aviation Authority just the other day. Whilst I know ministers are not keen to give directions to GBEs on a regular basis, this amendment gives the minister a halfway point between doing nothing and giving a direction. So it will be a useful tool to ensure that the public interest is maintained. That is an aspect of all three GBEs: the Federal Airports Corporation, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and the Australian National Railways Commission. Other aspects of the amendments ensure that they have the ability to appoint their own chief executive officer. They deal with arrangements of transfer of staff from public service to employment by that particular authority, and they also deal with the ability of those organisations to make interim dividends to the government as opposed to a once a year, end of year dividend to the government. So they will bring forward revenue for the government, and I guess that is a good thing if you are a taxpayer. The other aspect of the legislation before us deals with some changes to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989. As many honourable members would know, compliance plates are required for vehicles that operate in Australia. A number of categories of identification plate will be created, and this will be a better tool, if you like, in properly identifying vehicles that are imported into this country. My colleague the honourable member for Wannon e Mr Hawker) has an excellent suggestion that I hope the government will consider. He will no doubt speak about it in greater detail, but the nub of it is that he believes that in order to overcome a great deal of the cost involved with stolen vehicles it would be an excellent suggestion if compliance plates that become the property of insurance companies be compulsorily returned by the insurance companies so that they can be destroyed. Many honourable members may not be aware of the fact that when a car is wrecked in an accident or whatever the insurance company in many cases ends up the owner of that vehicle. But a compliance plate is a valuable tool if you happen to be a thief, and the compliance plate is not compulsorily required to be returned by the insurance company to a proper authority so it can be destroyed. In many cases these compliance plates are taken and used to provide another identity for a stolen vehicle in such a way you cannot prove the vehicle was stolen. The honourable member for Wannon has an excellent suggestion in this regard, and I hope the government will consider it for future amendments. The other aspect of the bill deals with the Navigation Act 1912. I know the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) who is in the House today, as he always is on such legislation, will no doubt have something to say about this because he is always interested in the maritime industry. I am sure it helps preselection time in a good, safe Labor seat. Mr Hollis-I don't need it.",11
3,Mr SHARP,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"I know you do not need it. The legislation deals with removing the opportunity for double dipping, which I sure the honourable member for Throsby would say never occurs, where maritime employees are on some sickness benefit that denies them the opportunity to both draw wage from their employer and receive some form of income from the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. So this tidies up. It deals with so-called sexist language with the implementation of a system of survey and certification that is harmonised between the multitude of conventions that exist in the maritime industry around the world. The Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 deals with so-called sexist language. There is nothing there that we would oppose. The Protection of the Sea Legislation Amenddid ment Act 1986 deals with civil liability for pollution damage. Over the last few years this House has dealt in a bipartisan fashion with a number of amendments to the law to ensure that people who create oil pollution are properly penalised and made to compensate those who are affected by it. This aspect of deals with civil liability. For example, you might have an oil spill or something or other that causes a fire which could bum your house down, bum out a national park or something like that, and this provides for method by which people can be compensated for any civil damage done as a consequence of ships carrying oil which leads to some that form of pollution and therefore damage. The last component of the bill relates to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. This is an area that I know is well received in the shipbuilding industry and obviously would be well received because the government over the years has been handing out considerable sums of money to people in the shipbuilding industry to assist in converting old ships to provide more efficient ships or to build more efficient ships from scratch. This is something the opposition has had some difficulty in at supporting. We continue to be in that position because we believe that the main beneficiaries of reforms in the industry, the main beneficiaries of upgrading of old ships to make them more efficient, are the owners of those ships. Why should we tum around and pay am money from the taxpayers' revenue to those people to do something which is in their own best interests in the first place? We have always opposed this particular component of a the government's approach to the maritime industry, and we will continue to do so. The amendment is designed to ensure that, it where overpayment to a person who has and received funding under the Ships (Capital ship Grants) Act occurs, the government can retrieve it. Interestingly enough, whilst I do not have any specific examples, I understand that there have been instances where people have been paid moneys under this scheme and have not expended all of those moneys and the government has no legal course to ask those people to give back the money that they not spend on the particular project that oil they received the funding for in the first place. So this provides the government with the authority to retrieve moneys provided by this grant that were not expended on a particular project. One can hardly oppose that. All in all, the opposition will not be opposit ing this bill. We have a number of concerns about it, as I have mentioned, and some good and positive suggestions such as the ones the honourable member for Wannon will be making. My colleague Senator Parer, the a shadow minister for aviation, has a couple of concerns in regard to the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959, which is about insurance. His particular concerns relate to the arrangements regarding foreign operators working within Australia. He will, no doubt, expand on those concerns in the Senate at a later date and put forward a very good argument for his concerns. All in all, we will not be opposing this bill because in the end we believe it is in the interests of the nation. But it does point out the need for us to be continually changing the legislation in regard to transport as technology changes; to be continually aware of the fact that, particularly in aviation, there is a need to overcome some very serious deficiencies within the Civil Aviation Act; and to ensure that we are doing the very best thing for Australians who work in and use our civil aviation industries. I am sure many members of this House would agree with me that the experience of the last year or two has proven to us that we have some considerable inadequacies in that area and we need to be ever vigilant to ensure that we do not allow those to continue at the expense of innocent people. (Quorum formed)",15
4,Mr HOLLIS,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"Throsby) (10.01 a.m.}-I thank my colleagues for filling the government benches to allow members to hear me speak on this important legislation, the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. It is an omnibus bill amending aspects of the transport portfolio. As the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) said, with changing technology we are going to have more and more changes to legislation dealing with transport matters. Not surprisingly, my comments will be related to the maritime aspects of this legislation. The amendment to the Australian Maritime Safety Act 1990 changes certain aspects concerning the authority. It transfers the employment of staff from the Public Service Act 1922 to the authority which can determine the terms and conditions of service of its staff. The Navigation Act 1912 will also be amended. This bill amends part 4 of the actwhich provides for the inspection and certification of ships under the provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974 and the International Convention on Load Lines 1966-to. give effect to a resolution of the International Maritime Organisation permitting the early implementation of the system of ship survey and certification that is harmonised between both conventions. The honourable member for Hume referred to it as double dipping, but it is a tidying up. The bill removes the seaman's entitlement to wages where there is a duplication of a right to compensation under the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992. It also amends part 7 of the act to incorporate the terms and principles adopted by the International Maritime Organisation in its International Convention on Salvage which relates to the current provisions which are based on pre-federation United· Kingdom legislation and the 1910 International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law respecting Assistance and Salvage at Sea. These changes provide greater incentives for salvage to encourage more timely salvage operations and assist in the protection of the environment. The bill provides an objective standard and prescribed forms for testing the level of impairment by alcohol, or any other drug, for the purpose of section 386B-which makes it an offence for the master of a ship or a member of a crew of a ship to be under the influence of alcohol or any other drug to the extent that their capacity to carry out their duties is impaired. This bill also removes sexist language from the acts. These amendments enable the government to fulfil its responsibility· to ensure safety of life at sea and to protect the maritime environment. I want to a-quaint the House with some practices in international shipping to which I believe that this House can no longer afford to turn a· blind eye. When the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure travelled to various ports in Australia looking at ships we saw many examples of unsafe shipping-indeed, rust buckets. The committee report Ships of shame was, I believe, the catalyst for improving shipping, not only in Australian waters but in international waters. Indeed, the very term 'ships of shame' has entered the international maritime language. I believe that shipping is safer today because of the work of the committee and its report. I also firmly believe that there is a darker side to international shipping, and that is the condition of foreign nationals on ships: their living conditions, working conditions, food, and payment--or, as is often the case, non-payment. It is little short of a scandal that Australia, on a mere technicality, has not ratified International Labour Organisation Convention .147. Here we are today, tidying up deficiencies and bringing the language into modern day parlance. That is very important-but we refuse to tackle the really difficult issues. Many of the appalling conditions facing foreign crews could be solved if ships not complying with ILO Convention 147 were denied access to Australian waters. I pay tribute to the work of the Maritime Union of Australia and its efforts to highlight the inhumane conditions many seafarers have to put up with. For so long it led the campaign against the rust buckets. Now it is leading the campaign concerning crew conditions and pay. Officials such as Roger Chapman and Rod Paterson of the ITF and Tony Papaconstuntinos of the Maritime Union of Australia join a long list of trade union officials who have fought against the greed and inhumanity of foreign owners. They have argued against the dreadful conditions on many ships and argued for adequate wages and adequate food. I have seen crews in Port Kembla who have been fed only watermelon for a week. Things that we take for granted in Australia are denied to the seafarers of many of these foreign ships. I have heard stories for some time concerning death threats against crews and their families and of the famous black list, which so many people deny exists. It exists, all right. It is compiled and held in the Philippines and anyone who knows anything about maritime unions knows that a black list exists. But time and time again, ship owners and officials deny that this black list exists. As recently as the ship safe conference in Sydney in September 1994, ship owners denied any knowledge of the list. 'These things do not happen on our ships,' they told the international audience. To hear owners, charterers or their representatives speak at these international conferences, you would think there were no unsafe ships on the seas of the world, and that every crew was well treated, well fed and well paid. If only it were so. By way of example, on 18 December 1994 the ITF took action on behalf of an Indonesian crew on a Panamanian registered vessel, MV Sheng Ho, to alleviate a contractual problem which meant that the crew had not been paid. That action resulted in the crew being awarded $US229,780 in back pay--over $A300,000. On 20 December, a couple of days later, the Indonesian crew received the following letter: This is further to our letter dated 19 December 1994 and our discussions with Chief Officer ... this morning. Based on what we have been told by our principal in Taiwan, Chuan Chi Shipping Co Ltd, concerning developments in the said problem, we are hereby requesting cooperation from our partner to avoid detention of the ship by the ITF whereby the ship's owners will lodge money with the partner, the money being the partner's acknowledgment as payment of wages. The said money must be immediately returned to the ship's owners via the ship's captain when the ship has left Australian waters(Quorum formed) I really am surprised that when I am attempting to draw the attention of the House to an international scandal, which concerns not only non-payment of wages but death and death threats the opposition would try to deny me speaking time. It is important that this be put on the public record, particularly in Australia. It is a scandal that the opposition should try to deny me my democratic right to say this and deny me my speaking time. As I was saying, when this amount of over $A300,000 in back pay was recovered, the crew were told that this money would have to be repaid. The letter continues: We believe that the partners can fulfil this request of ours and in pursuance of this we attach a letter of appeal from the Indonesian Sailors' Union. We thank you for your attention and cooperation. What in fact happened, as has happened in the past, is that the owners tried to make a farce of the payment of the back wages by making sure of its return while at the same time making sure that the ship was not detained at Port Kembla. Make no mistake, that ship would have been detained at Port Kembla until every cent of that back pay was paid. The owners agreed to the payment of the back wages which would immediately have to be returned to the captain when the ship cleared the port, but the crew did not have the money on them. It was paid into an account. We have been caught with this farce before. When the ship-and I stress that this was a vessel subchartered by BHP, the big Australian-reached Port Klang in Malaysia, representatives of the owners boarded the vessel and demanded the return of the back pay. From reports I have received, this was done with death threats against the crew and their families. The crew refused to comply and, as a result, they have all been sacked, and I believe that they are now on that black list. I have in my possession documents concerning this, proving that what so many have been saying was not occurring has in fact been occurring. The treatment of the crew, their pay and conditions, is an international scandal that will only be solved with and by an international solution. The conditions people work under is like slavery-slavery that was abolished 90 years ago. Just as the conditions of ships could not be solved by one nation, neither can this situation. Of course, overriding all this is the greed of international shipping community. I appreciate that the shipping industry is competitive but surely, as has been shown all along our coastline, it is better to have well trained, multiskilled crews being paid a decent wage. This way we would have a smaller and more productive crew rather than a large, untrained, half-starved, flogged and usually underpaid crew. There is a real concern that these vessels are being chartered or subchartered by some unscrupulous firms in Australia. It is also worth remembering that those who talk of opening a second register in Australia, indeed of opening Australia's coastlines further to foreign crewed and foreign flagged vessels, also want to introduce this form of slavery to Australia. No government can sit idly by and let this happen. We must raise these concerns in this parliament, but also our representatives at the IMO must continually raise them. We must not only rid the coastline of ships of shame but also be prepared to engage in the fight to rid the world of the inhumane treatment that too many seafarers are subjected to. We moved decisively to end slavery in Australia 90 years ago by stopping the recruitment of kanak labour. Why are some people now suggesting that we introduce slavery in Australia? Dress it up as they might, this is what a second registry for foreign seafarers on the Australian coastline would mean. Those of us who served on the Ships of shame inquiry know the conditions that seafarers are put into--Iow wages, being half starved and physically and sexually abused. Is this the sort of thing we want on our coastal runs? If members of this House believe that this does not happen, I invite them to talk to any officials from the missions of seamen around the Australian coastline. The Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Act 1986 will also be amended to enable Australia to implement the 1992 protocol to the International Convention on these Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969. This convention is designed to ensure that compensation is available to persons who suffer oil pollution damage as a result of maritime casualty involving oil carrying ships. the The 1992 protocol increases liability limits and extends the scope of the convention. It replaces an earlier protocol adopted in 1994, which, because of a particularly onerous entry into force requirements, is unlikely to enter into force internationally. This is an important aspect of the legislation, but, in my view, in no way would it compensate for an environmental hazard. Last year or the year before last, I went to the Shetland Islands and had a look at the impact of the Braer disaster on the coastline of the islands. The impact of that disaster was not as great as it could have been, because the ship was carrying light oil and because of the peculiarity of the weather. While we have rust buckets trundling inside our premier tourist attraction, the Great Barrier Reef-I understand why they are inside the reef and I actually support them being inside the reef-it has to me a matter of not if but when parts of the Great Barrier Reef will be awash with oil. do not know how much compensation we scandals. would have to have to clean that up. It is necessarily the oil carrying ships-this is restricted to oil carrying ships-but often bilges that spill oil. The spill that recently occurred at the top end of the Great Barrier Reef was not from an oil carrier but from bilge, when they wash out the bilge and the oil go. We will have to come to with that in regard to the Great Barrier Reef. It is not only oil but also the many hazardthe ous chemicals that are being chartered and carried around. We do not know what is being carried in these ships just off the tralian coast. Dreadful as an oil spill would be, at least you are able to see it and can implement some methods to remedy the Yet, problem. But, if some of the rust buckets carrying these chemicals up and down the Australian coastline run aground or there is major spill, we would not know what had did nothing. been put into the sea. We would not be able to see it. We would not know that there had actually been a spill until the fish started floating to the top of the water or people who got a mouthful of water actually died. We should at least have a register of the ships carrying these chemicals. We should know what these chemicals are. If people think this is an exaggeration, they should look at the recent truck crash at Hay. (Quorum formed) (Time expired)",16
5,Mr HAWKER,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"I ise would like to talk on this bill, the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. I will confine my remarks to part F of the bill serious number. which talks about amendments to the Motor Vehicles Standards Act 1989. In particular, want to talk about yet another area where the government seems to be perpetually dragging its feet. Of course, I am referring to the motor vehicle compliance plates that are used identify each new vehicle that is sold Australia and the fact that the government seems to have had considerable difficulty coming to grips with the fact that a lot more, through the use of compliance numbers, to reduce the level of theft of motor always seemed cars in Australia. The previous speaker, the honourable I member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), talked about Let me tell you of another scandal, not the level of theft of motor cars that goes on in Australia. It is approaching a billion dollar the industry. And yet it seems that the government---despite many warnings over many years, despite some very sensible and very a serious submissions that have been put to it let over many years-has failed to act in this terms very important area. (Quorum formed) As I was saying, this is another area where government has failed to act. I am rather pleased to see that the former minister for land transport, the member for Charlton (Mr AusRobert Brown), has arrived in the chamber because during his time as a minister he was urged time and time again to act on this issue. like in so many areas, he failed to take up the challenge. The minute he ran into something that was difficult, he did what a a typical Yes, Minister minister would do and I am talking here about motor vehicle theft and the opportunity that the government has had over a number of years to take some positive steps to reduce this very onerous cost on the country, not to mention the difficulties it causes to so many individuals when they suddenly find that their cars have been stolen. In many cases, the cars are never returned. To give some idea of just how serious this problem is, we should realise that the number of vehicles being reported stolen-I emphas'-eported'-has been in excess of 100,000 a year. In fact, in 1994 it was 125,000. While it has increased slightly, it is still a very The direct cost to the community is around I $400 million a year. But there are many additional costs, including the inconvenience to so many individuals who have lost their cars, the costs in police having to try to chase to things up and the cost in the courts when in prosecutions are mounted. When you add up all these other costs, it is not unreasonable to in say that the cost to the community is of the it could do order of $1 billion a year. The frustrating thing about all this is that the government has had offers made to it of quite simple solutions to this problem. While I acknowledge that the manufacturers have moved in quite a strong, demonstrable way to reduce the ease with which people can steal a car, it is still quite an attractive thing for those who want to get into an organised racket. If we look at the figures in New South Wales where the problem has been greatest, in 1990 the cost of car theft was estimated to be $226 million and in 1991 it had risen to $280 million. In 1992-93, theft related insurance claims cost the insurance industry $190 million. Guess who pays for this: this, of course, is passed on to the policyholders in the form of higher insurance premiums. According to the Insurance Council of Australia, in 1992-93 the theft costs added nearly 10 per cent to the insurance premiums. The RACV estimated that it was in excess of 10 per cent. The NRMA, the National Roads and Motorists Association, in New South Wales in 1993 calculated that the theft added an average of $46 per year to every premium paid by every Australian car owner. When you think about it, that is a major cost. Nearly $1 a week extra is paid by every person who owns a car just to try to pay for the cost of this theft. With car theft, it is not just the odd vehicle that is taken and disappears altogether. It is estimated that at least a quarter of all cars are stolen are stripped down and sold for parts or are on-sold again for profit under a new identification number. While this is serious enough in itself, it does not take into account the fact that 62 per cent-nearlytwo-thirdsof thefts do not involve insurance claims. So, when we talk about a figure of $1 billion, we are probably underestimating it quite a lot. So the community cost is very large. Theft rates have fallen slightly over the last three years. But it is still a very big issue. As the shadow minister in 1991, I called on the government to look at a very simple solution that was being offered. That was to use the vehicle identification number on several major parts of the vehicle. The Motor Traders Association of Australia has been raising this with the government since 1989, so it is not a new idea. Yet to date we still do not have any action. I see the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) is here. I should have thought that she would be rather interested in this sort of thing too because it ought to be something about which she is directly concerned as so many consumers are being affected by the fact that they have to pay more for insurance-as I say, nearly $1 a week because of motor vehicle theft. This solution is remarkably cheap and simple. The figures estimate that it would only cost $15 per vehicle to bring in this identification of major vehicle parts. Yet it seems that the government has failed to take up the offer and has failed to take this matter seriously. One really has to question where their priorities are if they cannot see the seriousness of this whole issue. Obviously, insurance premiums would only have to be reduced by about five per cent to recoup the full cost of doing this. These labels, which are now available, can be put on the major parts of a vehicle in a way that they cannot be removed or, if attempts are made to remove them, they can self-void. Nearly a quarter of the vehicles that are stolen are stripped for parts or resold under a different identification. People ought to realise that this is not just a random thing. A number that of organised, highly professional syndicates are operating this racket. These syndicates know what they are doing: they are so well organised that they steal cars to order down to the model and colour. There are many suggestions that at motor vehicle auctions people are working their mobile phones and actually buying cars as they come up. Some work has been done in the United States on this whole issue where it has become mandatory for high-risk parts to be marked. It has meant that since 1984 it has been that much more difficult for people to get hold of those vehicles and then strip them for their parts. In America up to 100 parts per car have been marked. The Motor Traders Association suggested that only 16 would be necessary, so it is not a big cost. Indeed, the cost could be easily recouped by lower insurance premiums. I am concerned that all of this information has been available to the government. In fact, there have been formal requests of the government for this for a number of years. Yet again, as this legislation demonstrates, the government is not prepared to act on an area which, if implemented, would have significant benefits for Australia over the next few years. The other thing to note is that the number of people actually charged with stealing motor vehicles is remarkably low. In fact, only about 2.8 per cent of cars stolen result in a person being charged. That is less than three per cent. It is very disturbing to think that, although the number of people being prosecuted is very low, this is costing the community over $1 billion a: year. One would think that the government would take this matter seriously and do something about it. Currently, aluminium labels have the vehicle identification number on them. While they are quite easy to read, adhesive labels with a self-voiding provision are now available. In other words, the minute someone tries to tamper with or remove it, the label self voids. That would take away one of the avenues people in this organised racket can use. They currently take the compliance plate off one vehicle and put it onto another. This removes the opportunity to trace a stolen vehicle because the identification number has been removed altogether from that first vehicle. This is clearly an area in which the government is going to have to move. Given the extent of theft, given the cost to. the community and given that all those who insure their motor cars have to pay for this enormous cost, the government should be beholden to take action. I find it rather appalling that, after all the opportunities that have been put before the government over the years, the government has again failed to take up the challenge. This legislation demonstrates yet again that the government is not prepared to look at this whole issue. I would have thought that, through the transport ministers council that meets regularly, this and a number of other issues could be addressed so this major cost to the community could be reduced. A number of recommendations have been put up within the last year. One recommendation was that when a vehicle is re-registered or registered within another jurisdiction it be mandatory for identification plates to be checked. Yet not even that is done. Given that the major motoring organisations have expressed their concern over a number of years and given that there is a simple solution, I believe that the government has a lot to answer for in relation to the level of motor car theft in Australia. Yet the government is not prepared to act. Mr FITZGmBON (Hunter) (10.38 am.)--",19
6,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"(Quorum formed) The Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, which is before the House, is a very wideranging bill and provides me with the opportunity to speak on two matters very near to my heart. The first matter that I wish to address is the increasing availability of private finance to invest in infrastructure projects such as those outlined in the One Nation statement. This response for an acceleration of infrastructure investment will bring about two very welcome positives: it will create jobs and it will boost the economy. As well, the projects contemplated by investment agencies have the potential to improve immeasurably the quality of lifestyle in employment opportunities available to all Australians. If corporate participants and governments can work together-and there is no reason why they cannot-private sector involvement in public infrastructure will see the completion of projects which hitherto have been but a wish or a dream in the minds of parliamentarians, civic leaders and constituents. I have an expensive dream for my electorate of Hunter, which I believe will come to fruition because of private infrastructure investment. I am confident that the pet projects of nearly every member of this House can be realised through the application of private infrastnicture investment. Since 1992 the growth in Australian superannuation funds-an attractive, alternative funding source for infrastructure projects-has been substantial. Daily income for Australian superannuation funds is $486 million, with total assets currently standing at $4,186 billion .. If the commonly adopted diversificaper tion strategy implemented by most superanmore nuation funds is applied then some $37 billion of these funds will be invested overseas either equities, bonds or fixed interest deposformed) its. Because of advice from asset consultants and· fund managers, superannuation trustees embrace this strategy in order to adhere to diversification philosophy rather than to great desire to invest in overseas equity bond markets. Given the opportunity and reasonable range of alternatives that would satisfy normal investment criteria whilst sacrificing diversification of investment, Australian superannuation funds would redirect these moneys back into the Australian economy. Institutional investors are showing interest in infrastructure projects which promise good rates of return in comparison with long-term bonds, plus there are tax advantages. The funding of public infrastrucsecurities, ture projects by private, personal and institustapled tional investors is certain to progress rapidly in this year and in coming years. This proin cess, while not having its genesis in the One Nation statement, will certainly be assisted the effective use of infrastructure bonds and it may be possible, through the of other government tax incentives, that principally institutional investors will look on infrastructure projects as a legitimate alternative to overseas investment. Should the government proceed with introduction of compulsory employee superanbetween nuation contributions, it would make the task of selling this to the Australian public easier. If those same employees had a choice of investment, given the well-known Australat Ian conservatism to savings, the attraction investing in large Australian infrastructure projects would assist in the introduction of what is going to be a most difficult strategy. With both Lend Lease and the New South Wales super corporation recently announcing major ventures into infrastructure after assemcomplete bling teams to work out the necessary risk return profiles, institutional investors are looking hard at the area. Estimates of the rates of return vary, but an existing infrastructure project might be expected to return 15 cent before tax and inflation and much for an unfinished project where the risks are somewhat higher. As the rates for a in finished project compare well-(Quorum As a result of the opposition member at the table, the honourable member for Indi (Mr the Lieberman), suffering from a digestive comany plaint, two quorums have been called. Conseor quently, I will not be able to get through my a whole speech. I have pointed out the wonderful opportunities for infrastructure developnot ments to be financed through private investmany ment. That is already happening. I think ordinary investors have become aware of where opportunities exist in the field. Consider the $486 million M2 Motormore way for Sydney's north west which was launched late last year on the Stock Exchange as the Hills Motorway Group. That Hills float has proven to be quite successful. The stock a company share and unit trust together, are steady at around $1.11 today compared with the starting price of $1 September when the security was launched. There are many similar examples in Vicby toria. There is a surge of enthusiasm for private infrastructure on the part of the Vicdevelopment torian government. Mr Chynoweth-What!",21
7,Mr FITZGIBBON,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"I know that the honourable member for Dunkley will not be particularly keen to hear this, but the govern the ment has started the process of deciding two consortia willing to take on an ambitious $1.5 billion build, own, operate and much transfer-BOOT-project. The project will link major Melbourne freeways that now end the city centre, in part through massive of tunnels beneath the Yarra in the CBD itself. There are some more examples in Victoria. The Victorian government's Department of Planning and Development cites a list of 14 infrastructure projects which it intends to using private investment finance. There are projects in all the other states too. Infrastructure projects in New South Wales are equally ambitious. Private groups have already built three tollways and the harbour tunnel, with another six tollways expected to be built within the next 20 years, and they include the M2. In Western Australia, Pacific Hydro Limited and Lend Lease Development Capital Limited are building a $75 million 30 megawatt hydro-electric power station at the Ord River Dam. And so the story goes on. Other states have similar projects in their planning portfolios. The identification of available options is an important step for government when planning and evaluating private sector involvement. A number of options have to be looked at there. It is crucial for the government to identify carefully its objectives involving the private sector and to choose the structure which best facilitates meeting these objectives. A failure by either the private sector or the government to really understand what drives any given project will inevitably be counterproductive and wasteful. A perfect example of a potential project suffering because of the lack of appropriate testing criteria is the Liverpool Range rail tunnel. I believe the Liverpool Range tunnel fits perfectly within One Nation. This is a project which is very dear to my heart. The Gunnedah basin, 320 kilometres north-west of Newcastle, contains in excess of one billion tonnes of identified recoverable coal reserves, and that figure is based on the 1994 New South Wales coal industry profile. These reserves contain good quality coal of both thermal and coking varieties. The coal industry has generally considered the Gunnedah basin as the logical replacement for the Hunter coalfields as its economic reserves are expended. Such a development would mean that Gunnedah would become New South Wales's major coal producing region. The prospect of such a large-scale development of the Gunnedah basin reserves, however, has been negated by the fact that, due to the distance from the port of Newcastle, the cost of transporting the product on the current rail system is prohibitive. The prime reason the current rail system is inadequate for transport is the Liverpool Range to the north of Murrurundi and the steep grades associated with the crossing of the range. For many years there has been consideration by various parties with vested interests in the development of the Gunnedah coalfields to the driving of a tunnel through the lower level of the range which would immediately allow the capacity of trains servicing the field to at least double from some 3,200 to 6,400 tonnes, according to SRA figures.",22
8,Mr COBB,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"You are a man of vision, Eric.",23
9,Mr FITZGIBBON,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"Such an increase in capacity would benefit my colleague sitting opposite without taking account of associated subsequent technological advances which could be treated as an absolute minimum and would themselves reduce rail freight charges dramatically, thus ensuring the development of a significant natural resource and the benefits to the national economy that would flow from that development. The tunnel would be some eight kilometres in length, commencing just to the north of the Murrurundi railway station and emerging at Chilcott Creek. Unconfirmed estimates put the cost of driving and equipping the tunnel at between $70 million and $100 million. This obviously is a cost which any individual coal producer is going to find prohibitive but as part of a broad scenario using superannuation funds it would become amply feasible. A study commissioned by Novacoal Australia Pty Ltd in 1991 was undertaken by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. The study developed detailed specifications and estimated costings at the time and, if accessed, would provide a useful base for further consideration of the proposal.. However, as I pointed out earlier, there has to be cooperation and trust if Australia is to achieve completely the benefits which will flow from privately financed infrastructure projects. The upgrading of the rail lines through the Liverpool Range in order to allow volumes of coal and agricultural products to be transported to the port of Newcastle for overseas export is essential. It is essential that we have cooperation to complete this rail line. We are not going to get capital investment to replace viable an antiquated rail system and we are not going to get capital investment to allow our rich coal and agricultural products to reach a seaport without cooperation. I make the strongest plea to Novacoal to cooperate in helping to achieve an extraordinarily worthy project. Novacoal must release the study it commissioned the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation to undertake in 1991. The detailed specifications and estimated costings held by Novacoal are critical to process the costing of the feasibility study of the project. The coal industry received a brutal kick in the teeth as a result of a recent court decision on the Bengalla mine development which I hope many members would be familiar with. For the New South Wales coal industry to continue to prosper it is absolutely critical the Liverpool plains infrastructure project be advanced quickly. I call on Novacoal to cooperate with all elements of the New South Wales community, including the unions and investors, to expedite the Liverpool Range rail project. We cannot continue to play the fiddle and miss opportunities such as that. We cannot miss opportunities which will allow our important coal mining industry to prosper. I hope that Novacoal will change its attitude. I intend making further contacts with the principals of that company. I hope it will release the information it holds so that an absolutely vital project, which will boost the productivity and wealth of the Hunter Valley and the state of New South Wales, can be completed expeditiously. (Quorum formed)",23
10,Mr COBB,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"In rising to speak on the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, I would firstly like to acknowledge the contribution of my colleague the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). The second half of his speech in particular showed great vision, which we do not often see in this parliament. I am very supportive of some of the ideas that he floated. I think his ideas should be recognised in the parliament. Obviously, the honourable member for Hunter should be on the front bench instead of being kept on the back bench. This bill gives us an opportunity to raise a number of important issues relating to road, rail and air transport. At the beginning, it is interesting to reflect that nowadays the average Australian spends more on transport than on housing. Transport is a very important section of our economy; particularly in a sparsely populated continent the size of Australia. I would like to particularly mention some of the concerns that I have about the east-west rail line which runs through my electorate. This line connects Sydney, through Adelaide, to Perth. In New South Wales it is owned and run by the State Rail Authority. In my electorate it runs from Parkes, through Bogan Gate and Condobolin, west to Ivanhoe, Methat nindie and Broken Hill. The government's commitment to build the standard gauge railway line between Melbourne and Adelaide-which should be finished later this year-will put pressure on this particular line. At the moment, interstate freight runs along this line from Sydney to Adelaide and Perth and is overseen by the National Freight Corporation. Interstate passengers also travel over this line, and that aspect is overseen by Australian National which runs the Indian Pacific service. I remind government members that the east-west rail line, as opposed to the Sydney-Melbourne-Adelaide line, is 400 kilometres shorter; it is six hours faster; and it runs over flatter terrain. The line is already there and it is in very good shape. It is welded between Molong and Broken Hill. I believe that no responsible federal government should let it go. There is talk that the Indian Pacific will be re-routed onto the Melbourne-Adelaide line. It would be a tragedy if that happened. While I have no objection to Indian Pacific passenger trains running on the Melbourne-Adelaide line, they should be in addition to what presently runs on the east-west line through Parkes and Broken Hill. The New South Wales government, through the SRA, spends about $75 million a year on western area rail infrastructure. Over the last couple of years the New South Wales government has spent $4 million on building three 1.8 kilometre crossing loops between Parkes and Broken Hill and $1.3 million on an online fuelling facility at Broken Hill. That is indeed a handsome commitment to the line. Crewing has also been rationalised. This line is particularly vital to the little towns in western New South Wales in my electorate. Ivanhoe is one of those towns and 30 to 40 residents are employed in the rail industry. To see this line close because ofrerouting of freight and interstate passengers would be a tragedy. The line is also important to other towns such as Mendindie and Condobolin. I believe that every effort must be made to keep Indian Pacific passengers and freight running interstate along this line. The federal government should oversee the negotiations that will take place between Australian National, the National Rail Corporation and the SRA. The federal government should assist where possible. I acknowledge that the federal government has spent something like $12 million on refurbishing the Indian Pacific in recent times, and that is very welcome. However, the federal government charges probably twice that amount on the diesel fuel freight tax alone. If that tax were removed it would tend to make interstate passenger rail servicing and interstate freight servicing much more competitive. I was pleased to see the New South Wales government make a commitment that if the Indian Pacific is re-routed, it will run an Explorer train service on the line to maintain the intrastate passenger traffic. That is very welcome indeed. I saw a survey recently that Travers Morgan had done. It showed that rail operating costs in Australia were 38 per cent above the world's best practice. So there is more that we could do to bring about efficiencies with our rail operating costs. I want to comment now on other parts of the bill and on road funding in particular. I again record my dismay that this federal government has slashed federal road funding from something in excess of $1,600 million to a figure barely in excess of $800 million over the last two years. I believe that is a scandal. It has put tremendous pressure on maintaining, let alone upgrading, the road system in this country. While it has done this, the government has continued to increase fuel tax. When this government first came to power in 1983 it was collecting about 6c a litre in fuel tax. Today that is in excess of 32c a litre on unleaded petrol and diesel, and in excess of 34c a litre for leaded petrol. Just over $1 billion of collections from fuel tax in 1982-83 has blown out to over $10 billion this year. It would have been even higher had the coalition and opposition parties not been able to stop an extra 3c a litre which the government wanted to put on leaded fuel in the 1993 budget. When we left office, something like two-thirds of fuel tax was spent on road funding. Today, sadly, it is only of the order of 8.45 per cent, and it is projected to fall to 7.51 per cent, according to the budget papers, in 199798. That is a very sad thing to see. I believe that the government's relentless increases in fuel tax have been a savage attack on country people. I was in Wilcannia, travelling through western New South Wales, only the other day and I filled up my car. I paid 88c a litreMr Braithwaite-That's discriminatory.",24
11,Mr COBB,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"It is. In Sydney you can buy it at least 20c a litre cheaper than that. Country people not only pay more for their fuel, they also use more because of the distances they travel and because there is little or no public transport in country areas. The savage fuel tax increases under this government have been a direct attack on country people. Seventy five per cent of domestic freight transport in this country is by road, and 80 per cent of that is carted distances less than 100 kilometres. There has been very heavy and increasing demand on road infrastructure in recent years and the government has done nothing to respond to that at all. In fact, things are quite the opposite. The 1993 budget, in particular, impacted very heavily on the average semitrailer running costs. We were not told anything about this before the election, I might add. The fuel tax increases on diesel alone added about $6,000 a year to the cost of running the average semitrailer. The sales tax increases alone added about $400 a year. That meant that freight costs had to go up and that has already put about $3 a week on the average family grocery bill. In the towns of my electorate of Parkesperhaps not so much in Sydney and Melbourne-these increases have added about 12.5c a kilometre to transport costs. I saw figures the other day for a semi carting cattle long distances. The recent fuel tax increases were adding about $1.80 a head to the cartage costs. The package we took to the Australian people at the last election would have taken about $60,000 a year off average rig costs. So this government's great imposition on transport costs, particularly for country New South Wales, is obvious. While many roads in this country need financing, I think we all acknowledge that the money we would have to pour into them are beyond the financial resources of state and local governments. Some of the very large local government areas in my electorate, such as Brewarrina and Bourke, have only about 1,000-odd ratepayers to support areas the size of Sydney and greater, and they do have to be assisted federally. The state government collects about 6Y2c a litre in fuel taxes in New South Wales and I am pleased to note that they pour 100 per cent of that back into the roads. There are many major roads in my electorate that do need upgrading, roads of national economic importance, such as the Kidman Way which starts just north of Hillston and goes up through Cobar and Bourke. The coalition, I am pleased to say, has made a federal commitment to seal that road upon return to government. I would like to see the present government put some money towards that instead of letting all of the burden fall on state and local governments, as is the case at present. The north-south road, or the Burke and - ills Way, which runs through Broken Hill, IS another road which badly needs upgrading and would bring a lot of tourists to outback New South Wales as well as providing freight outlets for south western Queensland down into New South Wales. It also needs money spent on it. The east-west road has slowly been sealed over the years between Bourke and Brewarrina. That is now complete. But between Brewarrina and Walgett there is about another $6 million or $7 million of funding needed to complete that road. The recent, very welcome rains we received out there meant that in the black soil no-one could move along that road at all for many days, indeed weeks in some instances. That road needs sealing. The Dubbo-Newcastle coastal link to the inland, as mentioned by the previous member, needs upgrading so that we can get the produce of our wealth creating industries to the seaboard in a more efficient way. I would like to make some comments on shipping. The Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987, which we are discussing today, makes mention of benefits to shipowners for modifications made to vessels to bring them into conformity with the revised crewing levels of the shipping reform program. I think it is pertinent in that regard to again raise the need for continued reform on the waterfront. The waterfront has been a national embarrassment to Australia for years. While the number of wharfies employed has fallen substantially, the cost to the people that use these facilities has hardly changed at all. With the $100,000 golden handshakes for the wharfies who have been retrenched, which has cost something like $430 million so far, it is no wonder the costs have not come down, because much of that has been paid for by cargo levies of $1.25 a tonne, levies which still continue, I might add. The bottom line of waterfront reform has to be the cost to the user and, as I say, that has not changed. The wages on the waterfront vary somewhere from $60,000 to in excess of $90,000 per year. If we compare those amounts with the massive investment made by the farmers in my electorate in their industries, often in excess of $1 million, we see that the farmers work far greater hours and take a far greater responsibility, and many, if not most of them, are earning a negative income. We must not lose sight of that. The reward for people who are creating the wealth in this country is totally distorted and has to be addressed, and the government is doing nothing in that direction whatsoever. I am alarmed at trends in recent months of the waterfront unions being in clawback mode again, even wanting to reverse the meagre gains that have been made. A study by the Bureau of Transport and Communications shows in its economic data that the increase in container movements per hour over the wharves, which peaked at 22.2 containers per hour over the last year, has sadly fallen back to 19.6 containers per hour averaged over five ports in Australia. It is tragic to see this slippage when we should be moving the other way. Mr Forrest-How do we compare with New Zealand?",25
12,Mr COBB,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"We can aspire to be the best in the world when it comes to sport, but when it comes to work, which creates our wealth and is reflected in our standard of living, we seem to make every effort to go the other way. My colleague asks me what the figures are in New Zealand. If we compare Australia with New Zealand-a country that does not have our resources or population, et ceterawe are 2- times more expensive than New Zealand. If we compare the costs of Australia with the port of Auckland, Auckland has reduced its costs by 43 per cent in real terms while Australia's have remained virtually constant. The port of Auckland operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and its turnaround time for container ships has plunged from 38.4 hours to 15.7 hours. If we compare that with Australia, there is hardly any comparison at all. The chairman of the Shipping Industry Reform Authority, SIRA, Ray Taylor, has recommended changes that would lower the annual costs of an international vessel by $2 million per year. That shows the potential is out there if we would only bite the bullet. But the minister, who is under siege on just about every front imaginable, will not act because he is terrified of upsetting the unions. In fact, the government, far from helping the shipping industry, has penalised it. In 1993 budget, the government increased the fuel tax on shipping. That added almost $10 million a year to coastal shipping alone. That worked out at about $288,000 per vessel per year. That more than negated the savings we had on the crewing levels on that ship. Mr Braithwaite-Scandalous.",27
13,Mr COBB,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"Scandalous, as the member for Dawson acknowledges. It was coalition policy in 1993 to save $460,000 per ship per year. If we had had that saving and not the extra impost, that would have worked out to be about $% million per ship per year. That has now gone by the board. I remind members that 16 per cent of the value of steel exports of BHP, the biggest company in this nation, is due to transport costs. That works out to be $231.3 million per year. If we could get a 10 per cent saving in those costs, which is surely not beyond us, that would save BHP alone $23 million a year on their steel transport costs. We could then competitively sell more of its products overseas, which is surely what we all want to do. I was alarmed to read in the Australian Financial Review yesterday that an internal survey by Contship Containerlines showed that work and port productivity in Australia is starting to fall. It compared the second half of last year with the first half of last year in Sydney and showed that, out of 46 international ports, we had slipped from 24th to 31st. In Melbourne we slipped from 28th position to 37th position. Melbourne had less than 40 per cent of the labour productivity of the No.1 port in the world, the port of Antwerp, and it was only 66 per cent that of Auckland. In Sydney and Melbourne, container ships are tied up for 59.6 hours, with 18.5 hours idle time at Sydney and 13.8 hours of idle time at Melbourne. It can be seen that there is room for improvement within Australia, particularly in comparison with overseas countries. We are sliding back. We are getting congestion at the ports; we are getting lost reliability at the ports, which is important to our competitiveness; and we are getting higher costs. This is adversely affecting exports. That particularly the impacts on my electorate of Parkes where the primary producers, whether they be in the mining industry or the farming industry, are being hit hard. I would like to see the government get back to its micro-economic reform program that it has trumpeted but in which it has achieved nothing. (Time expired)",27
14,Mr LATHAM,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"Werriwa) (11.20 a.m.)The Transport Legislation Amendment Bill raises several important aspects of transport policy in Australia. In this regard I refer the House to the findings of the National Transport Planning Task Force, released last December. I share the task force vision of a freight transport system open to competition within and between all modes, free of hidden government intervention-all subsidies must be transparent-with funding sufficient to meet demand efficiently, where investment infrastructure meets clearly established national needs, thus promoting appropriate modal choice, and where regulation is nationally consistent and reflects a balance of community interests. The task force also noted the extensive changes and improvements in Australia's transport system over the past decade. For that, this government can take a large slab of the credit. It found, however, that in several areas micro-reforms have not reached their full potential and now need to be reignited. I will quote from page five of the report which states specifically: road regulation reform, where the agreed process seems to have stalledprimarily due to the obstinance and foolishness of the New South Wales government. National Rail, where improvements in performance are taking longer than anticipated. The waterfront, where the significant performance improvements generated by the structural reform program are not being sustained. port authority reform, whereUnfortunatelythe benefits have been captured by state government treasuries rather than customers. It is acknowledged, and I believe now broadly accepted in this House, that the greatest barrier to economic efficiency in Australia is the cost of federalism; that is, overlapping and confusing responsibilities, regulations and planning priorities among and between Australia's three tiers of government. The National Transport Planning Task Force provides an instance of the cost of federalism at page 55 of its report. I refer all members interested in transport reform to the reportand I know this is an instance in which my friend and colleague the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) would be closely interested. The report states: The transport manager of a Perth firm which carts dangerous bulk liquids awarded a contract for the construction of a 25m tri-axle B-double trailer to a Queensland company. To mpve the newly constructed empty trailer to Perth operating permits were required from the states through which the vehicle would pass. Neither the NSW Government nor the Commonwealth had in place legislation which dealt with this type of vehicle. It was therefore necessary to avoid transiting New South Wales and the vehicle had to be moved via the Innamincka Track. I assume that is somewhere in Queensland, as the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) would understand. It states further: Three sets of operating permits were required from Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia In South Australia and Western Australia each required the trailer to be inspected by dangerous goods inspectors and each inspection cost over $10,000. Additionally, registration and driver licensing laws, stamp duty, third party insurance and a myriad of other hurdles had to be negotiated. The paperwork alone took over one month. In a nation wanting to compete and to be efficient on world markets, we really do need to overcome these costs of federalism. I am pleased to have learned from my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe), that the Commonwealth will soon be bringing the appropriate legislation to this parliament. It remains for the New South Wales government, alone among the governments of Australia, to get its act together and bring forward the nationally consistent regulations and arrangements needed to avoid these huge business costs on Australia's export potential. I wish to address the bulk of my remarks on this legislation to its amendments to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 which specifically provides for the minister to notifY the commission of his views on the appropriate strategic direction for the commission in the performance of its functions. It is not possible to frame, or understand, transport or infrastructure policies in the 1990s without regard to the requirements of our internationalised economy. The efficiency of government business enterprises is all important. The Industry Commission has estimated that government-supplied inputs account for 16 per cent of all intermediate inputs used by Australian industry, equivalent to six per cent of total industry costs. Transport and energy are the two most important inputs. A high proportion of export industries and factor resources are dependent on rail transport. Rail freight accounts for more than eight per cent of the total costs of the mining industry, 12 per cent for the coal and oil industries, 11 cent for cereal grain producers and nearly 20 per cent for ferrous metal ore producers. The performance of these government business enterprises has a significant impact on the competitiveness of Australian industry. EPAC has estimated that best practice reforms to government business enterprises in Australia can add 2.5 per cent to GOP. Rail has a huge role to play in this process. The Industry Commission has identified potential gains of $5 billion per annum in GOP from rail reform. Seventy per cent of these gains would result from improved work and management practices and using cost savings to reduce rail deficits. The other 30 per cent would arise from pricing reforms to achieve full cost recovery. These gains would result in improved efficiency of resource allocation with subsequent flow-on effects throughout the Australian economy. Benchmarking studies have shown that the pace of rail reform must accelerate to reach national standards, let alone international practice. In 1992-93 railways were responsible for 23 per cent of jobs in government trading enterprises, but only six per cent of government revenue. The first benchmarking goal in rail must be to match Australia's internationally competitive road transport industry. Competition with road transporters should be used as a catalyst for productivity gains and rail industry upgrading. The second and associated benchmark is against international best practice. Despite recent reform efforts and improvements in efficiency, the performance of the Australian rail freight system falls short of world standards. The Bureau of Industry Economics reported in its 1993 Rail Freight Update that: . .. whether on the basis of price, operating efficiency or cost perfonnance rail freight services are clearly below best practice and this poor relative performance impacts directly on the competitiveness of Australian finns using rail freight services. Labour productivity in the most efficient overseas railways was nearly eight times the Australian average, while capital productivity was four times greater. Overall, the Australian systems must reduce their 1991-92 operating per costs by about 27 per cent, or close to $600 million, to match world best practice costs. The differences between international and Australian efficiency partly reflect national operating conditions. The BIB analysis shows that, at current rates of improvement, Australian freight will reach world best cost levels in 1998-99. The acceleration of this process and further improvements to operating costs require additional capital investments by each of the Australian systems. Since Federation, the greatest cost to infrastructure and economic efficiency in Australia has been the cost of federalism. At least on rail freight, substantial progress has been made through the establishment of National Rail. Its emerging success is an outstanding example to all governments in Australia of how cooperation and a national perspective can improve our economic performance. We are doing it on rail; we can do it on road and eliminate some of the problems best I mentioned earlier. All Australians can be encouraged by National Rail's 1993-94 results, with a seven per cent growth in customer revenue and a four per cent increase in freight market share. National Rail, to its credit, has set performance improvement targets commensurate with Australia's trading position-it is a dynamic outfit looking outwards to the world environment, trying to assist Australia's trade prospects-that is, it hopes to reduce operating costs by 45 per cent in real terms and increase labour and capital productivity by at least threefold by 1995-96, the next financial year. National Rail is taking steps to improve work practices, increase wagon availability and improve the reliability of its terminal equipment, while increasing the number and quality of capital city services. I know the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) is very supportive of those reform initiatives. The federal government's other rail entity, Australian National, is expected this year to transfer its interstate freight functions to the National Rail Corporation. It will be reviewed to ensure that the ongoing organisation is appropriately structured and functional. These initiatives would be enhanced by two further reforms. I urge them upon the minister and the government, particularly in the consideration of the national transport planning task force report. First, there should be established a single system to manage interstate rail passenger services. The shifting of public transport costs between levels of government is never as important as efficiency gains available to all Australians, regardless of their state of origin. On the east-west corridor between Sydney and Perth, where passenger services are operated by Australian National, substantial benefits have already been realised. Second, Australia's rail freight systems should be integrated. While it may be logical to exclude metropolitan passenger traffic from the national rail network, it is to separate interstate and intrastate freight operations. No freight system has pursued a proper plan to rationalise and enhance its services. An integrated and truly national system is essential to the attainment of international best practice. Let me now turn, Mr Deputy Speaker, as we all must on rail reform, to the Hilmer report and national competition policy. The report recognised that because of economies of scale and distance, 'natural' monopolies may exist in some industries. Duplication of the rail system, electricity grid and gas pipelines is not economically feasible. The key to lower prices and greater efficiency in these industries is the creation of access for upstream producers and potential downstream competitors. Hilmer recommended an open and transparent system of declared access to essential infrastructure facilities at fair and reasonable prices. Adherence to the principle of competitive neutrality would prevent governments from· unfairly subsidising their enterprises in competition with private firms. Provision of third party access rights is not a new initiative on Australian tracks-it is not new at all. For many years BHP has been able to operate its own trains over sections of the New South Wales rail network. Its extension to all parts of the infrastructure sector is an essential reform. In the absence of competitive markets most of the productivity gains of public business enterprises in Australia have been realised as budget dividends for governments rather than cost benefits for consumers. Between 1990 and 1992, for instance, labour productivity in the State Rail Authority of New South Wales improved by 12.7 per cent, Queensland Railways by 11.5 per cent, the Victorian Public Transport Corporation by 2.9 per cent and National Rail by 16.4 per cent. But the average cost of sending rail freight improved only at the margin. Costs to industry fell by just 5.1 per cent in Queensland despite their large increase in labour productivity, 2.5 per cent in Victoria and only 0.6 on the national line. With even more extravagant dividend stripping, the average cost actually increased in New South Wales totally artificial by 5.1 per cent. From Hilmer's agenda it is competition not ownership in its own right which promotes efficiency gains in infrastructure. The debate in this regard should not focus on the relative market shares of public and private owners. I notice my colleague the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) in the chamber. He would appreciate that in Victoria it is not competition they are interested in; the Kennett government is obsessed with private ownership. They are willing to dismantle the way in which the public sector can efficiently compete with the private sector, with an ideological obsession that the private sector always does best. That is not the case. The private sector should be given an equal opportunity to compete against government business enterprises but not monopoly opportunitiesnot the sort of monopoly sell-off the Kennett government has as an obsession on its ideological agenda. Let us look at federal policy in regard to the introduction of private competition on a level playing field against the public authority on telephones. Much as the advent of Optus has enlarged the telecommunications market, efficiency gains through competition in rail are likely to attract customers from the road industry and expand the scope and potential of all rail freight enterprises. Just as much, competition policies are not necessarily synonymous with privatisation-a message all members of this parliament should take to the Victorian government. The primary objective of the reform agenda is to promote competition where it is likely to add to national competitiveness. The case of transferring ownership as a means of improving efficiency depends on whether privatisation is likely to produce additional net benefits to the economy, not an ideological obsession that the private sector always does best. It is a matter of judging these instances and prospects case by case with regard to the principles of competitive neutrality and the proper role of the public sector. Hilmer's model is consistent with the European Community's policy on rail transport. That is, to define the tracks as an tial facility and promote competition between track users. British Rail, for instance has itself in two: one section is a track authority earning a commercial return on track rentals; the other as a residual trading enterprise competing for franchises against privately owned companies. The British rail system has been divided into 25 route packages. Earlier this year the first seven passenger franchises were opened for competitive tendering. Three leasing companies have been established to make available the rolling stock for passenger services. This lowers an important barrier to market entry by reducing the up-front capital costs of operation. In Australia the first signs have emerged of a competitive market in rail freight. Road Railer Australia is hoping to position itself as a viable commercial competitor to the National Rail Corporation. The Hunter Valley rail project in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, has the potential to introduce internationally competitive freight rates for coal haulage and break down the monopoly profits currently levied on the coal industry by the State Rail Authority. Mr Deputy Speaker, as an outstanding supporter of the coal industry in the Hunter region, you would understand that its international trading prospects rely on the efficiency of the transport system. The lower the cost, the more viable the industry and the more sustainable the jobs of coal workers. I support the idea of competitive neutrality between the public and private sectors in transport operations. I also support advancing the notion of competitive neutrality between transport modes. Let us not just leave this as a question of ownership, let us get down to true efficiency in the transport system. There should be in Australia a more level playing field and greater competitive neutrality between road and rail transport. Currently, the system is not fair. It is not competitively neutral. For instance, when a government builds a road, it looks only at the potential community use. There. is no demand for the government to make a financial profit on road construction. However, there is a movement essen- towards commercial costing of new rail projects; that is, governments are expected to split make a commercial return on capital outlays for rail projects. Over the past two decades, real Commonwealth capital outlays on roads have been 10 times greater than all forms of federal rail funding, including rail operating subsidies. The urtlevel playing field goes further. Nowhere in the public sector is there a cost recovery expectation on road maintenance, yet we are moving towards full cost pricing on rail to recover all the recurrent costs. Equally, there is no focus within the parliaments of the nation on road operating losses for government, but there is a huge focus on rail operating losses. As well, road is not subject to any taxation of its externalities, such as pollution, congestion and each of the other problems that come with certain aspects of road transport. Rail has few externalities. If that were built into the competitive equation, there would be much greater government investment in rail transport in this country than we see at the moment. This federal government has been keen to promote the provision of private infrastructure in Australia. This is a logical response to the fiscal constraints placed on all levels of government in the 1990s. The infrastructure bonds introduced in the One Nation statement have now been enhanced by the Working Nation white paper, with a 33 per cent tax rebate for bond holders. Even with the best facilitation of private projects, however, infrastructure in Australia will remain primariAustralia's ly a responsibility for the public sector. Currently, just 11 per cent of national infrastructure outlays are funded from the private sector. Government capital spendirig is a crucial determinant of Australia's economic competitiveness. With more extreme climatic conditions and diversity of landscape than any other country, this is not an easy task. Nonetheless, on an island continent with disperse population centres, economic efficiency inevitably depends on the effectiveness of the transport system. Whenever the economic distance between markets is reduced, Australia enhances its competitive advantages for both domestic and external trade. Governments should regard transport investment as an essential structural reform, not as a function of the business cycle. The approach taken by One Nation, recognising the importance of transport to the nation and its regions, should not be restricted to pump priming the economy. Capital spending has been used as a swing instrument in the federal budget, inversely proportional to rates of economic growth while directly proportional to the size of the budget deficit. Better outcomes can be achieved through consistent long-term strategies for the nation's infrastructure and capital spending. Recurrent outlays are better suited to the role of a swing instrument. I am confident that this approach will soon be adopted nationally. It will be led by this government, using the findings of the National Transport Planning Task Force. We should recognise the importance of competitive neutrality and more rail investment, especially for the regions, to make our country economically competitive. (Time expired)",28
15,Mr OCONNOR,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"Corio) (11.40 a.m.)May I commend the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on his contribution to this debate on the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill. He does have a long standing interest in urban transport issues and a keen interest in, and appreciation of, the manner in which transport systems fit into the national economic framework. The Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 amends· a series of acts that govern vital transport systems. Those acts have been mentioned, and I will mention them again: the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990, the Australian National Railways Commission Act ·1983, the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959,· the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986, the· Motor Vehicles Standards Act 1989,·the Navigation Act 1912, the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981, the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Act 1986 and the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. I do not propose to go into the finer details of all the amendments that are being made to these acts. Suffice to say that there are no major shifts in transport policy in the bill which is now before the House. Rather, these amendments are. designed to improve the administration and delivery of existing policies. If we look at the series of amendments the most major amendments are those which include changes to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act, the National Railways Commission Act and the Federal Airports Corporation Act. The changes to these acts include revised accountability arrangements for the Commonwealth authorities and the government business enterprises which are involved. The amendments ensure that the lines of communication are improved between ministerial officers, the authorities and the enterprises involved. The amendments provide for ministerial notices about the strategic direction of enterprises and the supply of information to ministers and ministerial nominees. One of the difficulties we have had in the past has been getting sufficient flexibility in the way our public enterprises operate in market environments and retaining some semblance of accountability, ministerial direction and, should I say, control. These enterprises and corporations belong to the public of this country, the people of Australia. They are managed by the government and by the executives of the enterprises in the interests of the people. Given these sets of amendments, it is entirely appropriate that we should be strengthening the accountability of these enterprises while at the same time maintaining their essential ability to operate flexibly in the Australian national economic environment. Transport infrastructure is quite critical to the development of Australian regions. I happen to represent in this parliament a strong manufacturing region of the Commonwealth: Geelong, in the seat of Corio. I do not think there would be a member of this House who would not acknowledge the critical part that is played by our transport system in our economic development. In the regions, such as the one I represent, it has never been more so than today. The transport system is really the artery that pumps the blood of the economy. The objectives at all levels of government-local, state and federal-ought to be to build the most efficient transport system, to add to and maintain existing transport assets, and to integrate fully the various modes to increase the overall economic efficiency of the economy. As a national community, and as a highly urbanised population, we. have come to appreciate more the links between the transport system, the quality of our environment and the national economy and its performance. As far as the economic equation is concerned, we live in a country where there are vast distances between where the goods are produced and where the people who consume them live .. Our markets are largely concentrated where the people are concentrated-that is, on the eastern seaboards-and much of the raw material and produce are grown or mined elsewhere, vast distances from those major centres of population. Therefore, there is an urgent need for us always to pay attention to the efficiencies of the transport system. From the internal to the external sense, Australia is geographically located away from many of its major markets. We must ensure that the process does not just stop internally and that we achieve efficiencies in linking the regional markets, which I represent in this parliament, with the external environment. The transport network is absolutely critical to maintaining the competitiveness of our regions. The transport systems are very important to our standards of living. I have mentioned the importance of these systems in an economic sense but not in an environmental sense. Many Australians are living in what I would call less than quality environments because of air and noise pollution and, on the odd occasion, oil spills from the pollution of bays. I have mentioned that transport issues are critical to the development of our regions. Getting goods to the larger markets and to the international economy is a major task. The Kelty task force, which recently reported to the government, addressed these issues quite specifically. It identified the following key issues: the need for better and safer roads and linkages to the national highway system; improved linkages between the various modes of transport and improved facilities for the transfer of goods between the various modes; and better rail and public transport systems not only in our cities but also in our regions. It also commented significantly on the effect to regions when transport services are cut back. It should be remembered that, for many regional communities, transport, infrastructure and the provision of transport services are not just economic issues but also social issues. I share the view expressed in the Kelty task force report provided to the government that 'better transport is an investment in growth and not a drain on the community'. As I said, I represent a regional community in this parliament which is particularly blessed with transport infrastructure assets in road, rail, sea and air. As far as Geelong is concerned, it is well serviced by the Princes Highway. That highway links Geelong to its major market in Melbourne. At some stage the communities of Melbourne and Geelong in the state of Victoria will have to give consideration to a third lane stretching from Melbourne to Geelong. Under the one nation statement we made some inroads into that task, but it is one that ought to be considered now rather than later and factored into infrastructure expenditures over the next decade. The Princes Highway also links Geelong to its productive western district hinterland. Of course, Geelong is linked by good road systems in the form of Great Ocean Road to the surf coast-a fast developing region of the state of Victoria. These linkages are very important. They link Geelong to its major hinterland areas which produce wool, grains and other commodities. They also link Geelong to an area of great growth: the Great Ocean Road and the surf coast area. The federal government, which I represent here on the floor of the parliament, has acknowledged the importance of an efficient road system to the Geelong region. As I mentioned, through the One Nation package we commenced the task of putting in a third lane in .the Geelong-Melbourne highway. We completed the dual carriageway on the Portarlington Road which links the urban developments on the Bellarine Peninsula with Geelong proper. The Bellarine Peninsula is one of the fastest growing areas in an urban sense in Australia. That particular road is most important for residents living on the Bellarine Peninsula and for strengthening the economic linkages between the towns on the Bellarine and the city of Geelong. We completed the dual carriageway from Geelong to Torquay, regarded as the gateway to the Great Ocean Road, which has provided the stimulus for economic development and an impetus for tourism in the whole surf coast region. It is tourism that this region is looking towards to stimulate job creation and economic growth. I am pleased to say that there were federal funds provided to complete the Western Ring Road in Melbourne which now links Geelong and surf coast regions much better with the Melbourne market, northern areas of Victoria and southern New South Wales. Under that same program the federal government put over $14 million into the black spots program to improve road safety in the region. Under the building better cities program we have put $2 million towards a new bus interchange in the city of Geelong which will improve urban transport in that city. So far as rail services are concerned, Geelong is linked to Melbourne by a very fast and efficient commuter service. One Nation moneys were provided to upgrade that line and to improve commuter travelling time. But perhaps of more importance was the government's decision to link Geelong into the national standard gauge network which was commented upon by the honourable member for Werriwa in his speech to the parliament this morning. The improvements that this will bring to freight movements in the region and to linking the region into the national market are incalculable. So far as sea traffic is concerned, Geelong is particularly blessed with a bulk handling port which ranks as one of the great bulk handling ports in the nation. It is a major handler of petroleum, grain and other bulk commodities, and it has considerable potential for further development if handled correctly, and I will comment on that in a minute. The government reforms have already played a very important part in improving the efficiencies of this particular port. The government's waterfront reforms and its program of microeconomic reform have seen enormous efficiency gains in the port of Geelong. We have seen a decrease in the work force of some 50 per cent, and the multiskilling of those workers who have remained. There have been substantial reductions in operating costs and lifts in profitability, and this has been reflected in the reduced charges to port users. We now see the port of Geelong as a very important source of regional investment both in terms of infrastructure and economic goods and services that are bought within the city of greater Geelong. So it is with some consternation that I reflect on the decision of the Kennett government to privatise this port. This is being done against the advice of major sectors of the Geelong community. I understand that certain sectors have bowed to pressure from the Kennett government and have finally acceded to these privatisation proposals, but I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, what they say in public is not what they say to me in private. In discussions I had with business leaders and others when the Minister for Trade (Senator MCMullan) recently visited Geelong, the business community spoke. of the stupidity of the Kennett government walking down the line of privatising the port of Geelong. It is nothing short of plundering the assets of the community. I really question why in January this community in private was so vehemently opposed to the privatisation proposals, yet one month later came out in public strongly supporting it. As far as air services are concerned, we have an asset of unbridled potential in Avalon Airport. This area offers great potential for growth in passenger and freight movements. I point to the stimulus that has been given to Avalon by the recent decision of the government to award a contract for the maintenance of military aircraft to E-Systems, ASTA and others in that consortium. It will secure the skills of the area and will certainly give an impetus to developments that are occurring there. I am pleased to announce to the House that recently Hazelton Airlines, one of the major rural and regional airlines in Australia, commenced a service into Avalon airport. It is a fledgling passenger service, but I think it is the mark of bigger and better things to come. There are plans by the City of Greater Geelong and ASTA to develop the area. I think we need to revisit one of the major recommendations of the Kelty task force, that Essendon be closed and general aviation activities be increased at Avalon. This will give a great stimulus to the plans to develop this particular part of the Geelong region. Avalon has a great potential not only for a passenger service but also for a freight service, with a productive hinterland that can provide goods that can be exported by air through this particular facility. As far as the future is concerned, it is really time now for the Geelong region to examine more closely the development of its transport infrastructure assets. There is enormous potential for planned development if we get it right. This potential has been identified both in the Kelty task force report that was delivered to the government and in the Geelong 2010 vision process which was recently instigated by the City of Greater Geelong. Geelong has the potential to become a regional transport hub, with the magnificent transport assets which I have mentioned to this parliament. It is now time for the community to think closely and clearly about the intermodal linkages that will need to be effected to improve the efficiency of Geelong's transport network. Of course, we need to look at continually upgrading the great transport infrastructure assets that we have. There is a need to link the port of Geelong to the national standard gauge network. The port of Geelong has recently completed a feasibility study that suggests that there are great economic advantages to the region if this particular linkage is made. But if the Kennett government goes ahead with its privatisation of the port of Geelong, I wonder whether those linkages will be made and I wonder about the accumulated economic expertise that has been built up over time in the port of Geelong, which serves the Geelong community so well. I fear for its dissipation in this mad privatisation that is taking place in the port area. Vehicles already exist to examine and fund certain intermodal linkages. The government in its regional development program has provided some $68 million over a four-year rolling program for regional strategic infrastructure. I urge the City of Greater Geelong to look very closely at that particular program and at the expenditure it allows. The government has just tabled the urban and regional development review report entitled Timetabling for tomorrow. The press release that Minister Howe put out states: The Commonwealth will be interested in transport investments which occur after a strategic transport plan had been completed for a specific area. This plan would address all of the transport issues rather than look only at roads, or rail separately. So what you DON'T get is a series of separate decisions being made about pieces of transport to find out that this doesn't really make efficient and equitable system on the ground. What you DO get is the planning done before investment decisions are made, and the planning includes all aspects of the transport network ... The Geelong region must take note of this. (Time expired)  noon)-I am pleased to participate in the debate on the Transport Legislation Amendbeen ment Bill 1994 and to reinforce the made by my colleague the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), in respect of the expertise that dwells in the port of Geelong. The proposed fragmentation of the management of that port is the wrong way to go in providing the best results for the and the utilisation of the skill and knowledge of the officers. Geelong, like other regions in Australia, always finds it harder to reap the benefits that come from economic growth. happening. Geelong and the Hunter region have many similarities in geographical advantage and utilisation of the work force. This bill covers some 10 different acts are administered within the portfolio of the Department of Transport. I want to address my remarks to some of those matters. The liability limit in the case of passenger death or injury with Australian international carriples ers, scheduled and charter flights, has been increased to $500,000. In recent times, the House of RepresentaKingdom tives Standing Committee on Transport, relating to salvage. Communications and Infrastructure has been dealing with the question of the insurance cover for passengers of general aviation aircraft. The warning has been sounded many times in the chamber, but it must be sounded again. Persons boarding private aircraft for pleasure should make sure that the aircraft insurance cover for them. I think it is comise, mon knowledge that some aircraft operate uninsured. There are also those that operate with cover for the aircraft but not for the passenger or the pilot. In the aviation industry people tend to think that all of the protections that apply to the major domestic and international airlines flow only on to smaller aircraft. Perhaps someone has for an an aircraft and he wants to fly from Nambucca Heads to Walgett. He invites four of us the to join him and we share the costs. We must ask ourselves if we are protected in the event of the unthinkable happening. On many occasions there is no protection at all. With this legislation we want to ensure that everybody-particularly in the charter area-is covered. The private area is not covered, but at least the charter area will be. There have major deficiencies in the lack of cover remarks and the amount of cover available. Whilst this will impose some additional costs on the owners and operators of aircraft, they are costs. that have to be borne. People utilising those services have to be protected. port When members of this House are travelling on chartered aircraft they should similarly make sure that there is insurance protection for them in the event of the unthinkable I turn to the Navigation Act 1912. The the major amendments contained in the bill have been covered by previous speakers. One that amendment removes the entitlement to wages where there is a right to compensation under the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992. Another amendment incorporates into part VII of the act the terms and princiadopted by the International Maritime Organisation in its International Convention on Salvage 1989. It replaces the current provisions based on pre-federation United legislation in the 1910 convention It is interesting that much of our maritime and shipping legislation is drawn from the 1867 British Merchant Shipping Act, which in turn was designed essentially for sailing ships of that period. If any industry has been has slow to adopt new legislation and to modernit is the maritime industry, so we should be looking at an overall simplification of the Navigation Act rather than tinkering at the edges. It is a massive act and it contains a lot of areas worthy of modernisation. The amendment to part IV of the act, provision for inspection and certification ships, flows from two conventions-the 1974 International Convention on Safety of Sea and the 1966 International Convention on Load Lines of 1966. The amendment to this part of the act will also· give effect to resolution of the International Maritime Organisation permitting the early implementaregistration, tion of the system of ship survey and certificertified cation, which harmonises with those two of conventions. It also goes to the simplification of surveys. At this time in world shipping, when a substantial minority of ships are still substandCoastguard ard and operate in a substandard manner, the inspection or survey of ships has become such a burden that ship owners and ship managers are complaining that some of their vesselsAuthority particularly substandard vessels-may have as many as seven separate surveys in port. They may very well complain about it but that is a result of the substandard practices within the industry globally. Once we can get better quality in international shipping and once more of the major operathe tors move to operate quality ships, ships that meet international conventions, I am sure that the insurance industry and the cargo owners, the classification societies and the port states that those ships are visiting will ease their inspection requirements for those particular vessels. In respect of substandard shipping, pleased to mention in the House that the International Bulk Journal, in its February 1995 issue, published a report on the informara tion being provided by the Australian Marithe time Safety Authority. The article is headed 'AMSA publishes detentions list'. The part that I am particularly pleased about reads: In line with its commitment to the maritime industry and the protection of marine environment AMSA has commenced publishing on a monthly basis details of vessels detained following inspections by its ship safety surveyors. The release of this data is also in line with the recommendaber, tions of the ""Ships of Shame"" report presented to Parliament by the House of Representatives ing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. . . the When that committee made its recommendaof tions, they were seen as heresy. The information was said to be commercially confidential Life at and could not possibly be disclosed. Once that report was tabled in this chamber in December 1992, the attitude right around a the world to the publication of informationwho owns and manages the vessel, state of age of vessel, who classified or the vessel, date of last survey, date last inspection by port state, deficiencieschanged. All that information is now being published in the major nations. The European Community is moving to the same system and extending the information. The United States is also expanding on our recommendations. It is very heartening to see, in a major international shipping journal, that reports emanating from our Maritime Safety are being circulated around the world. The article goes on to refer to some of when they are the vessels involved. The standard of shipping coming to Australia seems to be improving, while vessels of a substandard nature are going to other parts of world. We were told at hearings in Sydney in September of last year that substandard vessels seemed to be avoiding Australia and congregating more in the Atlantic ports. Those Atlantic ports are the iron ore ports out be looking to of South America. In the same journal-and we were aware of this earlier-is a very detailed coverage of the sinking at the iron ore berth of a vessel called I am the Trade Daring. The Trade Daring is a 145,000 deadweight ton oil and bulk ore carrier. It was being loaded at Porta di Madeiat Brazil in November last year, and during process of loading broke its back and sunk at the berth. That situation excited the interests in earlier times of our iron ore and coal loaders in this nation because they did not want to see the prospect of their loading facilities being disrupted by vessels becoming disabled or breaking up at the berth and so monthly putting their own facility out of action. It was not until towards the end of Decemover a month later, that the vessel was Standable to be broken in two. It had broken its back, the berth was immobilised, the iron ore had to be removed, 2Y2 thousand tonnes of fuel oil had to be removed from the vessel, and there were still contaminants that flowed from the vessel that went into the berth and to the harbour at that point. Then the two halves were floated and towed out into the Atlantic and scuttled at a site that was selected by the Brazilian navy. I mention that because it is current information. It shows that we are seeing fewer substandard ships, but we are still seeing far too many of them. In global terms, those ships are still a blight on the international shipping industry. The deprivation and abuse of crew members still continue. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) referred to that this morning in his remarks. I concur wholeheartedly with his criticism of the owners and operators of those vessels, but I repeat to the chamber that, in many cases, it is more the users of those vessels who must be held to account. If you have a substandard ship, it is standard ship. It can be tied up on a buoy, it can be tied up alongside, but it does not really represent a danger to people's lives until somebody decides to use it because it is cheap. It is those people and those firms, and the sellers of those products that utilise those vessels that get the cheap freight rates that have to be held to account publicly. That is going to happen increasingly. In the information provided by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority we have asked as a committee-and we are pleased that the authority is responding to it-that where a ship is detained it also list in its information the charter of the ship. The authority is publishing the names of the ships that are being detained in Australian ports, but along with that when the information is availableand it generally is available-it should publish who has chartered the ship and what kind of cargo the ship has carried so that the cargo owners can be identified. That is another way in which we can put pressure on to try to clear our seas of these vessels and the dangers that they pose to seafarers, the ports and the marine environments of the countries they are visiting. In this nation, we have a very minimal participation in shipping, despite the efforts that have been made to improve efficiency. That efficiency does continue to improve. By way of comparison, in 1992-93, we handled some $49 billion worth of export cargo, 2Yz per cent only by value being carried by Australian vessels. In 1992-93, some $43 billion worth of imports came into this country. In respect of imports, by value only nine per cent of those cargoes were handled in Australian flag ships. We adhere to standards in this country in respect of our shipping that other countries do not yet adhere to. We adhere to standards in respect of our crews that other countries do not adhere to. That is a continuing global problem which we have addressed in other ways and which our government is addressing through the International Maritime Organisation. There is reference in the legislation to alcohol abuse on board ships. Alcohol and a sub- drug abuse on board ships is not a new problem. It really reflects the nature of the work on ships. Today, ships with much faster turnarounds provide little opportunity for crews to get a break from sea, to get a break ashore, particularly if they are on tankers or on bulk cargo ships where they go into isolated terminals and isolated loading facilities. It is a serious problem not only in Australia but also around the world. It reflects the nature of the work and, in some cases more than others, it reflects the deprivation and the abuse of crews that takes place. I am very pleased that we are moving to general purpose crews in Australia. We are moving through a process of other advances that arose out of an agreement reached between the maritime unions in this country and the Australian shipowners. This followed the government's decision to improve the tax benefits available to the Australian shipping industry. What has arisen out of this agreement are things like the reduction in crew size-that is also covered in this legislation and I will come to ship's capital grants a little later on-and the reduction in the crew to berth ratio. Also the continuity of employment has been improved. Shipowners say that they invest a considerable amount of money in the training of crew and they want to see that trained crew member spend a longer consecutive period on board their vessel to get the benefit of the training effort. Overall, there is a considerable amount improvement to take place in the Australi-n shipping industry. I am pleased that that. being done by agreement between the shlpinterest ping industry in this country and the maritime unions that are involved. In addition, a group has been formed, the shipping services task force 2000, which arose out of a conference on Australian shipping in Launceston on 17 and 18 August last year. I participated group. That group is moving to get a wider Australian recognition of the dimensions of the Australian shipping industry. (Quorum formed) The group I mentioned earlier, the shipping services task force 2000, has set itself target of identifying Australia's maritime network; not just ships, but all the shore people from the classifications side: the freight forwarders and the insurance commoving panies, all of those that are dependent upon the operation of shipping in this nation.

16,Mr OKEEFE,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"Burke-Parliamentary tional Secretary to the Minister for Transport) the (12.20 p.m.)-in reply-In summing debate on the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill, I would like, first, to thank the opposition for its assistance in helping us this legislation. I would like to compliment the various members from both sides for their contributions: the members for Hume (Mr Sharp), Parkes (Mr Cobb) and Wannon (Mr levels. Hawker) from the opposition side; and the members for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), Throsby (Mr Hollis), Werriwa (Mr Latham), Corio (Mr  from our side. As can be gathered from the debate, there has been considerable interest in the House the issues related to the maritime industry. Australia is a very large user of international shippjng. We have a quite proud history· in seafaring, in our own way, and there of things being done on a whole range of kaleidoscopes at the moment to expand and enhance our role in shipping. I particularly commend the member for Shortland and his House committee for the work they have done-I have done so in the House before-in the past particularly in the of area of ship safety and for the work they continue to do in safety in the whole transport lS field. That work is obviously of considerable to the members of the committee. It causes them to make very well-informed contributions in these debates. These things are obviously to the credit of the members and the House. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and I do appreciate the interest in that and support on these issues. There are some amendments that I will be moving shortly which will incorporate the provisions of the 1989 convention - nd they will establish environmental protectlOn as a goal of salvage operations in its new reward the system. The fixing of that reward, I might add, takes account of the skill and efforts of a salvor in preventing and minimising damage to the environment in salvage operations, to another field of best pract.ice in those issues in our part of the world. It lS true to say that the provisions of the 1989 convention have broad support within the internamaritime community. They also have support of state and territory governments, up the and industry organisations. In concluding the debate I would like to just repeat a point I made during the seco-d pass reading speech yesterday. The work that lS being done in Australia, particularly in the protection of the environment as. it relat-s to shipping, is being recognised at mternatlOnal It is with some pride that we can note that the International Maritime Organisation has declared the Great Barrier Reef zone as a sensitive area for shipping purposes. It is the first area to be internationally so declared. I think that is quite a feather in the caps of the various officials and people who have been in involved in the maritime debate and in presenting Australia's expertise and credentials in this field. I thank all who have been involved and the opposition for its support of are lots these legislative changes. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2.",39
17,Mr OKEEFE,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"by leave-I move: (1) Clause 2, page 2, line 2, omit ""and (5)"", substitute "", (5) and (SA)"". (2) Clause 2, page 2, after subclause (5) insert the following subclause: ""(SA) Subject to subsection (7), items 37 to 54 and 58 of Part G of Schedule 1 commence on a day to be fixed by Proclamation."". (3) Clause 2, page 2, at the end of the clause add the following subclause: ""(7) If items 37 to 54 and 58 of Part G of Schedule 1 do not commence within the period of 6 months beginning on the day on which the International Convention on Salvage, 1989 enters into force for Australia, they commence on the first day after the end of that period."". These amendments correct certain references required by the insertion of the salvage convention as a schedule to the bill. In particular, clause 3 requires that the amendments inserting the International Convention on Salvage enter into force by proclamation six months after they enter into force in Australia This ensures an open-ended period for the proclamation.",40
18,Mr SHARP,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"The opposition will not be opposing these amendments. Whilst the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) is here, I might take the opportunity to make the point that these are amendments of amendments, in a sense. In the interests of efficiency, it would have been a darned sight better to have got them right in the first place. I just draw this to the attention of the parliament because this is not the first time in the last couple of years that we have been having to deal with matters in this fashion. The question in my mind is: why was it not got right in the first place, rather than having to go through this additional process at additional cost in order to get it right? I just draw  Secretary. I know the departmental officers here will, no doubt, be filled with joy at my comments. But this is a most inefficient way to have to deal with these sorts of things. It would be better to get it right in the first instance. Amendments agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 3 to 10-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Schedule 1.",40
19,Mr OKEEFE,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"by leave-I move: (4) Schedule 1, Part G, page 30, item 38, before the proposed definition of ""damage to the environment"" insert the following proposed definition: "" 'common understanding concerning Articles 13 and 14 of the Salvage Convention' means the common understanding: (a) that is referred to in section 315; and (b) the terms of which are set out in Part B of Schedule 9;"". (5) Schedule 1, Part G, page 30, item 38 (proposed definition of ""Salvage Convention""), omit the proposed definition, substitute: "" 'Salvage Convention' means the International Convention on Salvage, 1989, as set out in Part A of Schedule 9 to this Act;"". (6) Schedule 1, Part G, page 38, add at the end of the Part: . ""58. After Schedule 8: Add the Schedule set out in Schedule 4 to this Act."". Just to briefly explain, these amendments are further measures to clarify the 'common understanding concerning articles l3 and 14 of the salvage convention'. By way of closing, I might make the observation that I acceptthe comments made by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) in the spirit in which they are given. I hope that he will have some understanding of the fact that these are difficult and complex matters and also that these conventions are fast moving things. We are picking up some wins and therefore having to amend the legislation to take part in those wins. But I do take the point. We would all prefer not to be moving amendments to amendments. Amendments agreed to. Schedule, as amended, agreed to. Schedules 2 and 3-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. New schedule 4.

Article 10 Article 7 Duty to render assistance Every master is bound, so far as he can do so without serious danger to his vessel and persons thereon, to render assistance to any person in danger of being lost at sea. 2 The States Parties shall adopt the measures necessary to enforce the duty set out in paragraph 1. 3 The owner of the vessel shall incur no liability for a breach of the duty of the master under paragraph 1. . . Article 8 Article 11 Co-operation A State Party shall, whenever regulating or deciding upon matters relating to salvage operations such as admittance to ports of vessels in distress or the provision of facilities to salvors, take into account the need for co_operation between salvors, other parties and public authorities in order to or ensure the efficient and successful performance of salvage operations for the purpose of saving life or property in danger as well as preventing damage to the environment in general. Chapter III-Rights of salvors Article 12 Conditions for reward Salvage operations which have had a useful result give right to a reward. 2 Except as otherwise provided, no payment is due under this Convention if the salvage operations have had no useful result. 3 This chapter shall apply, notwithstanding that the salved vessel and the vessel undertaking the salvage operations belong to the same owner. Article 13 Criteria for fixing the reward The reward shall be fixed with a view to encouraging salvage operations, taking into accountthe following criteria without regard to the order in which they are presented below: (a) the salved value of the vessel and other Article 9 property; (b) the skill and efforts of the salvors in preventing or minimizing damage to the envi ronment; (c) the measure of success obtained by the salvor; (d) the nature and degree of the danger; (e) the skill and efforts of the salvors in salving the vessel, other property and life; (t) the time used and expenses and losses incurred by the salvors; (g) the risk of liability and other risks run the salvors or their equipment; (h) the promptness of the services rendered; (i) the availability and use of vessels or other equipment intended for salvage operations; 0) the state of readiness and efficiency of the salvor's equipment and the value thereof. 2 Payment of a reward fixed according to paragraph I shall be made by all of the vessel and other property interests in proportion to· their respective salved values. However, a State Party may in its national law provide that the payment of a reward has to be made by one of these interests, subject to a right of recourse of this interest against the other interests for their respective shares. Nothing in this article shall prevent any right of defence. 3 The rewards, exclusive of any interest and recoverable legal costs that may be payable thereon, shall not exceed the salved value of the vessel and other property. Special compensation If the salvor has carried out salvage operations in respect of a vessel which by itself or its cargo threatened damage to the environment and has failed to earn a reward under article 13 at least equivalentto the special compensation assessable in accordance with this article, he shall be entitled to special compensation from the owner of that vessel equivalent to his expenses as herein defined. 2 If, in the circumstances set out in paragraph 1, the salvor by his salvage operations has prevented or minimized damage to the environment, special compensation payable by the owner to salvor under paragraph 1 may be increased up a maximum of30% of the expenses incurred by the salvor. However, the tribunal, if it deems it arose. fair and just to do so and bearing in mind the relevant criteria set out in article 13, paragraph 1, may increase such special compensation further, but in no event shall the total increase be more than 100% of the expenses incurred by the salvor. 3 Salvor's expenses for the purpose of paragraphs 1 and 2 means the out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by the salvor in the salvage operation and a fair rate for equipment personnel actually and reasonably used in the salvage operation, taking into consideration the criteria set out in article 13, paragraph l(h), (i) and (j). 4 The total special compensation under this article shall be paid only if and to the extent that such compensation is greater than any reward recoverable by the salvor under article 13. by 5 If the salvor has been negligent and has thereby failed to prevent or minimize damage to the environment, he may be deprived of the whole or part of any special compensation due under this article. 6 Nothing in this article shall affect any right of recourse on the part of the owner of the vessel. Article 15 Apportionment between salvors 1 The apportionment of a reward under article 13 between salvors shall be made on the basis of the criteria contained in that article. 2 The apportionment between the owner, master and other persons in the service of each salving vessel shall be determined by the law of the flag of that vessel. If the salvage has not been carried out from a vessel, the apportionment shall be determined by the law governing the contract between the salvor and his servants. Article 16 Article 14 Salvage of persons 1 No remuneration is due from persons whose lives are saved, but nothing in this article shall affect the provisions of national law on this subject. 2 A salvor of human life, who has taken part in the services rendered on the occasion of the accident giving rise to salvage, is entitled to a fair share of the payment awarded to the salvor for salving the vessel or other property or preventing or minimizing damage to the environment. Article 17 Services rendered under existing contracts the No payment is due under the provisions of this the Convention unless the services rendered exceed to what can be reasonably considered as due performance of a contract entered into before the danger Article 18 The effect of salvor's misconduct A salvor may be deprived of the whole or part of the payment due under this Convention to the extent that the salvage operations have become necessary or more difficult because of fault or neglect on his part or if the salvor has been guilty and of fraud or other dishonest conduct. Prohibition of salvage operations Services rendered notwithstanding the express and reasonable prohibition of the owner or master of the vessel or the owner of any other property in danger which is not and has not been on board the vessel shall not give rise to payment under this Convention. Chapter IV-Claims and actions 1 Nothing in this Convention shall affect the salvor's maritime lien under any international convention or national law. 2 The salvor may not enforce his maritime lien when satisfactory security for his claim, including interest and costs, has been duly tendered or provided. Duty to provide security Upon the request of the salvor aperson liable for a payment due under this Convention shall provide satisfactory security for the claim, including interest and costs of the salvor. 2 Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the owner of the salved vessel shall use his best endeavours to ensure that the owners of the cargo provide satisfactory security for the claims against them including interest and costs before the cargo is released. 3 The salved vessel and other property sllall not, without the consent of the salvor, be removed from the port or place at which they first arrive after the completion of the salvage operations until satisfactory security has been put up for the salvor's claim against the relevant vessel or property. Interim payment The tribunal having jurisdiction over the claim of the salvor may, by interim decision, order that the salvor shall be paid on account such amount as seems fair and just, and on such terms including terms as to security where appropriate, as may be fair and just according to the circumstances of the case. . 2 In the event of an interim payment under this article the security provided under article 21 shall be reduced accordingly. Limitation of actions 1 Any action relating to payment under this Convention shall be time-barred ifjudicial or arbitral proceedings have not been instituted within a Article 19 period of two years. The limitation period commences on the day on which the salvage operations are terminated. 2 The person against whom a claim is made may at any time during the running of the limitation period extend that period by a declaration to the claimant. This period may in the like manner be further extended. 3 An action for indemnity by a person liable may be instituted even after the expiration of the Article 20 limitation period provided for in the preceding Maritime lien paragraphs, if brought within the time allowed by the law of the State where proceedings are instituted. Article 24 Interest The fight of the salvor to interest on any payment due under this Convention shall be determined according to the law of the State in which the Article 21 tribunal seized of the case is situated.

Article 26 Humanitarian cargoes No provision of this Convention shall be used as a basis for the seizure, arrest or detention of human itarian cargoes donated by a State, if such State has agreed to pay for salvage services rendered in respect of such humanitarian cargoes. Article 27 Article 22 Publication of arbitral awards States Parties shall encourage, as far as possible and with the consent of the parties, the publication of arbitral awards made in salvage cases.

DONE AT LONDON this twenty-eighth day of April one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine. NA ARTICLES 13 AND 14 OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON SALVAGE, 1989 It is the common understanding of the Conference that, in fixing a reward under article l3 and assessof ing special compensation under article 14 of the International Convention on Salvage, 1989 the tribunal is under no duty to fix a reward under article l3 up to the maximum salved value of the vessel and other property before assessing the special compensation to be paid under article Title agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion Mr O'Keefe)-by leaveread a third time. SOCIAL SECURITY (NON-BUDGET MEASURES) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 28 February. Second Reading",40
20,Mrs CROSIO,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (12.32 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill gives legislative force to a number of non-budget measures, improving the effectiveness and delivery of a wide range of social security payments. Several initiatives are to assist families, especially those taking on new parental responsibilities. Under current arrangements, family payment for a newborn child is backdated to the child's birth if a claim is lodged within 13 weeks of the birth. Similarly, when a newborn child is placed with an adoptive parent, family payment is backdated to the time when the child entered the parent's care if the form is Article 34 lodged within 13 weeks of the child's birth. Languages However, there is no backdating provision for people who adopt older, rather than newborn, children. These people may be paid only from the date of claim. This bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 so that arrears of family payment may be paid from the date a child enters an adoptive parent's care if the claim is lodged within 13 weeks of the date the child is placed in the person's care. PARTB Presently, when a person who is receiving family payment for one or more children takes on the care of a new child, whether by birth or adoption, it is unnecessary for the person to lodge a new claim for the new child. It is sufficient to notify the department the addition to the family for the increased rate to be paid. However, there is currently no rule allowing the increased rate to be backdated to the new child's birth or the date the new child came into the person's care. Ac14.'."". cordingly, the rate may be increased only from the first family payment payday after the actual birth or the date the new child came into the person's care. This bill makes amendments to allow rate increases for second and subsequent family payment children to be backdated if the department is notified of the birth of the second or subsequent child within 13 weeks of the birth or the date the child came into the person's care. Additional family payment rates applicable to children under the age of 16 are adjusted each year on 1 January so that the sum of the combined basic family payment and additional family payment does not fall below a certain percentage-benchmarksof adequacy--of the combined pensioner couple maximum basic rate. From 1 January 1995, additional family payment rates applicable to children under the age of 16 were increased by $1 per week as a result of a decision taken in the 1993-94 budget context. To preserve the benefit of the $1 increase, this bill changes the current level of benchmarks of adequacy so that the increased rates of additional family payment are reflected in the benchmarks. Therefore, from 1 January 1996, additional family payment rates will increase in line with the higher benchmarks. Sole parent pension is currently available to people bringing up children on their own, in a number of situations: People may qualify if they are not members of a couple, or, if they are members of a couple but living separately and apart from their partners. This bill ensures that people who are separated may qualify only if that separation is permanent or indefinite, and not if it is a strictly temporary separation. The sole parent pension is designed to provide mediumto long-term support for people faced with the responsibility of bringing up children on their own. It is not intended to be available to people separated from their partners due to holidays, work or study commitments or during short-term domestic disputes. This bill also introduces special measures to assist those people in our community caring for disabled relatives or friends. One measure concerns the current inconsistency that frail disabled people may travel overseas for a holiday without their own social security entitlement being affected, whereas their carer may not accompany them because the carer pension is generally not portable. This amendment allows a carer pensioner to accompany the person being cared for overseas without loss of qualification, provided that the period of absence is temporary and does not exceed three months. This will permit disabled people to retain the support of their carer while travelling overseas to visit their homeland, for· example, or to seek medical treatment. Since July 1993, carer pensioners have been entitled to participate in employment or education and training within the limitations imposed by their caring role. However, while long-term recipients of many social security payments are entitled to an employment entry payment to assist with the costs of starting employment and are entitled to an education entry payment to assist with the costs of taking up study, these entitlements have not been available to carer pensioners. This bill introduces an employment entry payment of $100 and an education entry payment of $200 for carer pensioners. This bill also introduces measures to assist people claiming the sickness allowance. The requirement to serve an ordinary waiting period is removed if the social security secretary is satisfied that it will cause the person severe financial hardship. A similar rule already applies to people who claim the jobsearch and newstart allowance. Mobility allowance is provided to assist with transport costs incurred by disabled people. It is generally payable to handicapped people who are in gainful employment, vocational training, voluntary work or certain approvedjobsearch activities. Disabled recipients of jobsearch, newstart or the youth training allowance are necessarily engaged in jobsearch activities, yet they have not had access to mobility allowance for technical reasons. This bill ensures that these people will have access to mobility allowance. In April 1993, an amendment to the Social Security Act 1991 extended the availability of fringe benefits to all disability support pensioners, regardless of income, for 12 months after their payments ceased. However, the continuation of fringe benefits was unintentionally restricted to pensioners who lose their qualification because they commence full-time work. It does not extend to those whose pension is cancelled because of their earnings but who do not commence full-time work. The dependent pensioner partners-that is, the wife or carer pensioners--of these disability support pensioners also lose their entitlement to a fringe benefit extension. The amendments made by this bill allow clients whose disability support pension is cancelled because of their earnings-whether from full-time work or not-to retain their eligibility for fringe benefits for 12 months. Currently, disability support pensioners who lose qualification as a result of commencing full-time work may have their pensions suspended-for two years-rather than cancelled. Should they again become qualified for disability support pension during that twoyear period, an accelerated restoration process replaces the need for a new claim. This provision, introduced as part of the disability reform package, was designed to serve as an incentive for clients to attempt employment. In contrast, however, pensioners whose disability support pensions are cancelled because of their earnings from part-time work would have their pensions cancelled upon expiry of any earnings credit. Such people would have to undergo a new claim assessment process if they again become eligible for pension. As a result, a disincentive exists for people to attempt part-time work, which is the only option available to many disability support pensioners. This is contrary to the spirit of the disability reform package. This bill applies the two-year suspension rule to persons whose disability support pensions cease because of their earnings. Partner allowance commenced in September 1994 as a direct payment to the dependent partner of a recipient of jobsearch, newstarl or sickness allowance or special benefit. The payment had previously been made as an addon to the rate paid to the allowance or benefit recipient. At present, partner allowance may only be paid 14 days in arrears. This may disadvantage some people in some cases if a person's partner is granted jobsearch, newstart or sickness allowance or special benefit more than 14 days before the lodgement of a claim for partner allowance. To address this problem the bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 so that partner allowance may be backdated to the date the person's partner claims jobsearch, newstart or sickness allowance or special benefit provided the claim for partner allowance is made within 14 days of the parfuer's claim. This bill makes a number of amendments to the jobsearch and newstart programs. Specifically, the bill allows the social security secre1991 tary the option of requiring a person to attend a particular place for a particular purpose as a condition of payment of jobsearch or newstart allowance. This option will be exercised in situations where, for example, the secretary considers that a particular program information session held outside DSS and the CES would be valuable for the person. This bill also amends provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 relating to the appropriation of money, from which jobsearch and newstart training supplements are paid, to more accurately reflect the source of those funds. Entitlement to the supplement is contingent on approval of participation in a vocational training program or labour market program by the employment secretary. This approval is not subject to review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. This bill makes a number of amendments to simplify, and make more equitable, the cancellation and debt recovery provisions of all the Social Security Act 1991. Certain provisions operate to create a debt when a person receives a payment that is calculated at a rate greater than the correct maximum payment rate. This applies whether or not the person notified the department of a change in circumstances, and the debt commences from the date of the relevant event or change in circumstances. As the debt incurred will be the same whether or not the department is advised, this acts as a disincentive for people to notify the department of changes in circumstances. To provide an incentive for social security recipients to notify promptly changes in circumstances, and to ensure that treatment is consistent with the treatment of other recipients who notify changes resulting in loss of qualification, this bill ensures that recipients who notify a change in circumstances that affects the maximum payment rate will incur a debt only from the end of the notification period. This allows them a period of grace. Under the current legislation, there is a clear distinction between qualification and payability for a social security payment. The general scheme of the Social Security Act is that payment is no longer payable to a person who loses qualification for it. However, the debt recovery provisions are not as clear on this point as they might be. This bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 to ensure that, once a social security recipient has lost qualification, the recipient will have no further entitlement to payments. This proposal does not disturb the current rules that allow for the continuation of payment to the end of the notification period. Rather, it provides an incentive for clients to notify a change in circumstances within the prescribed period. In the time since the bill was introduced, further examination ·of the debt recovery provisions contained in the bill has revealed that it is possible that certain provisions may not in fact operate as originally intended. That being the case, I will be moving amendments to the bill that will operate to remove any doubt on this matter and will ensure that the original intention of the provisions is put into effect. There are an estimated 170 local exchange trading systems or similar community exchange programs in existence nationally, the largest with 1,500 members. As goods and services are exchanged without recourse to money, these systems are a useful community initiative, particularly in representing a form of activity that helps social security recipients keep contact with labour market skills and habits. At present, goods and services provided in return for non-cash credits are assessed as income for the purposes of the income test in the Social Security Act 1991, which discourages participation in these schemes. This bill exempts certain non-cash credits from the income test to overcome this disincentive. This bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 to allow notice of a decision to be given to a person for the purposes of the act if that notice is sent by pre-paid post to a person's post office box last known to the secretary. This amendment clarifies the department's response to a number of Federal Court decisions. This bill also makes amendments to the National Health Act 1953 and the Datamatching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990. I will be moving amendments to the bill that will allow the Minister for Social Security to declare, by notice in writing and published in the Gazette, a particular class of debt that may be waived. This amendment recognises the development of a data matching program between the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office's reportable payments system-RPS-in relation to the incomes of non-PAYE taxpayers. The government amendment will enable particular classes of debts arising under the principal act to be waived for those who would be affected by the new data matching program and who volunteer advice to the Department of Social Security about their true circumstances. I will also be moving amendments to omit division 7 of the bill. That division deals with interview requirements for sole parent pension and bereavement allowance claimants. From 20 March 1995, a new payment type, income support supplement, will be introduced into the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The arrangements for carer pension need to take into account the introduction of income support supplement. Unless the carer pension provisions are amended, carer pensioners will lose qualification for carer pension if they care for a person who receives an income support supplement instead of a social security payment. I will therefore be moving amendments that deal with various carer pension provisions to ensure that carer pensioners are not disadvantaged by the introduction of the income support supplement. I commend the bill to the House.",46
21,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"Berowra) (12.48 p.m.)The Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is a very interesting bill. When the listing of the bill was discussed for debate, it was suggested that the bill be referred to the Main Committee. I was told that it contained largely matters of form, matters of a minor and inconsequential nature and matters of a rather superficial character which would not raise or excite any particular interest of the parliament. Sometimes I think bills of this character need an even more comprehensive review, and I have a suggestion on the way in which this matter might be progressed. I foreshadow that, unless the government is mindful to give the responsibilities to a committee of this House, we will once more ask the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee to examine a number of matters which I will identify. I believe amendments will be required for each of those matters. I will suggest a way in which the matter might be progressed satisfactorily to achieve an outcome that will meet the government's objectives and the concerns that I and others have raised. I will propose specifically one amendment to deal with an oversight in some legislation handled late last year in which all of the agreed amendments were not put in place. It should be recognised that these days social security legislation is extraordinarily complex. When we look at the advisers sitting over there and when we turn our eyes to the desk we can see probably what are meant to be rather plain English legislative guides that rise to something of the order of eight inches above the desk. Like tax law, social security law has become very complex indeed. But, as a measure of the cooperation that the government obtains from the opposition, I will at first instance mention the large number of issues that are covered in this legislation that will not be subject of significant adverse comment or amendment. These proposals are intended to modify the carer pensioner provisions for a person accompanying the carer overseas: that is, carers would be able to obtain the benefit of their pension while they accompany a person who is otherwise entitled to go overseas. The financial consequences of that are not regarded as significant, but it has been drawn to my attention that there are others who may become entitled to this particular benefit. While the government expects that only 10 or so cases might occur at this time, with the way in which pension payments are increasingly changing and with the greater likelihood with the introduction of the partner allowance that many more people will go onto carers' pensions, we should not be surprised if this has more significant financial implications over time. I notice that the welfare rights movement has also suggested some extensions of this area. No doubt the government would look at those matters in a budget context but, knowing of the ease with which it is considering social security expenditures in the context of this budget, I would not be too optimistic about significant further extensions at this time. But that matter has been raised. It is also sought to extend employment entry payments to carer pensioners. An education payment for carer pensioners is provided. While we are not opposing that matter, I observe that I sought some further information from the department which has not come to me at this time. That would normally prompt me to be more difficult about the matter. In relation to carers who have to provide constant care and attention, and with the definitions of what constitutes constant care and attention, how can we be providing access to carer pensioners to involve themselves in other work or other studies for up to 10 hours a week when we are going to give them a $100 entry payment on the one hand or an education entry payment of $200 on the other hand? They are meant to be offering constant care and attention. It may be that constant care and attention is not constant care and attention under the the definitions that we use. I had hoped that that matter would be clarified for me, but I have not seen any clarification. But, in my usual cooperative way, I am not allowing that matter to affect my judgment in the extent to which I facilitate the passage of the bill. The bill deals with other matters as well. It extends the suspensfon provisions to disability support pensioners when the DSP is cancelled because of earnings. It allows certain DSP recipients to retain eligibility for fringe benefits. It allows recipients of jobsearch and newstart allowances and the youth training allowance to receive a mobility allowance. It ensures that the partner allowance is payable from the same date as other allowances under certain circumstances. It will increase the additional family payment benchmark effective from 1 January 1996. It will allow retrospective family payment arrears and increases to be paid in certain circumstances. It will remove the need to determine whether a particular loan is exempt or not. It will remove the requirement for a waiting period before sickness allowance can be paid in certain circumstances. The bill will provide that the training supplement is payable only if the training course undertaken has approval of the employment secretary. It will expand the circumstances in which notices of decision are taken to be given to a person. It will ensure that a person is taken to have failed to negotiate an activity agreement if the secretary is satisfied that the person is reasonably delaying an agreement. The bill will reduce rates of payment of certain allowances from certain dates when a customer with an earnings credit balance fails to notify receipt of that income that could result in a decreased allowance payment. It will clarify that ministerial decisions under sections 1099E and 1099L are not subject to internal or Social Security Appeals Tribunal review. It will exempt specified exchange trading agreements from the income test provisions. It will simplify the continuation and variation of determinations. The bill will make minor and technical amendments to the National Health Act to enable certain persons who receive a mature age allowance to retain eligibility for Commonwealth fringe benefits and will preserve the health care card entitlement for certain mobility allowances. It also deals with certain data matching issues. We are not intending to raise substantial objections to any of those matters. It is an extraordinarily beneficial approach to take on legislation dealing with such a large number of matters-and I commend the advisers on getting so many matters right on this occasion-but it does reflect upon the nature of the Social Security Act when, in order to make non-budget measure changes, so many issues have to be addressed. I approach examination of these issues seriously. You wonder how any customer or client can reasonably expect to find their way through this legislation. This is a matter that is going to require review. I was at a conference recently in which the welfare rights movement took us through particular client examples, which revealed the enormous difficulty in properly advising people as to their entitlements. Because of the extent to which the government wants, in many cases, to put its own mark on the Social Security Act and to have programs with names that it can say it is responsible for, it has unnecessarily, in my view, introduced complexity of such an order that it puts customers and clients in enormous difficulty in being able to satisfy themselves as to their entitlements. I will now go to the six or so matters that I did not mention. The first relates to the issue of ensuring that the sole parent pension is payable only if the separation is permanent or indefinite. The government gave us some advice as to some problems it sees in this matter. I am told they are largely potential at the moment, and that is why we are told in the explanatory memorandum that the revenue could leach to some $30 million, presumably if people took advantage of what one might assume were loopholes in the existing arrangements. It is possible for people to separate but for the separation to be for a purpose. It could be that a partner has gone overseas or interstate to work or to study, leaving the partner at home. Nobody would envisage that a person in those circumstances would be able to have their spouse or partner on a sole parent pension, particularly if they are up on the North West Shelf working at great danger on an oil derrick pulling in $60,000 or $70,000 a year. That is possible, but nobody would expect the act to provide a sole parent pension in such circumstances. There are other matters that were raised in relation to the extent to which people in a relationship might temporarily separate. The issue arises as to whether or not-if that separation is clearly of a temporary character and the parties are going to come back together again-it is reasonable to allow a sole parent pension to be payable in those circumstances. This is where we do see very significant problems arising in relation to what happens in those instances where a spouse has left a violent partner for a temporary reason. Sometimes, when you look back at the relationship, it is very easy to make a judgment that the separation was temporary and make a determination on the basis that the parties have come back together again. But, in situations in which people are faced with some violent action which could occasion them to separate, there are difficult judgments that have to be made at that time. The government has suggested that the act presently provides more than sufficient discretion for those who are examining these matters to be able to make a definitive judgment as to whether or not a sole parent pension claimant has left because of the violent actions of the 'other member of a couple'these are the formal terms that are used-and that the claimant would not be forced, through lack of financial support, to return home to a dangerous situation. However, the fact is that a number of organisations have raised very real concern about this issue, including the welfare rights movement. Although it has been put to me that this body may not understand fully the framework of law that operates in this area, it has usually been my experience that it has a pretty good knowledge of these matters. The welfare rights movement is very concerned about this question, as is the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, which has raised exactly the same question as to what happens in cases where violence, in particular, might be involved. I have suggested to the department that, there is any ambiguity about these provisions, there may well be other examples in other areas of the law, whereby claims of domestic violence by a partner are examined by.an organisation that would normally hear from both sides and establish that the claims had view. been proven. In the area of immigration, this is done in relation to claims for grant of matter out. resident status, where a partner separates because of domestic violence. The government wants to be satisfied that there is a proper basis upon which a grant of residence status might be made in compassionate circumstances. This avoids double jeopardy, whereby a person loses their partner and then may be forced to leave Australia as well. The fact that the domestic violence was proven was accepted under that law. It may well be that the provisions that have ed. been used in immigration law could be used in this area to provide a basis for partners who had been the subject of domestic vioof lence proceedings. Such provisions could accepted as the method by which it could be proven that a couple had separated for just cause. I believe that those matters do need to a good deal more attention. That can be undertaken in the context of a committee examination, where the views put by the welfare rights movement can be laid on the table, as can the departmental view that these matters are already addressed. We can then develop further amendments, perhaps along the lines that I have suggested, or with the department's assistance. But these matters do need further attention. Certainly, we do not want to see the revenue leaching. People should not be able to obtain benefits because of an artificial separation, but they should be able to do so in cases where domestic violence is involved. I am sure my colleague the member for Pearce (Ms Moylan), who takes a very considerable interest in questions relating to women, would be concerned if I were not to put this matter clearly on the table. The second matter that I wish to raise is the requirement that claimants for a sole parent pension or bereavement allowance attend an if interview relating to that claim. This matter was raised by other organisations, particularly the welfare rights groups. The concern is that the requirement of notice suggested could be a period of less than 14 days in which a person would be required to attend an interMrs Crosio--We're going to take that",49
22,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"I acknowledge that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security says that the government is going to take that matter out. It was a matter of concern to me. I know it was raised with the government. It shows the way in which these matters can be responsibly addressed. I welcome that comment. It demonstrates the benefits that can be obtained from a thoroughgoing review of legislation when it is presentThe third matter of concern was the provision to allow the Secretary to the Department Social Security to require a jobsearch or be newstart allowance recipient to attend a particular place for a specified purpose. This is a particularly interesting matter because the government is already able to designate have whether a particular program meets the government's training requirements. It now wants to designate whether or not a particular jobsearch or newstart training participant able to participate in that particular approved program. Ordinarily, one would think that a judgment ought to be able to be made as to whether particular individual should participate in program, and whether the particular program suits that person. A determination could then be made that,even though a case manager has suggested it, the department is able to come to another view. If the clause is enacted in form that is proposed, it would be listed in ation may go. the non-reviewable decisions under section 1250 of the Social Security Act. That is a matter of concern to us. There a vast difference between approval of general course· as a suitable vocational traindetails ing or labour market program and the decimatters sion that a particular course will not assist particular person to find work. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills made the following observation: Pending the minister's advice, the committee draws attention to the provision, as it may be considered to make rights and liberties or obligations dependent upon a non-reviewable decision breach of principle IA(3) of the committee's terms of reference. And the committee draws Senators' attention to the provisions that may be considered to make rights and liberties and obligations unduly dependent on insufficiently defined administrative powers in breach of principle IA(2) of the committee's terms of reference, or, in the tive, to make the exercise of legislative power insufficiently subject to parliamentary scrutiny in breach of principle IA(5) of the committee's of reference. Given those comments, the opposition is mindful to oppose that particular measure another place. In relation to the fourth matter, the issue is to allow customer information to be disclosed to certain Commonwealth agencies. The government is seeking to change the proviclaimed sions by which information is presently made available to other Commonwealth departments and authorities. There are a number of provicould sions that operate in this area. I have briefing in relation to those. The one that we are dealing with here is to allow the Secretary to the Department of Social Security to disclose information not to the secretary another Commonwealth department or authis ority-which is the present arrangement-but to other staff of that Commonwealth department or authority. There are certain circumstances under a certain provisions where that can happen now, a but this provision is designed to extend the range. At the moment it is intended that that will be done by way of the secretary delegating his or her disclosure power. My concern is that that then takes it beyond the scrutiny the of this parliament as to how far that delegI did raise this concern and I have received formal advice from the department-for is which I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to a the Minister for Social Security-which the nature of the way in which these are dealt with. It is quite clear the a particular way in which this matter is to be dealt with. Advice from the Attorney General's Department is that this delegation is an instrument of an administrative character and only instruments of a legislative character are suitable for disallowable instrument status. unduly The department, therefore, is arguing that in even under the new Legislative Instruments Act this delegation would be administrative and would not be reviewable under that legislation, and so what we will be seeking in another place in relation to that matter is that this delegation be clearly a delegation that is alternasubject to parliamentary scrutiny. I move on to the decision to allow the terms secretary to collect information relating to claims for the seniors health card. There was an interesting matter raised with me by the in Council for the Ageing, which wanted to be assured that when, in relation to the issue of the seniors health card, the department was going to obtain information from a third party relevant to whether or not a person who has is qualified for that card, the information that is obtained from that third party will be provided to the claimants so that they at least test its veracity. That to me had a seems not an unreasonable request. It may well be that that issue can be addressed already under freedom of information law and it may be sufficiently covered that of the third party information would be disclosable to the claimant. I am not yet satisfied that that is the case. I think that is a matter that the committee ought to review, where the evidence can be laid on the table and we can satisfy ourselves in relation to that matter. If there are no requirements at the moment which would ensure that that occurs, it seems to me that in that instance we do need to ensure that the freedom of information provisions are extended to cover it. That brings me to the last matter relating to the question of debts and waiver. As the parliamentary secretary mentioned in her speech, this area is one in which the government itself will be proposing amendments and it is quite complex and difficult. I just want to make one observation first of all about another area in which the welfare rights movement has satisfied me that we ought not to accommodate one of the particular changes that the government is pressing. At the moment the situation, as I understand it, is that when the issue of debt recovery arises there are two issues that are involved: first, the issue of whether or not a person is qualified for a particular benefit; and, at a point when that qualification issue arises, there is a basis upon which a debt can arise if a further decision is taken which is a separate decision relating to the question of whether the benefit was properly payable. So you have got two issues, one of qualification and the second of payability. The government's proposals, as we are advised, bring these two concepts together, so the judgment will. be made as to when a debt arises on the basis of whether or not the person was qualified for the particular benefit, and that may involve an element of backdating. It means that the time when somebody becomes aware and says that a person was no longer eligible is not the time at which the debt is created-it is in fact backdated, in some cases presumably to the date when the person no longer qualified. It seems to me that the difficulty with this matter is that, if this backdating is allowed to the date at which the person was no longer qualified, a certain laxity is allowed to develop in the administration. It means that nobody has to be conscious that there is a penalty that the department suffers, the revenue suffers, if somebody is not making the decision that the person is no longer payable. It means that people might even be encouraged in the view that they can let the matter go on and not draw it to attention-in a situation in which there may be pressure to do other work, for instance. The department has had a lot of problems in prioritising its work lately and the whole question of payability, of ascertaining whether somebody ought not to have been on a benefit and making a decision as to whether or not to terminate payment, could be deferred because it is not a priority task. That seems to me to be disadvantaging the person who is involved, who is going to have a debt created and to be obliged, through deductions that will occur later, to make a repayment. I am not convinced in relation to that matter. There needs to be an examination by the committee in relation to that. The final matter is that of waiver. The government wants to introduce specific provisions in relation to waiver of debts to introduce new data matching provisions. We are quite happy with the government's intentions in that regard but we want to see the circumstances in which that is done. There are delegations proposed here which we think need to be the subject of parliamentary review. We want that matter to be examined in the Senate committee as well and would propose amendments in the Senate to ensure that that happened if the present legislation that deals with delegated instruments did not cover it. Finally, this bill does give us an opportunity to amend the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Act of last year and section 1251 of the Social Security Act. I will be moving that amendment in the consideration in detail stage because of the situation in which that oversight was not addressed on the previous occasion. (Time expired)",52
23,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"The Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 consists essentially of some 27 non-controversial items. I am delighted to hear that the opposition will not be moving a standard amendment, as it has on virtually every bit of legislation in this area in this parliament. It means that I will not have to go through my standard speech of rebuttal. I am delighted also to hear that we have entered a new era of cooperation-exciting news for us. It does not change anything, because all we have had in the past has been rhetoric and empty words, but this new bit of cooperation may mean that we will get some more constructive discussion and debate. At the same time we may not prolong what in many cases are relatively minor matters and turn them into political point scoring matters. The matters are essentially non-controversial. Of the 27 items that are listed in the explanatory memorandums, one major one has an impact financially. That is the additional family payment benchmark, which will affect next year's budget by $46 million, up to $99 million in 1997-98. With regard to the remainder of the amendments, the effect is negligible-in one case $0.2 million, in another case $0.53 million. The case that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) referred to, the qualification for sole parent, has a potential cost to budget of some $30 million but at the moment that figure is not costed. Essentially they are matters of housekeeping, of modification, of tidying up and in many cases of basically adjusting equity, and in that context it is important that matters the treatment of carers' pensions are actually brought into line. Matters like the extension offamily payments in adoption cases to make them equivalent for older adoptions are fairly straightforward matters. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) has indicated some proposed changes to be made by the government on these matters. I note particularly the one for a veteran whose carers may be disqualified from a carer's allowance if all the veteran is receiving is compensation as opposed to a pension. That obviously is an important matter. These types of matters will come up in each parliament as the world changes. For example, when the government in the 1990 budget phased out the first home ownership scheme, there was a downstream consequential requirement to remove the provision for that scheme from the data collection and to adjust the relationship between the Department of Social Security and the department of housing. These are the kinds of matters that one normally deals with. In the last 12 years we have seen a major reshaping of the social security system. Whatever we do, there will be people who will have different views, and that is an understandable situation in a country like ours. But it is important to understand that our system is not a middle-class welfare system; it is incredibly well targeted. Today's amendments actually finetune that targeting. The focus is on finetuning and adjusting and bringing up to date. There must be constant vigilance for possible loopholes, like the sole parents who could choose to live in separate houses and, notionally, still get full allowances, unlike a couple who were living in the same house. Those kinds of things will come up from time to time. If one looks at the linkages and the targeting in terms of income levels and distribution of support, and if one then looks at the linkages between the social security system and other systems such as the employment and training system, Austudy and a whole range of other areas, which we need to bring together very closely, one will see that it is an like incredibly complex system. There is no doubt about that. It is complex due to the sheer diversity of people, their families and their circumstances. A sophisticated system is needed to handle that. The shadow minister, the member for Berowra, spoke about eight inches of files on the advisers' desks. That is relatively minor in one sense. You can call it complex or you can call it sophisticated. The fact is that, if you want to have a sophisticated system-and I am sure Australians do--sophistication requires definition. You simply cannot have a sophisticated system across the range of issues that we have and expect to get the interrelationships within and between systems right unless they are well defined. Eventually it is the legislation that provides the definitive framework and eventually it is regulations that extend that into detailed applications. . So the idea that having complex legislation IS somehow a bad thing is fallacious. Complex issues are not simplistic. You can define them, you can describe them simply, but to make them simplistic is to remove their sophistication. There is a class of politicians around this country, and in other parts of the world, who keep telling people there are simplistic solutions to complex problems. There aren't; there never were and there never will be. There may be simple explanations of complex matters, but what we hear is much more to do with the simplistic, and I think many Australians now understand that. We have, in fact, moved more and more towards a sophisticated, targeted and interrelated system. That was nowhere more evident than in the Working Nation white paper of last year. I can recall, from when I first entered parliament, the separation between the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the old CES. I will just give you an example of that separation, from my own area. Back in about 1985 or 1986 we required the two departments to compare their files on those people who were registered for un-mploy-ent and those people receiving SOCIal securIty benefits. When that comparison was made, it was discovered that something like 18 per cent of the people who were receiving unemployment benefits were not registered for employment. That was the system that we inherited. That was the system that Liberal and National Party members had put in place and had run for my lifetime. It was a system that did not require cross-referencing or interrelationships. The mood we have had in recent years has been a difficult thing to achieve. It has required a substantial cultural change within the departments themselves, and it has required incredibly sophisticated machinery of government between the departments in order for them to actually cross-refer. Let us consider the amendment that was raised by the shadow minister, regarding the transfer of information between secretary and secretary, and whether that should be passed down the line. I can understand, as we all can, the concerns about the level at which we authorise staff to transfer private information about in-ividual clients of their departments. But the Idea that we let only secretaries talk to each other is, obviously, foolish. Given the level of information that is available or is needed, the number of people who are served by each department and the potential for fraudulence, to limit that to such a narrow bottleneck would mean that the amount of information passed would be so minimal that it would totally hamper both the departments and the government in terms of our efforts to make sure our systems are used fairly and properly. That is the kind of level of sophisticatIOn we need, and I am quite confident that the minister and the departments can set an appropriate level. At the same time, of course, we must accept and remember that whatever level is chosen must be backed up by the provisions of the privacy legislation and a range of other matters. Certainly, our departmental staff are human beings; they are as capable of being corrupt as some others in the community may be. But our provisions on those matters are in fact, extremely powerful. I am quite confident that the misuse of that information would be an absolute exception. o- the. other hand, the need for good relatIOnshIps between those departments relies on good information transfer, as do our fraud prevention measures and our cross-referencing, because, in many cases, people do get into situations which are not of their own making. I have constituents, as we all do, who come in, having discovered that they have debts they were not aware of and did not know were. building up. In many cases, what we are domg, by both data matching and bett-r departmental communication, is preventmg people getting into situations of having to repay, out of their benefits debts inadvertently incurred. So, good com-unica­ tion between departments, in very many cases is in the interests of the people we and thosdepartments serve. It is an indication of the level of sophistication that we have developed between our departments. The attempts by those opposite to suggest that there is a lot of fat available in the social security budget, and that we can cut massive amounts out of it and, at the same time, in most cases, oppose any measures to minimise fraud or tighten up the system, I have always found to be interesting. It is obvious from the figures coming through in recent times, particularly with data matching and so on, that the government's measures in terms of fraud and sustaining integrity, introduced some years ago, are becoming increasingly effective. The level of fraud is now a minor part of expenditure, and well within international norms and parameters. What must be remembered is that those measures were all new. The things that we have been doing in recent years were unheard of 12 years ago, when the departments were not even required to talk to each other or to cross-reference each other's applications. There may also be political mileage for those opposite in attempting to create climate of blaming the victims, of blaming those on benefits for their circumstances, redeveloping a new mentality based on the concept of dole bludgers. There may be political mileage in that, given that people on benefits are effectively a minority in the community. But what those opposite are doing in that process will not be to their ultimate benefit. The concept of scapegoating and blaming the unemployed and other people on social security systems is implicit in their comments about the level of fraud but, more importantly, in comments on the capacity cut the budget. That concept came through in a recent public opinion survey that suggested a majority of people thought that the way for a government to save money was in the welfare area. That was not by accident; that did come out of the blue. People did not suddenly have a dream and suddenly realise what they believed. It has been a long process of condibeing tioning by those opposite who have been suggesting for many years now that there were massive savings available in the welfare budget. That 'throwing enough mud' sophistication methodology is clearly having an effect, the tragedy of that is that those who are impacted by it and those who are made to feel guilt about the fact that they are on social security cannot fight back and cannot answer back. At the same time, they know, as we and those opposite know, that the measures in place to protect the integrity of the system are quite profound. I suppose it is the hypocrisy of that that makes me angry. From my constituents' point of view, on the one hand people come forward quite upset about the level of antifraud measures that are in place, the number of checks that are done and the amount of reporting that people have to do in terms of response while, at the same time, they are being seen by the broader community as bludgers. That is the kind of resentment that is being built up in people who really are victims of circumstances rather than otherwise. In every parliament there will be legislation of this nature: omnibus amendments which pick up a whole range of issues. Normally, a we would deal with them in a fairly prompt fashion and I trust that that will be the case of after hearing the shadow minister, this being a new year and this being the first legislation some of the current year. (Quorum formed) On one hand, we hear of cooperation on this legislation and then we have this kind of childish game playing, which is probably the appropriate description for the call from the  sees the whole parliament as a joke. He is also one of those who will join in this constant theme about the standing and status of to the parliament. Perhaps he joins the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) in warning teenagers not to come here, but he is the reason that they should not come. This is a series of minor amendments which are essentially non-controversial. I am internot ested in the shadow minister's commentsmost of which, quite frankly, I see as looking for a reason to argue against it, rather than very constructive. The fact that we are constantly revising and reviewing, trying to make things clearer and easier to understand and administer, and increasing our level of within and between departand ments, is an indication of why our welfare support system is seen as one of the world's finest, and probably the most effective. I commend the amendments to the House.",54
24,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"I join this debate on the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 to support my colleague the shadow minister, the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who is one of the most compassionate people in this place. I am also interested to listen to my colleagues from the other side of the House who are quite conscientious and intelligent. I am interested in the way they keep extending the myth about the Labor Party and their thoughts about the social system of Australia. I am sure that we, as a wealthy country, should be supporting those that are needy, and I guess that in Australia we do. But the myths that surround the Labor Party keep coming through with every speaker. The last speaker, the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), talked about cultural change and constantly revising things, and about how we on this side were blaming people on social security as victims and calling them bludgers. I have never actually heard anyone on this side call them bludgers, but I do remember the member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith), in a speech in this place 12 months or maybe two years ago, mentioned that retired Australians are, in fact, spongers on the system. So the only people I have actually heard criticise people who are on social security are those on the other side of the House. The myth really continues. I remind those government members here of the promises that they made about social security,as well-promises that they are constantly revising and changing. The Australian Labor Party's 1993 election policies for older Australians said that they would remove all age and service pensioners from the tax system by 1995. That was a promise at the last election. I guess that must be happening some time this year. I believe the former Treasurer, John Dawkins, said that he was not compelled to keep that promise, but he is no longer here. This particular social security legislation is very important to Australia. We have got to look after our fellow Australians. In this particular area, we spend $68,000 per minute, 24 hours per day in Australia. You would expect that, if we are spending $68,000 per minute, we would in fact get some value for money, rather than eight inches thick of regulation on how we should be spending this money. The biggest difference I fmd between Labor politicians and Liberal politicians is that, while they are all conscientious and very much wanting to support each other and Australians, the Labor Party members have no concept of where money comes from. They do not know how to handle money: they spend it all over the place, as you can see they did in Western Australian, South Australian and Victorian state governments. Labor just throws money at a problem, rather than trying to actually get in and solve the problem in the first place. When he first came into the parliament the previous speaker mentioned comparisons of unemployed people in Australia. I have a table that I want to refer to. In the year 198283, which was when the Labor Party came into power, unemployment in Australia was nine per cent, with 624,900 actually unemployed and those getting benefits numbering 545,300. He was quite right to suggest that there were fewer people getting benefits than were unemployed. In 1993-94, some 10 years later, there were 915,500 people unemployed, yet, strangely enough, there were 917,500 people actually getting unemployed benefits. So we have gone from one extreme where there were actually more people unemployed not getting the benefit 10 years ago to now when people are receiving the benefit who perhaps should not be. This table is interesting because it gives an average duration of unemployment back in 1982-83 of 32.9 weeks. Some 10 years later, the average duration of unemployment is 57.5 weeks. So I guess there has been a lot of constant revising and change in the last 10 years. Whether it is for the better or not is something for Australians to consider at the next election. The previous speaker also talks about some of the great things that the Labor Party has achieved, which again is myth making, but I would like to read a couple of things that it has achieved. Over the last 11 years, one in 10 Australian families has both parents out of work; almost 19 per cent, 704,000, of Australia's children aged under 15 live in a family with no breadwinner; and one quarter, 25 per cent, of Australian families has no working member. Last year was the International Year of the Family, and one quarter of Australian families has no working member. This is what the Labor Party has delivered to us. The number of traditional families in the category of unemployed and welfare dependent rose by 50 per cent from 1989 to 1993. The number of children who are members of families dependent upon social security payments rose from 619,000 or thereabouts in 1982 to almost 1.6 million in 1992. One in eight families is falling below the poverty line. Poverty is increasing in almost every group except the aged. Over two million Australians now live below the poverty line. In a country as wealthy as Australia, two million of our fellow Australians live below the poverty line. That equates to 13 per cent of households and a rise of over 14 per cent of the population since 1983. Of all Australians living in poverty, one half come from traditional nuclear families. Fortyfour per cent of Australia's single-parent families live in poverty. Taking inflation into account, 10 per cent of earners have seen their income rise by seven per cent since Labor took office. Over the same period, real wages for the bottom 10 per cent have fallen by five per cent. The top 20 per cent of income earners get 42.1 per cent of total earnings; the bottom 20 per cent get 5.4 per cent. So these are the real facts about the Labor Party in power as opposed to the great myth about its being the carers of Australia. It does not really care; it just throws money at a problem and hopes it solves itself. The Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill is full of amendments. Why are we putting amendments through? It is because, traditionally, the Australian Labor Party cannot get these things right. We are always amending bills. Remember the great Native Title Bill that came through about 18 months ago? Apparently, it now requires amendments and will be coming back into the House some time this year. We have no intention of opposing this social security bill, as the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), said. We support most of the amendments. However, it must be said that the area of social security is very complex and it is too bureaucratic. I have seen examples of that in my own electorate. This particular amendment deals with debt collection. If the debt collection system in social security is like it is in other agencies associated with government, people will be interested in a story presented to me recently. A young woman aged 19, who had left school at 16, had been working for 2Y:z years to save enough money to educate herself in a particular course. That course cost her $5,000 for 12 months. She applied for and was granted Austudy because it was an Austudy approved course. At that time her father was only on part-time employment. For 2Y:z years she had been earning her salary and had been independent of her parents. Despite that, when her father went from a part-time job to a full time job, her Austudy payments were affected. I do not understand why someone who had been independent of her family had her Austudy payments affected when another member of the family had a wage increase. The girl was not advised about this until December, and her repayments were backdated to October. It was something like $350odd. She could not afford to pay it immediately. The people from the department harassed her. They harangued her. They rang her constantly. She offered to pay at the end of the course when she was employed, as people do with the HEC scheme. They would not accept that. They said that she had to pay the money back right away. She offered to pay it off at $5 a month. They accepted that. They were very pleased. However, the day after they accepted that offer, she received another letter demanding payment within seven days. That caused her great angst and caused the family to come to me. The problem was that the person she was dealing with in the department went on holidays. The new person who replaced that person the next day demanded a payment because he did not know what was going on. This story shows that the whole thing is getting too bureaucratic. Social security is a human area. It requires a humane approach. We are dealing with people; we are not dealing with machines. This particular department is getting so complex and so bureaucratic that one wonders what it is employed to do. Another aspect of this amendment relates activity and attendance requirements for unemployed people. This means that if someofficers one does not comply with the performance contract, as people are required to do after about 18 months of unemployment-and we stand. know that 57 weeks was the average length unemployment during 1993-94-that person will lose his benefits. Part of that employment contract is an attendance requirement. We assume that this is not going to be treated with disdain and that people will not be forced to do unreasonable things. For examnot ple, if a person is living in Manly, New South Wales, and the person in Manly says, is a job in Wollongong. You are required to attend,' and that person does not attend, could he lose his benefits? That is an extreme case, but if people do not fulfil activity or attendance requirements, they could lose their benefits. The Labor Party put forward the myth that we on this side were dropping people off the dole. This is exactly what the government now doing. If someone is required to attend or do an activity and refuses to do that, upon whatever grounds, they in fact lose benefits. So the bottom line is that those do not want to comply with their performance agreement lose their benefits. That means government is dropping people off the system. amendments. So the notion from the Labor Party that this applies to our side of politics is in fact true for its side. I support the comments my colleague the member for Berowra made earlier, and I will finish this by saying that we are a wealthy country. We have some rich resources and some great natural talent. One of our greatest natural talents is our people, and we do not necessarily look after our people as well as we could. Sure, we try to help by giving them money when they are needy and require some help, but the problem is greater than that. What is required is not just throwing money at the problem-we must actually go into the whole social system and look at the basic problems, why people are needing to go on welfare. We are dealing with people; we are not dealing with machines. The more complex to this legislation for social security becomes, the more complex it is for those conscientious that work for the Department of Social Security and the more hassles they have, because it is harder for them to underIt really is time that we started taking of a bipartisan approach to this whole problem and not taking people for granted, as I think we sometimes do, certainly in the broader public debate. As my colleague was saying, it is time that we started treating these issues of people on welfare as important issues and necessarily throw money at the problem but in fact seek solutions as to why they are 'There on welfare in the first place. That is really what we should be doing in this place, rather than bickering over amounts and what we should be doing about money here and money there. It is really time we started facing the facts about our social system in Australia and started doing something about it. Just making amendments here and then shifting things here and disqualifying is some people and allowing people over here is not really the way to go. We should be based looking at the whole social problem and their looking at other policies-perhaps not in who social security-that can solve some of these social issues. I will conclude on those rethe marks. I support the shadow minister's",58
25,Ms DEAHM,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"It is always a pleasure to folIow the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) because he is consistent. He always shows that he does not know what he is talking about. It is very well to spout off about looking at the whole social picture rather than throwing money at social security. Throwing money at it: what the hell does that mean? There are some very concrete proposals here which are not throwing money at anything. He also talks about the bureaucracy. He obviously does not know much about the bureaucracy because he is talking about an Austudy situation which is covered by DEET and not DSS, as he says, and I think we can also safely say that no office in Manly would insist that somebody goes to Wollongong for ajob. Spouting off rhetoric is all very fine, but I think it is also pretty hypocritical. The member for Cowan came into this place at the same time as I did, at the 1993 election, and he would have campaigned on Fightback-a document which wanted to take people off social security after nine months. So it is extremely hypocritical for someone like him to stand up in here and say that the Labor Party has lost the plot. I think this bill is very significant. Social security, as I think almost everyone has said in the debate so far, is very important. Australia has one of the best social security systems in the world, without a doubt. It is, as the member for Cowan has said, very complex, and I know that the current Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) is doing all he can to smooth out those complexities and make the system easier to run. He has in hand at the moment some ways of looking at simplifying the kinds of payments and the number of payments so that they are easier to understand by the general public. With something as complex as social security, which involves people on the ground, people in need and people who are vulnerable, as it very much does, loopholes and inconsistencies appear and have to be fixed up. That is precisely what this bill does. It may seem to someone glancing at it that it is a hotchpotch of odd bits and pieces, but it is putting together a whole lot of issues that do need amending and do need adjusting. I think they are adjusted to the benefit of the people who receive them. Finetuning is always needed in any legislation to do with such a complex area. There are a lot of issues here and I do not intend to run through them all. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) has already done that, in the second reading speech. I would like to just mention a couple of those issues before I go on to the issue which, for me, is one of the most important. I would like to first allude to the benefits for carers. It was not that long ago in this country-and those of us of a certain age can remember the time-that we did not even call them 'carers'; we just took it for granted that a spouse, a daughter, a son, a cousin or a neighbour would look after those in need, and we did not look after them. I think carers are being recognised. Certainly, this government has gone a long way to recognising the role that carers play in the HACC-home and community care-program. They are part of the target group, and we endeavour to do as much as we can for them by providing respite and so on. The carers pension is something that I think we need to be justly proud of, and these amendments which affect carers are very important. Anything we can do for carers to help them while they are caring for people and to help them into training or employment at a time when they are no longer in caring positions is extremely important. The other one is retaining fringe benefits for six months for people coming out of the mature age allowance and partner allowance. These are important, because they do encourage people to get back into the work force when they may feel that they are losing too much, particularly in the sense of fringe benefits, to actually go back into the work force. I think that transitional period is very important. There are other clauses here, which refer to disability, mobility, sole parent pensions, family payments and so on. They cover almost every area of social security. The one that I want to spend some time on is the amendment regarding exchange trading systems. This holds a particular joy for me, because I raised this issue with the Minister for Social Security in 1993. In fact, I was just looking through my file and realised that, for the letter I wrote to the minister at that time, I did not even have my proper letterhead, I was so new to this place. So it is very important for me to see that something that I brought up has now reached this stage. I am sure those of us who are fairly new backwas benchers in this place often feel that not have very much influence, so it is particudifferent larly gratifying to me to find something that I raised personally has now reached the stage of being enshrined in legislation. In fact, when the minister was going through this with the caucus community services commitdoing tee and he mentioned my involvement, chairman of the committee, the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), said, 'We will call the Deahm amendment.' I am very happy to accept that. The basic problem concerned people who were involved in exchange trading systems my area and were dealing with the Katoomba office of the DSS-which was being consciunderemployed-and entious; I am not criticising it in any way. Because this scheme was so prevalent in the area, social security recipients whether they were involved in one of the schemes and, ·if so, how much they had larly earned in their credits under the programthe ecos, as they are called in this particular Each eco was then counted as a dollar of income, so they lost their social security benefits. The local group, called LETS-the Local Exchange and Trading System-wrote to the minister. The letter reads: LETS income does not pay rates, electricity, gas phone bills or provide food and shelter on a livable level. LETS does provide a situation where ployed people can maintain their skill levels, gain experience in new skill areas and maintain level of self-esteem which ensures a healthier lifestyle and thus less strain on the National Care System. Mr Ronaldson-Great system.",60
26,Ms DEAHM,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"Thank you. I am glad to hear that the honourable member for Ballarat thinks it is a good system, too. I immediately took this matter up with the minister, who a discussion with people from the LETS group, the Welfare Rights Association and number of other groups who all added their contributions. After some discussion, the minister approved the dropping of this pracmembers tice. Now we see it coming up in legislation. One of the points made by the department that these people were working in a we do formal situation but they were not very from people who were working in an informal situation: for example, two people on sole parent benefits baby-sitting for each other with no money or credits being exchanged; bill they were gaining a benefit and they were some work, in a sense. I am glad to see the that that has been recognised. LETS is a very important organisation. It this benefits unemployed and underemployed people. It also benefits some employed people who receive payment for some of their work and receive credits under the LETS program in for other work. LETS uses the skills of people-particularly the unemployed and the keeps their skills going. People are not going to lose their skills while waiting for a job to come up. It was a comwere asked munity initiative. In the Blue Mountains, where it is particuactive, it came out of a group known as Coalition Against the Recession which area. started up a few years ago. Various groups were formed to look at how the local people could help those who were suffering under the recession. It included food collections where bins were placed outside the local supermarket. .People could buy an extra item and put it in the bin so that it could be distributed. The LETS program is one of the more permaor nent programs to come out of that initiative. I have only the 1993 statistics, but at that unemtime there were 170 LETS programs nationa high wide. The Blue Mountains group has 1,500 members. The monthly turnover was 35,000 Health ecos. As I said, we count an eco as the equivalent of approximately $1. I understand that there was no problem with people having ecos credited as income for tax purposes. Fundamentally, no-one has objected to that. The great thing about the scheme is that it encompasses a wide range of workers includhad ing builders, plumbers, accountants, people doing tax returns, baby-sitters and lawna mowers. It is extremely beneficial. In my electorate the LETS scheme has undertaken what is called a buddy scheme. Established introduce and help new members in getting used to how the scheme works. They teach them the ropes and, perhaps, teach them some new skills. A lot of people say to me, 'I can't afford to employ someone to mow my lawn. I can't do it myself because I am not physically able. I can't get this sort of help under home and community care because there are higher priorities.' The LETS program has responded to this by introducing what is called a community service fund. This invites members of the group to donate either money, ecos or time to a fund from which the services can be provided for people in need-particularly the frail, the aged and the disabled. So, I have been able to put the little old lady who cannot mow her lawn on to members of the LETS group and they have been able to do it for her. The LETS group has also cooperated with a group known as Mission Employment. This is a skill share operation which is run by the Sydney City Mission in my electorate. They started a group called LETS work to promote the scheme to people who have been recently retrenched. As many of us know, when people are retrenched their initial thought is, 'That's fine. I will have a little holiday.' However, they start looking around for jobs and, when they find nothing is coming, their self-esteem drops, their confidence drops, and they are put in a position where they do not find it very easy to go out and get work. Of course, their skills also drop. LETS work, together with the LETS group and Mission Employment, is there to get those people moving and also to teach them some of the skills that could earn them some ecos and keep them in work while they are looking for full-time employment. The amendment to this bill removes the provision requiring that kind of exchange work to be counted in the income test for social security. However, there are certain restrictions. Firstly, the normal activity test requires members to continue to look for appropriate work. They cannot say, 'We are doing this for a living.' They have to be looking for work. Secondly, cash amounts are not exempt. If they happen to get cash for any of those jobs, they must declare it. Thirdly, the social security secretary must be satisfied that the system is a local community based system, the primary purpose of which is to help persons maintain their labour skills and keep them in touch with the labour market. It is not run with a view to making a profit. Even with those requirements-the LETS group is certainly happy with those requirements-we have gained a victory in this case. I am very proud of the LETS program. There are several of them in my electorate and the members do a wonderful job. I was glad to hear the member for Ballarat endorse that. Mr Ronaldson-Yes, I have one in my electorate. They do a wonderful job.",62
27,Ms DEAHM,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,Thank you; I am glad to hear it. I support the issues in the bill. I do not think it appropriate to go through each one of them-that would be very boring. I just want to put on record my pleasure at seeing something that I lobbied for come to fruition. I also put on record my praise for and thanks to the LETS group for the great work it is doing.,63
28,Mr RONALDSON,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"Ballarat) (2.06 p.m.}I helped launch the Ballarat LETS project last year, so I endorse the sentiments of the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm). However, I am somewhat disappointed that someone whose company I enjoy and who I quite like on a personal basis perpetuates this myth that the coalition had a nine-month unemployment policy before the last election. I say in the clearest possible terms: that is wrong. I hope that, having heard it refuted in such strong terms, the member for Macquarie will never again utter that untruth. The debate on the Social Security (NonBudget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 has been very wide ranging, and I think that is appropriate in the circumstances. I would like to commend to the House the speech of the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) who exposed the Labor rhetoric for what it is. It really shows the utter hypocrisy of the government on the question of social justice. In this country we have seen the gap between the rich and the poor widen. That is happening despite the rhetoric of the government--:-and despite its rhetoric, the government is doing absolutely nothing about it. Its absolute hypocrisy on the question of social justice is now reaching legendary proportions. I would go so far as to say that history will show this government as an equity fraud because it continues to perpetuate this social justice myth. The Australian people are awake to this. They will no longer be conned by this government. They know that equity ALP style means giving it to Labor mates and the rest can go to hell. That is the way the ALP has been operating in politics for the last 10 years and I have no doubt that is the way it will continue. We only have to look at Austudy as an example of Labor's absolute belief that the country stops at the end of the metropolitan tram routes or bus routes. As far as the rest of the country is concerned, people can sink or swim. This has always been Labor's attitude and will continue to be its attitude. I was on the phone this morning to a constituent from Stawell who told me that because he has to send his daughter, a trainee nurse, to an institution away from Stawell, his family is suffering a cost penalty which I, and others who have looked into this closely, believe is nearly $170 a week. That is simply because they live outside metropolitan Australia. That is not social justice, that is not equity, and nothing has been done to address that situation. The member for Macquarie had a go at the member for Cowan for talking about matters that fell within the DEET portfolio. When you are paying $170 a week financial penalty for having to educate your child outside your regional rural area you are coming within the domain of the Department of Social Security. The two are very much tied together. The bill before this House is of significance to a number of Australians. It is therefore unfortunate that this legislation is in many ways a patchwork piece of legislation which does nothing more than redress the tardiness of this government in its haphazard approach to policy making. As has been previously stated by my colleagues, a number of pieces of legislation will be affected by the bill, induding the Social Security Act 1991, the National Health Act 1963, the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 and the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1993. Very broadly, this bill proposes amendments to the aforementioned legislation. Although these amendments in themselves may not introduce major policy changes, they are nevertheless very significant in what they propose. The bill proposes changes to the eligibility qualifications for the carers pension which, if passed, would allow the carer to receive the pension while the carer and the person being cared for are overseas for a period of up to three months. The bill also aims to extend the employment and education entry payments to recipients of the carers pension, eligibility for fringe benefits to people who cease to receive the disability support pension for a period of 12 months and eligibility of the mobile allowance. The bill also aims to ensure that credits which are approved under trading systems, certain barter arrangements-the honourable member for Macquarie has already mentioned that in relation to the LETS schemes-are not deemed income· for the purposes of social security payments. Finally, this bill aims to bring forward the date from which a benefit is not payable due to changed circumstances where the recipient notifies the department of these changed circumstances. I support the moves by the shadow minister for social security and senior citizens, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), to have this bill considered by the Senate committee on community affairs, especially given the concerns expressed by the coalition about certain aspects of the bill. Having this piece of legislation referred to the committee is the only way that we can gain a better understanding of the full implications of the bill away from the restraints which this chamber imposes. The coalition is committed to ensuring that all legislation is given proper and deserved consideration. Just because the coalition will not be opposing the bill does not mean that we are content with many aspects of it. There are a number of proposed amendments to the bill which the coalition has serious concerns about. Although these have been alluded to by my colleagues, I will elaborate on them later in my speech. This bill gives due recognition to the role the carers play in our society. Carers are, in my view, the unsung heroes in our society as they provide a much needed and very difficult service to those in need. Carers provide daily care and constant supervision to prevent injury to people being cared for, as well as injury to other people. To be classed as a carer, a person must not be employed or study for more than 10 hours a week. A carer will continue to satisfy this requirement even if there are breaks in the caring period to a maximum of 42 days a year. The job the carers do is both demanding and sometimes-I stress the word 'sometimes' - with little reward. The role carers play is essential and deserves to be further commended. It is a job which I believe many of us would concede requires great strength and great courage. It requires a very special type of person to care for someone who is severely handicapped and living in the same house as the carer or in an adjacent dwelling. The personal care task is based on the personal care required by the disabled person and tasks directly related to that person's needs, such as daily attention, bathing, hygiene, food preparation and administering of medication, to name a few. I am proud to say that carers are a vital of my electorate of Ballarat. These carers provide many different types of support to many different types of people, both financial and emotional. Sometimes emotional support is just as important as financial support, if more so. Carers can be individuals or groups, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know. In my electorate there are a number of support groups that are carers. I will go through those, because, as far as my electorate is concerned, they are important and they are providing a valuable service. I would like to place on the public record my support for the work they are doing. These support groups in Ballarat include: ADARDS, the Alzheimers disease and related disorders support group; ADDVANCE, which is the active attention deficit disorder support group; the AIDS care team; the congenital disabilities support group; the cystic fibrosis group; Diabetes Australia; Grow, the community mental health self-help organisation in Daylesford, in what will be part of my new electorate; the headway carers group; the Motor Neurone Disease Association of Victoria; the Muscular Dystrophy Association; the obsessive, compulsive disorder group; the Parkinsons support group; and the post polio support group. There are also a number of other carer groups that are just outside my electorate. These groups provide a desperately needed and, in my view, underrecognised service to many of my constituents. This bill looks to providing such carers with wider services. The amendments to the carer pension would allow a carer to accompany the caree overseas without a loss of qualification, provided the period of absence is temporary and does not exceed three months in a calender year. Currently, a frail or disabled person who is cared for may travel overseas for a holiday without affecting entitlement. However, the person may not be accompanied by their carer because of the restrictions on the portability of the carer pension. Although there are minor exceptions to this rule, this is a grossly unfair situation during such time that carees are in most need of their carers. Although the amendment in the bill overcomes this gross injustice, the coalition is part concerned that, with the government's phasing out of wive's pensions, more wives or de facto partners will claim a carers pension; and that when their spouses go overseas-their pension is portable for 12 months-they will not receive payment for only three months. This is an area which must be urgently addressed for it has the potential to increase dramatically the bill's financial impact. If the government is serious about providing an effective service to those genuinely in need, at the same time minimising the impact of rorting within the system, then such anomalies in the legislation must be tightened. To ensure this is effectively done, the bill must be referred to the Senate committee. The bill further proposes the introduction of an employment entry payment and an education entry payment for recipients of the carer pension. The amendment proposes a payment of $100 to be made in recognition of the costs involved in starting employment, with an additional amount of $200 to be payable to assist with the costs of commencement of education. In order for jobsearch and newstart allowees to be eligible for the proposed employment education entry payments, they must cancel their social security payments. The coalition does, however, have justified concerns regarding this proposal. On the face of it-and I stress 'on the face of it' - it would appear incompatible that a person in full-time study could fulfil their requirements to provide constant care and attention to a person in need. If the 10-hour rule which applies to work were to also apply to study contact it could be argued that a carer could engage in full-time study at the same time as providing care and qualify for the pension. However, one could envisage possible problems for carers, especially during times of high stress, such as the exam period. It may be that the committee will review the definition of a carer in terms of hours spent in providing care to see whether full-time study is likely to have an impact on the ability to adequately provide this care. I note with interest that the bill proposes restoration of fringe benefits to the disability support pension. This amendment will allow clients whose disability support pension is cancelled because of earnings to retain their eligibility for fringe benefits for a period of 12 months. This concession would also apply to the dependent partners of these disability support pensioners. This amendment is, in effect, a signal of failure on behalf of the government. On 1 April 1993, the Social Security Act was amended to extend the availability of fringe benefits to all disability support pensioners regardless of income. This was to be a crowning moment for a government which had deluded itself into thinking that it was capable of delivering social justice. However, the bill was not properly thought out and a consequence of this change was that the relevant amendments restricted the continuation of fringe benefits to pensioners who lost qualification for the disability support pension because they commenced full-time work. This, in effect, meant that a beneficiary who had the pension cancelled because of his or her earnings but had not commenced full time work was not entitled to the 12-month fringe benefit extension. The government now claims that this amendment will correct this unintended consequence and ensure that beneficiaries, whose disability support pensions are cancelled because of their earnings, obtain their eligibility for fringe benefits for a period of 12 months. Had the original bill been dealt with in an orderly and appropriate fashion, through the appropriate mechanisms, we would not have to go through this amendment stage today. The Australian people can only conclude that this legislation is a telltale sign of a government which is tired and worn out, losing both the will and the ability to effectively govern the country. But this is not the only amendment in the bill which reveals the true extent of the government's inertia. This bill also proposes the suspension of fringe benefits for those receiving the disability support pension. Currently, if disability support pensioners lost qualification as a result of commencing fullthe time work, they would have their pension suspended for a period of two years, rather than having it cancelled. Should the person again become qualified for a disability support pension during that two-year period, an accelerated restoration process replaces the need for a new claim. Let us remember that this provision which was introduced by the government as part of the disability reform package was designed to provide incentive for clients to attempt employment. The current situation is in stark contrast to that of a pensioner who has the disability pension cancelled because of earnings from part-time work. These pensioners would need to undergo a new claim assessment process if they again became eligible for a pension any time. This situation, ironically, provides a disincentive, as do many of the government's policies, for pensioners to attempt part-time work. This in most cases is the only option which is available to the many recipients of the disability support package, which purports to supplement their pension. Again, had the government had the foresight and common decency to process the bill properly, it would not have to introduce a bandaid fix-it approach, as we are doing today. The other bandaid approach which is characteristic of the amendment is the endeavour to backdate partner allowance. Why could this not have been introduced when the partner allowance was brought before the chamber initially? The department claims this will have a negligible effect. However, the department's administrative arrangements are such that this measure could have been implemented without legislative authorisation-thus, backdating was sought. The government simply must learn that, unless legislation is dealt with properly the first time, we will always be returning to this chamber to replaster, reupholster and rework legislation as it falls apart. Based on the government's record, we have little cause for optimism on this front. There are areas of this bill which, if not handled delicately, could have serious negative effects. One such example is the amendment to ensure that the secretary has the power to collect information from clients and from third parties as to whether or not a claimant is entitled to a seniors health card. The coalition shares the concerns of the Council on the Ageing, that the term 'third party' is not adequately defined. It is fair for us to believe that the information collected from the third party should be made available to the claimant upon request. Although we want to legislate against rorts within the system, we should not let this be at the price of individual privacy. Again, the ramifications are too serious to allow this to be handled in the same hotchpotch way it has been. The Senate committee is the only way that these issues can be truly dealt with. Another such amendment is the qualification for sole parents. There is a danger that this could result in intrusive inquiries into the lives of prospective sole parent pensioners and their friends of the opposite sex. This amendment could also have a more serious effect on women who are seeking an urgent payment of the pension because they have a violent partner. When the relationship is investigated, the issue of the permanence of the separation arises and the absent partner is given the power to state that that person believes the separation to be short term because of domestic disputes. In such situations the claimant could be denied the pension because of that statement, thus the department may assist in compelling a woman with no other income to return to her violent partner. It is no surprise, therefore, that the Catholic Social Welfare Commission has called for a more precise definition of 'strictly temporary basis'. I am sure we are all aware of what the consequences would be if the government has got this amendment wrong. This chamber should support the coalition's proposal to ensure a court order is obtained so that claimants who have left a violent partner are not forced to return to what potentially could be a home situation which threatens the safety of the claimant. The safety and security of the victim should be paramount in the delivery of such payments but, at the same time, we want to ensure that only those genuinely in need have access to those payments. This matter is best left to the Senate committee on social welfare to ensure that the issue is properly handled. As has been seen, despite the significant importance of this bill to many recipients of the above mentioned allowances, it is riddled with holes. In many places it amounts to nothing more than a bandaid solution to compensate for past ineptness. As I said before, if we do not want to be here again this time next year going over old ground and putting bandaids on top of bandages to desperately try to hold this legislation together, let us do it properly this time. If the coalition has managed to find such problems with the bill in the short period of time that we have had access to it, imagine what problems the Senate committee on social welfare could find in the bill. It is time this government understood that the processes and procedures of this chamber are an essential part of any legislation and that we will subject all legislation to these mechanisms to ensure they receive the proper scrutiny. This bill is a classic example of what happens when legislation does not receive the proper care and attention the first time. The government owes it to the people of Australia so that the same mistake is not made on this occasion, especially on such an important piece of legislation. In the remaining45 seconds can I say that we on this side of the House are the ones who are genuinely concerned about social justice in this country. One of the key people leading that role in this chamber is the shadow minister, the member for Berowra. If you look through what has been said in this House over the many years that he has been here, especially since he has had those responsibilities, you will see time after time that true social justice has been generated from this side of the House by the member for Berowra.

29,Mr GRIFFIN,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"We are here today to debate and consider the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. To take up one of the issues which has been considered by a number of speakers, this is a bill which has a range of, in some respects, unrelated clauses leading to a number of minor changes in the operation of the legislation. The nature of this parliament and of government as a whole in this country, both now and in the past under earlier governments, is such that the legislation that we deal with in this ber is often amendment legislation. We cannot expect to get everything right the first time because circumstances change and issues develop. In those circumstances, any responsible government would move to respond to what has happened to ensure that it maintains the integrity of the system for country as a whole. That has been the experience not only of this government but also of previous conservative governments right back to Federation. The bill makes a number of minor amendments to the Social Security Act. The act is a particularly complex piece of legislation running to over 1,300 sections, defining entitlements to a large number of payment categories with wide ranging rights of appeal to independent tribunals. I think the range of amendments contained in the bill have been well canvassed by many of the speakers, in particular the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) in her initial comments. However, I would like to mention three amendments in particular: entrenching the $1 increase in additional family payment in January 1995 into the benchmarks for AFP; exemption of local exchange trading system-or LETS-'credits' from the income test, which is something that both the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) and the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) spoke about at some length; and employment and education entry payments, $100 and $200 respectively, for carer pensioners. When you look at these amendments, my earlier comments on the integrity of the system and the need to adjust it on a continuing basis, I think you really get to the essence of what this government has tried to do on the question of the social security system. We have seen it as being an evolving thing; we have seen it as being something which encompasses more than strictly the question of benefit payments. I believe that we can stand proud for much that we have done over the last 12 years on the question of the social security system. For example, we have improved the adequacy of social security payments. The base pension increased by some L4-per cent against the CPI between March cham- 1983 and December 1994, with Labor's long standing commitment of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings achieved. Family payments have been increased enormously. Additional family payment has increased by 75 per cent in real terms for the children under 13 and by 147 per cent in real terms for children aged 13 to 15. The number of low income working families receiving AFP has increased tenfold because of wider coverage and service delivery improvements. Family allowance, and indeed all family payments, have been indexed against inflation. Australia's family payments are among the most progressive in the world. When combined with relatively progressive income tax scales, Australia's tax-transfer system is the world's most progressive as far as families with children are concerned. From July 1995, these payments will be improved further as a result of the introduction of the parenting allowance, which will pay up to $134 per week to 118,000 low income working families where one partner stays at home to look after children. Maximum levels of rent assistance have increased by between 80 per cent and 13 7 per cent in real terms, and rent assistance has been extended to low income working families. These measures have improved the position of the most disadvantaged in Australian society very substantially both in real terms and against any 'poverty line'. For example: the position of a single pensioner renting privately has improved from six per cent to 13 per cent above the Henderson poverty line, which I will discuss later; the position of a sole parent with two children renting privately has improved from nine per cent below to two per cent above the Henderson poverty line; and the position of an unemployed couple with one child renting privately has improved from 11 per cent below to one per cent above the Henderson poverty line. Most payments are underpinned by explicit benchmarks governing the pension and family payments. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has, however, asked the department to look at methodologies by which the adequacy of payments can be judged with a view to establishing priorities for future adjustments to real payment rates. Targeting is an important issue within our social security system. The Labor government reintroduced comprehensive income and assets testing into the system in the mid-1980s. Most payments are targeted to those most in needthere is little 'middle class welfare' in the social security system these days. A study by AND academics has shown that Australia has one of the most efficient social security systems in the world in alleviating poverty as well as in purely administrative terms. We also have enhanced incentives for self-provision. People retiring now and in the future benefit from the government's enormous expansion of superannuation coverage. Other measures to assist self-provision include: the introduction of deeming on pensioner bank accounts, which has forced the banks to pay them realistic rates of interest; the introduction of earnings credits into pensions and allowances, which encourage part-time and casual work; better linking of social security and labour market programs through, for example, the newstart and job compact arrangements for the long-term unemployed, the disability reform package and the jobs, education and training scheme for sole parents; the introduction of the child support scheme to ensure that non-custodial parents make a proper contribution to the maintenance of their children; and setting the tax rebate so that maximum-rate pensioners are not subject to income tax. From July 1995, the income test on unemployment and other allowances will be adjusted to ensure that recipients are always better off working additional hours either full time or part time. We have also worked to restore the integrity of the system. A wide range of compliance measures have been adopted in the system. A review in 1992 concluded that these measures had 'indeed succeeded' in 'correcting the relative laxity of the past and restoring public confidence in the payment system'. A comprehensive set of up-front measures ensures that payments are only granted to those entitled to them. A number of payments have built-in compliance features. For example, continued payment of unemployment allowances is usually conditional on fortnightly lodgement of a statement of jobsearch efforts. These measures are supplemented by an array of review mechanisms under which some 2.3 million reviews are conducted each year of people's continuing eligibility for payment. These reviews. save the equivalent of some $1 billion per year. These mechanisms include: data matching with other agencies such as the Taxation Office, DEET, Immigration and state corrections authorities; risk-based reviews, based on statistical probabilities of success, often conducted by mobile review teams; and duration-based reviews in a number of payments, including sole parent pension and unemployment allowances. There have also been a range of client service improvements. The client service statement by the then Minister for Social Security in March 1992 encompassed a range of improvements to client service delivery, including revamping Social Security offices to make them more user-friendly; the publication and updating of client service standards; and the introduction of teleservice centres to improve access via telephone calls. I know that my own local area in Cranbourne is the beneficiary of part of this. We recently turned the sod, in effect, .in the construction of a DSS office in Cranbourne. It is in the middle of the south-eastern growth corridor in an area of Melbourne that is growing rapidly--one of only several in Melbourne, I might add, under the Kennett government-and it is an area that is in urgent need of government services. The then Minister for Social Security, Neal Blewett, recognised this and two years ago a decision was made to fund an office. It has gone through that process. A site has been selected and construction has commenced. We hope that office will be operating by around June this year. That Department of Social Security office will incorporate a more userfriendly approach and move away from what is sometimes thought to be its inquisitorial nature. It will try to ensure that the dignity those who use those services is respected. Mr Bruce Scott-Spare a thought for the people of the bush, who have to drive hundreds of miles to those services.",68
30,Mr GRIFFIN,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"The honourable member may not know that part of my area is the bush. At present, the Department of Social Security visits those areas two days a week. It is very well thought of and performs an excellent service. I share the member's concern about rural areas but, as he would know, it is difficult with the distances and the often sparse population in those areas. We as a government have attempted to do something about this and I think our attempts have been quite effective. But I suspect it is something that will never be totally resolved to the satisfaction of members of the National Party. It certainly remains an area of concern for those of us who represent those areas. In today's debate, there has been a fairly long-ranging use of statistics. An old line many of us know is that there are lies, damned lies, and statistics. We all use them to good effect when it suits us. But we need to go beyond statistics and look at studies. They are not infallible but they take into account more than just statistics. They can look at effective comparisons. A range of studies in recent years have compared retirement incomes and the social security system in Australia with those of relevant overseas countries .. These studies have shown how well we have been going in, for example, the area of retirement incomes. A recent World Bank report entitled Averting the old age crisis: policies to protect the old and promote growth was published by the World Bank late last year. It addressed a range of issues in relation to the nature of age patterns, and what income services and other supports were available. In the Financial Review, Michael Stutchbury made the following comments regarding that report and its implications for Australia. He referred to the report as: ... bracketing Australia at the international forefront of efforts to head off a looming global crisis of old age pensions. The study suggests that Labor's combination of of a more means-tested public pension and the introduction of the Superannuation Guarantee Levy is a far-sighted move which will make the greying of Australia less financially painful than in most other industrialised countries. In October last year, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) made the point in the House that Thailand is currently developing a comprehensive social security system. It will use what is effectively the Australian model because, through research, it has found that it is the most likely to succeed. There is no greater credit than someone replicating your efforts. That also puts the actual effectiveness and efficiency of our system in good stead. A study done at the ANU by Professor Gruen, Dr Deborah Mitchell and Professor Ann Harding compared the social security systems of Australia and nine other developed countries. That study concluded that, of the 10 nations studied, we have easily the most efficient system of getting the dollars to those who need it. That has to be a major benchmark with respect to the operation of the system. Beyond that, there have been other studies. There was a study done last year titled 'Living decently', which was authored by Sue Richardson and Peter Travers. In their conclusion they stated: At the end of the 1980s most Australians were indeed living decently. Material affluence was at an all-time high, Australia was still ranked around the middle of the dozen most equal countries in the world. They also stated: Australia is a world leader when it comes to social mobility. Our positive picture of high levels of affluence and of relative equality is at variance with the gloom and doom that is typical of many editorial writers and political social commentators. Another study which related to this particular issue came out in the OECD's Employment Outlook for July 1993, which contains a table on earnings dispersion for the year 1991. Again I stress that, when you are talking about the social security system in Australia, the position of people in benefits situations and those with low incomes, you simply have to look beyond the amount of money they receive. You have to look at Medicare and educational opportunities; you have to look at a range of activities beyond that simple matter of the amount of money they may receive; you have to look at allowances, rental subsidies, et cetera. That study showed that Australia has one of the least unequal distributions of earnings in the developed world, following the Scandinavian countries. To get a comparison, the measure of inequality was shown to be 50 per cent higher in the United Kingdom than in this country and 2Yz times higher in the United States. The real concern here, which relates to where we are going as a country and where we may go if there is a change of government, is that those countries which have strongly embraced labour market deregulation-have moved away from awards-are those that are in fact facing the greatest ineqUality. That fact is clearly coming through in the studies, and there has been much media and press comment about it. Now university research is pointing to that fact and making it very clear to everyone that that is the case. Peter Whiteford, a senior research fellow at the University of York, published a paper titled 'Income distribution and social policy under a reformist government: the Australian experience'. In looking at a comprehensive assessment of what makes up the social security system and inequality, his conclusions were as follows: Living standards were higher and inequality slightly lower in 1990 than when Labor took office. If poverty is measured by reference to a constant real poverty line, then poverty had fallen substantially. The UK figures suggest a dramatic widening in income inequality. The Australian figures suggest a slight narrowing in income equality. Peter Whiteford ended with: It seems fair to sum up the ALP's record as combining egalitarian social policies with economic policies attempting to enhance efficiency, within the framework of a consensual incomes policy. I do not mean to say that we have everything right, although other speakers may suggest that is what I am saying. I certainly do not wish to say that there is no poverty out there and that it is not a real concern. What I am saying is that this government has done an awful lot to address those issues and to move on from the situation we inherited some 12 years ago. I am also saying that to get a relevant, fair and reasonable comparison of the situation in Australia one has to look overseas to see what other nations have done-how the other governments during the time that we have been in power faced the same international circumstances and acted as they saw fit. I refer to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 30 April 1994 by Ross Gittins. I will extensively quote from this article because it makes some very important points. The article is headed 'Now just who is it who's poor?' and states: My point is that most poor people are eligible for some sort of welfare benefit. People who can't work are eligible for the dole . . . or the age pension, the invalid pension (renamed the disability support pension), the sole parents pension or the sickness allowance. People on low-to-middle wages with kids to support are eligible for the family allowance (now the ""basic family payment"") and those on lower wages are eligible for the family allowance supplement (now the ""additional family payment""). There's a comparison for March 1983, when Labor came to office, and for September 1992 ... He is talking about a report done by the Department of Social Security that relates to the Henderson poverty line. Mr Gittins goes on: The Henderson poverty line is the most cornmonly used measure of poverty in Australia. It was developed by Professor Ronald Henderson, who headed the Royal Commission on Poverty which reported in 1975. I know certainly from my university days that the Henderson poverty line was seen-I believe it still is seen-as an indicator of some value in terms of these particular issues. Mr Gittins goes through a range of details in his article. I turn to some of his conclusions with respect to the 1983 situation and the present situation. He states: You can see that most are now above the poverty line ... It's reasonable to conclude from this that, since 1983, poverty has declined significantly among people dependent on welfare benefits for their income. But now let's look at the position Labor inherited in 1983. You can see that the Fraser Government's arrangements gave a better deal to couples than singles. You can also see that Labor has reduced that gap. The Fraser Government also gave a better deal to pensioners than to people on allowances (the unemployed). Again, Labor has reduced the gap. The Fraser Government gave a much better deal to welfare recipients without kids than to those with kids. Labor has gone a long way towards rectifYing that. Finally, the Fraser Government gave a better deal to couples with kids than to sole parents with kids. Labor has reduced that gap, too. Again, this bill is about improving a system which is doing a good job but which, like all systems, can be and ought be improved. I note the concerns of the opposition regarding a number of clauses. I hope those concerns can be resolved in the consideration in detail stage. This bill will improve the system-a system that is of value; a system that is better than what we inherited as a government; and a system that will go on to serve Australian society well into the future as a sound basis for those who are less fortunate than many of us.",70
31,Mr BRADFORD,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"I am glad the previous speaker, the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin), made the point that the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is about improving the current legislation. To the extent that it does that, we on this side of the House support it. As the shadow minister said in his introductory remarks, this bill also highlights the complexities of our social security system. As we have noted in this place on a number of occasions, there has been an explosion in welfare in this country in the last 10 years since this Labor government came into power. For example, in 1980 there were 289,400 people getting a disability pension; in 1993 that figure increased to 524,900. In 1980 there were 70,400 people getting supporting parent or sole parent benefits; in 1993 that figure quadrupled to 298,400. In 1980 there were 311,000 people getting unemployment benefits; in 1993 that figure almost trebled to 913,800. In 1980 there were 122,900 people getting student income support; by 1993 that figure almost quadrupled to 423,600. There are, unfortunately, all sorts of disincentives within the system which I believe are designed to push more and more people into the welfare system. In my contribution to this debate today, I will reflect on what I think is a very real concern in the community about the spread of welfare. Welfare costs, or welfare outlays, if you want to use that terminology, as a percentage of our gross domestic product have doubled in the last 20 years. Government speakers come into this place belabouring the fact that it is a good thing; that it is a product of an enlightened Australian society. To some extent, it may well be. Let me repeat what I have said in this place on a number of occasions: this government has a program for every problem-and it created most of those problems in the first place. We do not have to go much further than unemployment to recognise that. The huge cost of unemployment benefits to this country is a product of the economic mismanagement of this country by this government. Let us look at those getting disability pensions, which have doubled since 1980. Many of those people rightly qualify for disability pensions but they are being used by the government in a way that has actually reduced the number of unemployed. Many government programs-for problems that it created-have achieved that end. They have simply disguised the level of unemployment. So rather than having 800,000 or 900,000 unemployed people in this country, we probably have twice that many. When the government comes in here and crows about the number of jobs it has created it is not honest with us about the figures. It mostly talks about jobs as being part-time jobs; they are short hour jobs. In fact, very few people in the community probably realise that the definition of employment for the purpose of being classed as unemployed is that you worked only one hour in the week before you were surveyed to participate in the collection of those figures. So if you worked for one hour you are classed as being employed; that is, not unemployed. Mrs Crosio-That's ridiculous.",72
32,Mr BRADFORD,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"It is ridiculous. So most of the government's efforts have been aimed at getting people out of the statistics by getting them onto all sorts of other benefits, programs, training-you name it. That is why we have seen welfare costs as a percentage of GDP double in this country over the last 20 years. My concern about what this government says is a good thing, about the proliferation of welfare expenditure in this country, is that welfare creates dependency and dependency undermines self-reliance and personal responsibility. My other concern as one person in this place who takes a very strong pro-family line is that welfare has quite demonstrably led to family disintegration. I imagine that this mustMrs Crosio-What rubbish!",73
33,Mr BRADFORD,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"You never like this, do you? Let me run all these figures by you again. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security really does not like hearing this. Let me make it very clear to her that I accept that that may be an unintended consequence of the welfare system, but it is a fact that it has led to family disintegration. It may well be that Australia has one of the most generous social security systems in the world, but what this government does not seem to accept or recognise is that it has to be paid for. And how is it paid for? It is paid for by our taxes. Mr Gibson-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. As is usually the case with the honourable member for MCPherson, his comments bear no relationship at all to the content of the legislation that is under debate in the House. I ask you to bring him to the content of the bill.",73
34,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member for Moreton suffers something of a disadvantage for not having been in the House to hear earlier participants in the debate. He may well have witnessed the debate from his office, I am aware, but a great deal of latitude has been allowed in this debate in dealing with what are social security issues. The honourable member for MCPherson in my estimation has not moved any further from those issues than any previous speakers.",73
35,Mr BRADFORD,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"I thank you for that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am making a case here. As you correctly say, there has been a wide ranging debate. This is an all-encompassing bill that deals with a number of matters affecting social security, and it is in that context that I am making my remarks. I appreciate the fact that you have vindicated me on that point. I was talking about the fact that welfare has to be paid out of taxes. It seems to me that the incidence of taxation in this country is falling more and more on those who are less and less able to pay it. We are already being softened up by the government and by the welfare industry for tax increases based on the false premise that Australia is a low tax country. It is not a low tax country. In fact, taxes have increased consistently over the years. In 1967 the tax rate for the median taxpayer was 24.6 per cent and in 1990 that had increased to 40.3 per cent. There are lots of other ways in which we can measure the figures, but the clear facts are that Australia is not a low tax country. If we want to have this welfare state that has been imposed on us by this government then it has to be paid for. The fact is that when you have all these programs that you cook up every day-and we will probably hear about some more in question time today; every time a minister gets on his feet in this place it is to tell us about how they will spend some more money fixing up a problem they have created-then they have to be paid for, and of course they can only be paid for out of taxes. Let me say quite clearly that I believe a relatively wealthy and fortunate nation such as Australia should be able to take care of those who are genuinely unable to take care of themselves or who are genuinely disadvantaged. There would be no difference in the opinions held by members on that side of the House or on our side of the House on that. I believe the system imposed on us by this government goes way beyond this. The fact is that today we have before us complex legislation-simply because the social security legislation is so complex itself-and, because it is complex, it lends itself to abuse and fraud. Recently my local paper the Gold Coast Bulletin brought to light a number of instances of fraud which are quite alarming. On Tuesday, 17 January under the headline '$184m welfare fraud clamp' it states: Government 'dole buster' teams have saved the Department of Social Security almost $4 million fraud and over-payments on the Gold Coast in the past six months. That is good news. It goes on to say: The mobile review teams, based at Surfers Paradise and Tweed Heads, act on public tip-offs about dole fraud and also check unemployment claims at random. The fact that they have discovered that extent of fraud in what amounts to spot checks indicates the extent to which the system is being abused. This should not surprise us, because certainly not a week goes by without the office of every member in this place being approached by people who are able to instance fraud and abuse of the social security system. The reason that occurs is simply that the system is so complex. The Gold Coast Bulletin of 21 January 1995, under the headline 'Students' $5m Austudy rort', says: Gold Coast region students have reaped a $5 million windfall from a subsidy rort-and authorities yesterday vowed to haul the guilty ones before the courts. We are glad they have vowed to haul the guilty ones before the courts, but the fact once again is that this is an indication of the extent of abuse within the system. The Australian on 20 June 1994, under the headline 'Crackdown nabs staff hands in social security till', states: The Federal Government's computer clampdown on social security fraud is catching cheats with seniorjobs within the Department of Social Security as well as small-time rorters. The department has uncovered $18.8 million in fraud since July 1 last year, of which $2.5 million involved 11 senior staff in departmental branch offices. I am demonstrating here that there is a considerable amount of fraud-and there is plenty of evidence of that-within the social security system. The reason for it is simply that the legislation is so complex. I have no objection whatsoever to the tightening up of requirements for access to benefits. Mr Cleeland-You'd better believe it.",73
36,Mr BRADFORD,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"The member holds up our policy, which in parts was aimed at tightening, saving money, detecting fraud and exposing rarts. As I have already illustrated, in there is plenty of scope for doing that. This legislation in part is aimed at tightening the requirements. I have no objection to that. There is, for example, considerable sympathy in the community for some sort of work for unemployment benefit scheme. The interesting thing about for work for the dole schemes is that it is very often the unemployed people who express support for them. In fact, a recent survey in the community showed that 65 per cent of people were in favour of, in broad terms, work for the dole schemes. The interesting statistic that came out in that particular survey was that 56 per cent of unemployed people themselves supported those sorts of schemes. Handouts are, in my view, a growth industry. I ask the government: while money and programs for successfully pulling families apart abound, where are the programs that seek to keep families together? One of the programs that we are dealing with today is the sole parent pension. As I already pointed out, let us remind ourselves about how this particular benefit has grown. In 1980 there were 70,400 supporting parent benefit recipients and in 1993 there were four times as many298,400. Why is that? It is simply because of the availability of that particular benefit. The fact that it is easy to get has encouraged people to apply for it. Mrs Crosio-Rubbish!",74
37,Mr BRADFORD,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"It is a fact. You read the figures for yourself. 1 know you do not like to hear them, but they are the facts.",75
38,Mr SPEAKER,COMMON UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING,"Order! It being 3.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour, and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",75
39,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before I call for questions without notice, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the Republic of Hungary led by the President of the Parliament Dr Gal. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Current Account Deficit",75
40,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance and relates to the January current account deficit of $2.3 billion. Given that this is the first time Australia has ever had deficits over $2 billion in six out of seven consecutive months; given that it is the third highest monthly current account deficit on record; given that the threemonthly current account deficit is the highest on record; given that the current account deficit over the past 12 months is 50 per cent higher than in the previous 12 months; given that the January current account deficit is more than double that of January 1994, I ask the government: why have you not fixed this problem after 12 years of trying?",75
41,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I point out several things about this to the honourable member. Firstly, while the current account figures are not acceptable, nevertheless they are completely in line with the revised projections that the Treasurer put down",75
42,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,75
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,75
44,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and the strategy that the government is putting in place to deal with that has already been outlined to him. The second thing is that the level of current account deficit that we find is not without historical precedent in rough figures. We found ourselves with that back in the period of time when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer when the current account reached roughly the same levels of percentage of our GDP. There is a difference, however, between now and then. The difference between now and then is this: available to the then Treasurer were import controls, the capacity to increase tariffs, and a fixed exchange rate. All those tools were available to him; all tools which made our country a very uncompetitive country when exercised in his hands. They are tools that the government long ago forswore. We are able to confront this sort of current account deficit, firstly, because we are far more competitive now than we were then. The second reason-while not viewing these numbers with equanimity at all, we can take some degree of comfort in them-is that they are a direct productMr Costello-You are taking comfort in these figures! MR SPEAKER-Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked his question. Listen to the answer.",75
45,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"of some very good statistics elsewhere in the economy-like the growth rate; like the increase in business investment in our community which is going to make a very substantial difference to our productive capabilities over the years. All those elements are there and are basically underlying the change in the current account figures. All of them are very much better figures-infinitely better figures-than the government anticipated when it brought down its last budget. They are infinitely better figures than the opposition anticipated at the time. In so far as these current account figures are a product of the gap between national expenditure and national product, we have announced an intention to, in the next series of budgets, rein in the deficit and go into surplus much faster. We are prepared to do that by addressing both the revenue and the expenditure side of the budget. The simple fact of the matter is that you are not participants in this debate. You have eliminated any intention on your part, you say, to address-despite what you had to say when you were Treasurer-revenue raising measures. You are not participants in any discussion on revenue raising measures. You have decided not to make yourselves participants in the area of spending cuts. Bravely you wander around the place talking about $5 billion to $10 billion worth of expenditure cuts when a bunch of public service figures were leaked that indicated what you would have to do to come to $5 billion to $10 billion. First you paraded out there, waving this document around with great glee, and then all of a sudden-it took a while-like a silver bullet between your eyebrows, you discovered what it meant for you: if you were going to put in place $5 billion to $10 billion worth of cuts, that is what you would have to do. So instead of being a document waved around, the document suddenly became Dracula, and immediately you hauled out the Liberal Party cross, stuck it in front of that document and said, 'Into the waste paper basket with you lest people take a bit of a look at what might be our intentions if we ever got into office.' You are, as was said by one of your own at one point in time, purely meretricious players in this particular debate. Therefore, you are not in it at all, as far as we are concerned. NA",75
46,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the Netherlands. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Sydney Airport: Third Runway  directed to the Minister for Transport. Has the minister seen a media report of claims that there would be a concentration of traffic using the north-south runWays at Sydney airport following the opening of the third runway? What is the minister's response to those claims? What action does the government intend to take in regard to those claims?",76
47,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my attention has been drawn to a report from the Stan Zemanek Show, a radio program on 2UE",76
48,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Redneck radio.,76
49,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Actually, this is one of the occasions when I think Mr Zemanek should be commended",76
50,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,76
51,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I am afraid you're the spinners, as will become apparent from this exchange. Mr Zemanek is interviewing John Fahey. Mr Zemanek says this: You mean to say that you never realised, were never told, you had no information whatsoever that, really, it wasn't going to be three runways operating, it was only going to be two runways. That was the question from Mr Zemanek. John Fahey in response: Absolutely. Underno circumstances did we believe that there would be only two runways operating at that time. Stan Zemanek: Are you saying also that you had no knowledge that the east-west runway was going to be phased out? John Fahey: I can say that we did not know that there was going to be a concentration on the north-south runway, and that is a fact. Stan Zemanek-a tad incredulous at this stage: But you are the premier of this state. You're a man running the government of this state. Are you saying that you were never consulted, never wanted to find out about it? Did you ask any questions about it? John Fahey: At no point of time did they saythat's the federal governmentthat all the planes would be operating on the south runways, causing noise pollution to people who happened to be in the flight path. That is the report from 13 February 1995. Can I say, it sits rather uncomfortably with this document, which is the submission of the New South Wales government, the Fahey government, on the draft EIS for the proposed third runway at Kingsford Smith Airport. Let me quote two things that the New South Wales government says in this document, in its official submission on the third runway. This is what the Fahey government had to say-wait for it: The State Government believesthis is the government in which Mr Fahey is a ministerthat the draft environmental impact statement sufficiently analysed all the key issues associated with providing additional runway capacity in the Sydney Basin. No single issue or combination of issues identified in the draft EIS or this submission is either incapable of management or is sufficient to impede the early construction of the third runway. Furthermore, the State Government believes that the draft EIS is a good and well-researched document overall and is suitable as a tool for decision ing. That is the New South Wales government's official submission on the draft EIS. The New South Wales submission went on to say-and the Leader of the Opposition knows how important this is: The number of people seriously affected will be reduced from 54,700 to 26,900 whilst those moderately affected would reduce from 170,000 to 82,000. HoweverNew South Wales saidNew areas will become exposed to aircraft noise and some areas will be exposed to higher levels of aircraft noise. The decreases will be to the east and the west with moderate reductions to the south but increases to the north. The noise outcome is a logical conclusion as those movements arriving from the north on the third runway are much higher over urban areas. This was the New South Wales government's submission. It went on, because there was a supplement to the EIS, and it indicated that the east-west runway movements would north- reduce from 72,000 in 1988 to 3,600 in 2010. That was the official figure endorsed by the New South Wales government in these terms in its supplement to the EIS, when it said: The New South Wales government agencies have reviewed the supplement to the draft EIS for the proposed third runway and relevant ministers have endorsed the views expressed herein. The honourable member asked me what I intend to do about this report. What I intend to do is to reveal the truth about John Fahey and to reveal the absolute humbug that he is. Interest Rates",76
52,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Minister for Finance to reveal the truth about the government's economic program, and I ask has him: does the government endorse Senator Evans's statement in the Senate this afternoon that interest rates will not rise in the foreseeable future?",77
53,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would not mind knowing what your particular policies are. Go out there and do an interview with a serious economic journalist. We have not got your views on anything. You have been going mak- around the place for the last three years with one-liners unwilling to test yourself against any journalist who might actually know something about what you aspire to talk about. Do we ever hear from you on those subjects? No, not at all. The fact of the matter is that as far as the government is concerned, the policies that we are pursuingMr Costello-So you don't endorse Gareth?",77
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked his question. Mr Costello--We have got to get answers.,78
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,If you would be quiet you would hear one.,78

57,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,78
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left. He is now trying to hear.,78
59,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The position of the government is that every aspect of government policy works to put as much downward pressure on interest rates as it possibly can. We have had some good news on that in recent times. In so far as interest rates in this country are, to a degree, impacted upon by foreign interest rate movements, which they are, we had that good news from the head of the federal reserve in the United States which indicated that, as far as he was concerned, he saw an end to rises in American interest rates. That was good news, and 1 would have thought ought to have been news that was regarded as significant by the opposition. Mr Downer-Why are you walking away from Gareth?",78
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Mayo.,78
61,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Obviously, in putting forward the propositions that the Treasurer did a month or so ago as to the direction of government fiscal policy and what were the directions in this and subsequent budgets in so far as fiscal policy impacts the policies that the government has in place and is emphasising further in these subsequent budgets exercise a downward pressure on interest rates. That happens to be the objective of the government. We also do it from not a bad position, because it has to be said that the interest rates that are being paid, for example, by our home buyers now at this point of time are at a level they never fell below in the last period of the Treasurer opposite us. When it comes to the 90-day rates which are now around about 8 per cent, you had 23, 'The best in the world,' he said at the time. It depends on your point of view, 1 suppose, as to whether or not they constituted the best in the world. We need to take no lessons from you lot when it comes to managing this economy in a way that has the minimum possible impact on interest rates. Election Campaigns: Public Funding",78
62,Mr GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Is the government reconsidering the declaration arrangements associated with election campaigns and the public funding of them?,78
63,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Andrew Robb has got to stop writing letters. He wrote to the honourable member for Banks and suggested that he ought to join in the campaign of frightening the life out of all recipients of social security benefits. He got his telephone into action and, in a push poll, was phoning around people in Canberra with misinformation and now he has started to write on fund raising matters to George Gear. George takes a small amount of offence at this, because he received a letter recently entitled 'An urgent message from the Liberal Party of Australia. $10,000.00 cash & prizes must be won!' An opposition member-So what?",78
64,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will get onto so what. The letter says: Dear The Gear Family, As you read this message you may be richer than you think, for a supporter has advanced $1 0,000.00 Cash and Prizes to be awarded to The Gear Family or someone else who will respond to messagesjust like this. upon interest rates, It goes on: Our research has proven that Australians want the Liberal Party to govern Australia, and they are prepared to help it win. Unfortunately, we don't have the union bosses to collect money for us. You might have a few business contributors but you do not have the union bosses, according to this. It further says: So we decided to instigate this donation incentive plan in which The Gear Family can take part in the $10,000.00 Cash and Prizes Sweepstakes. It then goes on to show the three ways in which the Gear family can benefit. There is an unfortunate thing about this letter. This letter, authorised by Andrew Robb, contains within it suggestions that it is a legitimate raffle-type activity licensed in the ACT and the Northern Territory. That is what the number seems to indicate. Unfortunately, it does not have a Western Australian number on it. The problem with that, as the member for Moore would know, is that it is a fine of 2,500 grand or six months gaol if that actually happens to be the case. If that is the case, perhaps the executive director of the Liberal Party will finally get his just reward. But really, if the opposition is going to have any show of knocking us off in an election campaign, it will have to get act together much better than this. At least when you do your raffles, do not do them with George's family, and do them legally. Television: West Indian Cricket Series",78
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Like millions of other Australians, I was looking forward to seeing the Australian cricket team play against the West Indies. We want to see the test series and the Minister for Communivices cations and the Arts promised that we could see it. Why does the government not fix failed anti-siphoning legislation rather than trot out the Minister for Communications and the Arts at a doorstop every time sporting teams is about to go onto the field? I ask whether the minister agrees with the statement of the chief executive of Channel Mr David Leckie, this morning: There is only one person who can break this deadlock, and that's the minister for communicawedge tions, Mr Michael Lee. Will you push the minister to change this legislation in the interests of Australian sports coverage?",79
66,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I will be very pleased to put the government's position with respect to this matter and to indicate the House that this government is absolutely committed to ensuring the continued availabclearly ility of major sporting events to the public free to air television. That is our policy. certainly was the clear intention of ment when it enacted the Broadcasting Services Act to ensure that major sport does not migrate from free to air television to pay television. That was the intention of this House and it is clearly enunciated in the Broadcasting Services Act. If members of the opposition care to turn on the television, they will find that viewers are seeing, and will continue to see for free, rugby league, rugby union",79
67,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can you guarantee the West Indies cricket series?,79
68,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You asked me a question. Viewers will also see soccer, tennis, its netball, basketball, golf, motor sport, the Olympics and, let me say in answer to the honourable member, yes, even the cricket. The West Indies cricket is a unique case due in part to the unresolved question",79
69,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,79
70,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Wait for it. It is due iIi part to the unresolved question of whether the rights were secured before the list took effect; that is, the list under the Broadcasting SerAct. I think, and the government believes, that on that basis there should be room its to see compromise both from Australis and from the Nine Network in order to reach an agreement so Australian fans can watch this one of our world class cricket event. We are aware of comments by the Nine 9, Network that allowing Australis to broadcast the event live, simultaneously with free to air TV, is in some way the thin edge of the and that sport will end up on pay TV rather than on free to air TV. The very fact that it is not seen as a precedent would seem to indicate that the wedge has been taken out of this equation. No precedent will be set by the West Indies coverage. Under the provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act the rights to listed events cannot be acquired by to pay TV before they are acquired by the free to air broadcasters. The broadcasters are running out of time. They have obligaon tions to their viewers to reach an agreement It and they certainly should be doing that rather this parliathan trying to hoard rights. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I ask that the minister table the document he was reading from so we can make sure he has read it all.",79
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the minister reading from private notes?,80
72,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. Education: Funding Mr GmSON-My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Is he aware of media reports suggesting that the extra 500 higher education places for Queensland announced by the government late last year are threatened by funding cuts? Will the minister assure the House that those places will be made available as promised?",80
73,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question because he has been at the forefront of the campaign to ensure that Queensland does get its fairer share of places for university education. I am aware of the report that the honourable member refers to. It comes from a speech that the shadow spokesman for education made in Brisbane on 15 February. It was a disappointing speech because not only did it not give any detail of what the opposition policy on higher education might be, it also failed to live up to expectations that it had fed the gallery in terms of having further leaks about what the government might be doing in its budget round. All it did was put fear into the minds of university students, those 500 extra students that got places as a result of our policy at end of last year, that those places might not continue. The fact is that these places are not at risk. Not only have we honoured the promise in terms of delivering those 500 places, we have already funded them. I can give a guarantee that that funding will continue over the life of the degree. There is no point funding one year of a degree if what we are trying to do is raise the opportunity for people in Queensland to get into university. Not only can I give the guarantee that the 500 places are safe, I can tell the House that we will go beyond the 500 places. I said at the time these were announced this was a down payment on our commitment to redress the inequity that has occurred in the system whereby Queensland-and it is not the only area where this is the case-has seen significant growth in its population ahead of the rest of the country but university places have not followed in the same way. We as a government are committed both to access in terms of ensuring that university places are available near to where the people live and to equity in the way in which those places are handed out. We will have regard to the growth that has occurred in the regions. You will find out the details of the further places beyond the guarantee that was sought by Senator Hill, which I have reaffirmed to the House today, when the budget is handed down. I am currently in discussions with the higher education sector about a number of priorities impacting upon that sector within the context of the forthcoming budget. The allocation of places to Queensland and to the other growth areas is only one component of it. I can assure the House that, whatever the outcome in terms of what this package of measures involves, it will not involve up-front fees for undergraduates- That is a clear commitment that this government makes and which it reaffirmed at the party conference last September. We as a government are committed to people having the opportunity to enter university based on merit, not on money; that is, not on their capacity to pay. But this, of course, stands in stark contrast to the opposition the policy--or what we can glean from it-so far as higher education is concerned. Senator Hill has been quite silent in terms of what the opposition proposes for higher education. But one interview that he did make himself available for was reported in the Age on 28 June. The article states: Senator Hill is committed to the idea of user pays in higher education: market mechanisms, he says, ultimately give greater power to the student. He wants to give individual institutions, and states, more autonomy by moving away from a centralised bureaucracy. The question that has to be asked is: if he is that concerned about these extra places for Queensland, how do market mechanisms and greater autonomy guarantee the access and equity? They cannot. What he has got is not only scaremongering; he has not got a shred of policy initiative that indicates how the opposition in government would handle the situation. There is little wonder that the Australian, in its editorial on 23 February, had this to say about the Liberal Party in relation to higher educationMr Costello-February?",80
74,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, 23 February this year. The editorial reads: The Liberal Party, however, has been without a semblance of a higher education policy since the sinking of the voucher scheme ... The reality is that, if the Liberal Party cannot develop a policy strategy, it should not be criticising us in a dishonest way and putting concern into the minds of students when we are genuinely demonstrating a commitment to meet their needs. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Noise",81
75,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Is it a fact that the not. CAA's acting chief executive revealed the truth when he said on radio earlier this week that increased aircraft movements on the north-south runway at Sydney airport will mean increased noise? Will the minister admit that he asked the Civil Aviation Authority not to open the new control tower at Sydney airport until after 25 March in an attempt to protect his New South Wales Labor mates, because he knew all along that opening it would mean increased traffic and increased noise for Sydney residents? When will the minister stop misleading the. people of Sydney about the aircraft noise that he is insisting they endure because of the federal government's incompetence?",81
76,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, just a few months ago in this place, the· opposition was saying that the whole aircraft noise problem in Sydney was due to the fact that the third runway was opened before the tower. Now they are here saying that we are stopping",81
77,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, he is asking you a question.",81
78,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Excuse me, let me answer the question-that we are preventing the opening of that runway for landings by jet aircraft. Let me make the position absolutely clear: the Civil Aviation Authority advised me last year of the staged arrangements for the phasing in of the third runway. The first stage, of course, was its opening last November. The second stage involved the landing of jets which was to coincide with the opening of the tower. And the third stage was to see the eventual capacity of the airport taken up with the commissioning of the ground radar late in 1995. The first stage is completed; that happened in November last year. The second stage; that is, the use of the third runway by jet aircraft, will commence when the tower is ready. The honourable member asked me whether I am preventing it from being opened. The answer is no. Mr Tim Fischer-Jets are already using the third runway.",81
79,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not for landings they're Mr Tim Fischer-For take-offs, yes and if you check the record you will find something different.",81
80,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Actually, I am interested that the Leader of the National Party would get into this act because I was only thumbing through my records today and I came across the definitive bible as far as this parliament is concerned on aircraft noise. Of course, it is the report by the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in 1985, which the honourable member said was a good committee. Of course, he would know-he was a member of it. Indeed, there is a fine photograph of him here back in 1985 wearing a three-piece suit. Seeing as he has bought into this, let me remind the House what he himself said in his dissenting report contained in this document because along with Mr Burr and Mr Webster, he put out a dissenting report in which he said that the second matter of disagreementthat he had from the rest of the committee 'relates to the construction of the parallel runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport.' He said this: The previous Coalition Government in 1982 decided to proceed with the construction of a closed space parallel runway at Kingsford-Smith . The new runway was to be 2,600 metres in length parallel with and located to the east of the existing 1634 runway commencing south of runway 725 and extending into Botany Bay. In announcing its decision, the Government advised that in 1981 delays to passengers and operators in Sydney could have cost at least $30 million. Wethis is the honourable memberfully support the decision of the previous Government and believe that the arguments for the construction of the runway are now even stronger. He went on to say: A decision not to proceed with the construction of a new runway at Kingsford-Smith could add to the noise problems at Sydney. That is what he was saying at the completion of his detailed study. Listen to this because this is the corker, this is the classic-this is about as truthful as John Fahey. He said this: A parallel runway could be available in six or seven years. Because of the changed operational arrangements for the new runway, it will be possible that there will be some alleviation of noise in the suburbs to the west and no significant change in overall noise exposure. That is what he said, having spent all of his time on that committee making the study. And he buys into this debate now! These are the people who would have you believe today in 1995 that they were not campaigning hell for leather for this runway right throughout the 1980s. The member for BennelongMr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. I am quite happy with the quote; my point of order relates to the nub of the member for Hume's question, which was whether the minister instructed the CAA to delay the tower opening until after the New South Wales elections. I ask that you direct him to answer that part of the question.",81
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister was asked a lengthy question. He is relevant to date. The minister.,82
82,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will be saying a few more words, Mr Speaker. I have indicated to the HouseMr Tim Fischer-Yes or no?",82
83,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Come on now! I have indicated to the House that this runway will be open for landings of jet traffic as announced last November when the tower is ready, and the government is doing nothing to delay the tower. Indeed, the advice to meMr Tim Fischer-Have you instructed the CAA?",82
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,82
85,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I have not instructed the CAA at all. And, indeed, the CAA has advised me that the tower will not be ready until the start ofMr Tim Fischer-April!",82

87,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,82
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will just wait for a minute. Those on my left will come to order. The minister has the call and will be heard in silence.,82
89,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will conclude by recounting to the House my experience on Sunday night, when I was confronted by a Liberal Party campaign worker who pressed into my hand the electoral propaganda for Mr Ben Franklin, the member for Heffron. Mr Ruddock-The member for Heffron?",82
90,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is what he wants to be; that is what he is putting himself up for. I might say that the name 'Benjamin Franklin' has gone downhill a heck of a way in the last couple of hundred years. It is pretty clear that this Ben Franklin is certainly no George Washington because this fellow does not mind telling a few fibs. Listen to this one for a classic. He put this propaganda into my hand. He says: What does Ben Franklin stand for? Mr Downer-You are certainly the original Laurie.,82
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Mayo has been warned once.,82
92,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He says that he stands for the fast-tracking of Badgerys Creek airport. He also says: The Labor Party's official policy is to reopen the east-west runway and bring the noise back to our areathat is, bring the noise back to the east-west. This is the Liberal Party's official campaign propaganda. That comes on top of the Liberal Party propaganda which I distributed a few weeks ago-Mr Costell-Which you distributed?",82
93,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, that is right. There is more Liberal Party propaganda here in this House. The voters of Hurstville were told that Labor will reopen the east-west runway. This propaganda was sent by the party's candidate for Hurstville uner the slogan 'Don't let Labor bring the noise back'-that is, bring the noise back to the east-west runway. If ever there has been an issue on which opposition members have been revealed for the absolute hypocrisy they preached throughout the 1980s, at every point to the present and again today, it is this issue of aircraft noise at Kingsford Smith airport. Daw Park Repatriation Hospital",83
94,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Would the minister advise the House on the current status of the integration of the Commonwealth's repatriation hospital at Daw Park in South Australia? Furthermore, will the minister assure the House that South Australian entitled veterans and war widows will not be disadvantaged as a result of the integration of the hospital at Daw Park into the state health system?",83
95,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. On 26 November last year, I had the pleasure of announcing the integration of the Daw Park Repatriation Hospital into the state public hospital system of the South Australian government. Integration of the hospital will take place on 9 March this year. The changeover will involve a payment of some $220 million over four years to provide for the treatment of veterans in South Australian public hospitals. The key aspect of the package is that the Commonwealth will make a specific capital contribution of some $13 million for the construction of a new rehabilitation facility at the hospital. The new facility will provide significant benefits for the local community as well as entitle war veterans and war widows to reside within 20 kilometres of the hospital. Integration will secure Daw Park's future as an acute care teaching hospital and will guarantee continuing access for veterans to its high quality treatment services. I, with the Minister for Human Services and Health, intend to officially hand over the hospital to the state on 10 March. Special veterans services-such as outpatients clinics, psychiatric, aged and extended care and rehabilitation and hospice services, wili also be retained. A newsletter reporting on the joint announcement and the support of all major ex-service organisations was sent out on 6 January. In relation to the second part of the question, I can advise the honourable member that I do not believe there will be any disadvantage at all. A treatment monitoring committee will make sure that everything goes well. Since I last reported to the House on hospital integration, the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital was successfully transferred to private operators in January this year and the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital in Victoria was transferred over last year. There have been hardly any complaints, if any. War Memorials: Restoration Program",83
96,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I remind the minister of his announcement late last year about a national restoration program of war memorials separate from, but in conjunction with, the Australia Remembers initiative. Is he aware of and satisfied with the DEET job creation criteria of this program? If not, what action is he taking with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to resolve the problems which are affecting war memorial restoration work in my electorate, and I suspect in electorates on both sides of the House, or is this just another example of Keating rhetoric without substance in this important year of remembrance?",83
97,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. A couple of people have asked me what the position is with that restoration operation, including the shadow minister. It is not that easy to simply arrange to give the money over and allow somebody to do it. I sent out an appropriate circular to all members giving them a pamphlet telling them exactly how to do it. We said that the local DEET area consultative committees should get together with the local RSLs, the ex-service organisations or the shire councils and put forward some sort of program so we can arrange to use the new work opportunities for such things as war memorial restoration, remembrance driveways, remembrance walks and that sort of thing. Under the new work opportunities, we need to have six months worth of work for people who are eligible for that type of work. There is also a certain amount of money between the amount paid for the training wage and the actual amount paid for material, supervision, et cetera. I understand there are some perceived problems in some areas in the sense that some people do not know exactly how to go about it. It was only today or yesterday that I wrote to the shadow minister on this particular matter. I do know that in other areas it is going very well, and it very much depends on the local personalities in that particular area. I am more than happy to give whatever assistance I can to the honourable member to get it off the ground. I take some objection to his saying that it is rhetoric. It is not rhetoric. I am prepared to help. I have discussed this with the minister for education. Come and see us, and I will be only too happy to help you. There is no need for you to ask the question in here, I will help you. Sole Parents Mr FITZGmBON-My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. What is the government's response to recent media claims about the circumstances of sole parents?",83
98,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members may have seen the report on Monday's edition of A Current Affair on Channel 9 hosted by Ray Martin. That program featured a number of claims about sole parent pensioners. It implied that a significant number of sole parent pensioners are teenage girls having children solely in order to gain access to the sole parent pension. It also claimed that little or nothing is being done to ensure that both parents of children of sole parent pensioners are making a contribution to their upkeep and that nothing much is being done to create incentives for sole parent pensioners to take up work opportunities, and so forth. In other words, it referred to all the standard negative stereotypes of sole parent pensioners that do so much harm to those people and their children. What are the facts? It is important to provide a few on this matter. Firstly, the vast majority of sole parent pensioners achieve that status after the break-up of an existing marriage or marriage-like relationship. The average age of sole parent pensioners is 33 for women and 38 for men. Secondly, a picture is purveyed that sole parent pensioners are teenagers but the reality is that three per cent of sole parent pensioners are teenagers and that fewer than one per cent of sole parent pensioners are under the age of 18. Over the last 20 years or so the number of teenage births has declined markedly in this country by around 60 per cent, which coincides with the availability period of the sole parent pension. That situation is in marked contrast to that of the United States. A very different pattern exists in that country in terms of sole parent pensioners. The numbers are rising sharply and the whole picture is very different. Those who watched the program would never have guessed at the existence of the child support scheme, which has been in operation since 1989. That scheme has a requirement for parents to take reasonable steps to seek maintenance before they can get the sole parent pension. As a result of that scheme, the number of sole parent pensioners receiving child support has doubled in the last five years. The average level of child support has risen markedly over that period from $44 to $68 a week. Finally, I turn to work incentives. A major focus of government activity has been on the so-called JET program-the jobs, education and training program. That is unquestionably one of the most effective labour market interventions that we have. It is demonstrably successful and will shortly be generating net savings on government outlays. That is the overall picture. As a result, the proportion of sole parent pensioners deriving income from non.:.government sources has increased quite significantly in recent years. All those facts are hardly consistent with the picture of large numbers of teenage girls having children just so they can access the sole parent pension. The average duration of sole parent pension is now down to about three years. It is terribly unfortunate that a program with such a wide viewership should continue to pervade these negative stereotypes, which do immense harm to people and families. Horticulture: Labour Shortage",84
99,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-'-My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I have no need to remind the minister that over 800,000 people are unemhave ployed in this country and that countless parliamentnumbers again are underemployed. Why, then, are horticulturalists currently having enormous difficulty in attracting harvest labour? I am referring to grape growers, vegetable growers problem. and stone fruit growers in the Murray Valley, the Goulburn Valley and all across Australia. Mr Bevis-Have you heard about award wages?",85
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Brisbane!,85
101,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,These growers have their that livelihood dependent on expeditious removal of their crop; I remind the minister-and interjectors-that they contribute billions dollars to this nation's wealth. Will the lems. minister explain why this ridiculous situation is allowed to occur when there is a vast labour pool available? What is he doing about it?,85

104,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When I visited Seymour last year, this problem was similarly raised in relation to Shepparton and the. fruit picking industry. As a result of those that came along, including the employers of SPC, having identified the problem, my understanding is that we have developed a response for the stone fruit picking industry in that region. I do not see any reason why-and I have spoken with area managers to this effect-we cannot use the flexibility within Working Nation to develop group schemes that involve unemployed people on a regular basis moving around· to follow the seasons.

112,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not mind constructive criticism. What I take exception to is people only want to criticise; people that are not prepared to get involved actively with the the opportunities presented through the area of consultative committees to solve these probLast year I was in the electorate of the previous questioner who asked a question of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. As I recall it-and he was at the meeting so he should be of it-we did announce a project under the restoration of memorials program within his electorate.  Speaker, understanding order 145. The minister was asked a question by the member for Mallee about the stone fruit industry and now he is answering a previous question from the member for Groom about the reconstruction program. I ask you to bring him back to the question.",85
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister was indeed asked a question related to those programs. I suggest he comes to them.,86
114,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am happy to, Mr Speaker, but this just highlights the fact that they are not really interested in the answers. They are only interested in levelling criticisms. I simply say to the honourable member: you give me the details of where you say the specific problems are and I will get cetera you the details of how we have responded to them in the Seymour region. Let us together see whether we can develop a response for Mallee. I put you on notice that I am prepared to work with you to develop that solution because the reality is that Working Nation can respond to these sorts of issues. What we are saying though is: you identify the need. Working Nation can fit the need. Industrial Chemicals",86
115,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations. he aware of concerns expressed by the cal industry that cost recovery arrangements have a negative effect on the introduction safer industrial chemicals? What is the minister's response to those concerns?,86
116,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have had a number of tution representations from the chemical industry, including from one group now headed by the former member for Warringah, making a very reasonable point to us. Their concern is that the cost of evaluation of new chemicals safer brought into the country prevents safer chemicals being used in substitution for current chemicals used in Australia. One of the most widely used examples is that mirrors which are made in Australia still have a harmful lead based backing to them and that, although there are safer alternatives to the lead based backing for mirrors, the cost of assessing the alternative material or chemical has prevented the importation of that material. The 3M company has provided to us a list of 120 products which it claims could now introduced into Australia except for the fact that the cost of evaluation is too high. reminds us that it is difficult to cost of those evaluations in such a small market as the Australian market. Last October I undertook to initiate a review of the national industrial chemical notifications assessment scheme--NICNASwith a view to testing its proposition, that is, that chemicals are not being allowed into Australia because of the cost of evaluation and the inability to recover those costs, and that, therefore, safer chemicals are not being used. The independent consultant Dr Howard Gwynne has already given me a copy of an interim report which he is further working up with some people--environmentalists and union and industry representatives-in Sydney today. I am pleased to be able to report progress so far inasmuch as he thinks there is validity to some of these claims; that it is possible that we should be able to change the pricing of the testing and assessment of Is chemicals such that, while ensuring the chemiAustralian community that we keep the highest standards of assessment of chemicals, of we should be able to change the way that we price the assessments to allow the importers of chemicals in the chemical industry in this country to bring in safer chemicals in substifor chemicals currently used in Australia. This is good news and I hope to report further progress in a month or two. It is my earnest concern that we will, where we possibly can, change the signals to ensure that chemicals are imported into this country. Mount Barker Road",86
117,Mr STEELE HAL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Transport aware of the notoriety of the Mount Barker Road, part of the main interstate route out of Adelaide, with the worse road accident record of all national highways in Australia? In view of years of delay in this project, the already peak capacity traffic, the completion of acquisition and planning requirements, and the fact that South Australia's share of national highway funding was a paltry seven per be cent this financial year, will the minister urgently approve the reconstruction of the It Mount Barker Road as part of Australia's recover the national highway system?",86
118,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I indicate to the honourable member that the Mount Barker Road and its needs are well recognised by the federal Department of Transport. It is a project that we have had and continue to have ongoing discussions with the South Australian government about. The South Australian government has indicated, through Minister Laidlaw, the priority its sees for that work to be carried out. It is a massive undertaking; it is a huge project involving some hundreds of millions of dollars in construction work. It is not something that can be commenced withoutMr Downer-It is not hundreds of millions; it is $100 million.",87
119,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it will be well over a hundred million dollars before this work is finished. I can say to the honourable member that I have had discussions with my South Australian counterpart about ways in which this work could commence earlier than might be the case within the constraints of the national highway system, and those discussions are ongoing. I would like to see the design work completed. I would certainly be keen to see this work undertaken because we recognise the priority that should be afforded it. Overseas Aid",87
120,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Could the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs indicate what action he is taking to follow up his statement to the House on 27 February concerning a code of practice for non-government organisations working in the overseas aid field?,87
121,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member. I think the reception to his question indicates that it is only when matters of genuine moment are before the House that he rises to ask a question on a matter which I believe is of concern to both sides of the chamber. As I mentioned in parliament on 27 February, I have written twice now to the Industry Commission about some gaps which exist in the accountability provisions for charitable organisations. In particular, I indicated to the commission that I am prepared to set up an advisory committee to make recommendations on an appropriate voluntary code of practice for nongovernmental organisations. I have just had a reply from the Chairman of the Industry Commission, Mr Scales, who in his letter says: Appropriate interim voluntary codesMr Downer interjecting",87
122,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Look, it is actually in relatively small type. He said: Appropriate interim voluntary codes of practice for NGDO accountability may be a useful way forward in meeting some of the accountability problems currently facing a number ofNGDOs. It goes on: You also raised the matter of compliancewith such a voluntary codeas a prerequisite for continued access to funding or tax deductibility. This is a useful suggestion and we will examine it and other possibilities . . . I am very pleased that, in the last day or so, a couple of non-governmental organisations, including CARE Australia, have come out in support of such a code. Those 93 nongovernmental organisations which belong to ACFOA-the vast majority of the 120 nongovernmental organisations in the aid fieldalready sign up to the existing ACFOA code of ethics, which in my experience is rigorous and effective. My proposal is to have a code to which all non-governmental organisations can sign up whether or not they belong to ACFOA. I accept that some non-governmental organisations-and one of those is the Red Cross-have good reason not to join ACFOA, but my hope is that a voluntary code divorced from actual membership of ACFOA can get around that problem. The legal advice that I have had in a preliminary way is that compliance with such a code could be a prerequisite for tax deductibility status. Incidentally, I note that Malcolm Fraser's reported concern that such a code might be used to obtain lists of donors is quite misplaced. I assure the House that there is no intention that any code of practice would require that. In the near future I will be setting up an expert advisory committee with representation from ACFOA, non-governmental organisations and accountancy experts, amongst others. This committee will make recommendations on the legal and accountancy issues involved and will be using the existing ACFOA code as a basis for its work. It will also examine international best practice. I am determined to pursue this matter promptly to ensure that the Australian public will continue to have confidence in our Australian nongovernmental organisations working in the overseas aid field.",87
123,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",88
124,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Yesterday, the honourable  attention to a case involving an injunction being sought to prevent the publication of a report by the Ombudsman. The honourable member asked me to consider whether an issue of privilege existed and asked whether the House should be represented in the proceedings. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) also commented, asking me to consider the actions of the party seeking the injunction. The honourable member for Chifley asked whether I was aware of any previous such case. I have to say that I am not. As I understand it, the situation is as follows. The Ombudsman has prepared a report and, at this stage, has provided a copy to the chairperson of A TSIC under section 15 of the relevant act. Under the Ombudsman Act, the Ombudsman may publish reports and may provide a copy to the Prime Minister. This could occur where the Ombudsman had concerns following consideration of a report by the agency concerned-under section 16 and section 35A of the act. Another possible step is for the Ombudsman to provide the report for tabling in the parliament. This could occur if, for example, the Ombudsman still had concerns following the provision of a report to the Prime Minister-under section 17 of the act. In the particular case raised by the honourable member, ATSIC has sought an injunction from the Federal Court to prevent the Ombudsman from publishing the report and from providing a copy to the Prime Minister. Such action is allowed for by the legislationsection llA applies. As I am advised, an injunction could not be obtained, and has not been sought, to prevent the Ombudsman from dealing with her report in accordance with the Ombudsman Act. Rather, I am informed, ATSIC alleges that the Ombudsman has breached the act and that, therefore, the report is not a proper or 'valid report. The Ombudsman has undertaken not to publish her report pending the resolution of these issues by the court. The matter is scheduled to come before the Federal Court in Sydney later this week. As I understand it, it is not common for such reports to be tabled in parliament. Whether this eventually happens depends on the earlier processes and, in particular, on the Ombudsman's views as to the responses received. It seems to me that there is, at this stage, no issue of the rights of members or the House being infringed. It is possible that the case will prevent further publication of the report but, as I understand it, the actions taken have not been directed at the parliament in any way. As indicated, there is no requirement that such reports be presented to parliament. This is a matter for the judgment of the Ombudsman. Honourable members may also take the view that, should such a document be presented to a house of parliament, the person responsible for providing it may be entitled to seek the protection of the law concerning parliamentary privilege in any case. I do not believe that a prima facie case of breach of privilege or contempt has been made out. Whilst I recognise the concerns of the honourable member, I do not believe it necessary or desirable for me to be represented in the proceedings. Notwithstanding, I am sure all members would have an interest in this matter. I, too, will monitor progress.",88
125,Mr HOWARD,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence. Would you be prepared to give precedence to a motion expressing the view of this House that the Ombudsman be requested by the parliamentto provide a copy of her report to the parliament?",88
126,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"As I understand it, there is nothing ultimately which would prevent that happening in any case.",89
127,Mr HOWARD,PRIVILEGE,We are trying to make a request.,89
128,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"It seems to me that it would be unnecessary, and, in time",89
129,Mr HOWARD,PRIVILEGE,"-I have addressed a specific question. I am asking whether you would, because this relates to a matter of privilege, give precedence to a motion to that effect.",89
130,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Could I seek some advice and then come back to you on that, because it is a matter that a number of people have raised concerns about on both sides of the parliament.",89
131,Mr HOWARD,PRIVILEGE,"We take the view that the contents of that report are clearly a matter of public interest and direct interest, and, after what you have said, the idea that that report will not be tabled strikes many people on this side of the House-and on the other side of the House, I would hope-as quite ridiculous.",89
132,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"As I said, I will get some advice and report back. NA",89

134,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I have received letters from the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) proposingMr Downer---Guess who wins. Mr Costello-Goldstein.,89
135,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Would you like to put a bet on it now? The letters are proposing that definite matters of public importance,89
136,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,89
137,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Just as well I am feeling happy today. They are proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion. As required by standing order 107, I have selected the matter which, in my opinion, is the most urgent and important, which is that proposed by the honourable member for Goldstein, namely: The incompetenceofthe Government's handling of the telecasting of mlYor sporting events which threatens to deny most Australians access to free to air television broadcasts of the Australian Cricket Team's tour of the West Indies. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number ofmembers required by the standing orders having risen in their places",89
138,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Today there is every chance that Australians are about to be denied access to the most exciting cricket series in years. In May last year, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) made a promiseOpposition member-Another promise!",89
139,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, another promise. He promised that this legislation, the so-called anti-siphoning list, would ensure 'that viewers would not be forced to pay for major sporting programs which they now receive free of charge'. Today, because of the minister's bungling incompetence, that promise looks as though it is about to join the increasingly long list of broken promises which have come from this government. Australians today are at risk of losing the right to see Australian test cricket in the West Indies on free to air television-a right which we on this side of the House support unequivocally. Under the minister's rules, unless it can be shown on free to air television, this test series and the one-day games will not be able to be shown at all. The reason this extraordinary situation has arisen is the incompetence of this minister. Of course, we all know that the minister on the other side of the table is not the real minister for communications. The minister is way out of his league. He would be much more convincing as the 12th man, bringing out the drinks at a social match, but he is a player in the big league.",89
140,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He's the runner.,90
141,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He is the runner. The Leader of the Opposition thinks he is the runner. That puts him back where he should be. I want to assure the minister of this: we are a sporting mob on this side of the House, and for the purposes of this debate, we are going to treat him as the minister for communications. But what was it that Geoff Kitney called him last week? Little Sir Echo. Do you remember the words of that song? 'Little Sir Echo, where have you been? Hello, hello.' These are very appropriate words in this case because this minister has been posted missing time and time again when there have been major decisions to be taken. We could go right through the record of this minister and we would see that again and again when there was an important decision to be taken he was not there. Mr Reith-So who makes them then?",90
142,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The person who makes the decisions is the real minister for communications. He is the captain of the team over there for whom this fellow is the runner. The captain of the team, of course, has a different view of communications policy to most Australians. In his view, communications policy is all about high politics. Every decision that has been taken in this area of communications has been taken for the immediate, shabby, short-term benefit of the Prime Minister and the spivs around him. In finding his substitute for media policy, Paul Keating has made more deals than Nick Leeson and, as a result of that, his media policy is about as bankrupt as Baring's bank. This rabbit on the other side of the table is not part of that high politics. His role is just to do the nightwatchman's job, to stonewall, do nothing, try not to get bowled out and do what he is told. It looks as though the millions of sporting fans and cricket lovers in this country are about to find out that he is not even up to that role. We see the extraordinary sight of this minister running very hard. At one time he is over on the side of free to air television, the next time he is at the other end of the wicket, he is on the side of pay TV. He is running harder than Mark Waugh in the 49th over of a one day match. At the moment, it is like watching the fast forward on the television. He is back to one side then the other side trying to make up his mind and trying to produce some sort of result. Last week he was. over on the side of Channel 9, it seems. Now he is on the other side. What has changed since then? Only the captain's altercation with Kerry Packer in the outfield. It is pretty clear that the Prime Minister has told this bloke to fix it, and fix it quickly. We are watching a very embarrassing performance. When the Prime Minister does deals in this area, he does them a long time ahead. He can see the event coming up. He knows when the match is going to be played, so when he wants to make a deal to sort something out for his own political purposes he does it ahead of time. When he wanted balanced coverage in the 1993 election campaign, he sorted that out. He told Conrad Black what he wanted in January-February 1992. The minister's problem has been that he has left this to the very last moment. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald in July last year the minister was warned that Australis thought that it had bought the free to air and the pay TV rights to the Windies tour. There was fair warning about that, and it was fair warning to you that something had to be sorted out, and you did nothing. You usually do nothing. In July 1994, that same month, an article appeared in the Financial Review which reported that a leading Sydney lawyer had given advice that Mr Kerry Packer could increase his interests in Fairfax beyond his current 15 per cent, up to 25 per cent, without breaching the cross-media rules. Did you clarify any of that? Were you interested in that? Then you started to say, 'Well, perhaps the cross-media rules are out of date. Perhaps they have been overtaken by technology. Perhaps something will need to be done about them to change them.' But that is not the Prime Minister's current view, is it? The Prime Minister's current view is that perhaps the cross-media rules need to be tightened. He is playing his political games, and you fall in behind. When the Prime Minister brought down his Creative Nation statement and he threw the ABC orchestras into chaos by suggesting that the Sydney Symphony Orchestra should be taken out of the network-the biggest network of symphony orchestras in the world-what did you do? You waited around for five months while every music lover in the country was wondering what on earth was going to· happen to that network because you had not been able to resolve it. It does not matter whether it is music lovers or cricket lovers, they get the short end of the stick from you because you cannot make any significant decisions. In January this year, you were asked if pay TV could broadcast the Pakistan test seriesone of the best cricket test series ever. You were asked whether it could be broadcast on pay TV-a series the free to air channels had not taken up. What did you say? You said you would think about it. You asked the ABA to report in the middle of the year-nine months after the series was played. So much for Australian sports lovers. That is the sort of service they get from you, Minister. It is now clear that you knew for months that Australis was claiming free to air rights for the Windies tour and you did absolutely nothing, or at least you failed to resolve the matter and all its implications. You did not take any action to find out whether the antisiphoning rules applied or not. You allowed uncertainty to continue. As David Leckie of GTV 9 said this morning on the AM program, 'This is a deadlock that should not have happened.' He said, 'There's only one person that can break this deadlock, and that's the minister for communications, Mr Michael Lee.' Where has Mr Michael Lee been all this time? He has not been there trying to sort this out. He has followed the usual form and let it drift. The ABA has given the minister some preliminary advice. It seems that the claims of Australis do not pre-empt the legislation, that it does apply, and under your legislation you had a very clear responsibility, a responsibility to determine whether the free to air channels had been given a reasonable opportunity to acquire the rights. But you did not take effective action to sort that out. You still have not taken effective action to get a clear and immediate ruling from the Australian Broadcasting Authority as to the position under the legislation. A week ago, as I said, you seemed to be on the side of Channel 9. It proposed a 24-hour lapse between the pay TV and the free to air broadcast. You proposed 12. Of course, that was on the basis that the anti-siphoning rules actually applied to this case. But, of course, the minister is now proposing simultaneous broadcasting without setting a precedent. Why does it not set a precedent? It does not set a precedent only if the anti-siphoning rules do not apply to this case. So, in the context of one week, the minister has taken two quite opposing views about the application of the anti-siphoning rules to this case. Mr Richard Evans-He does not know where he is.",90
143,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He does not know where he is and he has not done what he should have done, which is to go to the Australian Broadcasting Authority and ask it for an immediate clarification of whether the rules apply in this case or not. As it is, everyone is left in a high state of uncertainty. Now it looks as though every Australian cricket lover is going to be denied the chance to see the Windies tour on free to air television. I remind the minister that last May you made a promise to the Australian people. made a promise that this anti-siphoning legislation would ensure that viewers would not be forced to pay for major sporting events which they now receive free of charge. Every sports lover and every cricket lover in this country now wants to know whether or not the chamber. that promise was any better than the Prime Minister's promise on taxes. Was it a promise to be kept or was it a big l-i-e by L-e-e? Minister, when you received that first warning, why did you not act? You should have referred the matter immediately to the ABA to obtain a definitive ruling. July last year, you made a very revealing statement, I thought, on the 7.30 Report. showed a certain amount of honesty about your failings, Minister. You said: I'm working as hard as I can to build up the I need to be as good a Minister as I can. I'm sure I've demonstrated yetthat I'm good enough be a Minister who is handling very difficult issues. Only one thing has changed since then. You have now demonstrated that you are not a good enough minister to be handling these difficult issues. In fact, I have to say that are beginning to make the tenure of the previous minister of the portfolio, the present Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), look pretty good. He would be pleased with you now. It is getting pretty late in the game. one-day matches in the West Indies start in week's time. The sporting public is disillusioned about your performance. wicket is beginning to break up, the bowling is getting pretty hairy and, unless your batting improves dramatically, you are just be clean bowled.",91
144,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Dobell-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism) (4.22 p.m.)-The matter of public importance today just shows how hypocritical the opposition is on this and other issues. It was the opposition that was trailing its coat around this building, saying it was going to disallow the anti-siphoning list because the opposition believed the list was too long. Senator Alston, the spokesman on communications, was running around suggesting because the list was too long, we were threatYou ening the viability of pay TV. Yet these hypocrites come into this chamber and seek to suggest that in some way we have not done enough to protect the public's right to continue to watch these events on TV. So there is certainly stacks of hypocrisy on that side of What is important is that the government remains committed to ensuring that pay TV is about increasing the diversity of television coverage for Australians. Pay TV was not meant to force people to pay for events they have traditionally watched on free to air TV. In Yesterday, Mr David Leckie, the Chief Executive Officer of Channel 9 made a few comIt ments. One of the things he said was, 'The only person who can stop this is Michael Lee.' Let me make one thing clear: there is skills only one thing stopping Australians watching not the West Indies tour and that is Channel 9's to determination and demand to have exclusivity. That is the one thing stopping this broadcast being available to Australians right across the country-and that is what has to be addressed. It is ridiculous for Channel 9 to claim that you there is some threat to the viability of its broadcast. How can it claim that its viability of broadcasting to 18 million people is somehow undermined by 3,000 people watching it on pay TV? Surely the opposition does not argue that a broadcast to 18 million people The can be undermined by 3,000 people having a access to it on pay TV? Channel 9 then goes getting on to argue, as Mr Leckie said: Your This is the thin edge of the wedge . The next step will be for other major sporting about to events to appear only on pay TV. What I did yesterday, if Mr Leckie did not notice, is separate the thin end from the wedge. I made it clear that the West Indies tour will not s.et a precedent. Australis said that in its Senate evidence the other day and I repeated it yesterday. We have separated the thin end from the wedge-and it is ridiculous for Channel 9 to suggest that in some way a concession on simultaneous broadcasting of the West Indies tourMr MCLachlan-How do you separate the that, thin end from the wedge?",92
145,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, my friend, the argument Network from Channel 9 is that the wedge-that other sporting events-will not Channel 9 agrees to simultaneous broadcasting on this event, in case you haven't noticed. The We made it clear yesterday that this will set a precedent and Australis has said, 'This network. will not create a precedent.' So it is very clear. It is ridiculous for Nine to suggest that some way this compromises its position for future negotiations. Channel 9 has also claimed that, in a press release put out Leckie on 22 February, in some way it has other things. some right. The press release states: ""If Nine loses its fight to maintain exc1usivityChannel9's that being our internationally recognised broadcast the cricket before Australis-we do believe that the anti-siphoning legislation will work. Unless I am a bit thick, no channel has an internationally recognised right to the cricket or any other sport-just as Channel 2, the ABC, did not have an internationally recoga  took it off them. Surely the opposition-the siphoning list. supporter of free enterprise-is not arguing that in some way Channel 9 has a monopoly on the rights to the cricket. Do you agree Channel 9 on that point? I certainly hope db not. It is ridiculous for a broadcaster to had this exclusive right to be the only channel to negotiate the rights for cricket. When network such as Nine says that rights to broadcast cricket, it should be thinking of the obligations it has to its viewers. has an obligation to its viewers to ensure that this is on free to air. The challenge is for Channel 9 to remove the roadblock that is stopping all Australians having access to cricket. The first point is that blocking the road today as we speak is Nine's demand for exclusivity. The next point is raised in an article today'sAustralian under the headline 'Rugby League poised to expand into pay TV arena'. I do not know whether the opposition spokeslong. man has seen it. The article states: It is understood that discussions are advancing between the Mr Kerry Packer-controlled Nine and Optus Vision to negotiate the broadis, cast of Rugby League on pay TV. be covered if It goes on to say: director of sport for Nine, Mr Gary Burns, told The Australianthat Optus Vision would ""probably"" not get the use of Rugby League for its pay TV On the one hand we have Mr Leckie saying that any event on the siphoning list must be in shown exclusively on free to air, otherwise we are going to undermine the economics of free to air coverage of sport; on the other by Mr hand we have got Channel 9 saying some I have a few questions for Channel 9. Does pay TV associate-that is, Optus right to Vision-intend to broadcast any matches not which are not broadcast on free to air, in particular matches that are on the siphoning list? For example, Nine currently broadcasts two of the rugby league matches and the ABC broadcasts a third match. However, there are lot of other matches that are currently not shown on free to air TV and that are on the I have a question for Channel 9: is it planning to allow those other matches to be with shown on its pay TV channel? If that is the you case, why is it okay for Channel 9's pay TV company to show an event on pay TV that is say it on the list but it is an outrage when Australis's pay TV company choses an event a on the list? I think that Channel 9 should it has the answer that question. The essential point is: how does the siIt phoning list work? What we have made clear is that the rights to an event that is on the list cannot be secured by a pay TV licensee until a free to air broadcaster has first secured the the rights. That is the way the legislation was the only thing intended to work. I have to confess that I drew up a list that was pretty long. It is my very strong view in that Australian viewers out there should continue to have access to the major sporting events free of charge. That is why my list was In fact, the opposition criticised me because it claimed my list was too long. The following statement was in the 20 May 1994 edition of Media Australia under the headline 'Opposition concern over the extent of ""free list'''. It reads: . .. Senator Richard Alston, .also warned that ensuring wide-spread free-to-air access to sporting events could be to the detriment of the developing pay-tv industry. There is Senator Alston, who is still the opposition spokesman-I thought he might covered have got a shuffle along but he is still therecredit-they saying that he thought my list was so that it was going to undermine the viability pay TV. It is a bit hypocritical for opposition members to come in here and say that there is some major problem when they were the people who were saying that my list was too long. Let me give the House another Australian on 6 October under the headline 'Opposition may back pay TV operators on exclusive sports deals'-do you remember that one?-it states: The spokeswoman said Richard Alston was concerned that the list strike a balance between free-to-air and pay TV interests. ""We have got to achieve a balance which tinues to allow people to see events of national importance on free-to-air but also ensures that fledgling pay TV industry remains viable,"" spokeswoman said. It is extremely hypocritical of the opposition to come in here and argue that, in some there is a problem with the anti-siphoning when they are the people who argue that we are protecting too many events for free to air TV. What has happened with the West Indies negotiations? As the shadow spokesman says, it is correct that Australis did claim in July last year that it had the exclusive rights the West Indies series. As I told you yesterone day, subsequently they advised the Broadcastthe ing Authority and me-we made inquiries with Australis within days of its July anry nouncement-that an affiliate company, Prime Sports, had secured the international rights and that their licensee company, the company that holds the satellite licence, had not secured the rights. Then in January, Australis told that they were wrong, that that licensee company had secured the rights. Putting aside the question of whether or not the Broadcasting Authority and I were misled, the ABA is certainly still investigating whether or not the West Indies tour is covered by the list. They have told Australis that their preliminary view is that it is covered by the siphoning list. You have to give credit to Australis for behaving as if the event is by the list. And that is to Australis's have negotiated with Nine, they long have offered it to other networks, both of metropolitan and regional. That is the way the siphoning rules are meant to work, and that is the way this government intends to make sure they do work. So it is pretty hard to argue, as the opposition does, that in some way there is some crisis with the way the quote. In the siphoning rules work. What have I done in all this? On two occasions I have sought to break the logjam. These companies have been trying to negotiate these rights off and on now for three or four months-and, I have to confess, mostly off. Ten or 11 days ago, I tried to come up with a compromise that allowed Nine and conAustralis to reach agreement so the viewers out there can watch the cricket. Ten days ago the I suggested a delayed broadcast of 12 hours. the Certainly that was less than Nine asked for; Nine were after 24 hours. But it did not break the logjam, and the thing that was blocking way, the negotiations was Nine's request, delist mand-however you put it-for exclusivity. Some people, particularly Channel 9, argue that they have to have exclusivity. This is rather hard to understand when you realise that there are already clear examples where precedents have already been set and different deals have been done with different broadcastfor ers over a number of events. I will give you example that I am sure is in the mind of right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair): the New Zealand centenacricket test. Delayed highlights were shown on Channel 9 but the live coverage was shown on Galaxy. The FA Cup in soccer, which I understand will again be shown live on SBS, will be simultaneously shown live on us Galaxy. The netball world championships will be shown live on the ABC and live on Galaxy. I have been advised that the US Masters golf will be shown live on Nine and a delayed broadcast will be shown on Galaxy. All of these events are on the list. It is certainly clear there is obviously room for compromise by Australis and Nine to reach agreement on the West Indies tour, which is also on this same list. Senator Alston is the king of the press releases. We get half a dozen press releases a day, a stream of consciousness-Senator Alston's views on this, that and everything else. But there is never any focus on the opposition's communications policy. We had an amazing article written by Senator Alston in the Australian on the Opinion page last week, with Senator Alston saying, 'unless Keating can overcome his micro-economic reform fatigue and slash transmission costs', he does not think Australia will get the benefits from the information superhighway. It is rather hard to reconcile Senator Alston's urging that we should be speeding up micro-economic reform when it comes in the same week as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is running around saying that vague is best, that the opposition believes we should slow down the pace of micro-economic reform because there is too much pain out there in the community. I also notice that Senator Alston is on the record as saying that he does not think that the government should be putting money into developing multi-media in Australia, into bringing together our creative industries, the people who are the best at making films and television programs, and our computer software programmers to generate Australian content for the superhighway. He does not think that the government should be involved in this area. He thinks that is picking winners and that is money down the drain. His obsession is with the cost of transmission on telecommunications. This government remains firmly committed to encouraging and stimulating investment by the private sector in this very important industry-an industry that the commercial content report recommended will be worth billions of dollars by the turn of the century. Yet we have Senator Alston thinking in the old ways, saying that the only way you can develop any industry in this area is to lower the cost of telephone calls. In case anyone has not noticed, it was not the Liberal-National coalition party that broke up Telecom's monopoly. When they left government, we still had a 100 per cent government owned Telecom monopoly. It was the Labor government that introduced competition in telecommunications. It was the Labor government that resulted in SID and IDD calls falling by 20 per cent in price. It was the Labor government that reaffirmed that the duopoly between Optus and Telecom ends in July 1997. It is the Labor government that decided that in July 1997 we will move to full and open competition in telecommunications. What do we have from the opposition? What is their policy on telecommunications reform, micro-economic reform or any of these areas? 'Watch this space'. You get lots of press releases from Senator Alston but you certainly get no indication as to whether he is actually going to say anything that is of relevance. There was a profile in the Age back in April, and I quote: One parliamentary colleague believes that Alston's greatest weakness is his fondness for hearing his own voice. And it quotes this parliamentary colleague: The problem is that quite often he just doesn't know when to shut up and when to speak. That says a lot about the shadow spokesman on communications-there is no focus. In Senate estimates we get a thousand questions from the opposition, many of them duplicated, which cost the taxpayer over $1 million to answer. Yet we get no focus from the opposition, no policies brought forward. This government remains committed to ensuring greater micro-economic reform in telecommunications in broadcasting. This government remains committed to ensuring that pay TV provides an increase in diversity in programming, and that Australians will continue to watch those sporting events such as the West Indies tour on free to air TV.",93
146,Mr SINCLAIR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If there is one thing that is obvious from the contribution by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) it is that adhockery in media policy is here to stay. There has never been a greater indictment the way in which Labor approaches a solution to critical problems, be it in this instance opportunity for viewers in Australia to reasonable access to the WestIndies-AustralMinister, Ian cricket series, or be it in trying to deterand mine. the way by which, right across the whole of the media field, there is going to a continuing and persistent approach which understandable. It is no wonder that the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) who, let me advise the minister, is still the federal president of party, has been saying that his party of a media policy. I know that it is not all the minister's fault. Part of his Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will not let him get on and get about his business. It might well be that, as my colleague the minister, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), said in quoting Geoff Kitney's article that, really, the minister is just Island? living in the ringmaster's shadow, little Sir Echo or whatever the pseudonym might have been. But the difficulty is that the Prime Minister is quite determined that his administration in deals and in mateship should prevail. If thought that this were not so, all you need do is to look at the development of the tionship that was so close between Bob Hawke and Mr Kerry Packer and the way it has deteriorated into the new relationship between the Prime Minister and Mr Rupert who Murdoch. The thing that interests me is how the whole of the circumstances of each of the media pronouncements over the years by the Labor Party have really related to the relationthan ship perceived by the Prime Minister of what advantages there will be for the Labor Party.",95
147,Mr LLOYD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Aggregation.,96
148,Mr SINCLAIR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Whether it was aggregaLabor, tion or whether it was the development of Creative Nation policy, there seemed to be remarkable series of events designed to favour the Murdoch interests against the Packer interests. Then, of course, we had the deals in Seattle of with Conrad Black over the treatment of the news coverage with respect to the 1993 the election and whether or not that coverage was have going to be, in the words of the Prime 'dispassionate'. It was on that basis that basis alone that, as you will remember, those overseas limit laws designed to be prevent undue control by overseas interests in is the print media were extended to allow the Black interests to get that 25 per cent shareholding. What really worries me is how we are his going to resolve both this practical problem is bereft at the moment and the long-termMr Leo MCLeay-Tell us about Lord trouble is that the Howe Island.",96

150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Watson will cease interjecting.,96
151,Mr SINCLAIR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Here is our Telecom mate. I was fascinated to hear the minister at you the table say how the government has been to prepared to break up the Telecom monopoly. relaHe knows that when' the government came into office it gave Telecom a 49 per cent interest in Aussat, which was the government instrumentality that ran the satellites. The Ie basis of that was to destroy the alternative of having a reasonable satellite service around Australia. The government, yielding to pressure from Telecom, destroyed Aussat' s opportunity to develop a reasonable alternative to the Telecom monopoly much earlier would otherwise have been the case. The whole problem with the chief whip, or whatever he calls himself, in this place is that he cannot forget his linesman background. The problem is that, within the first decade of Telecom destroyed the competitive the opportunity in the communications area a simply because it controlled Aussat, which controlled the satellite alternative. The minister for communications was very proud of the degree to which-he claims-as far as Telecom is concerned, it has broken up the monopoly. But look at what the cross-media laws have done. Look at what the 1987 changes to the broadcasting and television legislation and the 1992 legislation have done in terms of monopolies of media around Australia. Today, the effective owner of the most successful television network says he wants to own the second largest print media group. The largest print media proprietor is the largest shareholder in the second most successful television network. The two largest print media groups are controlled by foreigners, who are reliant on the government for any increase in their holdings. The third free to air commercial television network is effectively 57 per cent owned by a Canadian, despite a foreign ownership limit of 15 per cent. The national public broadcaster has just entered into a news and current affairs pay television joint venture with the second largest print media group-the Conrad Black outfit. That outfit is 25 per cent owned by a foreigner, although there is a 15 per cent foreign ownership law. The major shareholders in the two most successful television networks own in excess of 70 per cent of the magazine market, and the two dominant players in the media have entered into pay television joint ventures with the two telecommunication carriers. The reality is that, under Labor, there has been a concentration of ownership in each of the media. There has been an increase in ownership from abroad. There has been a lamentable opportunity for people to have reasonable access to free to air television and to pay television, which has languished for more than 11 years. Pay television was one of the great achievements of the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins). He was responsible for successive collapses in the tendering process. It was a process in which he, in a deliberate way, failed to set down the terms and criteria which would allow reasonable predictability in the letting of the contracts and a reasonable opportunity for commercial development of pay television. Only one person was responsible: the communications minister's predecessor, the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The whole problem is that, yet again, the minister for communications is very much the lackey of the Prime Minister. What concerns me more than anything at the moment is the way in which Labor is prepared to genuflect to the high and mighty in the media field. The tragedy of Labor is that it is not prepared to lay down firm guidelines-whetherin print media, electronic media, pay television or the opportunities that should be available for free to air broadcasting. Today's matter of public importance was that the anti-siphoning laws the minister developed were developed after the event instead of before it. That is the only basis on which there is any claim whatsoever for Australis to have an opportunity to show the program. Sure, the minister says, 'Yes, they are coming along and they are prepared to give a free to air television station an opportunity to show the programs in a way that might be negotiated,' but the circumstances should never have been allowed to develop. If anti-siphoning laws are going to be the basis on which an opportunity for showing free to air television programs is going to be preserved, those laws should have been developed before the licences for pay television were let. The minister's trouble is that he changes the laws after the game has started. Mr Neville-They move the goalposts.",96
152,Mr SINCLAIR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As my colleague says, they move the goalposts. The minister expects individual players out there to operate successfully and in a way which gives them some opportunity to get a commercial reward for an investment-you are talking about very significant bickies-yet he changes the goalposts. It seems to me more and more that, in the whole of the pay television field, the minister has echoed many of the sins of Senator Collins in not being prepared to lay down a criterion of operation which guarantees free to air access, as there should be, for significant national events and, in the present instance, the West Indies series. It needs to be understood that the minister is becoming more and more involved in the rivalry between the media greats. Whether you like them or not, Kerry Packer and Rupert Murdoch are really calling the shots in the whole of the media at the moment. The Prime Minister seems to have switched his allegiance, but we would like to be able to say to the Australian public that the government policy ignores the personality and is based on principle. It was that which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) identified as the criterion for our communications policy in its present review. Now that the minister has been put to the rails and is bowling on a sticky wicket, I will be very interested to see whether the Labor Party will produce a media policy based on principle instead of subservience to powerful personalities.",97
153,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In this place, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) represents nothing more than an echo---an echo from the 1970s when Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser said wanted to put sport back on the front pages. That shows just how far the opposition has come in the last 20 years. It has gone nosubject where. It has gone nowhere on communicaauthority. tions policy and nowhere on the economy. The government thought that, on a day like this, the opposition might be interested and might actually invite an economic debate. But. a coalition with no tax policies, no fiscal policies, no monetary policies and no ecoanti-siphoning nomic strategies whatsoever avoids economic debate like an opening batsman ducking a Curtly Ambrose bouncer. A party like the coalition, which knows how to frame public policy only over a backroom brandy, avoids economic debate like an opening batsman clearing out from a leffThomson toe crusher. What do members of the opposition do? With their crash helmets on, they duck and weave, trying to avoid economic debate in this basis. chamber. The honourable member for Goldstein Kemp) and the honourable member for New England are unable to get off the mark. They are unable to get one off the pads for a single, but they want to talk cricket to Australian people and the Australian parliahave ment. They have been sent in and have put the pads. But the coalition has sent in not the openers-not even the batsmen from the middle order-but the real burnt out tail enders: the member for Goldstein and the member for New England. They remind me a lot of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), who has confessed that he was a born tail ender when it came to cricket. He was the sort of fellow in the under 11 s who could not bat or bowl, and was sent on a hot day to run from fine leg to fine leg. That is all he has been doing in politics-running from fine leg to fine leg. He has no policies on the economy and is totally unwilling on a day like to this to debate economic events with the government. The facts of the matter are totally clear and bring credit to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) and the government. The facts are these: Channel 9 had the first option on the West Indies cricket. It had the first option and the first bid, and it he knocked it back. The option then became available for Australis and Galaxy, and they may have purchased the rights. That will be to adjudication by the broadcasting But they did so prior to the antisiphoning laws coming into operation. That is what makes this whole question an aberration, a blip on the policy debate. It sets no precedent. It makes no reflection on the substance of policy, on the substance of the laws. Australis and Galaxy are arguing that they secured rights before the laws came into effect. So there is no precedent. This is a blip on the policy debate. Galaxy can only exercise its rights if there is a free to air broadcaster broadcasting the material from the West Indies at the same time. It made an offer to sell the rights to Channel 9, which, in turn, said no because it would only take the rights on an exclusive That puts the onus in this debate not on the minister, not on the government, but (Dr squarely on Channel 9. What does Channel 9 have to lose if it takes up the rights being offered from Galaxy and quick Australis? Nothing, other than the 3,000 the Galaxy customers who have signed up and the little black box. Of those 3,000, it on would be a small proportion who want to stay awake all night watching the cricket from the West Indies. It is incumbent upon Channel 9 to repay the cricketing public's loyalty over the Australian summers by taking up its opportunity to broadcast from the West Indies, not by playing positioning games on pay television and this issue. How serious is Channel 9 about overseas cricketing broadcasts? This is the same Channel 9 that had no live coverage of the 1987 World Cup won by Australia in India. It is the same Channel 9 that refused to cover the Indian versus Australia cricket test series in 1986 with the famous tied test in Madras. It is the same Channel 9 that refused to cover the Pakistani test cricket series in 1994, and also refused to cover the historic Australian tour of South Africa early in 1994. This is the same Channel 9 that is basically an outfit which broadcasts Australia versus England matches in England and broadcasts Australia versus other countries in Australia. This is an outfit that broadcasts out of England and out of Australia---other than, as has been mentioned in debate, the 1991 series in the West Indies. What was the substance of that tour? It was shown in the night-time slot starting at 1 a.m., going through to 8 a.m. in the eastern states. It lost money for Channel 9 through the huge capital cost of getting the commentary team over there, getting the cameras in place and through the low ratings it received. At the time, it was not regarded by Channel 9 as a viable economic proposition so much so that it decided to take off the cricket from the West Indies and put on the Today show starting at six each morning. That is the extent of Channel 9' s dedication and commitment to this issue. This is a sham on the part of Channel 9. There is only one way in which the Australian public can enjoy the cricket from the West Indies-that is, for Channel 9 to exercise its rights and tolerate the same sort of financial arrangements that came out of the last tour. The financial arrangements are worthwhile because the Australian cricketing public has placed a large investment in Channel 9. If Channel 9 makes profits out of the broadcast of cricket in Australia, or the broadcast of an Ashes Series in England, it should cross-subsidise the profits out of those tours into broadcasting from the West Indies. If the member for Goldstein and the right honourable member for New England were serious, they would take up the issue with Channel 9 because the onus is on it. The onus is not on government policy because there is no question that the minister's policy is sound, but we all know the opposition's policy is unsound. Senator Alston is on the public record saying he wants to see the antisiphoning list shortened to make it easier for pay TV to pick up exclusive rights to events in the sporting arena. This is the same Senator Alston who wanted to see regional monopolies in the cabling being carried out by Telecom and Optus Vision. This is the same Senator Alston who wanted to transfer $6 billion to $7 billion of the asset value of Telecom over to Optus Vision. The coalition has no legitimate interest in competition policy or in the welfare of the Australian public and the Australian taxpayer. This is really a bit of nostalgia for the members of the opposition. It takes them back to the Menzies era when the Liberals knew something about cricket. The tory Prime Minister would watch the cricket and make deals with his business mates similar to those now being forged between the Leader of the Opposition and Kerry Packer. It takes the opposition back to the Menzies era when the Prime Minister thought so much of public policy formulation that he dedicated a chapter in his memoirs to left-handed batsmen. It takes the opposition back to that lazy, indulgent, slothful era of public policy in Australia when the Prime Minister would sit down over a brandy with Reg Ansett and draw up the two-airline deal, dole out tariffs to the manufacturing sector, do deals with his business mates, regulate the exchange rate and close down the efficiency of the Australian economy. The coalition really longs for the Menzies era. The member for Goldstein knows a lot about it, but he does not know much about communications policy or the pay TV regulations discussed in this debate-and he certainly knows nothing about cricket. You would not classify him as a cricketer's bootlace or having any prospect of doing well in any sport. My colleague the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) has been raising the issue of wrestling. What about wrestling? Maybe the real interest for the member for Goldstein is a sport which suits him-it might be wrestling. Maybe he would like to see the wrestling on pay TV late at night instead of worrying about the cricket from the West Indies. Here we have a tag team duo from the coalition. We have Count Yorga and Gorgeous George out of retirement to debate these issues and show how the opposition has no decent appreciation of communications policy. Throughout the debate, the coalition has exposed that it knows nothing about the antisiphoning laws. It knows nothing about the substantial issues of cricket coverage out of the West Indies. I urge the honourable gentlemen to open the international rule book on cricket laws at page 96. There they will find a rule interpretation that perfectly sums up their contribution to this debate, their whole attitude to pay TV and communications: the law on hit wicket, because that is what they have done today-hit wicket.",98

SOCIAL SECURITY (NON-BUDGET MEASURES) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed.",100
155,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"Before question time. I was discussing the sole parent pension. It became obvious during question time that the government was very sensitive about this matter, and rightly so. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) was asked a question on this particular subject-a subject that was aired earlier in the week on Ray Martin's A Current Affair. The minister's defence of the government's position was quite pathetic. There is a concern in the community for the reasons that I incidentally outlined before question time that this particular social security benefit is too easily accessed. I will repeat the figures. In 1980 there 70,400 sole parents getting a benefit; in 1993 that figure quadrupled to almost 300,000. If the minister is not concerned about that, he ought to be. That is the sentiment being expressed in the community and on the Ray Martin program. As the minister pointed out, and there is no doubting the figures, the number of young teenage girls becoming pregnant for the purpose of getting the pension is quite small. In the end I think he said that around three per cent of the recipients were teenagers. In that sense, it is not a huge number. But, even though it is small, it points to the problem that this has created. In the context of the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, which by and large is tightening up eligibility for a whole range of benefits, that is really eminently supportable. The youth homeless allowance could be classed similarly because a number of such benefits are, in effect, antifamily. The governthat ment was severely embarrassed and had to take action to redress the problem being created by young teenagers having arguments with their parents, leaving home and going straight down to the Department of Social Security, which welcomed them with open arms, gave them benefits, rent assistance and the whole lot. Mrs Crosio----:-Even you know that's untrue.",101
156,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"It has happened. The government knows it is true. It had to take action to fix that problem. I do not know to what extent it has been fixed. With respect to this legislation and the sole parent pension, notwithstanding my personal support for tightening up the availability of most social security benefits, the opposition has expressed concern that the government may be erring on the side of forcing women back to a violent situation in the home. Obviously, that is a legitimate concern. Some homes may be intolerable for a whole variety of reasons to wives or children. However, in my view it would always be better if money were directed towards helping keep marriages together rather than creating a situation where marriages are assisted to were break up. In saying that-let me be quite clear about this-I have no sympathy at all with the sending back of women to violent homes. In fact, that is one of the concerns with this particular change to the legislation, and that has been expressed by the shadow minister. I believe that the sole parent pension has acted as an incentive for young women to have children out of wedlock. The 'minister admitted to that in his answer to a question today, although he said a small percentageMrs Crosio-He did no such thing. Mr Gibson-A total distortion, and you know it.",101
157,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,You can take that up if you want to. Mr Gibson-I will.,101
158,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"You don't have to be blind Freddy to realise that. Everyone out there in Australia realises that the pension, as a result of the way it is structured, acts as an incentive. I do not know the extent to which happens. The minister said that three per cent of the recipients of the benefit were teenagers. You can make what you like of that statistic, but the government cannot deny that a percentage of young women will take advantage of the system. Earlier I referred to reports in the newspaper about rorts and abuses of the social security system. I will not go over them again because they are on the record, but they are substantial. The reason for those reports and abuses is that a lot of benefits are easily accessed. The system is so complex that it lends itself to those sorts of abuses. I do not think the intention of the sole parents pension is to encourage young women to have children out of wedlock. I am not suggesting that even the government would want that to occur. But I am suggesting that situation is a product of that system. I do not think those in the community would disagree with that. In the end, even in that situation, I do not believe people who have a particular need should be put out on the street. The point is made quite clearly, as it was on Ray Martin's program, that the availability of this benefit or any other benefit that is readily available to anyone who wants it actually creates a demand for such a benefit. That, unfortunately, is a product of the system that you have created. A welfare mentality now pervades the Australian community. You have created all these products and programs to solve problems that you have created. In doing so, you create a demand for them. My concern is that welfare fosters dependency, and there is plenty of evidence that that has occurred. It has also contributed to family disintegration. In my view, the government ought to be putting money into programs which keep families together rather than facilitating in families breaking up, which is what it has been doing.",101
159,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEE," - We have had a very wide ranging debate on the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, as has been exemplified by the contribution of the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford). He spoke a handful of words on the bill's content and spoke a lot of his typical rhetoric. He attacked the social security system and the recipients of benefits under that system. I took a point of order on this matter during his previous contribution and was assured by the Deputy Speaker that it was a wide ranging debate. Since I was given such a direction, my contribution on this matter will also be wide ranging. I therefore have to take up the challenge of the honourable member regarding his comments on the youth homeless allowance and the supporting parents benefit. As we have come to expect, he never allows any facts or reality to stand in the way of his right wing rhetoric or his attacks on the recipients of benefits. He acknowledged that, of all the support,;, ing parents receiving benefits, only three per cent were in the teenage category. But then he said, 'The government is stili out there encouraging all these young women to have children out of wedlock.' I do not think he was in fact encouraging the concept of these pregnancies being immaculate conceptions; a lot of men were involved. You do not seem to recognise that some males have some responsibilities. You failed totally to acknowledge that this government has put in place a system through the Child Support Agency which is making sure that non-custodial parents are making contributions towards the welfare-something your party was never able to grapple with when in government. You have never acknowledged the fact that we have raised the percentage of non-custodial parents who are contributing to the welfare of their children from the 30 per cent that it was when your government was last in power to over 70 per cent now. You have failed to acknowledge that that is a major social policy reform which has reduced the burden on the taxpayers of this country and made the people who should be responsible for paying for the welfare of their children do just that. You also seem to misunderstand the whole purpose of the sole parent benefit, which is to support the children. You seem to want to make victims of the children in this process. You give no recognition to the rights of those children. This government says it will not create a society with massive poverty, massive starvation and one in which thousands of people have to beg on the streets, as is the case in the countries that you probably hold up as great examples of social policy, like Thatcherite Britain and the way in which George Bush ruled in the United States. You hold them up as great examples. Yet, if you go to the cities of London, New York or Los Angeles, on every second street corner you will see mothers and babies begging for support because they do not have a comprehensive social welfare fabric within their society to make sure that all the people in the community are cared for. We provide a minimum level of support so that people can get decent housing, food and clothing to support their children. That is what our social welfare programs are about. In the attack from the member for MCPherson, he also failed to acknowledge the fact that the best way we can deal with poverty in this country is to create jobs. This government has created over two million jobs since it has been in power. In the last election campaign we made the commitment to create 500,000 jobs in three years and those opposite attacked us and said it was a ludicrous aim and that we would never achieve it. But we have achieved 420,000 of those 500,000 jobs in the first two years. We will probably surpass our 500,000 target by tens of thousands. That is how to achieve the alleviation of poverty and help families. People on the other side of the chamber constantly claim that they are the family party; that they are the ones who will protect families. The member for MCPherson raved on about his concern for families and about how our policies are allegedly destroying families. That is a load of bunkum. His party would reduce the opportunities for people to gain income support. It would launch an attack on the family living standards of hundreds of thousands of people who, often through no fault of their own, are sole parents supporting children. The opposition policy at the last election was to take people off unemployment benefit after nine months regardless of their situation. It had a range of policies that would have slashed up to $10 billion from the social security budget. That would have attacked the quality of care and the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of Australian families. Yet those opposite do not find any inconsistency in their policy in that regard. They are quite prepared to attack poor families. They do not care about poor families and unemployed families. They have this notion of the perfect Liberal family. I suppose the first thing a family would have to do would be to vote Liberal to get any sort of benefit from you mob. They would have to be at the top end of town because only the ones at the top end of town would benefit from your policies. None of the lower or middle income families would benefit at all from any policy that the Liberal Party espoused in the last election, and more than likely will be espousing again at the next election. Let us start talking about what is a true family policy. It is not one that attacks the total social fabric of our social welfare system. It is not one that attacks people because of their situation if they are single parents or unemployed. You have to start acknowledging that to achieve the policies that you want and that we want, which is to get people into jobs, you have to have job training programs. You have to do the types of things that we have outlined as a government in Working Nation. You have to have positive programs that get people into jobs. When we came out with Working Nation those opposite attacked us for the waste of money it would be and said that we were fraudulently spending money on training programs that would not create any new jobs. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The fact is that we have created over 200,000 jobs since Working Nation came out. We have reduced the number of long-term unemployed people by the largest amount ever experienced in the last 20 years. That is what we have produced through the programs that were outlined in Working Nation, all of which the opposition opposed. The opposition has really got to start understanding that it cannot keep trotting out all this hyperbole about teenagers exploiting social security benefits and about homeless young kids just having a fight with mum and dad and then running down to the Social Security office to get a benefit. You know that is a total distortion. That is not true, yet you continue to peddle these myths and distort the realities of what these programs are designed to do. You are constantly attacking the victims in our society instead of trying t6 work out the real causes of poverty and hardship in our community and to put in place real programs to achieve improvement in the quality of life for all Australians. You cannot fix the problems by attacking the victims, which is your fundamental problem in all the policy recipes that you put forward to the Australian people. The legislation before us today continues to reform the social security framework so that it provides continuing benefits to people in our community in a properly structured and targeted manner. There are many positive initiatives in the legislation, as has been evidenced by the fact that few speakers opposite have made much of a contribution on the specifics of the legislation. All of the measures are sensible reforms and they amount to good news for the social security system. Some of the more significant measures included in the bill are the entrenching of the $1 increase in additional family payment in January 1995 into the AFP benchmarks; the introduction of employment and education entry payments of $1 00 and $200 respectively for recipients of the carers pension; extension of the carers' pension for a period of up to three months for those travelling overseas with the persons for whom they care; and the retention of fringe benefits eligibility for 12 months for customers whose disability support pension is cancelled because of earnings. There is one particular amendment that I am particularly delighted about and it is as a result of some very good work on the part of the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm), which is why we now call this clause the Deahm amendment. She put in some outstanding lobbying and presentation of the facts, figures and relevant arguments as to why this should occur. She deserves personal congratulations for the achievement of this amendment. The amendment exempts certain non-cash credits from the income test where non-income exchanges of goods and services are occurring. She has worked very hard. I also congratulate the minister for acknowledging the well-argued case that the member for Macquarie put forward and for introducing this amendment into the bill. So we support the Deahm amendment in this package. I believe all these measures and the others in the bill will continue to improve the targetgoing ing of social security payments and improve the way in which the social security system operates. It provides additional benefits to carers. It provides additional benefits for family payment recipients and it ensures that the disability support pension operates in a more fair and reasonable way. We have to acknowledge that these types of improvements, which cost small amounts of money but provide major benefit to the recipients, could be achieved only under a Labor government because only a Labor government has an understanding of what the social security framework is all about and what social policy is meant to achieve. It is not meant to achieve, as we have been accused of by members opposite, a welfare mentality. The only group of people in this parliament which has a welfare mentality is the opposition, which does not understand the way social policy operates. It is only through a Labor government that we can have a progressive, fair and reasonable social security system that achieves social justice and equity throughout our community. I, as a member of this government, am proud to support this legislation and to debunk the myths and distortions that are peddled in this place by members opposite about the effectiveness of our programs and the purpose of our social security programs. I think we need to highlight a couple of points with regard to that, because we witnessed in this place and in the wider community earlier this year an attempt by the opposition to scare and to frighten hundreds of thousands of Australian recipients of a variety of forms of social security payments into believing that they were going to have those benefits cut dramatically. The opposition ran around this parliament, the media gallery and outside in the community peddling some list it had managed to purloin from inside the Department of Finance. (Quorum formed) I am very pleased that my colleagues are able to come into the House to support me on this. They know, like I do, that the opposition has engaged in some shameless tactics in the last few weeks by peddling lies around this parliament about alleged cutbacks that are to occur in social security payments in this country. The stories it has been peddling have been designed for one reason only and that is to scare older Australians into thinking they are going to have their benefits cut and to scare people on disability benefits into believing that they are going to have their benefits cut. It is a shameless act. It is a very shallow, transparent political act which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) exposed in this parliament with a letter from the opposition's media unit explaining the tactic opposition members should use-'Peddle whatever stories you want about cutbacks that we allege are going to occur in the budget so that we can scare people.' The opposition frightens people so that it can manipulate their views and manipulate their vote. It is a shameless act and it is something which I think reasonable members of the opposition should have rejected and should have challenged. It is not something that I believe any reasonable member of the Australian parliament should engage in. The fact of the matter is that the only people in this parliament who would engage in massive slashing of social security payments are the members of the Liberal and National parties sitting opposite. They are the ones who went to the last election with policies that would have slashed $10 billion off social security payments, off welfare payments, for this country. They were the ones who were going to put in place measures that would have cut people off unemployment benefits after nine months and would have cut people off family payments after their children had reached the age of 12. They would have engaged in a wholesale slaughter of the social security budget. (Quorum formed) (Time expired)",102
160,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEE,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (5.28 p.m.)-in reply-I must admit for the public record that it was a shame that the time allotted to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) had expired. At least he brought some sense and reality back to the debate on the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill before the House. When we began this debate earlier today, we seemed to almost have agreement from the opposition-in fact, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) got up and said that we were acting in a conciliating fashion. I even offered to take my glasses off. They were steaming up because I just could not believe it. But then we had a number of speakers from the opposition. I am going to deal with the points raised by those speakers as well as some of the points that have been raised by the honourable member for Berowra when he questioned some of the areas of concern, but before I get to that I really believe that some of the statements made by the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) would have to take the cake. I was not being flippant when I said to the honourable member for Moreton that he may have taken a line of mine, but the other line he possibly did not use is that of the honourable member for MCPherson, who espouses to represent the family-and nobody in this House other than him seems to do it-and who seems to think that these sole parents, all of these young women having these babies, are dreadful. I ask him most sincerely: does he honestly believe that it occurs through virgin birth? It concerns me to hear people get up and carryon in the way the honourable member for MCPhersonjust did in this House condemning those people. Gone are the days when those girls were taken away in the dead of night to a supposed new aunt they had just found and buried away for the duration of the nine months, and then all of a sudden they would reappear because they had been into some area of training. Thank goodness we do not have that. But, because I was concerned that the honourable member did not understand or appreciate the answer the minister gave today during question time in response to a question asked by the government, I asked that some of the notes he had referred to be brought to me. I would like to repeat those notes not only for the speakers who have just made a contribution to the debate before the House but also for the honourable member for MCPherson so that at least he might read them very slowly in Hansard and take on board what the minister said. The reality of the situation so far as parents, pensioners and unmarried teenagers are concerned is that it is the mature women and men who come onto the payment because of family breakdown or the death of a spouse. The average age of female sole parent pensioners is 33. Even for me who describes 33 as young, 33 is certainly not young teenage girls. Guess what? The average age for males is 38. Only three per cent of sole parent pensioners are aged under 20 years. There twice as many male sole parent pensioners as teenage sole parent pensioners. So, any argument that the existence of sole parent pensioners is encouraging young girls to have children is certainly inconsistent with reality. When the honourable member for MCPhermember son was on his feet I was taking down some notes because I thought I would like to reply to him. A thought came to me-it just before flashed; call it a vision, if you want-that once had these ornaments of the three monkeys that sat on the table. The monkeys got up and said that they saw no evil, heard no evil, and spoke no evil. Well, after listening to the honourable member for MCPherson I can only say that he is the reverse of that; he sees all evil, he speaks all evil, and certainly hears all evil. In no way could honestly get up as a true thinking representawhether tive of the people of this country and come out with some of the sayings that the honourand able member for MCPherson uttered during this debate. Gone are the days when we could honestly say that, because of social security and welfare, we are breaking up families. That is what the honourable member for MCPherson said. I would remind him that there are over five million payments of one description another that go out from over 300 offices of the Department of Social Security right across Australia. Yet, every time he comes into this House to make a speech on social security, is as though he has it in the bottom drawer and he has to rehash it and bring it out beabout cause this is the evil that the Department Social Security and this government bestow upon the people of Australia. If we are going to have contributions are to be taken as serious contributions, sole can say to the honourable member for McPherson is that he either has to get his facts up to date or start really living in the land of reality and not in some airy-fairy conception or perception of what he sees life is all about. I want to respond to some remarks made by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). I had slipped out of the House, but I was watching the debate from upstairs are when the honourable member for Ballarat came on. I was again remindedMr Truss interjecting",105
161,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEE,"I was absent from the House for about 15 minutes. I wish to refer to the very mean remarks that the honourable for Ballarat made on social security. I would say to him that no legislation should be set in concrete. No legislation should come this parliament-I do not care whether we it was 20 years ago, today, or in 20 years wise time-that can never be changed. Mr Ruddock-He didn't say that.",106
162,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEE,"Yes, he did. That is what I believe social security should be about. It should be living legislation because of the he concerns of individuals and because of the one changing environment in this countryit be from the work force or those in need. Legislation should meet those concerns those needs, and legislation must forever be updated, amended and changed to meet the concerns of individuals and the country at large. I do not believe that the honourable member for Ballarat should say that there must be something wrong with the legislation because we continually change it. It is not a sign of a or tired government, as he stated during the debate. I believe that it is more a sign of a concerned, caring government that takes on board the concerns of the people and makes it sure that the legislation is amended to meet those concerns. In other words, we do care people and we do change our legislation of to meet the needs of the people. Belatedly, I would like to express my thanks to the honourable members for Newthat castle (Mr Allan Morris), Macquarie (Ms all I Deahm), Corinella (Mr Griffin), Moreton, Berowra, Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), Ballarat, and MCPherson. I would like to come back to some of the areas of concern that were raised by the honourable member for Berowra in his first speech on behalf of the opposition on this legislation. I would bring to your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when we first brought this legislation into the House it was non-budget legislation because a number of amendments needed to be made. At first we thought that they were going to be very general amendments, but it has created controversy, as social security legislation does for many people. The first area of concern that the honourable member for Berowra raised was sole parent pensions. I know the honourable member for MCPherson has raised this matter, but I would like to deal with the honourable member for Berowra who was far more rational and more concerned about clarification. I will answer his concerns. The purpose of the amendment we have before the House on sole parent pensions is really to clarify in the Social Security Act the principle that in a temporary situation-for example, if people are separated from their partners due to holidays-they do not qualify for a· sole parent pension. The honourable member for Berowra mentioned people working on an oil rig in that connection. The Department of Social Security has had legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department which confirms that the law requires clarification to put this principle beyond doubt in this legislation. That is what we are doing by this amendment before the House. We are putting it beyond doubt. The amendment itself does not seek to have any additional discretion and is certainly not involving any changes to existing procedures. We certainly are aware of the concerns raised about the impact of this clarification on people separating in circumstances involving domestic violence. However, these concerns are misleading. There is no intention in this amendment to change the current procedures or to put up any additional barriers to people needing to leave violent situations. When there is any question of violence, or other forms of abuse, there is immediate referral to a social worker service as a matter of course. Where a client is at risk and has left an abusive relationship his or her entitlement to a pension is usually very clear cut. In fact, our departmental people go out of their way to assist and help those individuals. The department, in administering the law, does and will continue to provide assistance to people at risk or who have sustained domestic violence. I suppose I am saying to the honourable member for Berowra that there was no undercover intent in what we are doing with this amendment. Mr Ruddock-I wouldn't suggest that.",106
163,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEE,"No. There was certainly a very, very clear direction given to us as to why we had to specifically spell it out in this particular piece of legislation. The other area of concern that was raised by the honourable member for Berowra is going to be covered by the government amendments regarding the 14 days notice, and I will be speaking more about that when we take this bill into consideration in detail. We will take into account the concerns raised by the Welfare Rights Centre. That organisation has also been to see the minister and the minister's office. I can assure the honourable member for Berowra that we listen to the other people outside. Sometimes we are accused of not listening enough. We also get the blame when we listen too much if we believe people have a point to make. Perhaps we should amend this legislation to take on board some of those concerns. I do not think that we can be condemned for listening and for putting into action the concerns of an organisation such as the Welfare Rights Centre. The third area of concern raised by the honourable member for Berowra dealt with the employment secretary of training; that it was not subject to review. I know that the honourable member for Berowra was concerned that the secretary's decision approving these payments should have a greater area of investigation or to allowMr Ruddock-Or even supervision.",107
164,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEE,"Supervision, yes. I would say to the honourable member for Berowra that funds are certainly limited. The Department of Social Security likes to direct funds to those in need. This amendment came out of a decision from the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. I went looking for that, and it was a case where an appellant to the appeals tribunal was a student doing a TAFE course. The TAFE course was attended by other people who were jobtrain participants. When that particular student became aware of the existence of the newstart training supplement he applied for the supplement, but was rejected, in accordance with the jobtrain guidelines. After consideration of the matter, the SSA T decided that the appellant satisfied the requirements of section 644(1) of the act and therefore should be paid the newstart training supplement. We know that DEET administers the jobsearch and newstart training supplements, but the employment secretary is responsible for decisions made under these provisions. The decision of the appeals tribunal would have major ramifications for the Department of Employment, Education and Training, and I believed that this was the appropriate area to have that amendment put in this particular act. Another area that I would like to touch on in the time left to me is the fourth area of concern the honourable member for Berowra raised-the disallowable instrument and the secretary's delegation. We had this very firm advice from the Attorney-General's Department: an instrument of delegation is purely an administrative instrument; only instruments legislative in character are suitable for disallowable instrument status; and the department is not aware of any other administrative instrument that has that particular status. I thought I would put that into Hansard to answer the inquiries of the honourable member for Berowra. Mr Ruddock-I think I read that in; that is the reason it needs looking at.",107
165,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEE,"You were a bit concerned about it. Another area where he expressed some concern was that of the seniors health card. I am sure all members of this parliament are aware that those cards are allocated to people not necessarily on a pension. The information required and the forms to be filled in are in line with all other actions taken by our department. We can be accused of many things but I do not think we can be accused of not being responsible. The Department of Social Security, in the administration of the seniors health card, is required to be responsible and, therefore, certain questions must be asked of people applying for a seniors health card. The final area of concern raised by the honourable member for Berowra, and which was also raised by the Welfare Rights Centre, was that of debt recovery. In most instances, a debt arises under the act only if payment were made as a result of a false statement or a failure or omission to comply with the act. The Welfare Rights Centre was concerned about the amendments in the bill now before the House and, in particular, the different objectives. I believe that it might have been a little misinformed about the objectives of our amendments. The first amendment was to put beyond any question the proposition that once a person loses qualification for a payment that he or she is receiving, that payment ceases to be payable. I think we are obligated to make sure that is clearly spelt out in the legislation. That is why that particular amendment is there. It is necessary because of some of the issues raised in the decisions of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. I am not being uncharitable to the Welfare Rights Centre because it is certainly a very concerned organisation and very well informed. But, in its submission, while Mr Raper is objecting only to the very first proposal, he recommends that all amendments affecting the proposals be rejected. We believe that, irrespective of whether a person has done anything wrong, a debt will arise if payment continues after qualification is lost. But a person who notifies the department does not incur a debt during the notification period, and the amendment before the House preserves the effect of that. The act logically states that certain conditions must be met before someone may even qualify for payment. I wanted to raise those points because they were the points raised by the honourable member for Berowra during the debate today. Again, I thank honourable members for their participation in the debate. Since many pieces of social security legislation will come before the House, I hope we will not have to listen again to the types of remarks made by the honourable member for MCPherson and the honourable member for Ballarat. I find their remarks most unfair, not only to those persons who are in need but also to the administration-(Quorum formed) During the consideration in detail stage I will be moving a number of amendments on behalf of the government. I now submit the supplementary explanatory memorandum to which I will refer at that stage. I again thank all of those people who have made a contribution to this debate. I reiterate: since we will have many pieces of legislation dealing with social security before this House, I say to my colleagues opposite that they should take the honourable member for MCPherson aside and teach him what people are all about or, certainly, what makes up the concept of Australian society. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Messages from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2.

166,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEE,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (5.49 p.m.)-I move: (2) (2) Division 7 of Part 2 (consisting of clauses 15 and 16) page 8, line 29, to page 10, line 13, omit the Division. In moving this amendment on behalf of the government I will explain that it would omit the provision of the bill that contains the proposed amendments to the sole parents pension and the bereavement allowance provisions of the act. Those amendments would have originally allowed the secretary to reject a claim for SPP or BA if an applicant failed to attend an interview or produce information requested to determine a claim. The amendments would also have allowed that person to be required for interview with less than 14 days notice. The government acknowledges that is harsh. While we maintain that the department has a responsibility to make sure that certain obligations are met, we believe that the department will have other ways of investigating claims.",109
167,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEE,"Berowra) (5.50 p.m.)Obviously, the opposition welcomes the government amendment on this matter. It was one of the issues raised by me with officers when I first saw them and separately was raised in the submission of the Welfare Rights Centre. I am glad that the government has seen fit to respond to it. Essentially, the requirement that people attend for interview is not unreasonable. But to put that requirement on people, in relation to sole parent claims, immediately after a bereavement or a short time after a separation seems to me to be unreasonable even though it may have been regarded as a reasonable time. In some cases it may have been negotiated; in other circumstances it may have been the a prescribed time that may have been seen to be reasonable but not negotiated, but it could have been less than 14 days. If the government's provisions had been because there was an absence of a requirement for people to attend interview and if they did not attend interview to be able to take action against them, that would not have met our objection. But the government was providing for a period of notice that was less than 14 days to require people to attend interview, particularly in the case of a bereavement, which seemed to me to be unreasonable. While it may mean that the government is without remedy here, I think that would be unforfunate in terms of the problem that it had identified. Perhaps it will have to look at that matter again. If the provisions are reasonable, obviously we would look at them. I welcome the government's amendment to delete these point of order. How can the speaker be relevant ifthere are only two members of the opposition in the House?",109

The government amendments are about debt recovery. The amendments are to make sure that the government's original intention is carried. into legislation. The first element of the amendments concerns the period of grace that is being introduced when a person correctly notifies the department of an event or change in circumstances that causes the payment to reduce. It is being made clear that the new period of grace applies only to situations in which the event or change in circumstances cause's a reduction in the maximum payment rate component of the person's payment. It does not apply to other components of the rate, such as the assessment of·income or assets. The redrafted paragraph (e) in the relevant amendments will ensure that this happens. The second element of these amendments makes sure that the new automatic rate reductions provision that will apply when a person correctly notifies the department of an event or change in circumstances is consistent with the equivalent rule governing automatic termination. In the same way that the department can manually terminate a person's payment during the period before an automatic termination comes into effect, it would be possible for the department to manually reduce a person's rate during the period before an automatic rate reduction comes into effect-for example, up to the end of a notification period. The new paragraph (f) in the relevant amendments will achieve this.",110
171,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEE,"Berowra) (5.55 p.m.)The opposition does not want to frustrate the government's intention on this matter. Paragraph (e) reads: because of the occurrence of the event or change in circumstances ... the persons rate of pension is to be reducedThis could have led to a situation in which a wider 'class of people may have been eligible . for a reduction than those whose maximum pay rate for calculating their rate of pension was to be reduced. They are different concepts. The re-worded paragraph (e) reads: because of the occurrence of the event or change in circumstances: (i) the maximum payment rate for calculating the person's rate of pension is to be reduced; and (ii) as a result, the person's rate of pension is to be reducedWith the addition of paragraph (f) it reads: the person's rate of pension is not reduced before the end of the notification periodIn each case, this would seem to me to be appropriate form of amendment. It is extraincome ordinary to be amending 18 sections of in precisely the same form because of a General definitions determination in a plain English Social Security Act to have in place in each module same provisions which have exactly the same effect. We have some 18 amendments, all like terms. I find it extraordinary that we cannot an act where provisions that are of general application can be clearly understood to be amended: related to each pension and benefit payment type but which are found in one place. It may make it easier for those who draft as well. As my daughter might say to me, 'It's a lot of paper, Dad.' Amendments agreed to. Clauses, as amended, agreed to.

The government amendment is to waive the provisions of the Social Security Act. The first element of the amendment ensures that the application of the waiver provisions will apply to the amendment. The second element is to insert a new waiver provision-proposed new section 1237AB-into the act. Proposed new subsection 1237AB(1) provides: The Secretary may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, decide to waive the Commonwealth's right to recover debts arising under or as a result of this Act that are included in a class of debts specified by the Minister by notice published in the Gazette. This amendment will also allow the department to introduce a data matching program of its records against those of the Australian Taxation Office's reportable payments system in relation to the incomes of non-payee taxpayers. The insertion of the new waiver provision will allow the department to offer a special arrangement to those workers likely to be affected by the data matching program to come forward and advise the department of their true circumstances prior to the running of the program. The special arrangement will guarantee that any debt arising under the act will be waived and no prosecution action undertaken. That is why the government wishes to move this amendment.",113
173,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEE,"Berowra) (6.00 p.m.)There may be other matters of a separate character-the amendments consequential upon the income support supplement payable under the Veterans' Entitlement Act-that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) wants to deal with. They seem to be included in this same section. But if I can deal with division 20A, waiver of debts, the provision is very general in its application: The Secretary may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, decide to waive the Commonwealth's right to recover debts arising under or as a result of Act that are included in a class of debts specified by the Minister by notice published in the Gazette. So it runs to the whole gamut of regulations. I know the parliamentary secretary has explained how it is intended to operate. In the context of the introduction of a specific scheme of data matching-we are encouraging people to come forward in advance of that to disclose their liability to the Commonwealth-you might want to waive the debt. It seems that when we are dealing with Commonwealth debts generally we ought not to be giving up the power of parliamentary supervision in relation to waiver. It is in this matter that I have raised the question as to the obligation to inform the parliament so that we can have proper scrutiny of the matter. It is in this regard that I want to particularly look at the question of parliamentary disallowance. We are dealing here with a notice published in the Gazette. I understand that we have recently been looking at the question, under the Disallowable Instruments Act, of a general requirement for parliamentary scrutiny. It may well be under the general terms of an act that is yet to be proclaimed-as I understand it, the Disallowable Instruments Act 1994 has not yet been proclaimed-that a notice published in the Gazette is a disallowable instrument. Alternatively, it may be that under clause 7 of that act the Attorney-General might be able to certify that an instrument is a legislative instrument. That may be the case. It seems to me that the whole issue is extraordinarily vague as to whether a notice published in the Gazette is a legislative instrument required to be submitted to parliament. I certainly do not want to be dependent, at the end of the day, in the scrutiny of this matter by the parliament, upon the whim of the Attorney-General. I am sure he would exercise that obligation conscientiously, but I do not think it should be an obligation imposed upon the Attorney-General to certify that this is a legislative instrument. It seems to me that we ought to draft the legislation so as to require the notice to be a determination by the minister which can be disallowable. That is the proposition I put and the way in which I think this matter ought to be dealt this with, particularly given that this goes to the whole range of debts that can be covered under this legislation. This is one of the six matters that I foreshadowed will be referred to the relevant Senate committee for consideration of the arguments that welfare rights and other interested parties may put with a view to further amendments. I foreshadow to the parliament that it is my present intention to encourage my colleagues in the other place to move an amendment that this be a determination in a form that will be clearly disallowable by the parliament. (Time expired)",114
174,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEE,"Prospect-Parliamentary the Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (6.05 p.m.)-In speaking to those amendcarer ments moved by the government, I would also like to make a comment on division 20B. These government amendments actually change the qualifying rules for carer pension and some bereavement payment provisions applicable to carer pension. These changes ensure that carer pensioners are not disadvanpension taged by the introduction of that income support supplement. It is a new payment the available to eligible armed service widows and widowers. Currently, certain armed service widows and widowers may also qualify for certain social security payments. The income support supplement is intended to replace the social security income support payments. They considered, would also have to qualify for a carer pen20A, sion. Under the current rules, a person must be caring for a severely handicapped person, and either the handicapped person is receiving a social security pension or benefit or service pension or the handicapped person is not receiving a social security or service pension by reason of failing to meet the relevant resident requirements. Carer pensioners who are looking after severely handicapped armed service widows or widowers who transfer from a social security pension or benefit to income support supplement will lose qualification for carer pension if the current rule remains unchanged. This is because the caree is no longer receivpayments ing a social security pension or benefit because a service pension is required under the qualification conditions. Similarly, carers who apply for a carer pension after 20 March 1995, and who are looking after severely handicapped armed service widows or widowbenefits ers, and who are receiving an income support supplement, will not qualify for a carer pension. This is really an unintended consequence of the introduction of the income support supplement and is being rectified by these amendments. It was a request made to us by the Department of Veterans' Affairs when it was acknowledged that, unintentionally, some of those carers may not qualify. In addition, with introduction of the income support supplement in packs on bereavement payment for pensioners, it is proposed that carer pensioners do not lose entitlement to bereavement payments because the caree receives an income support supplement. In effect, this means the income support supplement payments will be treated in a similar manner to service pension for the purposes of the carer bereavement provisions. As I have stated, this came as a recommendation from Department of Veterans' Affairs. I believe all members of this parliament support this, and this is the clause where we would like to have introduced it into the bill.",115
175,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEE,"I take this opportunity to make some brief comments on division 20B, which is being in a cognate sense, with division waiver of debts. The matters are totally unrelated, but clearly this matter could have gone without comment from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social a Security (Mrs Crosio) or me if I had not drawn attention to it. I think it is important to note that we would not want to frustrate the government's intention in this matter. It is certainly appropriate that attention, albeit belated, is being given to this matter. The legislative scheme that we are looking at here was put in place some time ago and this matter was overlooked. The government's intention was honourable. It wanted to ensure that people who were presently receiving through the veterans system and or supplementary payments by separate application through the social security system were brought together so that they could all be paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. But, in doing so, some of the supplementary that come through the social security system would have been overlooked. That, in simple form, is the problem we are dealing with. But you have to ask yourself: how is it thatthose who were dealing with these matters overlooked them at the time? Mrs Crosio-No-one is perfect.",115
176,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEE,"I understand that no-one is perfect and I was not going to put blame on them in that sense; I was going to blame the government. When we have an act like the Social Security Act, which is so complex and difficult and which is specialised in every section, we have to be conscious of every nuance. Why do we have to live with an act of parliament which is so complex and difficult that we are continuing to change it? I know the parliamentary secretary is sensitive to these matters, as she well might be. Mrs Crosio-No, I am not. I would be more sensitive if it was not corrected.",116
177,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEE,"You would have been justifiably condemned if it had not been corrected now, before implementation; but it is probably more by accident than design that we are dealing with this matter now. It could well have gone to the keeper and people would have been missing out on their benefits. The government could have been very seriously embarrassed. I think it warrants the government taking on board the general and appropriate criticism that this act is now so complex and difficult that it is suffering significant designer error all the time. New divisions agreed to. Clauses 141 to 152-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Schedule.",116
178,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEE,"I am proposing an amendment to the schedule, page 52, to add new paragraphs 19 and 20 which are amendments to paragraph 1251(l)(b) and after section 1251 to add a new section 125 1A. The parliamentary secretary seems amused at thisMrs Crosio-No, I am not.",116
179,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEE,"Themember for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who is also at the table, is a parliamentary secretary as well. The changes are matters that the parliament The opposition, in its usual cooperative way, was facilitating the government's program for changes in relation to the manner in which the new job training allowance was implemented. There were also changes associated with jobsearch and newstart. In the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill, amendments were prepared to section 1241 of the Social Security Act to enable it to be applied to an adverse decision which would result in the application for a deferment period. At that time it was intended that a similar amendment be made to section 1251, because it similarly provides for the consideration of certain decisions which did not previously allow the exercise of a discretion. We were not mindful of amending certain other sections of the Social Security Act which the government wanted amended, without the capacity to exercise some discretion in the decision-making process in dealing with the circumstances in which people who were on benefits were likely to be excluded from benefits without some notice. This was largely because the welfare rights group not unreasonably had suggested that this created a problem. It was not satisfied that the present appeal provisions provided an adequate remedy. The purpose of this amendment was to provide that remedy. We provided one half of it. The agreement was, as I understand it, that both sections would be amended; but it did not happen. I will move this amendment now to ensure that this intention is reflected in the legislation. I move: Schedule, page 52, add to the Schedule: ""19. Paragraph 1251(1)(b): Omit the paragraph, substitute the following paragraph: '(b) the adverse decision: (i) depends on the exercise of a discretion by a person or the holding of an opinion by a person; or (ii) would result in the application of a deferment period; and Note: For ""deferment period"" see section 23.'. ""20. After section 1251: Insert the following section: Guidelines for exercise of Secretary's power has considered. to continue payment '1251 A.

Note: For ""deferment period"" see section 23. '(2) A determination made under subsection (1) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.'."". Let me add a couple of other comments relating to the way the opposition sees the administration of sections 1241 and 1251. First, we think it is important that people are aware of the implications of this decision in relation to internal review. We certainly believe that in the department's published guides, guides that are publicly available, this information ought to be included. We understand that at present in the Department of Social Security a separate review and appeals manual which is not accessible generally, even at regional office staff level, might include this information. We think it ought to be made more generally available. The parliamentary secretary might care to give us some undertaking on it. Secondly, we think that a comprehensive system to monitor and review the breaches and the new sections should be established. It is essential that after, say, three months and six months the department should report on the number and type of all breach decisions, the number of considerations under each section, the number of continuations of payment under each section, the length of continuations under each section and the reason for non-continuance decisions. In that context, we might well be able to judge the effectiveness of these provisions. I think it is important for the government to be aware that we are concerned about the way these breach matters were to be dealt with and that people could be cut off benefits without being made aware that this was going to happen and that they could find themselves without income. These amendments were to ensure that people were not left in that position and that there would be an appealable decision which would reinstate benefits. if they were taken away in such circumstances. It does provide for that but we also think, in looking at this matter, that it is important for there to be ongoing arrangements for proper monitoring. I hope the parliamentary secretary will be able to give us an assurance that this will occur.",116
180,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEE,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (6.16 p.m.)-It is a very rare occasion but we as a government support the amendment moved by the opposition. I would like to say at the outset, to those who may have been listening and are trying to work out what the amendment means, that it will enable the guidelines to be established by way of ministerial determination and the continuation of the payment of.jobsearch allowance or newstart allowance pending the outcome of a review of decisions involving the application of a deferment period by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. We are supporting the motion as moved by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) because the amendment is consistent with the recent changes to the act concerning the payment pending internal review of a decision involving the application of a deferment period by the secretary or an authorised review officer. We were concerned about the amendment when it was first proposed, and appreciate the fact that the amendment has been redrafted into very clearly qualifying what is meant in the guidelines. I can assure the member for Berowra, who was speaking on behalf of the opposition, that the government is aware of the intent of this amendment and will certainly carry it through. Amendment agreed to. Schedule, as amended, agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mrs Crosio)-by leave-read a third time. NA NA Consideration resumed from 7 February. Second Reading",117
181,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"Cal wellParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (6.19 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to present this bill which will clarify the operation and the scope of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 and will address some unintended consequences of this legislation. As you are aware, the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 received royal assent on 24 December 1992 and took effect from July 1993. Many of you were party to the passing of that legislation and will recall the act's objective: . . . to improve public health in this country by limiting the exposure of the Australian public messages and images that may persuade them to start smoking or to continue smoking or to use continue using tobacco products. To this end, the act bans most remaining forms of tobacco advertising subject to a few limited exceptions. At the time the bill was considered by the House of Representatives, the member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), now the Speaker of the House of Representatives, stated in the second reading speech that ' like powerful drugs, firearms and other legal, although dangerous, products, advertising of tobacco products should be severely limited.' The need for a ban on tobacco advertising has not waned over the 24 months since that bill was passed at Christmas time in 1992. In fact, we know even more about the harms caused by tobacco consumption now than we did then, as evidenced through a number of Australian and international reports including: - Peto R. and Lopez A., et aI, Mortality from Smoking in Developed Countries 19592000, 1994; - US Department of Health and Human Services, Preventing Tobacco Use Among 1995 Young People-A Report of the Surgeon General, 1994; and - National Drug Strategy, 1993 National Drug Household Survey, 1993. From an Australian perspective: - tobacco is the major cause of preventable death and disease in Australia; - tobacco consumption was responsible for nearly 19,000 deaths in Australia the year we passed this legislation, and has been responsible for a further 19,000 every year since; - tobacco consumption costs our country approximately $9.24 billion each year in terms of health, social and economic costs; and - tobacco consumption causes cardiovascular disease-this country's biggest health problem-and is the largest cause of cancer mortality in Australian males . to With one substance imposing such a significant burderi on the Australian community, it or is not surprising that all Australian governments support the national health policy on tobacco. The pervasive nature of tobacco use in our society, its continuing appeal to a wide range of people and the available evidence on the health, social and economic costs of tobacco mean that parliament has a responsibility to take steps towards reducing tobacco consumption. Therefore, the problems associated with tobacco usage are addressed at a number of levels using many approaches, all of which together are essential to the success of the overall tobacco control strategy. The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 is an integral component of overall tobacco control strategy. The purpose of the amendments before this House is to address a number of issues that have arisen during implementation of the legislation and, by so doing, clarify the operation of the legislation. Firstly, during implementation of the legislation and following consultation with key tobacco and health groups, it has come to our attention that the act may be interpreted to have a number of unintended consequences and unforeseen deficiencies. For example, the Commodore car could technically be interpreted to be a tobacco advertisement as it coincidentally bears the same name as a brand of cigarettes. Clearly, this is an unintended consequence of the act that the proposed amendments will rectify. Secondly, the High Court has recently had occasion to give further consideration to the issue of an implied freedom of communication in respect of government and political matters under the constitution, an issue which had not been fully explored before the introduction of the act. In the light of the High Court's decisions, a thorough review of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 has been undertaken. In this context, it has been proposed that a number of amendments be introduced to clarify the operation of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 and to identify the exact bounds of the legislation in terms of implied freedom. As an example, the act is not intended to stifle public debate on the question whether a legislative ban on tobacco advertising is itself appropriate. Thirdly, the opportunity has also been to make technical and drafting amendments to facilitate the implementation of the act. I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.",118
182,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"We are here today to consider a bill that really should not be here. The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act was passed by the Senate in the dying hours of the last parliament in December 1992, when the minds of members of this place were more on their re-election than on the legislation they were passing. In Labor's rush to get on the hustings an avalanche of legislation, including the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act, cascaded through this parliament. Today we deal with some of the consequences of that rush. The intention of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill is to clean up a number of unintended consequences of the hasty consideration and passing of this act in 1992. These unintended consequences are so patently absurd that they have threatened to make the present act unworkable. They also make something of a joke of this government's claim to be a government of consultation and care. What makes this state of affairs even more amusing is that the government actually admitted that it got it wrong even before the original act became law. At the time of the Senate's second reading debate on the original act in the early hours of Tuesday, 15 December 1992, the now Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Bolkus, had to present a new explanatory memorandum because the original one, in his own words, 'did not reflect some of the more recent changes to this draft bill'. It also contained typographical and transposition errors which actually contradicted the meaning of the legislation. It is a pity that the government, with its horde of policy and legal advisers, could not the see some of the patent flaws in this legislation-flaws such as: making it very uncertain whether a tobacco company can legally list itself in the telephone book or hire staff; affecting the sale of an unrelated product taken which has the dubious fortune to bear an identical or near identical name to that of a tobacco product; and possibly affecting the legal ability of a manufacturer to issue a recall notice in the event of a defective product. Then there is the real imperative for this bill; that is, casting doubt on the ability of the tobacco industry to advertise in the context of discourse on government and political matters, so long as the advertisement does not promote a tobacco product or products. In so far as this bill clarifies such anomalies the coalition does not oppose it but, in not opposing the bill, I want to draw the House's attention to the inclusion of proposed new section 4A to ensure that the act does not apply so as to exceed Commonwealth power. This is done with what could be called a 'black is white' clause. The proposed section 4A says that if a provision of this act has an invalid application but yet can be constructed to have a valid application, an act or omission made on incorrect grounds can be assumed to be correct. This is one area where the government has an advantage over ordinary citizens who have to take full responsibility for their actions, right or wrong. I am advised that legally this is a valid drafting device but, in other ways, it makes me wonder how nervous the government is about a tobacco manufacturer's current challenge to the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act in the High Court. In many ways, this bill is a product of that High Court challenge. If the government really wanted to make sure of the validity of its legislation-which had the support of the coalition on its original passage through the parliament-it should have taken some basic precautions, such as consulting as widely as possible in the preparation and drafting of the bill and allowing the parliament sufficient time to actually debate the legislation and scrutinise it in detail. Unfortunately, given the speed with which the original act was rammed through the House of Representatives and the Senate in 1992, it was not possible for that bill to properly considered. This failure on the government's part is all the more deplorable· because of the importance of the subject of the bill, namely the broad principle, accepted by a majority of Australians, and accepted by the coalition, that smoking is a dangerous, noxious, addictive, carcinogenic and, for all too many people, a fatal habit which is the single biggest cause of preventable illness in this country. It is a habit and addiction that, in spite of all the available weight of medical evidence, and state and federal anti-smoking campaigns, young people are still taking up. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's latest statistical report, Australia's Health 1994, shows that on the most recent sex based data over 30 per cent of men and 27 per cent of women smoke. What alarms me, and should alarm all members of this House, is that the groups whose smoking rates are the highest are those from the ages of 16 to 35. The Institute of Health and Welfare statistics also show that 41 per cent of men and 38 per cent of women aged 20 to 24 are placing themselves in greater long-term risk of lung cancer, cardio-vascular disease, bronchitis, emphysema and a range of other potentially debilitating, life-threatening and, I might say, preventable conditions. Despite the community's best efforts, their numbers are still being supplemented by teenage and sUbteenage smokers. The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act is intended to make it as hard as possible to promote tobacco related products for sale, and the coalition supports that end. Before I finish, I just want to say a word about consultation on this bill. In the second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) talked of wide consultation with interested parties. I have some reason to wonder about this. My understanding, based on well-placed information, is that the government consulted little, if at all, before the introduction of this bill into the other place. There may have been consultation about the deficiencies of the original act, but not about the government's proposed remedies. It seems be to me that the government, and its officials, have obviously not learned their lesson from the way the 1992 act was handled. In summary, then, the coalition does not oppose this bill. But in not opposing it we note that the Philip Morris challenge of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act is still to be heard by the High Court, and that Philip Morris and the Tobacco Institute have made it clear that the challenge will proceed in spite of this bill. The coalition has nothing to say about the challenge, or the grounds for it. But we will be watching its progress with interest. If the challenge succeeds, and the act is declared invalid, then it will be quite clear where the blame lies. If the government in 1992 had done its homework properly, and consulted widely before introducing it, the question of validity would have been beyond doubt.",119
183,Mr GIBSON,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am pleased to participate in this debate and to make a few points in relation to tobacco advertising and, in particular, the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 1995. In entering this debate, I am going to have to make a very public admission that I am a wowser on the tobacco smoking issue. I hate smoking. I have never smoked. I hate being in a room where anybody has smoked. I hate the smell of smoking and I hate the impact that it has on me as a non-smoker whenever I am in the presence of a smoker. I have a very strong view about smoking. I think it is a very pervasive and nasty habit. I apologise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, because I know you are a smoker and I know you are going to find this debate a bit difficult, particularly with some of the other things I am going to say further on. So I apologise at the introduction to my remarks. Mr Nugent-Don't. You might convert him.",120
184,Mr GIBSON,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"I may well manage to convert him but I think that that might be a lost cause. However, I wanted to make it quite clear that I am not a converted smoker, which a number of people in this place are; I have never smoked and I hate it and I always have hated it. I grew up as the child of two smokers, both of whom do not smoke any more but who did during most of my childhood. So you can, in fact, as a child of smoking parents decide that you hate the habit and get out of it, whereas a lot of people seem to follow their parents' pattern. I wanted to put that on the record first because I know that, when I make some of these other comments, I am going to be accused of being a wowser and a complainer on this issue. But we are talking today about a bill which is designed to amend certain aspects of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act which came into effect in July 1993. I would remind the House that the objective of this original principal act was: to improve public health in this country by limiting the exposure of the Australian public to messages and images that may persuade them to start smoking or to continue smoking or to use or continue using tobacco products. That is a very important aim and something I strongly support. I believe that, regardless of whether members are smokers or not, as the national legislators, as the people responsible for the care and welfare of all Australians, everyone in this parliament should support better health for all Australians. But as managers of the purse strings of this country we should also support the bill because, as outlined by the parliamentary secretary, tobacco and tobacco products cost this country $9.24 billion in disease, in loss of employment and in loss of earnings. So we have a fiscal responsibility as well as a health responsibility to all Australians to strongly support the aim of this legislation. As outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) in the second reading speech, a number of unintended consequences have arisen out of the initial legislation which· make necessary the proposed amendments in this bill. We also have to deal with some of the issues that are emerging from the High Court challenge. But this amendment enforces the spirit of the original legislation. It is clear that now, more than ever, we should increase our vigilance on this issue. I remind members of the House of some of the statistics that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) outlined in her answer in question time on Monday of this week. For the first time in a decade there has been an increase in the number of young people who are smoking-a five per cent increase for girls and a four per cent increase for boys. Approximately 260,000 12to 17year-olds currently smoke each week, resulting in a cost of $1 million a week burnt up by those young people. In addition, around one-quarter, or approximately 25 per cent, of adult Australians currently smoke. In the past this government has introduced a range of initiatives to reduce tobacco consumption in Australia, and there have been some excellent programs. First, the 'Smoking. Who Needs It!' advertising campaign was very effective and well targeted. It led the way on bans on smoking in the work force by preventing smoking in Commonwealth buildings. The government also extended the ban on tobacco advertising to include all forms of advertising on the broadcast media, including incidental advertising of tobacco products where the names of tobacco companies are used in the promotion of other sporting or cultural activities. Of course, the other important initiative that the government took was to ban smoking on all internal airline flights and to encourage Qantas to gradually move in the international arena to ban smoking on all international flights. The national drug offensive campaign conducted by the NCADA, the national campaign against drug abuse, has proven itself to be spectacularly successful in fighting tobacco, drug and alcohol abuse. I also support the actions of the Minister for Human Services and Health in her strong campaign against tobacco sponsorship of sport. We need to encourage that at all sporting venues. I understand that my colleague and friend the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) is going to speak a little bit further about a particular sporting event that is proposed for his home state and the use of tobacco there. I strongly suggest that the government take further action. We have a reasonably strong strategy but I believe that, in order to tackle tobacco usage in this country, we need to make that strategy much stronger and much more comprehensive. I would like to suggest a number of further avenues. We have banned advertising in almost every form, but there are still insidious ways in which tobacco companies are able to advertise. I think we should move to make sure that a tobacco company cannot promote in any way or form whatsoever the name of the company or any of its products. We should work with state governments to ensure that tobacco advertising is removed from every possible venue, such as sporting fields. Either up front or surreptitiously, tobacco companies should not be able to advertise their product during cultural events, in shops, et cetera. We need to do further work to ban tobacco advertising. My most important suggestion is that we push the price of tobacco products up to exorbitant levels. We need to make the price of tobacco products so high that no young people can afford them. If we do this most people will find smoking has such an impact on their budget that, regardless of the health consequences, for financial reasons, they will not be able to afford to smoke. I will outline some points regarding tobacco excise. In the 1993-94 financial year, the federal government received $1.4 billion from tobacco excise. In 1994-95, this is expected to rise to $1.5 billion. The government receives $1.65 in excise on a pack of 35 cigarettes, and it receives 94c in excise on a pack of 20 cigarettes. For a 500-gram pack of rollyour-own tobacco, the government gets $3.37 in excise. I do not believe those figures are high enough. I do not believe they have a sufficiently punitive impact to stop most people. Evidence clearly shows that young people are still taking up the habit and are able to afford tobacco products. In this year, the year in which we are seeking to find additional revenue to ensure that our deficit is reduced, that interest rates do not go up any further and that our economy is maintained on a sound economic footing, I believe that the government has a very sensible, reasonable and rational option: double the excise on all tobacco products. That is my very firm recommendation to the government. That would enable the government to raise an additional $1.5 billion in revenue. The price of a pack of 20 cigarettes would increase by almost $1. I would like to see us add another dollar to the price of a packet of cigarettes each year for the next five years. I realise I am taking a great risk here because 25 per cent of my· constituents still smoke. Mr Nugent-And you have a very marginal seat.",121
185,Mr GIBSON,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"And I have a very marginal seat; I recognise that as well. But I have the national interest and the interests of my constituents at heart. I believe that smoking is an evil habit that has to be stamped out as much as possible. Smoking is hurting each one of my constituents every day. I would much rather see them devote their financial resources to healthier pursuits than to using tobacco products. It is clear from evidence over successive years, such as budgets and a range of other activities, that putting the price of tobacco products up to a very high level has an immediate impact on demand and usage. Regardless of all the other strategies we employ, which I fully support-in fact, I would seek to have additional financial resources gained from this doubling of the excise duty committed to them. I still believe that the most effective means of stopping people smoking is pricing them out of the habit. That is the only real way we are going to get most people to stop. This strategy would have a number of benefits. Firstly, it would add an additional $1.5 billion to Commonwealth revenue. Secondly, it would make the price of tobacco products too high for a lot of young people and discourage them from taking up smoking at an early age. Thirdly, it would provide significant additional financial resources we could more than double the amount money we commit to the quit smoking campaigns, the advertising campaigns and the support programs we put in place in workdeath places around the country to support people to give up the habit. I think we need to commit significant additional resources to those strategies. It would mean we could engage in major community education camstandably, paigns on a much larger scale than we do the moment because we would have the caused additional financial resources to afford it. We need to work with state governments thoroughly enforce existing laws. way people as young as 12 or 13-and their numbers are increasing-are able to smoke is if people sell them the product. Laws in all states prohibit the sale of tobacco products people under the age of 16, yet tens of thouclass sands of people under the age of 16 are regularly smoking and are regularly able to get access to tobacco products. Therefore, we need a very strong law enforcement campaign to make sure that shop owners, supermarket staff and others are not able to sell tobacco products to young people. Those will have a very strong impact on tobacco smoking. Australia's programs already have a very good international record. We have led the way, and I have noticed that while I have been in other countries. I do not believe that antismoking campaigns in other countries are anywhere near as comprehensive as ours. I have noticed at meetings, conferences and forums overseas that quite an extensive amount of smoking is still occurring. It is allowed in meetings and conference rooms, but we do not allow that in this country. Australia has a very proud record in relation to programs to reduce the use of tobacco products. But the evidence now shows very clearly that these programs are not having the impact they had two or three years ago. We needto rethink our strategy, revisit the different ways we can have an impact and be a bit more aggressive in our campaign. The mechanisms I have suggested-the biggest and the one with the most impact is the doubling of the tobacco excise-will have an immediate so and very positive impact on reducing the of numbers of smokers in this country. Tobacco is the major cause of preventable and disease in Australia. Tobacco consumption is responsible for nearly 19,000 deaths in Australia annually, which is six times higher than the number of Australians who die annually in road fatalities. Underwe express enormous horror and at outrage at the road carnage and the trauma by road accidents, yet we freely allow the sale and distribution of a product that we know kills six times as many people and costs to the government of this country and the comThe only munity $9.24 billion a year. I know that people are going to say that as a member of the Labor Party I am advocating to something that is going to hit the workingpeople and the poor battlers, who are going to have to cough up more money for their cigarettes. I believe this government has to act in this way. Ignoring our responsibilities for the health and welfare of those working-class people and their families and not taking strong action is not doing the initiatives workers any good at all. We as a government need to be taking very strong, firm action to tackle this issue. I do not believe we have any option other than financial disincentive because-regardless of all the money we put into education and advertising campaigns, et cetera-if the products are still pretty cheap and accessible, people will use them. We have to make them not so cheap and not so accessible. I congratulate the government on the initia!ives it has taken in the past in this very Important program. I support the legislation. I support the strategy the government is engaged in, but I believe we need to go much further. I hope that we as a government are able to grasp the nettle and accept the challen-e that I put forward-that is, doubling the eXCIse on tobacco products in the next federal budget. Mr Nl!GENT (Aston) -6.50 p.m.)-I gave up - mokIng at five to eIght on Friday, 14 AprIl 1978 so I declare a bias, and perhaps the mere fact that it is so indelibly engraved on my soul gives an indication of the insidiousness of the habit. Whilst I will never go back to smoking properly, I think I have s-oked four or five cigarettes in the years SInce, and I have to say that each time they were like nectar. I wish to hell that I had never taken it up in the first place as a 15year-old. I agree with much of what previous speakers have said when talking about the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill. The member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) has all the medical and statistical information. I agree with much of what the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has said, and I hope he takes his $1.5 billion plan to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to see how he gets on with it. I suspect, though, that if you drive people away by pricing them out of the market you do not actually then get the revenue from your taxes. It is a diminishing return in some sense. The member for Moreton also foreshadowed what the member for Dunkley (Mr Chypoweth) is goi-g to say, which I suspect I will not agree With as much as I did the m-mber for Moreton because he is probably gOIng to have a go at the wonderful Victorian state government.",122
186,Unknown,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,Government members interjecting,124
187,Mr NUGENT,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"They are very predictable, Mr Deputy Speaker. Unfortunately, we are really here to clean up some more of the governmet.tt's mess. We have been doing it for some time. Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, you and I have been in this place for almost five years now. It seems that with great regularity we come into this place and find that the timetable is hurried, that legislation is introduced at very short notice and is often pushed through-frequently guillotined through-and that we do not get a chance to debate it properl-. Either the drafting is poor or the InS-ruct.IOn- from the drafters is poor and the leg.IslatIot.t IS - ammed through the parliament. Th.ls applIes rIght across the board-to legislatIOn on tax, Aboriginal affairs the recent situation with the Human Rights Commission, et cetera. V(e h-ve even had this situation with major legIslation, such as the native title legislation. Justice French himself has found shortcomings in that legislation that were pointed out to the government before it was passed through the House. This time it is the tobacco legislation. We are here to pick up errors that should have been obvious when it was first drafted and first pushed through this House. The object of the legislation, we all know is to prohibit tobacco advertising. Why do whave. that? It has been said by a number of prevIOu- speakers, and. it will be said by succeSSIve speakers, but It bears repeating: we need to prevent this particular advertising because it does damage, particularly to our young Australians. The argument from a medical point of view is one that is quite clearly accepted right across society. It is our young people in particular whom we have to try to protect. The. tobacco .c?mpanies are continuing some of theI.r advertiSIng, and I believe the lengths to which they go are quite immoral. As I walk around my suburban electorate I find it q-ite distr-ssing to see the number - f young - Ir-s smokll-g these days. They will pay for It In later hfe as, indeed, I have. We are spending billions of dollars each year in terms of the c-st of smoking and it is not only the damage It does but also the repair to people's health that is needed, the hospital costs, the treatment of smoking related illnesses, and so on. I speak from experience. One of the things in my life that I am aware, and probably the least proud, of is that I smoked for many years when my children were young. It is interesting that when I smoked in the house my kids got on all right; they did not comment about smoking too much because they were quite used to it. They were brought up with it from birth. After I gave up smoking, as soon as a smoker left the house we were all running around opening the windows and trying to get some fresh air in. I noticed the difference, as did my kids. That was a graphic illustration that when I was smoking they were in fact passively smoking. I want to make sure that we discourage people not only from doing themselves damage but from doing other people damage as well. Particularly, I do not want to see the young influenced. We in this place should all be outraged by the number of deaths in this country from smoking and smoking related illnesses. There should be no argument that we need the strongest possible legislation. We are told the amendments to the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 are to clarify that the is not to apply in a way which would exceed the Commonwealth's power and provide for the exemption of various types of tobacco advertisements from the operation of the act. Those exemptions are to include advertisements made in the context of government or political discussion, so long as they do not promote tobacco products; advertisements relating to the internal management of the business of a manufacturer, distributor or retailer of tobacco products; advertisements preventing a product causing injury to anyone; non-tobacco products which share the same name or have substantially similar names to a tobacco product manufacturer, distributor or retailer; the publication of the name of a tobacco manufacturer, distributor or retailer in a telephone directory; and the broadcasting or publication of an advertisement on international air flights. It seems that they are all eminently common sense matters that should have been legislated for in the first place. This legislation should never have come back here to be amended. As the honourable gentleman from Chisholm said, the timing of the bill has in all probability been brought on by the Philip Morris case-and I do not intend to go into that particular case in any great detail at this point in time. We have a real problem in this area: the government introduces legislation, does not talk to the outside world-the real world-gets itself into trouble and then has to keep coming back with amendments. We then have further court challenges, the government finds that it has not done its homework and we come back in here for further amendments yet again. I hope this time the government has done all its homework. It has the time because it does not need to rush things through on this occasion. It really is important that, on this sort of legislation, we get it right. As my colleague the gentleman from Chisholm said, we do not oppose it but it is another cleaning up exercise for the government. It is important that we all reaffirm our commitment to discouraging smoking, particularly the adverthat tising for young people. As a former smoker who is admittedly worse off for having act smoked, I commend the bill to the House because anything that can help prevent just one more young person from taking up smoking and suffering from it as I did is deserving of being passed through this place expeditiously.",124
188,Mr CHYNOWETH,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"I will confirm for the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) that, yes, I am going to mention Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett, but at a later date. I did have a few smokes behind the shelter shed when I was a kid at Moorabbin tech, but that is about it. Most of my family have never smoked, and none of my kids do. My father smoked and he died of emphysema just last year, so there is a connection there and that is my pecuniary interest in this Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill. I last spoke about the tobacco industry in December 1989 in the debate on the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisement (Prohibition) Bill 1989, so it was a while ago. It was a private member's bill that was introduced by Janet Powell, who was a Democrat from Victoria. At that time, I raised the issue of advertising by stealth in regard to the tobacco industry and what it was doing in the area of cricket-and this was in relation to Benson and Hedges. At the time, I said that over 40,000 smoking messages bombard the viewing public during an average test match. I would like to suggest a way to stop these as getting through. I believe it would be feasible with today's computers to have all sporting broadcasts with cigarette advertising in them to be processed by a real-time system that would turn to some colour any item with the words 'Marlboro', 'Benson and Hedges' and 'Philip Morris'. So when we have a close-up of a racing car driver with the words 'Marlboro' or 'Philip Morris' across his shirt, the computer would recognise them and, before they were transmitted to the public, diffuse the block of pixels involved to create a bland colour. This principle would also work for all the fence boards around our cricket ovals. I believe this technology is capable of being developed in Australia by our software houses. To pay for it, the federal government could up the tax on cigarettes and have software firms work on it. To prevent their being nobbled by the cigarette companies, these software firms could be offered a prize of perhaps a million dollars for the first one to come up with the software. That way, many firms would be involved and not all of them could be bought by the cigarette companies. The government could buy a super computer to handle the software and processing and, when not in use by the TV networks, it could be used in our universities and by other bodies such as the CSIRO. This idea might sound a bit strange at first, but I believe that it could be put in place and that we could afford it through the method I have suggested. It is a novel idea, one which I have never heard before. I thought of it some time ago, and I hope that someone picks it up and carries it. We should also ban the export of cigarettes from Australia and put even more money into education to teach our children about cigarette smoking. I notice when I attend many labour market programs and graduation ceremonies that those involved smoke heavily. I suggest that part of the curriculum for labour market programs for our young people-programs such as LEAP-have an antismoking component to teach of the dangers of smoking and the benefits of not smoking; that is, the monetary benefits of not smoking. Since I last spoke about the tobacco industry in December 1989, many people have been killed by cigarette smoking. It is estimated that every year 5,100 people die in Victoria; that is, 25,500 people in Victoria have been killed through smoking cigarettes since 1989-25,500 people! Hard drugs or opiates killed fewer than three Victorians every week. Road accidents killed nine Victorians every week. Alcohol killed 30 Victorians every week. Tobacco killed nearly 100 Victorians every week, which is about 14 per day. More recent research indicates that these figures are conservative and that one in three smokersnot one in four-will die prematurely from smoking related diseases. I am sure honourable members are all aware of the diseases caused by smokingcancer of the lung, lip, oral and nasal cavities, pharynx, larynx and bladder. Three-quarters of all cases of lung cancer are due to smoking. Other diseases include heart disease, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, strokes and peripheral vascular disease. Not only does the addiction to cigarettes kill those who participate; it can also kill their friends. It has been estimated that passive smoking causes over 1,600 deaths per year in Australia-146 from lung cancer and 10 times that number from heart disease. Recently smoking was banned on all nonstop flights to the US and Canada. I recall the debate in caucus in 1987 about stopping smoking on our domestic airlines. Ron Edwards, the former member for Stirling, moved the motion, which was opposed by the then Prime Minister Bob Hawke. Bob was beaten only twice in caucus, and this was one of them. At that time, back in 1987, it was a great victory for the caucus to win and be able to support Ron Edwards's motion. I think the people who travel on aircraft can be thankful to Ron for the effort he put into that motion being passed in caucus and therefore potentially saving many lives in relation to passive smoking. I support the AMA call for cigarettes to be sold only from licensed outlets. Why should they be sold from milk bars? Milk bar owners are there to make some sort of profit. They could not care less whether they sell cigarettes to kids under the age of 16 or not. Chemists and liquor outlets have to be licensed to sell drugs. Therefore, I believe only licensed outlets should be able to sell cigarettes, and the tax applied to them should be increased. A couple of days ago, I received a letter from Philip Morris arguing against an increase in tax by using the same old arguments to justify its position. In part, it points out that one-quarter of Australia's population smokes and votes. That leads me to an interesting article regarding donations to Victorian political parties by Philip Morris. An especially interesting donation is the one to the Liberals in Victoria, headed by the chairman of smoking-Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett. An article in the Age of 26 February, 1995 states: Tobacco giant Philip Morris made a $25,000 donation to the state Liberal Party after Kennett government moves to water down cigarette warnings and defend cigarette advertising. The Philip Morris Group made the donation last April, according to Liberal Party annual returns lodged with the Australian Electoral Commission. Both before and after the donation the Premier, Jeff Kennett, publicly defended the right oftobacco companies to sponsor Melbourne's Grand Prix. In 1993 Mr Kennett attempted to have other state governments reject stricter warnings on cigarette packets, warnings that had previously been approved by Victoria. The Liberal Party refused to discuss the Philip Morris donation. Liberal Party members are not discussing much these days. They are into all sorts of dirty tricks and will put their any grubby money they can get hold of. The article further states: The vice-president of Philip Morris, Mr David Davies, defended the donation, which he said had nothing to do with the Kennett Government's stance. Mr Davies said the company had not made a contribution to the Victorian ALP, but had made a similar donation to the New South Wales ALP. ""My philosophy is that companies such as ours have an obligation to support the political process and we do so in a non-partisan manner because we recognise the political process is under-funded,"" Mr Davies said. Phillip Morris had donated to the Victorian Liberal Party because Victoria was the company's home and it had a special sense of responsibility to the state, he said. No donation had been made to the state ALP because it had not requested one . . . What a joke! On the one hand he says that process has to be non-partisan, but on the other hand he says that, because a donation was not asked for, it was not given and that the donation was given to the Liberals because they asked for it. It goes on: The Oppositionthat is, the Labor Party in Victoriahas claimed several of Mr Kennett's staff had links to the tobacco industry. One of his senior advisers left the Government to take up a senior position at Philip Morris. There you are: a job for the boys. Philip Morris is saying, 'You give us $25,000, we'll promote the Grand Prix for you, destroy the health Albert Park Lake and, if you have a few people looking for jobs, don't worry we'll pick them up.' These people taking such jobs at Philip Morris are just jumping aboard Jeffs gravy train. No doubt people like Ron Walker Mr and Philip Morris are very pleased that a few pieces of silver can buy favours in Victoria. I trust that my idea to blank out as on TV will be looked at and put in operation so as to thwart the plans of the Victorian government and the Ron Walkers of this world. I advise people in Victoria to take on the tobacco companies. More cases like the one that was recently decided in Victoria would be worth too while. In the Sydney Morning Herald, under the headline 'Passive smoking: first award for hands out for eye damage', it states: A nurse's aide has been awarded $4000 for eye damage he suffered from passive smoking in a Victorian public hospital in what is believed to be a legal world first. The claimant, who wants to remain anonymous, was paid the $4000 out-of-court settlement this month by the Victorian Government after he developed conjunctivitis. He was subjected to cigarette smoke from patients and staff while working in a public hospital in Victoria. His lawyer- Mr Eugene Arocca of Morris, Blackburn and Co--said yesterday it was the first time damages in a passive smoking claim had been paid for a non-respiratory illness. A flood of similar claims were expected to follow as a result of the settlement, Mr Arocca anti-smoking groups predicted yesterday. I urge those people affected by tobacco to take on these drug peddlers. Another very pleasing article to me was in the Australian 28 February which said in part: Telephone lines were jammed at law firms the United States last week as thousands of scrambled to join the biggest class action suit history, after a ruling by a judge in New Orleans that gave a group of 60 law firms permission the tobacco industry for addicting 40 million to 50 million Americans over the past 50 years and for hiding evidence that nicotine was addictive: It is the first time that a federal court has ted a class action against the seven major cigarette manufacturers and lawyers say it could result damages of more than $USIOO billion ($135 billion). Several other courts last week waved anti-tobacco cases forward. In Florida and Mississippi, lawyers were given permission to proceed with suits that aim to make cigarette companies reimburse State medical services for the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses. This is what we should be doing straight away-taking them on. It also states: Tobacco executives are reacting stoically to the latest assault on their $US54 billion a year ness, which provides $US 13 billion in excise sales taxes to federal, State and local governments. They have never had to pay damages in the despite scores of cases brought against them say they are confident the new cases will nowhere. Tobacco shares held up well last week, despite dipping initially by up to 8 percent. The last sentence is what this is all about. I will read it again: Tobacco shares held up well last week, despite dipping initially by up to 8 per cent. Money-that is all it is about. These comtion panies could not care less where they peddle their drugs, who it affects, what suffering creates or how much extra they impose on the health system. All they are after is the money generated by this drug. I trust that the enactHouse, ment of this bill will assist in closing down these drug peddlers. MrBRADFORD (MCPherson) (7.14 p.m.)-It is interesting that the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) should wantto cast aspersions on the Kennett government for its fundraising activities. I do not know anything and about that, but, if the member wants to go down that track, we do not have to look too far to start painting the Australian Labor Party with the same sort of brush. The member of talked about the caucus rolling .the former Prime Minister in the caucus room. If he across wants to go down the track of fundraising, smokers what about the same man's having attended in the famous gold lunch in Western Australia. The price tag for that little exercise I think to sue was $250,000 per head. The Bonds and Connells of this world were there, all contributing to the Labor Party coffers. I do not need to draw the inference too broadly. If the permitmember wants to go down that track, I sugin gest he take note of the old adage that people in glass houses should not throw stones. The interesting thing about this debate so far is that the honourable member for MoreState ton (Mr Gibson) and I have finally found, after five years here together, one thing on which we agree. That is quite extraordinary, as I am sure he will agree. That is that we are both pretty much confirmed anti-smokers. When I came to this place I was quite alarmed to find that people smoked quite busiopenly inside Parliament House. Senator Dr and John Herron and I were concerned about this and subsequently raised it, which led to a ban past on smoking in Parliament House. I did not and make friends among some of my colleagues get here who smoke, although I think perhaps I could observe that they may not observe the ban as religiously as they ought to. I now find that, whereas we could go outside in the courtyards to get fresh air, we now have to stay inside because all the smokers are out in the courtyards. My next suggesto the Speaker might be that he consider extending the ban to what I would call the it environs of Parliament House. I do not want to suggest that that would force the smokers down on to the road in front of Parliament but I cannot help but observe, perhaps a littlelight-heartedly, that now that they are all smoking out in the courtyard we cannot go outside for fresh air because it is being polluted. It is a problem that I suppose somebody has to solve. The shadow minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who is well qualified to speak on these matters, spoke eloquently about the dangers of smoking tobacco-and other substances, I presume. He also made the point that deaths from smoking related illnesses are avoidable and that that is one reason why we should be very concerned about this. I also took the point that the honourable member for Moreton made that in grasping these issues enthusiastically we are likely to offend smokers. My experience in dealing with smokers is that most of them want to stop. My father, who smoked for a long time, tried on many occasions to give it up, but unfortunately he was too heavily addicted, or perhaps did not have whatever it takes to give it up. I note that some people have the extraordinary capacity to smoke a lot of cigarettes a day for a lot of years and then suddenly to give it up. Apparently that is amazing. Some of them can, but others obviously cannot. But I think that not many smokers, if they were honest, would say that they would not stop if they could. We meet the occasional person who does not agree with that point of view, but I really believe that is the case. The shadow minister has justifiably criticised the government for the fact thatthis bill is a result of the haste in which the original legislation was enacted. There is certainly justification for that criticism, as yet another piece of legislation is before us as a result of, to use the words of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), a number of unintended consequences. That is the excuse the government gives when a lot of legislation that is rushed through this place for one reason or another results in further legislation to correct a number of drafting mistakes or so-called unintended consequences. I suppose in this case there could be an argument for some urgency. If we are committed to the reason for the legislation, then I guess we would have to concede an element of urgency about it. This legislation is substantially because of the Philip Morris High Court challenge to the 1992 act. This is a response to the concerns of the tobacco industry about freedom of speech. As I understand it, even the Australian Medical Association and other medical authorities have conceded that these changes are in order. The amendments give tobacco companies rights to do things, as I understand it-to use their names in job advertisements and those sorts of things. So in that sense we have to concede that there were unintended consequences. Like, I would think, all speakers here, I have never had any doubt about the intention of tobacco companies to use advertising to encourage people to smoke. The arguments that they were doing otherwise were always specious. They were so glaringly, obviously so that I could not imagine people from the Tobacco Institute writing to me or standing up in public to try to make a case that their advertising was intended only to affect brand loyalty and arguments along those lines, which clearly was not the case. In fact, I think they must have thought most people were stupid if they thought that they would take that sort of argument seriously. The tobacco companies always intended to make smoking acceptable and to encourage people to take up smoking. That has always been their intention. Even in recent times they have shown a great capacity to be original. I have noticed their latest attempts to promote smoking with all sorts of value added promotions, retailer loyalty programs and the like. In the end the government may well have to look at preventing these sorts of activities, which may already be in breach of state laws. State jurisdictions, no doubt, will be looking into them. It is evident that the Philip Morris challenge will continue despite this legislation. Of course nobody denies that it has the right to take action in the High Court, but it does in a sense indicate the level of concern that tobacco companies must have about the future of their business. I for one certainly hope it will not be successful in its High Court action. The question often posed, quite legitimately, is: if smoking is so dangerous, why is it not banned? You would think from hearing the fervent speeches made on this subject here today that there would be some people calling for the banning of cigarettes as a product. From listening to the speeches that have been made, it would be almost logical if that were to occur. I think the answer is largely self evident-prohibition will not work. I suspect it would substantially be in the area of cigarettes, but in the end it will not work to the extent that it perhaps needs to. It should have been banned a hundred years ago or whenever it was that Sir Francis Drake took the first puff. It would have been banned then if they knew what we now know about it, although I am not sure that we learn lessons quite that way. With the calls for legalisation of marijuana and some of those other substances evident around us, hopefully we will not be silly enough to go down that track when the dangers of smoking, inhaling or the taking of those sorts of substances not entirely certain one way or the other this stage-depending on who you talk to. Perhaps the answer is in education, though, unfortunately, because of the incipoint dence of young people taking up smoking, that does not appear to be working as well as it should. It probably takes time. I firmly believe that education is an important componot nent. All of our children's children very clearly taught about the dangers of exposure to tobacco, drugs and such products. My own children, for instance, attend our local Life Education Centre, which does an excellent job. I observe in passing that its funding was reduced. That was a matter that came up in the budget debate. The Life Education Centre does a very good job-certainly the one on the Gold Coast does-in teaching kids about the dangers of smoking and other drugs. It will just take time and determination to use the education process. We are beginning to make some impact on kids with warnings about the dangers of skin cancer, for instance. A lot of educational material has come out, and a real concern about skin cancer is starting to emerge. Kids are wearing hats, using sunscreens and are obviously aware of the dangers of exposure to the sun. That has come through education. I believe strongly that education is still an important component in stopping young people smoking. When they eventually get the message that it is not cool to smoke-the reason they take it up is that they think it is cool-then we will start to see the trend going in the other direction. The sooner we do the better. One other element in the equation is obviously pricing. The member for Moreton went a little bit over the top when he called for a doubling of excise in the 1995 budget. The rationale he had for that was an economic one. He went to great lengths to point out that, if excise was doubled, it would raise so many billions of dollars-I have not got the the figures at my fingertip-and help the government with its deficit reduction strategy, which no doubt it would. The fallacy of that must be that, if it has the desired effect of stopping people smoking, it surely will not double the are excise. If we are going to use the price at mechanism-there is no doubt that every time you make cigarettes more expensive some alpeople give up smoking-there is certainly a on the demand curve where you will virtually stop people smoking. The purpose ought to be quite clearly not to raise revenue. If it raises more revenue, then it certainly is having the desired effect of stopping should be people smoking. The other option and part of the armoury, if you like, of ways of attacking this problem is prohibition on advertising, which we are talking about today. I and the speakers that have taken part in the debate are certainly committed to that. It is one of a range of options, the three main ones being pricing, education and prohibiting advertising. The three of those combined eventually, hopefully, will have the desired effect of stopping people smoking. I like to give credit where credit is due and I give it to you, Mr Speaker, because I remember in the debate that took place in 1992 that you reluctantly ended up strongly supporting the original legislation. It must have been hard for you and, indeed, for the then Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Mrs Kelly, to do that because of your interest in rugby league.",125
189,Mr SPEAKER,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,You have not heard what I want to say on this yet.,131
190,Mr BRADFORD,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"I thought at the time that you had taken a very brave decision, as had Mrs Kelly, who had obvious strong inclinations to rugby league, particularly to the Canberra Raiders. Mrs Kelly, to her credit, made a difficult decision, but she made the right decision, which is good. In this place sometimes people are inclined not to make the right decision. She did and I expect that she will be remembered for taking that difficult step. To enlarge on the argument that legal substances should be allowed to be advertised, clearly there are plenty of legal drugs that are not allowed to be advertised. I think that puts the lie to that particular argument. In the end, restricting advertising should lead to decreased consumption. As I foreshadowed earlier, for decades we were told that cigarettes were not bad for health. Many soldiers took up smoking during the war when they were actually given cigarettes, and many have since died from smoking related diseases. I was interested to find in doing a bit of research for this tobacco bill that the Menzies cabinet actually had been warned about the dangers of smoking as far back as 1963 when it rejected bans on tobacco advertising. An article in the Canberra Times states: The 1963 Cabinet papers, made public today, show that the minister for Primary Industry, Charles Adermann, succeeded in knocking back recommendations from the National Health and Medical Research Council for bans because it would be ""detrimental to the Australian [tobacco] leaf industry"". Far be it from me to go too far down the track of attacking the Menzies' governmentyou can understand that, Mr SPEAKER - but it seems to me that, if it had actually done the right thing in 1963, a lot of the 20,000 people who die each year from smoking related disease would have lived at lot longer. I commend the government for continuing to pursue this matter, even though, as I say, we are looking at fixing up unintended consequences. I strongly congratulate you, Mr Speaker, and the government for bringing this law in in the first place. I hope that we will continue to be vigilant about calls for other substances to be .legalised when there is still very much doubt about whether they will also have the same consequences in the long term.",131
191,Mr SPEAKER,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,Earlier today in the second reading speech on the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 1995 the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) referred to comments which I made when the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Bill 1992 was introduced into the parliament. Mr Rocher-Is this a personal explanation?,131
192,Mr SPEAKER,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is, actually. Mr Rocher-Do you claim to have been misrepresented?",131
193,Mr SPEAKER,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"Absolutely. These comments were the views of the government as they were contained in the second reading speech which I delivered at the time as the duty minister in the chamber on behalf of the former Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, the Hon. Peter Staples. Debate interrupted. NA",131
194,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! It being 7.30 p.m. I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Timber Industry: Taxation,131
195,Mr ROCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"The government and the green movement have been saying that the solution to the current problems of woodchipping native forests is to harvest new growth plantation forests. The reasoning goes that this will reduce the need to harvest old growth forests in which so much of our flora and fauna exist. Naturally, the development of a plantation based timber industry is supported by members on both sides of the House. It is difficult to argue against. In the national forest policy statement of 1992, which has been signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and all premiers and chief ministers, article 4.5 asserts that all Australian governments will continue to encourage plantations. The third paragraph of article 4.5 states: To achieve the governments' objectives it will be necessary to ensure the impediments to plantation development are minimal in areas such as taxation, planning and access to information. The government has failed to meet its obligations under the national forest policy because the Australian Taxation Office has made a mess of plantation tax policy. The major problem relates to the management of tax rulings by the Australian Taxation Office. The ATO now refuses to provide private tax rulings for afforestation projects, whereas previously it did, The reason for the ATO not providing a private ruling is that it now refuses to provide rulings for primary industry production projects. This has the potential to cripple moves towards a plantation, and thereby renewable, source of timber products. How can a company, in all honesty, release a prospectus for a forest project stating that certain non-capital expenses will be tax deductible under section 51(1) of the act when the company has no advice from the Australian Taxation Office that these deductions will be allowed? There is, however, an ATO public tax ruling on afforestation projects known as IT360. IT360 is under review and the Australian Taxation Office refuses to provide private rulings. So, what are companies that are considering afforestation projects to do? This is an industry where it takes up to 12 years for a plantation to grow to maturity and be ready for harvesting. This is a very long lead time before any income is derived. It is essential that there be certainty as to what expenses are deductible. It is just another example of the government's left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. If the government were truly interested in encouraging plantation forests it would give companies-and therefore prospective investors-private rulings and finalise the review of IT360 as quickly as possible. The government must fulfil its obligations under the national forest policy and minimise taxation impediments to plantation forests. It is the government's responsibility to send out a clear message that it supports plantation forests. Rhetoric is one thing, but there is no substitute for action. Here is an opportunity for the government to use the tax law to benefit the timber industry, the environment, and the wider community, but Labor is unable to grasp the nettle. This is an issue which is of national importance. We all want a sustainable timber industry because we will, for the foreseeable future, require timber products and we certainly do not want to have even more timber imports. Our balance of payments is precarious enough already without Australians resorting to ever higher levels of timber imports. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) and the Minister for the Environment (Senator Faulkner) should all get together and come up with a common sense approach that will end dire uncertainty. The Australian Taxation Office, for its part, must issue private rulings immediately so that investment in the industry can occur with maximum certainty. Aboriginal Health",131
196,Mr HAVILAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) (7.35 p.m.)Last night in the adjournment debate I was talking about Aboriginal health and the responsibility that state governments have for this issue under the constitution. State governments have historically failed to deliver the services for which they have constitutional responsibility. That applies to Aboriginal - health and to many other areas as well. Aboriginal affairs generally is a particularly strong example of the continuing failure of state governments in areas where they have constitutional responsibility. We hear a lot about states rights from our opponents in the Liberal Party and the National Party. As a speaker in this debate said yesterday, Aboriginal health is about more than just medical services: it is about housing, educationMr Knott-Land.",132
197,Mr HAVILAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Land first and foremost. I thank my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore. Another important aspect is property rights. Land management rights are supposedly constitutionally the responsibility of the states, as we found out in the native title debate. Housing, education, roads, water and sewerage are very important components in ensuring the health and welfare of Aboriginal people, particularly in remote communities. These are all areas of responsibility of state governments. As I said yesterday, it is broader than just Aboriginal health. Mental health services are traditionally state responsibilities. They have been traditionally very badly delivered and have been neglected over many decades. Not a day goes by in this place without another example of areas of state government responsibility which have been stuffed up in terms of policies. I refer to forests. We had a blockade around this building, but who is responsible for logging licences? State governments, of course! I could go on. We have another COAG meeting coming up soon and no doubt we will have all the state governments trotting off to COAG and complaining about not getting enough money from the Federal government. They will be complaining about having too many of their grants tied and having to be accountable to the Commonwealth for taxpayers' money. At the moment the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is holding an inquiry into specific purpose payments. The terms of reference to that inquiry are, basically, to investigate the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements for specific purpose payments-SPPs or tied grants-with particular reference to the need for improvements in the management of SPPs; the form, structure and content of SPP agreements; the appropriateness and relative efficiency of them; and the needs to better define the roles and mandates of the Commonwealth and state Auditors-General to audit SPPs. That inquiry is continuing at the moment. Submissions were called for and received last year. A questionnaire was designed by the committee in consultation with the Auditor General's office and was circulated to Commonwealth departments. We had a lot of cooperation from Commonwealth departments. The chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), wrote to the state governments and asked them to answer a few questions based on the questionnaire. The committee received submissions and cooperation on the questions from all state governments-except one. The New South Wales state government wrote to the chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on 22 November and said The New South Wales Government is of the opinion that answering the questions will not add to the position we have already put. The position of the New South Wales government is that we should not have tied grants. What would one expect from a state government? The letter goes on to say:. The New South Wales Government is not prepared to devote additional resources to your inquiry. It gets worse, Mr Speaker, because the public hearings have commenced into specific purpose payments and the New South Wales hearings occurred on 21 February. On 7 February 1995 the secretariat of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts contacted the New South Wales Premier's office to find out whether the state government was going to appear before the inquiry. The secretariat was told that no decision had been made. On 15 February the secretariat contacted the directorgeneral of the Cabinet Office, Mr Roger Wilkins, to seek an answer. The secretariat was told that Mr Wilkins would return the call. No call was returned. On 16 February the secretariat called again because we still had not had an answer. Apparently, some time after 5 p.m. on the Friday the New South Wales government had still not responded. (Time expired) River Torrens",132
198,Ms WORTH,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, the pollution-choked River Torrens winds through the electorate of Adelaide and provides a picturesque backdrop to the heart of the city. But behind this facade is kneedeep rubbish, and a delicate ecosystem that is being progressively destroyed by pollution resulting from the activities of thousands of people who live and work in the catchment area. The river needs sustained management to combat its chemical, oil and bacterial pollution. If the River Torrens is to be saved, there needs to be cooperation across all three levels of government. On 16 January I held discussions with the state environment minister David Wotton and Adelaide Lord Mayor Henry Ninio. We agreed on the need for a management plan for the clean-up of the Torrens and also on the need for community education and involvement. We agreed that long-term strategies and action were required. To further highlight this need for action, I organised a community clean-up day on 20 January and urged people concerned about the deplorable state of the River Torrens to join me. Raising awareness via the media is just one way to force communities and governments to confront and address the pollution problem-especially appropriate on this occasion as 1995 has been designated the Year of the Torrens. The clean-up attracted more than 50 volunteers from all ages and backgrounds, and together we braved the mud to collect just a tiny fraction of the refuse which clogs the river. We gathered firstly at the banks of the Torrens near the University of Adelaide footbridge and then travelled to Pitt Weir in St Peters to continue our task. The rubbish amassed at both venues had to be seen to be believed. There was a sordid assortment of litter found amongst the debris-plastic wrappers, milk cartons, spray cans, oil cans, old tyres and fast food wrappers, just to mention some of it. When we all emptied our bags into the truck provided by St Peters Council the tray was piled high with rubbish. Naturally, we could do nothing about the chemical and bacterial pollution but our actions, which received considerable at least highlighted the problems.",133
199,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,Highly commendable.,134
200,Ms WORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I think so too. Eighteen local government councils are involved in the Torrens catchment area. So, clearly, today's problems are the result of many years of neglect. Only a coordinated effort will see a successful clean-up and a healthy environment for future generations. As David Wotton says, bandaid measures are neither appropriate nor acceptable. To that end, I have already investigated projects for federal funding. I have met with a senior officer of the Department of Employment, Education and Training to discuss whether the department runs any programs that could be used to help in financing the River Torrens clean-up. I discovered that not only are there a number of appropriate projects but it is possible, according to the senior officer, to involve other federal government departments as well. Public pressure demands action. An editorial in Adelaide's Advertiser asks: Must the Torrens become a political issue, a kind or urban Murray, an inland Patawalonga before it is properly cleaned and maintained? As oftoday, the depressing answer seems to be that it must. The River, lake, or to be more accurate, the lagoon which meanders through the heart of Adelaide is a filthy disgrace. The editorial goes on: South Australians do not care about who was responsible for silly buck-passing. The waterway which could be the quiet pride of the city is more like a sewer. State and local governments share the blame. They will be called to account separately and together until the Torrens is again Adelaide's pride. I would like to add that we all share the blame, but at least there is a genuine commitment and willingness on the part of the state and local governments to find solutions. I hope that when the time is right there will be federal government support. Thanks to the community clean-up, I know there is a willingness amongst those living in Adelaide to do their bit to make the Torrens a cleaner and publicity, healthier place to enjoy. Finally, I would like to place on the record my appreciation to those who helped on the clean-up day. Special thanks needs to go to all those who came along to help as well as to KESAB, to Adelaide's Deputy Mayor Jim Crawford for providing a bus at his own expense to transport volunteers, to Ansell for providing protective gloves, to St Peters Council for a truck for the rubbish collection, and to radio station 5AA for refreshments for those who volunteered. I hope to be able to report back to the House shortly on my progress and achievements on this important issue. I can say now that I will be back there again next Sunday morning as part of the clean up Australia campaign. Geelong Port",134
201,Mr OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I spoke in this place last year concerning the threat to sell off the Port of Geelong by the Kennett government. That threat is now being realised by the Geelong community. The Kennett government wants the port in private hands-and the cash in its-by the end of this year. Opposition is building and, as I rise to speak in this House tonight, the Geelong community and the union movement are gathering to discuss further means of opposing this privatisation. The sell-off of Geelong's port, possibly to foreign interests, has outraged and united the Geelong community as never before. Unions, port users, business groups, community groups and Labor politicians have all voiced opposition to this decision by the Kennett government. That is because the Port of Geelong is central to the city in many ways. It is the city's geographical heart, a central transport link, a core economic asset and link to the export markets of Asia and the world. Yet, despite this centrality to Geelong, the Kennett government has told the combullied munity that it will auction the port and related assets to the highest bidder-a less plundering of the assets of the community that denies it any involvement in the management of this public asset. The Kennett government's economic rationof ale for the sale is simply its privatisation mantra that private ownership will improve efficiency and cut costs. However, Geelong already has the runs on the board or, should I say, the ships in the port. As I told the House in May this year, the federal government embarked on an ambitious restructuring of the waterfront in 1984. three-fold process of overhauling stevedoring employment arrangements, implementing port authority reforms and encouraging greater competition in the industry, has had a impact on our waterfront. In Geelong, it has transformed the port into a profitable and efficient asset that is competing well on the world stage. Productivity has improved by some 120 per cent. The port is one of the most efficient grain handling ports in the world. Cargo handling rates have risen by 57 per cent. Ship turnaround times at container terminals have been reduced by 45 per cent. The port returned a $9.6 million profit last financial year and has reserves of some $44 million. That is why the Kennett government wants to get its grubby hands on this community asset. While I regret the loss of jobs, manning levels have been reduced through voluntary redundancies by 50 per cent, and the work force has been multiskilled. The Kennett government's response to the port's success has been simply this: 'Here is a successful community asset; let's flog it to our mates.' All the while it is telling the community that the port is so inefficient that only private interests will be able to deliver the further efficiencies and cut costs. The community simply is not buying it. There has been a chorus of opposition from business, unions, the local media, the port our authority and the community generally. The business community is bitterly divided over the sale. Longstanding opponents have been into acquiescence by the Premier, but its in private they are expressing to me their pointbitter opposition to the sale. The union movement is united in outrage at the sell-off plans. It has played a very constructive role in the corporatisation of the Port Geelong. The workers have helped make the port an efficient community asset only to see it sold from under their feet by the Kenthe Port of nett government. I commend the Waterside Workers Federation in Geelong for the constructive role it has played, especially its secretary, Jimmy Mavity. It is that group, showing concern for That its community, that is rallying tonight. The Reorganising Board for the Port of Geelong has also expressed its opposition to large the port sell-off. When the government announced its decision on port reform in late January the reorganising authority stated: The Government's plans appear to fly in the face of the advice given to it, both by the Reorganising Board and those who participated in the consultative process. What has the Geelong Advertiser had to say on the issue? It put it fairly bluntly in an editorial on 19 January this year: Apart from the simple fact that selling public assets that return strong profits is plain bad business, the Government is also selling out Geelong. That is what it is doing on this occasionselling out Geelong. (Time expired) Flying Fruit Fly Circus MrLIEBERMAN(Indi) (7.50 p.m.)-The matter I want to raise tonight concerns the very famous Flying Fruit Fly Circus, a children's circus that is well known in Australia. It has been aptly described as a national living treasure. Mr Knott-Like you!",135
202,Mr LIEBERMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you very much. I am flattered. The circus has contacted me because of its very grave concern about its future. Its future is in doubt because the Commonwealth has not so far responded to the plea of the circus for funding arrangements with the Commonwealth. I am told that the circus is facing a reduction of 60 per cent in Commonwealth funding unless the matter is clarified. To give an idea of the success of this organisation and the dimension of the funding involved compared with other organisations, in 1994 the Australian Opera, which I support very strongly, performed to approximately 300,000 people in Australia. In the same year, the Flying Fruit Fly Circus performed to 248,000, which is 80 per cent of the opera's audience. In the same year, the Australian Opera received $7,700,000 funding from the federal government; the Flying Fruit Fly Circus received $90,000, which is 1.16 per cent of the opera's funding. It is that $90,000, believe it or not, that is in doubt. I have been told by the directors of the Flying Fruit Fly Circus, which has been operating in Australia now for 15 years with great success and international recognition and acclaim, that if the Commonwealth does not respond to the submissions that have been made about funding and does not continue the funding of around about $90,000, the circus will have to close. It will be lost to Australia. I hope that this brief summary, because of time constraints, will be heard by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the other relevant ministers; the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), whose department has had a long standing partnership with this organisation because it is also a training organisation. It helps train young Australians in theatre, the arts-particularly in acrobatic arts. I want to conclude by saying that this great national treasure is helping young people achieve excellence. It has travelled the world and been recognised and acclaimed. I remember very well when I was patron of the organisation in its early days that it went to Canada. As a result of its performances in the World Children's Circus, it was acclaimed as the best, and NBS television filmed it. They thought they would show it once in America through cable television and that would be it. Because of the demand, it was shown constantly by NBS cable television in America, and the circus has been invited back and has been back to that country on, I think, two more occasions. It performs across regional Australia and in the capital cities. I would like to have a performance in front of parliament one day, but I do not want to tum these kids into a stunt. They are too good for that. I would like this parliament and the Prime Minister on a non-party political basis to act quickly and urgently, because this is the first time in the 15 years that I have been associated with this circus that it has ever made a plea like it is now. It is not kidding. If it cannot get this $90,000, it is finished, and that would be· a shame. NRMA: Insurance Industry",136
203,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to speak on Hilmer's competition policy, especially in relation to the NRMA. My understanding of the Hilmer competition policy is that it is designed to get the best possible competitive vehicle for economic activity within the country. We have seen things which I am a little dubious about in the Hilmer being pushed through COAG to cover areas like water, such as has happened in the Victorian electricity industry. Are schools to be next? In Western Australia. I understand health has been put forward for that. Prisons, in some instances, have been put across. The question is of desirability. I have my reservations about those things and I have expressed them in this House before. Accepting the premise of competition policy that an organisation which is best suited in a competitive economic framework will survive and will do the best, I turn and look at the mutualised society of the NRMA. What is behind these con artists in the president's team who turn around and suggest that they are motivated by the need to unlock those vast resources of the NRMA and get them out to the members? Some of the opponents of their philosophy suggested that the best way they could unlock those resources and get them out to the members was to give refunds, rebates or lower fees on the insurance premiums they charge. The answer that came back from these intellectual giants was, 'No, we can't do that because, if we did, that would destroy the insurance industry. All these other companies would fall by the wayside. They would not be able to compete.' I find myself in a very difficult position, then, if I accept what Hilmer is supposed to do - that you find the most competitive vehicle within anyone industry and back that to the hilt, that you allow competition to take its ugly course and whoever comes up on top, whoever is the most appropriate body, is the one to have pre-eminence. But here the directors of the NRMA are saying, 'We can't do that. We can't have competition because if we had competition all the other insurance companies would go broke.' My question is simply this: if it is so desirable to get least cost delivery of service, then in this case would it not be in the best interests of the motoring public of New South Wales, would it not be in the best interests of the business and small business sectors of New South Wales, to have the cheapest possible insurance? I have heard all the arguments about water, electricity and so on, relating to how they are going to do these magnificent things for the people in the communities and small business in New South Wales. Quite frankly, I doubt it. But accepting that, I look at the insurance premiums people payout in small business. I refer to small business, but the same applies to householders in terms of their household and car insurance. If electricity is going to deliver some benefits then, in dollars and cents terms, lowering those insurance premiums would do a hell of a lot more for small business and for the people in New South Wales. All of you understand that I am telling you the exact truth. So why under Hilmer do we have any consideration for assisting the demutualisation of this organisation? Why not put Hilmer in there? The GIO has gone and I cannot see much more competitiveness in New South Wales in the insurance industry. The real reason behind this is that this is a theft of the mutualised members' assets. They are going to pay SOc in the dollar to the assets of the NRMA and those mutualised members and the historic members. If we are going to go down the path of Hilmer, let us do it correctly and not say, 'Hold on. This instance does not exactly help our corporate mates.' If we are going to go down that line and use that argument, let us not do it halfway; let us do it all the way. I would prefer that in many instances you reject that argument, but in this one instance of the mutualised society of the NRMA I think you will find that it is in the best interests. (Time expired) Voyager Disaster: Compensation",136
204,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"In the very short period of time available to me this evening before we adjourn, I take the opportunity to draw to the attention of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), who is at the table, a series of questions that I placed on the Notice Paper three weeks ago relating to that continuing vexatious problem of Voyager compensation. I hope we will shortly see some light at the end of the tunnel. I understand that the Attorney-General may have to go back to cabinet on the issue. I hope that, if he does, that will speed up the process. All I can say to him once again-this is about the fifth or sixth occasion I have actually spoken to him since he has been Attorney-General-is that I hope at long last we can see those remaining 60 to 80 Voyager compensation cases resolved satisfactorily.",137

The essential criminal responsibility under the common law accused knew, believed or intended at the time provisions of the Griffith codes.

Consideration is being given as to whether AWEX will take on responsibility for wool pack standards.
