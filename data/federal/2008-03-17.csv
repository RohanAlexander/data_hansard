1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 12 pm and read prayers. NA AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 February, on motion by Ms Gillard: That this bill be now read a second time.",17
2,Mrs GASH,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"As has been stated and restated in recent days, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 is a turning point in the history of industrial relations in Australia because it spells the end of Australian workplace agreements, which were first implemented in 1996. It is true that the federal coalition has championed statutory individual contracts for many years and has fought critics of the system. However, the election on 24 November 2007 delivered a convincing win to the Australian Labor Party as a result of the policies the ALP took to the people of Australia and the people of Gilmore. While there is continuing debate on the reasons for the ALP victory, there is no doubt that the debate on Work Choices and AWAs was highly public and a driving factor in many a person's decision on election day. That being the case, the coalition is not going to stand in the way of the government's industrial relations policy and its commitment to the Australian people with regard to Work Choices and Australian workplace agreements. However, I strongly suspect that the coalition would have been criticised for whatever stance we took on the issues. The coalition is seeking one change to the bill, and I strongly urge the government to adopt the amendment. The coalition believes the Australian government should extend its temporary employment contracts, its individual transitional employment agreements, from two years to five years. This will allow greater certainty for employers and employees. The amendment the opposition proposed will not obstruct this bill but it will provide 2008 greater flexibility. The coalition will now focus on developing new policies to encourage individual employment arrangements using the framework of common law contracts. That said, the key to this entire debate lies in the bill's subheading, ‘Transition to Forward with Fairness'. The 10-year National Employment Standards profess to provide a simple, fair, flexible safety net for all employees, and that is a commitment to which the alternative government will hold the Prime Minister and his government accountable. Twenty-twenty hindsight is a luxury not afforded to new policy. We are not in a position to gauge the true impact of the new legislation; we can only hope it delivers what the government has said it will. It goes without saying that we need to be wary in these troubling international economic times. Already in some circles the 1970s term ‘stagflation' has been resurrected and is being bandied about. The government has been elected to make laws for the benefit of the nation, not just for a select few. As a former small business owner and now parliamentary secretary to the shadow minister for tourism, my concern obviously turns to the business community, particularly the hospitality and service sector. The Australian Financial Review wrote on Friday, 15 February 2008 that employers were warning of a massive increase in costs and more restrictive work arrangements. Business groups also warned that the new industrial era being introduced will place more and more impositions on business activity and impact on the bottom line. There is no doubt that the lessstructured approach to industrial relations from the reforms up to 2005 have brought us benefits. These concerns must be taken on board by the government as it moves forward with its changes. We left the Labor government a legacy of strong economic and employment conditions, a point acknowledged on both sides of this House. We left the new Labor government no debt and a massive surplus. We left this Labor government and its state colleagues a lot of economic wriggle room. The management of our industrial relations system is no easy task-and the Rudd Labor government now has its hands on the controls. This bill is the government's first major foray into the arena, and its impact will be monitored not only by the coalition but by the people of Australia-the working families and the business owners. As a backbencher my primary concern is towards my constituency and the impact this will have on one of the major industries in Gilmoretourism, a major employer of young people. The new government's policies are gradually unfolding and need to be monitored so as to avoid any deterrent to employment and potential to contribute to an increase in unemployment. The new government has before it the challenge of meeting the economic and industrial relations changes of a rapidly changing world. Our local tourism industry is at the cutting edge of that changing world and among the first to feel the impact of change to industrial relations legislation. I talked to a number of small business owners in my electorate recently, asking how things were going. Without exception they expressed deep concern about where things were heading. They were concerned about how rough things have been in New South Wales for a very long time and that it did not seem like they were getting any better. In regional and rural areas trade has been down. These people trade on weekends and public holidays. That is when tourists visit and it is their best opportunity for making a living. They told me that many cannot afford to open because of the high cost of staff and that they are wary of a union driven wages break-out. One cafe owner said it cost him about $40 an hour for a senior shop assistant on New Year's Day. That is a lot of lattes that he has to turn out every hour just to break even. But he says he needs to do that just to make sure his business has continuity. He has to cop any losses from that. He has a choice: he can do that or he can shut up shop. If he shuts, staff have no jobs and the tourists have no service. My point is that, in the face of a possible world recession, with the events unfolding in America this year, more interest rate rises on the way and further deterioration of consumer confidence, sound management of our industrial relations system is more crucial than ever-and now the new Labor government has the helm. Although the question of the reintroduction of unfair dismissal provisions has not yet been raised, it would appear likely. The prudent approach should be to explore the consequences of any such step. Again, this is a case of the government being given the reins of control. We as the alternative government have the responsibility of making sure that due diligence is followed in the formation and delivery of the government's industrial relations policy agenda. When business operators, the people who provide and create jobs, are telling us to take it steady, we should listen. Of primary concern for me and the people of Gilmore is the creation of jobs and the maintenance of employment. Job creation or job preservation strategies are critical elements of any government's industrial relations legislation. We need to avoid pressure mounting on the domestic tourism industry. Added pressure will come if this government does not control inflation. It is all very well blaming the former government but, sooner or later, the government have to accept responsibility and act on the fact that they voted in because Rudd said they would do a better job. If the unemployment rate starts going up then it is a clear sign they have failed. This failure will be accentuated if government fail to reduce the unemployment rate in Gilmore. My concern is to protect and to build on the jobs we have, and the people of Gilmore would expect no less of me. We need to address the issue of job prospects in the Gilmore electorate and particularly in domestic tourism. Gilmore has the reputation of having one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia. During the last campaign Labor promised to make it a priority to address the chronic unemployment issue in Gilmore by addressing the infrastructure bottlenecks and the skill shortage crisis. In fact, I have purposely kept a record of the words used by my Labor opponent during the campaign with regard to this issue and many others. I might remind Labor that the unemployment rate in Gilmore under the previous stewardship was as high as 17 per cent and was brought down to 7.8 per cent as of September 2007. Labor now has to bring that figure down significantly if its promise is to have any meaning at all. Labor needs to make some serious investment in the Gilmore electorate and one of the first places to start would be the local tourism industry, which is the major cornerstone of the economies of Kiama, the Shoalhaven and Eurobodalla. I have no qualms about working with the government to achieve this and have already taken steps, through approaches to ministers, to put some rubber on the road. I strongly encourage Minister Albanese to place the Princes Highway at the top of Infrastructure Australia's priority list. A commitment to the improvement of our main transport artery would be a positive early sign that the government is determined to do as it promised and govern for all Australians. As far as I am were concerned, we cannot afford to be caught up in arguments over ideology. Industrial relations management is too important. Sound management of an incredibly complex systhe tem is what, in the end, puts bread on our tables and clothes on our children's backs. Businesses in my electorate are very concerned at what could be coming over the economic horizon, as are mortgage holders, mums and dads, builders, casuals and young people about to leave school and their parents. These concerns will not be easily allayed, but a steady approach to industrial relations management will go a long way towards doing just that. Again, Work Choices is no longer coalition policy and the coalition will not block the abolition of AWAs as this bill passes through the House. However, over coming months and years the government should be aware that it is on notice that the people of Australia and Gilmore are dependent on it to deliver on its election 2007 commitments. Policy that reduces flexibility and returns modern workplaces to the mandatory collective agreement dominated days of the past will be rejected and stunts and posturing will also be rejected. The people of Australia, particularly the people of Gilmore, stand by the coalition when it says that Labor has the controls but it does not have a mandate to destroy jobs and damage the economy. Our people want to work and we need the jobs for that to happen. It does not help when the government axes programs like the local liaison officer program that was of great assistance to local members in their efforts to assist, for example, job seekers. The new Labor government also needs to closely investigate the impact of abandoning programs like Sustainable Regions. The coalition had committed $15 million under the Sustainable Regions Program to encourage business initiatives and job creation on the New South Wales South coast. While I appreciate the new government is in a stage of review and renewal, I strongly urge it to look at the for such a commitment in Gilmore. A similar commitment by the Rudd Labor government to the people of Gilmore would be a clear indication that the government is determined to deliver on its commitment to govern for all Australians.  Today on St Patrick's Day, wearing my green tie, I am proud to speak in favour of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 and join the Rudd government's support for Australian working families. I think St Patrick is credited with getting rid of snakes in Ireland, so it is a good omen for this piece of legislacountry tion. Australians have spoken loudly and clearly-they do not want the coalition's unfair Work Choices laws. This bill honours the Rudd Labor government's commitment to return fairness to Australian workplaces and the incredible efforts of the hundreds and thousands of Your Rights at Work activists and union members who dug into their pockets and did the hard yards on work sites and street corners all over Australia in the leadup to last November's election. This Rudd government bill will also ensure that we never again return to a system where Australians are forced to trade away their entitlements. We will not be leaving a legacy of poorer working conditions for our children, which, unfortunately, was the case under the Work Choices legislation where, for the first time in the history of the Australian Federation or white settlement, we would have been leaving our children with a poorer set of working conditions in the workplace. Since Australian workplace agreements were forced upon working Australians we have heard countless examples of how pay and conditions have been stripped away. I have certainly heard it throughout my electorate of Moreton. This new bill means no new AWAs for working Australians, no more need ‘my way or the highway' workplace negotiations. Now we are returning to the long cherished Australian tradition of employees and employers sitting down at the table like civilised human beings and discussing what is best for the long-term interests of the business. This is music to my ears and to those of people on this side of the House. It is music to the ears of the millions of mums and dads-the millions of working Australianswho have been let down by AWAs. Also, it is a huge relief to the many seniors and pensioners who were horrified at what the Howard and Costello government foisted on the of the fair go. The country that they had worked so hard to create was being chipped away by the Howard-Costello legislation. This bill puts in place sensible and fair transitional arrangements to allow those employers and employees who have been using AWAs to prepare for the full implementation of the Rudd government's new system in January 2010. During the transition period, employers using AWAs as at 1 December 2007 can offer individual transitional employment agreements to new employees and employees already on AWAs. This bill also addresses John Howard's failed fairness test. Never before in the history of literature have we in this parliament come so close to Orwellian language. George Orwell would be spinning in his grave, in a little country graveyard in England, over that so-called fairness test. This John Howard-Joe Hockey ‘unfairness test' failed to protect working Australians. It failed to protect all award conditions. We have heard in parliament, from the Deputy Prime Minister, tale after tale of lost entitlements. In fact, when data was collected it showed that 100 per cent of AWAs ripped off workers' entitlements and that they failed to adequately compensate employees for the loss of so called protected award conditions. Quite frankly, the Howard government's fairness test wasn't worth two bob. It almost brings a tear to my eye when I think of all the money that was wasted on the as that I saw promoting this so-called fairness test. This bill will ensure that all agreements approved by the Workplace Authority pass a true nodisadvantage test against the full applicable award or the full applicable collective agreement in the workplace, if there is one. The opposition would have us believe that unions are irrelevant and no longer have a role to play in Australian workplaces. Well, think the election in November last year showed that this could not be further from the truth. Unions have played a vital role when it comes to ensuring proper standards of occupational health and safety, and they will continue to do so for many years to come. We all expect that when we go to work, be that in a service industry or a mine or a school, we will be safe. As well, we pect that when our children go to work they will be safe and come home. We have unions to thank for many of the workplace health and safety conditions around the country. I think of my younger brother's experience on a building site. Unfortunately, two people were killed in a workplace accident right next to him. Changes have been made since then because of union involvement in response to that accident. Our trade union members and leaders across the country are working to ensure that basic working conditions, like overtime and penalty rates and the ability to make a few dollars if one has to work in a coffee shop on New Year's Day, are being properly protected. I said at a forum at Yeronga State High School, in my electorate, way back in early 2005 that I thought the union movement's response to the Work Choices legislation would be the union movement's finest hour-and it certainly was. It certainly showed that when people have worked out how they are going to be treated unfairly it will move them off their couches and onto street corners to do great things. I contrast that with the agenda of the former member for Bennelong-and it is great to see the current member for Bennelong here. What happened reminds me of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. That novel was set in the Depression, a time when there was a race to the bottom as to what workers would tolerate. If someone was prepared to work for 15c an hour, an employer would say, ‘Well, I there's someone here prepared to work for 14c an hour.' That would then lower the rate. That race to the bottom is not the way of the Rudd government. We are finetuning the economy. We have a plan for the future. We disagree with what is being suggested by the opposition in terms of what was handed on to us. We had 16-year-high inflation rates. We had 10 interest rate rises in a row. We ex- had a productivity rate of zero handed over to us, Commonwealth spending at record levels, at up to nearly 4½ per cent, and 5½ years of monthly trade deficits-22 shameful quarters in a row of trade deficits. That is the economy that was handed on to us. This bill offers a fair and balanced approach to workplace relations, one which ensures that employees are getting proper protection, when it comes to their basic working conditions, and offers more than enough flexibility for business. I commend the bill to the House.",17
3,Ms MARINO,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008, with regard to my electorate of Forrest, in the south-west of Western Australia. My electorate has a full range of industry, from small business to retail, contracting and those in the very large mining and resources sector. I have found that the majority of people have not been fazed by the introduction of Work Choices and are well aware that AWAs are nothing new as they have been available since 1996. It is plain that federal Labor are using the Work Choices legislation as the excuse to roll back and then to end AWAs and individual contracts. However, they are keeping them under the new name of individual employment transitional agreements, or IETAs, but only until December 2009, when a no disadvantage test will apply. As AWAs were subject to a fairness test anyway, this really means that federal Labor intend to keep individual contracts but to promote union collective agreements over individual contacts. In my electorate we have the Bunbury Chamber of Commerce. This particular group has over 800 small business members, with 80 per cent employing fewer than four employees. Work Choices gave these particular businesses significant confidence to expand and employ more staff. I also have larger mining and resources companies in my electorate. Wespine, for example, has 80 per cent of its workforce on AWAs. This has been the case for a long time. It believes that if these contracts cannot be renewed federal Labor will make it more difficult for the company as it has been able to incorporate flexibility into the contracts to cater for needs of individual employees. I have another major firm in my electorate, a contract cartage and heavy haulage business, whose workers have the opportunity for a wide variety of agreements-and it is that flexibility that makes the difference for both the employer and the employees in that particular business. Another company, Piacentini & Son, an earthmoving and mining contracting company in Picton, in the south-west, has been able to operate very successfully with AWAs not only in Western Australia but also in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. AWAs have been very good for both this company and its employees because they have offered flexibility to workers and have streamlined the rules and pay for similar activities. With AWAs the employer could deal directly with individuals and discuss the issues that were relevant. Different levels of pay were available for different levels of activity. The company reported to me that it needs to retain this flexibility in its workforce to remain competitive in tendering for contracts right across Australia. AWAs benefited both employers and employees because they provided an alternative to a discussion platform. It was akin to having competition in the workforce as opposed to having only a union to negotiate with. The power was not confined to just one group, and it gave people the capacity to negotiate. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has said her government must talk with employers, employees and those who will play a role in our new workplace relations system. There are a number of employers and employees in my region. I seriously hope that the minister consults with them in this process, because they are working very well with AWAs, probably because they are on non-union sites. I would strongly the encourage federal Labor to get in contact with the various groups and businesses in my electorate. We need certainty, and these businesses are already contacting me looking for certainty and looking for what the rules will be going forward. An expanding business needs increased productivity, and employers and employees are happy when they work together. I am a small business person myself, and the one thing that I hear from other small business people is how much they value very good workers. We hear about workers being dismissed. In this House the employers whom I meet value their very good employees because they are part of the productivity and the future of their businesses. Employers cannot do their jobs without good employees and they value those employees. In fact, with our unemployment rates as they are in Western Australia, the good employees certainly are able to negotiate very good outcomes for themselves. My colleagues who have spoken previously to this bill have also confirmed the coalition's position that Work Choices is no longer coalition policy and the coalition will not oppose workforce. the transition of this bill in the House. In my electorate of Forrest the mining tor is a very high earner, followed by forestry and agriculture-including horticulture and viticulture-and tourism. All of these businesses require flexibility in the workforce. Another issue is the fact that small business is also often the engine room of many small towns and communities in general. I was the president of a football club in my small community, and the support for that football club came from small businesses. Their economic position came from flexibility in the workforce and the capacity to negotiate with their employees. Small business has the capacity to be significantly impacted by major changes. A number of those businesses have contacted my office in relation to this issue. Small business is a critical part of our economic and social fabric in regional towns and centres right across Australia, but particularly in my electorate of Forrest. The jority of these small businesses are family owned and run. Small business is a major employer nationally and is effectively the cornerstone of our society. The one thing that is often overlooked is the fact that small business is actually a critical player in strengthening competition in the marketplace. My electorate is one that has a vast range of tourism opportunities, but its workforce needs to be a flexible workforce. The same is true of the agricultural sector, particularly in dairy farming, where there is a real need for flexibility in the workforce. I have also looked at what has happened in relation to infrastructure. We have some very clear infrastructure needs throughout my electorate. I hope that the Labor government strongly supports their election commitments, particularly in relation to the infrastructure projects and the Bunbury outer ring road. Again, a raft of these initiatives will be based on the capacity to engage a flexible I am concerned that recent job advertisesecment figures show the total number of jobs that are being advertised is actually falling. The three latest surveys indicate that business confidence is eroding and, as a result, there is a real and genuine possibility that unemployment may rise. Last month's Sensis business index showed support for the new government dropped by 30 percentage points. This was followed by the Olivier job index, which recorded a drop in job advertisements for the first time in three years. Business, and in particular small businesses, is facing an uncertain future under changes to unfair dismissal laws. The Labor government wants to abolish AWAs but not enable negotiations beyond these in a way that is effective for both employers and employees. No new employees can go onto ITEAs; there will be no new agreements beyond December 2009. Only 700,000 workers-that is, ma- eight per cent of workers in Australia-are on individual contracts, mostly in the mining sector, but they are a significant check and balance for businesses. They are a check and balance; I repeat that. We need flexibility of individual contracts as well as collective agreements. We need flexibility in the labour market for productivity gains. Individual common-law contracts are needed for contracts where employees earn over $100,000. I believe all employees should have the right to negotiate their own conditions, whether they earn above or below this level, but this sends the wrong message and separates these workers into an elite class. I maintain that we need to retain flexibility in the labour market. The amendment bill seeks to lengthen the life of ITEAs to five years. I support the amendment bill and commend it to the House.",21
4,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I rise with a lot of pride to speak in relation to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008. If there has been a bill in the last 50 years that has been more important to redressing the imbalance in workplaces in Australia then I am yet to see it. This is a bill that is supported by the vast majority of Australians, one that on 24 November galvanised Australians all around workplaces to vote for the Labor Party to see the end of these rotten laws. It was with some amusement that I noted the member for Gilmore's comment chastising Labor, saying that we cannot afford to be caught up in ideology. Dear me, if there were any piece of legislation in the last 50 years more caught up in blind ideology than the Work Choices legislation then I would be astounded. The Work Choices legislation was inherently unfair; it inherently played on the imbalance between an individual worker at a workplace and the powers that a corporation can bring to the bargaining table. How could anyone argue that an AWA could not take advantage of that inherent imbalance of power? The statistics in relation to AWAs speak for themselves. Between April and October 2006, 89 per cent of the 1,700 AWAs that were lodged excluded one or more protected items. That means literally almost nine out of 10 agreements that were lodged took away what were meant to be protected items. Quite clearly, the argument that individuals can be in some sense empowered to be on an equal standing when they bargain with their employer is an absolute nonsense. Before I came to this place, I represented workers in the health industry. I was constantly asked by ambulance officers, radiographers, pharmacists, nurses and aged-care workers: ‘how is it fair that a government can bring in laws that strip away our conditions?' How is the economy improved by an ambulance officer losing his penalty rates or by a nurse losing her shift allowance? These were questions that were asked of me constantly and ones to which I could only say: the laws are unfair and need to change. Another terrible effect of the Work Choices laws was the insecurity of hours that workers suddenly found themselves with. People were not able to plan when they were going to be at work. People had their whole shift patterns eroded. These sorts of things put great strains on family life and on community life and made it difficult for people who want to volunteer for a range of community activities. The death of Work Choices means that these opportunities are there again. Looking at the aged-care industry, where over 80 per cent of employees are either part time or casual, where over 80 per cent of employees are female and where workers earn less, on average, than you would working in MCDonald's or KC, what is the effect on the quality of care for the elderly when the few conditions that workers have are eroded and their working patterns are disrupted? Back in 1962 in New South Wales, by agreement with the employer, awards were changed so that broken shifts were outlawed unless there was a specific agreement. That meant that people going to work would not be asked to work for three hours, have two hours off unpaid then return for another three or four hours. With Work Choices, we saw the return of this practice in nursing homes. We saw people becoming chained to their workplaces. It was not creating flexibilasked ity for mothers, as is often put by the opposition. It was not creating a more friendly workplace. It was creating a workplace that you could never leave, even when you were not being paid. These are the effects of Work Choices. They need to be addressed and changed, and this legislation is the starting point in relation to that. In my electorate of Dobell, we have high unemployment. We are in a very different position from the electorate of the member for Forrest. In fact, unemployment in Dobell is almost twice the national average. For the citizens of Dobell, the former Prime Minister's boast that working people have never been better off sounds very hollow indeed. It was worse for people in Dobell because we have close to 30 per cent of the working population commuting for up to two hours to Sydney. You need to ask: how can working people travel to Sydney for two hours, be asked to work a broken shift where they will work for three hours on the job, take four hours off on their own time and spend another three hours back at work, then travel home at the end of the day? Clearly, this has an effect on communities and it had an effect on my community-it made sure that people understood that these laws were inherently unfair for working families. During the election campaign a gentleman came to see me who had been given an AWA at a large retail store where he was to be made the manager. By being made manager, he found his AWA said that he would have to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The AWA had another provision in it which said, despite that clause, ‘This should not limit the number of hours that he may be called upon by his employer.' I am not quite sure what hours outside seven days a week, 24 hours a day someone can be asked to be available, but that was what happened with the AWA this gentleman was to sign. Members opposite may say, ‘Yes, but he was rewarded through an increase in salary.' He was offered a salary of $25,000 to be available seven days a week, 24 hours a day, only made possible by these Work Choices laws. In the seat of Dobell this was the biggest issue that had people changing their votes. The economic argument that is put forward by the opposition from time to time is about flexibility in wages so that we can compete. Well, quite frankly, I do not want to see an Australia, and I do not want to see the citizens of Dobell, having to compete on wages with India and China, who are a couple of our biggest trading partners. It is a nonsense. The way for us to compete internationally is through working smarter and that is why the Rudd government's education revolution is so important for this country. What does the opposition actually stand for today in relation to Work Choices? We have heard speaker after speaker saying it is no longer the policy of the opposition to support Work Choices, but we all know they still believe it. You have to say to yourself: ‘If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck then it still is a duck.' We just had the member for Forrest extolling the virtues of AWAs and saying how important AWAs were for this country. I certainly did not get the impression that the member for Forrest thought that Work Choices was not a good thing for this country. Look at the way in which the then government tried to frame the argument in relation to Work Choices. It was framed as an attack on union bosses. There are a couple of points that need to be made in relation to this, the first being: what is dishonourable about looking after workers? I have spent 19 years looking after health workers, ambulance officers and pharmacists, and can I tell the House that I am damn proud of that work and think that it was an honour to be a union official given that responsibility. Legislation, though, was not aimed at the unions; it was aimed at ordinary working families-and that is the problem that the opposition have in relation to their position on this particular issue. They chose to attack the most vulnerable. They chose to attack ordinary working families, to make their lives more difficult. They made it more difficult for them to pay the bills by weakening their bargaining position. Do opposition members really think that employers just came to the workplace one day and said: ‘G'day workers, today we are going to give you four weeks annual leave; tomorrow we are going to give you penalty rates, workers compensation and long service leave'? These things were argued and fought for by unions and, for that reason, the union's role in tion to the workplace should be spoken about with honour rather than derided as the opposition continue to do. The Australian public were very clear on 24 November 2007: they were voting to get rid of these rotten work laws. The important legislation that is before the parliament today is the first stage in the Rudd government's commitment to have fair and balanced workplace laws in Australia, and I commend the legislation to the House.",24
5,Mr RUDD,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Today the House has an opportunity to take an important step in building a modern Australia that delivers for working families facing cost of living pressures. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 makes the first step towards a new balanced approach to workplace relations that delivers for the economy and delivers for working families-the first step towards a system that is designed to increase rather than reduce productivity growth, the first step towards a genuine safety net for working families, ensuring that employees will no longer have basic conditions stripped away by unfair AWAs, and the first step towards a modern industrial relations system, a modern workplace relations system, that is consistent with the core Australian value of a fair go for all. Just over three months ago, Australians voted overwhelmingly against the extreme workplace relations policies and laws of the Liberal Party. For the Liberal Party, this policy was the centrepiece of their fourth term in office. It was their No. 1 priority. From July 2005, they had control of the House and the Senate-the first time that such power had been enjoyed for three decades. What did the Liberal Party do with this power? It used this power to ram through the legislation that reflects their deepest beliefs and reladeepest values-that is, Work Choices. This deepest belief is that working families and their children should be left to fend for themselves in an industrial relations system that has one organising principle and one organising principle alone, and that is the survival of the fittest: a system where hard-working people working in shops, offices, hotels, restaurants and workplaces of every kind could have the most basic award entitlements stripped away from them without any compensation. Make no mistake about it: the Liberal Party is the party of Work Choices, by Work Choices, for Work Choices. This is the policy supported in the party room and in the parliament by every one of them who were in this place before the last election, and by every one of them who, as candidates, defended this industrial relations system during the last election. The Liberal party spent $121 million of taxpayers' money trying to convince Australians to accept this extreme workplace relations system. That of itself is an obscenity. What is a double obscenity is the fact that this money was taken from the pockets of working families to try to sell, to the very same working families, the proposition that Work Choices was somehow going to be good for those working families. Throughout 2007 and at November's election, Labor outlined a clear alternative approach. This alternative reflects a core Australian value-the tradition of combining individual aspiration with a strong community safety net; a tradition that says that, to reward hard work, achievement and success through individual incentives, we do not need to become a dog-eat-dog society where working people are forced to fend for themselves. This Australian tradition says that we can provide a decent safety net and we can respect the rights of workers to bargain collectively without tying businesses up with the rigidities of a centralised wage-fixing system. The great Australian tradition is that we can have a society that protects decent minimum standards and also rewards individual effort. The Liberal Party's DNA says there is a core and absolute choice between individual aspiration and a fair go for all. Their conclusion is this: to hell with a fair go for all. bor's DNA, by contrast, says that in this country we can embrace a system that combines both aspiration and a fair go. That underlines our different approach to this core piece of law, this core piece of policy, this core piece of practice which affects every working Australian in their workplace. The Liberal Party has got this wrong, because they have got Australia wrong. They do not understand the values of working families. They do not understand the cost of living pressures on working families. They just do not understand working families, period. They went to the last election proclaiming working families had never been better off and did so without dissent from any Liberal MP or any Liberal candidate. They are so out of touch that, according to their own former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, most of their cabinet ministers were not even aware that working Australians were being made worse off by Work Choices, despite the fact that the central point of the Australian industrial relations debate through 2005, 2006 and 2007 went to the absolute detail of the Work Choices legislation regime. Late last month the Four Corners program gave us the extraordinary picture of the member for North Sydney trotting from one cabinet minister's office to the next as he told ministers, whom he claims were ignorant, that Work Choices was actually making people worse off. Hold the phone! There is some news for you. I remind the House that this was happening in the first half of 2007, although almost two years had passed since the Work Choices policy had been announced. For all that time, the people who made up the front-bench of the opposition today were defending this legislation and denying its harmful effects on working families. They just cannot work out where they stand on this legislation, even as Laof today-one moment they are opposing it, the next moment supporting it and most recently they say they are not supporting it but they are not opposing it either. The legislation that Labor introduces to the parliament highlights one further contrast between this government and the previous government. Before the previous election the Liberal Party kept their industrial relations plans secret. Once they had won the 2004 election, they sprung their extreme laws on Australians and rammed them through the parliament. In contrast, Labor announced our workplace relations policy in detail well prior to the last election and in government we are delivering on what we promised before the election. We said before the election that we would achieve a sensible transition to our new, fair and flexible system that would come into operation fully from 1 January 2010. This bill takes us a step forward towards that We said before the election we would prohibit the making of new AWAs. This bill achieves that goal. We said before the election we would allow for individual transitional employment arrangements for a twoyear period only. This bill does that. We said before the election we would modernise the award system. This bill makes that possible. We said before the election that what we needed was a balanced system and an approach that delivers appropriate flexibility for businesses but provides a genuine safety net for working families. This bill takes us towards that goal. This balanced approach to Australian workplaces is critical for both the long-term needs of the economy and our immediate priority of tackling inflation. Right now, Australia is facing a serious economic challenge arising from global financial market instability. That instability rages abroad while at the same time we have raising inflationary pressures at home. The key measure of ongoing inflation, the underlying rate of inflation, had at the time this government took office risen to the highest level in 16 years. Underlying inflation has been running at an average of three per cent, the upper limit of the RBA inflation target, for the past year and a half. It is now forecast by the RBA to stay at three per cent or higher until mid-2010. The threat of rising inflation has not emerged overnight; it has been building for years as the Howard government neglected warnings about growing supply constraints and slowing productivity growth. Back in 2005, the Liberals told us that Work Choices would deliver low inflation, low interest rates and stronger productivity growth. They claimed that Work Choices was core economic business but they had nothing-no hard data, no modelling-to support their goal. claims, and now we understand why. The member for Goldstein, for example, was very explicit when he told this chamber on 3 November 2005-and it is worth listening to this: By promoting flexibility and greatly simplifying the system of industrial relations, this legislationthat means the Work Choices legislationwill deliver better outcomes for interest rates and employment and inflation. Since then we have seen inflation reach its highest level in 16 years. Since then interest rates have risen seven times, the second highest level amongst advanced economies. Since then productivity growth has been flat and, as of when this government assumed office, had fallen to zero. The architects of Work Choices said it would lift productivity growth; it failed to do so. By failing to boost productivity growth, Work Choices failed to tackle the inflation challenge. Nor did the Liberals deal with the rest of the inflation challenge: skills shortages, infrastructure bottlenecks and profligate government spending on the demand side of the economy. The result: rising inflation and, as a result of that, rising interest rates, despite the Liberals' assurances that they would keep interest rates at record lows. Do you remember that? The assurance prior to the 2004 election, just before Work Choices legislation was introduced, that they would keep interest rates at record lows-as believable as the undertaking since that election that working families had never been better off. At a level of policy, Work Choices has been an abject failure. Work Choices has been bad for the economy. Work Choices has been bad for working families and Work Choices has also been bad for business. It has created a red-tape nightmare, especially for small businesses. Just look at the fairness test, the bandaid that was taped over Work Choices in the run-up to last year's election. By the time the Liberal Party lost office last November, employers had lodged 220,000 workplace agreements to be reviewed under the fairness test. Only 50,000 agreements had passed the test, and 9,000 of those needed to be changed before being approved. Just 72,000, less than one in three of those workplace agreements, had been finalised. There were 150,000 workplace agreements at the Workplace Authority waiting to be processed. You can just see it down there at the Workplace Authority: there is the shelf space for unprocessed applications for new workplace agreements-150,000 of themand over there you have got the 467,000 Work Choices propaganda booklets. There must have been no room on the shelves down at the Workplace Authority; none whatsoever. If you are in small business and you are trying to make sense of this extraordinary system which the previous government had implemented, consider, in a very tight labour market, the consequences of dealing with such a complex piece of legislation. For 150,000 workplace agreements to be with the Workplace Authority waiting to be processed is one of the most anti-business, proregulation, pro-red tape measures that any government of this country has ever introduced. They pretend to be not just the party of compassion but also the party of small business. If ever there was a set of statistics which underpinned the reckless disregard which the previous government and the Liberal Party had for the interests of business general and small business in particular, it was in their bandaid solution last year to their industrial relations laws, resulting in an absolute nightmare for businesses trying to operate within that regulatory environment. Harmers Workplace Lawyers estimated last year that the record-keeping requirements of Work Choices had imposed compliance costs of more than $950 million in relation to small and medium sized businesses. In the Australian Human Resources Institute survey of 1,000 human resources managers in August 2007, 55 per cent of HR managers reported that there was an increased need to seek legal advice since the introduction of Work Choices, 54 per cent reported that there was an increased level of record keeping since the introduction of Work Choices and 40 per cent said Work Choices had made employment arrangements more complicated. Asked the question of whether Work Choices was more or less likely to improve productivity, job creation or work-family balance with their organisation over the next three years, more said it was unlikely to improve these outcomes, and 78 per cent had not seen any improvement-I repeat, any improvement-in productivity since Work Choices had been introduced. In fact, five per cent had seen a decrease in productivity. AWAs did not deliver for the economy, AWAs did not deliver for business, but AWAs certainly did deliver substantial harm to the interests of working families. According to the Bureau of Statistics, workers on AWAs work more and earn less per hour than those in the same jobs who are employed on collective agreements. Last week, the Deputy Prime Minister and minister for workplace relations reported to the House on new data analysing a sample of 670 Australian workplace agreements submitted to the Workplace Authority in the two months after May 2007, when the fairness test had been announced. in This data showed that, of the sample of AWAs that had failed the fairness test, around 45 per cent underpaid workers by between $1 and $49 per week below the required rate of pay for the protected award conditions, 50 per cent paid $50 to $199 per week less than the required rate of pay, and five per cent provided $200 to $499 per week below what was required. These are extraordinary numbers. Last month, the Deputy Prime Minister again revealed other information about AWAs that had been kept secret by the previous government. That information showed that, in a total sample of over 1,700 AWAs lodged between April and October 2006, 89 per cent of those AWAs removed at least one award condition that the previous government's advertisements said was protected. Further, 31 per cent of those AWAs took away rest breaks, 49 per cent took away overtime loadings, 63 per cent removed incentive based payments and bonuses, 65 per cent removed penalty rates and 70 per cent took away shift loadings. Consider also the evidence of the impact of Work Choices on women. Women on AWAs earn less per hour than those on collective agreements. Women on AWAs who work part time earn $3.70 less per hour or $85.10 less per week, based on an average of 23 hours per week, than those on collective agreements. This unfairness lies at the heart of the Work Choices legislation. This is the legacy of the Liberal Party-the party that, three months later, wants to pretend now to be the party of compassion. What I have run through for the benefit of the House today is the cold, hard, statistical data as it impacts on working families and as it impacts on hard working small businesses. And still the Liberal Party does not know if supports Work Choices or opposes Work Choices. It is why we now come today to start to build a new, fair, flexible and modern system. The first step towards a new workplace relations system is this bill, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008. The transitional arrangements will be followed by the introduction of more substantial workplace relations legislation into the parliament later this year to ensure that the government's new, fair, flexible and productive workplace relations system can be fully operational by January 2010. If the coalition finally backflips, a big ‘if', this legislation can declare a stop to the use of AWAs now-if the coalition backflips. The transition bill ensures that Australians will no longer be forced to sign unfair AWAs that strip away key conditions with little or no compensation. From the commencement date of this legislation, no more AWAs can be created. An employer and employee can agree to terminate an AWA and replace it with another type of arrangement. We know we cannot correct every injustice of the old Work Choices system overnight. It took the Liberal Party, represented by their spokesman at the table, quite a period of time to construct such an entrenched and complex system of injustice. It will take us some time. We need to focus instead on building a system that will not allow such injustices in the future. This bill ensures sensible transitional arrangements for employers who have been using AWAs under the previously existing law. Where an employer was using AWAs as of 1 December 2007, employees on AWAs or new employees may be placed on individual transitional employment agreements that can have a nominal expiry date up to 31 December 2009. The bill abolishes the so-called it ‘fairness test' and introduces a new, genuine no disadvantage test that provides a genuine safety net for employees. The new no disadvantage test will apply to all individual and collective workplace agreements. Importantly, the bill will also make it sible for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to begin the process of award modernisation. The bill enables an award modernisation request to be made of the AIRC by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. It is intended that modern awards be simple and provide an appropriate benchmark to support collective bargaining, while at the same time providing a safety net for award-only employees. It is also intended that modern awards be relevant to the Australian economy by not being overly prescriptive and by allowing for flexible working arrangements. The AIRC will play an integral role in the award modernisation process during the transition period. The intention is to ensure that this exercise is overwhelmingly completed by the end of 2009. Modern awards will be able to contain 10 allowable modern award matters, including minimum wages; arrangements for when work is performed, including hours of work and rest breaks; overtime rates and penalty rates; and allowances. Modern awards may also build on and provide industry specific detail about the proposed National Employment Standards, the content of which will be finalised by June, following the exposure draft process that is occurring now. We are proud of this legislation because it brings to an end a system of rank injustice on the part of those opposite. We believe that it is entirely appropriate that this legislation be supported by the parliament. The modern, fair and flexible system that Labor is building demonstrates that we can build long-term prosperity without throwing the fair go out the back door. We can build long-term productivity growth while giving working people the right to bargain collectively if they choose. We can have a low inflation economy without forcing the lowest paid workers to make all the sacrifices to achieve it. The posgovernment takes very seriously its responsibility to deliver on its election commitment. That commitment was to abolish Work Choices and to build a modern balanced system that helps build long-term productivity growth while protecting the interests of working families. This legislation is the first order of business for the government. That is why it is the first bill that this government has introduced into the House. I commend the legislation to the House.

6,Ms GILLARD,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (1.00 pm)-in reply-In closing this second reading debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008, it is not my intention to speak for a long period of time, but I make the following points very briefly. The Rudd Labor government has come here today proud to start the process of getting rid of Work Choices through the passage of this bill. I have been wondering for some weeks now what it means to not support and not oppose a piece of legislation. Apparently, what it means is that you hide in your office because you do not know what you want to stand for in the modern age. This is a government that knows what it stands for. It stands for a fair, balanced and flexible industrial relations system; and, more than anything else, it stands for the delivery of the things that it promised the Australian people. Let us remind ourselves that the Liberal Party finds itself in the position it is in today because it was not honest with the Australian people. When the Australian people voted in 2004 they did not vote for their pay and conditions to be stripped away through individual workplace agreements, Australian workplace agreements, they did not vote to exchange the safety net for a limited number of so-called protected award conditions that could simply be eradicated without any compensation and with the flick of a pen, they did not put their hand up and vote for the opportunity to be dismissed at any time at and for no reason and they did not vote for a system so complex and so confusing that it fails to meet the needs of business. Having not told the Australian people the truth in 2004, that is what the Liberal Party introduced in government. There is now an attempt to completely rewrite history about its knowledge of the impact of these changes on working families. It knew it was hurting Australian working families and it delighted in it. That is the truth and no rewriting of history will cover that up. Let us remember that the Liberal Party's own Work Choices propaganda talked about Billy, the minimum wage worker who lost every condition in his award. Howard government ministers, the members of the Liberal Party today, publicly defended that as fair. These are the same people who now profess a great concern about jobs in the Australian community who said that it was fine, if you were a long-term worker, the breadwinner in your family and you had always done the right thing by your employer, and it was okay if you went to work one day and were dismissed for no reason and you had no remedy. So much for a concern about jobs and the job security of working people. They delighted in the fact that people could lose pay and conditions. They delighted in the fact that people could be thrown out the door for no reason at all and with no remedy. Since the election the Liberal Party have been trying to rewrite history and they have been struggling to try and find a way to a new position on workplace relations. And haven't we seen a variety of positions on display? No-one can predict with certainty where they are going to go next. But what we do know is that they introduced Work Choices, then they defended Work Choices, then they defended the continuation of Australian workplace agreements, then they had a vexed party room meeting and then they all did not know what they were going to do next. In that track record of dithering around the place it seems that the parliament today is going to be witness to another round of dithering because we are advised-and we do not know if we have been correctly advised-that the opposition will not move any amendments today, despite the fact that the opposition spokesperson on this commenced her speech in the second reading debate by saying: The opposition will not seek to oppose the passage of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008. However, we will move an amendment that we believe will strike the right balance between flexibility and fairness in workplace relations. She then went on to outline an amendment which would have increased the time period for interim transition employment agreements-that is, she outlined an amendment which would have kept statutory individual employment agreements in the system for longer. Ms Julie Bishop-Your bill keeps them anyway.",31
7,Ms GILLARD,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"As anticipated, right on cue, the member opposite thinks she has some point about Labor's system having in it interim transition employment agreements. I say to the member opposite that we do not apologise for giving business a sensible and measured transition. We do not apologise for that. You might have wanted to do it differently, you might have wanted to create chaos, but we do not apologise for creating a sensible and measured transition. What the member opposite, and the opposition overall, has never seemed to understand is that the interim transition employment agreements are in the system only to allow the two-year award modernisation process to go forth. Once the award modernisation is completed there is no need, going forward, for statutory individual employment agreements, and under Labor there will be no new statutory individual employment agreements from that date. They are over-done and dusted. From the date of proclamation of this bill the ity of any employer in this country to make an Australian workplace agreement, the ability of any employer in this country to rip away an award condition without compensation, will be over-done and dusted. That can still happen today, despite the so-called fairness test of the previous government, which was of course not fair at all. So, from the date of proclamation of this bill, there will be no new Australian workplace agreements, nothing for employees to fear in terms of the safety net being ripped off them, an award modernisation process, a two-year interim transition employment agreement while award modernisation is in train and then Labor's new fair, balanced, flexible system, which will protect the interests of ing families. That is what this bill is about. ‘We don't oppose; we don't support; we don't know; we're still thinking; we've got no idea'-all these divisions, and we still do not know exactly where the opposition stand. We know that they have been supporters of Work Choices, but I would be really interested in an answer to a simple question, which is: will they go to the next election promising the reintroduction of Australian workplace agreements-yes or no? It is a very simple question: yes or no? Do they stand for statutory individual employment agreements-yes or no? What will they take to the next election? We do not know. What we do know is they cover things up in the lead-up to elections. They did that in 2004. But surely they could break with tradition and be honest just once. Today is the day to do it-to declare where they stand on that central question. During the debate, and obviously in the Senate inquiry, some points have been raised about various aspects of Labor's legislation. Can I thank those who have participated in this chamber and can I thank those who abilmade submissions to the Senate inquiry. The Senate inquiry report will be available later today. Of course, we will look at the Senate inquiry report and, if there are technical clarifications that need to be made arising from the report, we will consider those. But we are saying, both in this chamber and in the Senate: there is no reason why this legislation cannot be through the parliament by the end of this week. We will do everything to organise the sitting program to ensure that that happens. What we do not know, of course, is whether all of the opposition's ‘don't support, don't oppose, don't know, can't think, don't have an amendment, do have an amendment' dithering will hold up this bill that the Australian people voted for. I work- am clearly saying both to the opposition members in this place and to the opposition members in the Senate that we will facilitate whatever is necessary to allow them to have their say but this bill should clear the parliament this week. That is what the Australian people want; that is what they voted for, and we will deliver it. On the question of award modernisation, clearly the commission will undertake the modernisation of awards. I understand that concerns were raised before the Senate inquiry about the requirement for the commission to ensure that modern awards do not contain state based differences. I would like to note for the purposes of the record that this would not prevent the commission including in awards terms and conditions that are appropriate and based on objectively ascertainable regional circumstances and on the evidence of the parties that such a term or condition is necessary to ensure a fair minimum safety net. It is appropriate that new modern awards operating in a national system should not replicate state based differences from old awards which exist merely as a matter of historical circumstance. Of course, awards will be modernised over the next two-year period. In the period of award modernisation this bill, very importantly, extends the end date for notional agreements preserving state awards and transitionally registered associations-matters that Work Choices would have brought to an end artificially, leaving thousands and thousands of workers around the country without a safety net. One thing we should remind ourselves of is that the Howard government were not only on a strategy to have Australian workplace agreements override awards and allow working families to be ripped off; the Howard government were on a strategy to kill the award system overall. They wanted it to wither and die. They wanted the only minimum conditions for employees in this country to be the five minimum conditions in the Australian fair pay and conditions standard. If re-elected at the last elecnot tion, who knows where they would have sought to go to next in terms of those five minimum conditions? Would there still have been five, or would it have become four, three, two, one or no minimum conditions for employees in the workplace? This is an important moment for this parliament. It is about delivering to the Australian people what we promise. It is about getting rid of the spectre of Work Choices from their lives. Getting rid of Work Choices is only a start-there will be more legislation to come-but it is an important start. It is the first handful of dirt in the grave in which we are burying Work Choices, and we will make sure that it is buried because we understand what it cost the Australian people-what it cost people who lost pay and conditions, what it cost people who worried about their sons and daughters in their first job, and what it cost people who lost their jobs without reason and without remedy. The members opposite, the Liberal Party, will never understand that. They will politically position, they will come out with platitudes, they will come out with things to say in this area of debate, but they will never understand what they did to Australian working families with their extremism. And they will forever be tied to Work Choices because they will forever believe in it. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",32
8,Ms JULIE BISHOP,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (1.14 pm)Notwithstanding the ideological rhetoric of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister, I must bring to the attention of the House that this piece of legislation, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008, does deliver what the government said this bill would deliver. It is in fact a flawed piece of drafting. Given that the Labor Party has had almost 12 months since it announced its policy platform on industrial relations, it is almost inconceivable that this bill is so flawed as to not come near reflecting what the government has said it will achieve. The coalition referred this bill to a Senate inquiry, against the strenuous opposition of the government, and then the time frame for the inquiry was severely truncated by the government. Nevertheless, the evidence before the inquiry has revealed that this bill is fundamentally flawed, both from a drafting and a policy perspective. There are extensive concerns with respect to the bill's complexity and drafting. I refer to comments from Professor Andrew Stewart, of Flinders University, who has stated that many of the provisions remain ‘unduly complicated and difficult to understand'. On a close analysis, it is apparent that Professor Stewart is correct: the proposed legislation complicated unnecessarily and in many areas is very difficult to understand. This confusion and complexity will impact on businesses and workers. To prevent widespread confusion and ensure transitional arrangements for workplaces across the country are adequate, the bill should be redrafted to address the numerous technical and policy concerns that have been raised in the evidence given before the Senate inquiry. Let me give you a number of examples. Whilst the bill seeks to replace existing Australian workplace agreements with another, similar form of individual statutory agreement called an ITEA-an interim AWA introduced by Labor-and in fact allows existing individual agreements to continue up to and beyond 2010, the legislation before the House is unable to accommodate particular types of employment arrangements presently able to be entered into under Australian workplace agreements. Evidence before the inquiry shows that, moving forward, this will present significant challenges for industries who are dealing with the introduction of Labor's interim AWAs, otherwise known as individual transitional employment agreements. A specific example of this is the construction sector, where, due to the transient nature of the workforce and the project nature of the work, there will be some employees that will be able to access Labor's interim AWAs and others that will not. Somebody put it in these terms: ‘There will be workers who will fall into an abyss.' This will result in workplaces having one set of workers on Labor's interim AWAs and another set of workers, carrying out the same work, who are going to be forced back onto awards. Within the construction and mining sector, industrial coverage, and thus protection from is industrial action and drawn-out completion dates, is also a commercial consideration for many principal contractors. This bill places workplaces and contractors at risk from industrial action and puts employers and employees in a position where they have different groups of workers doing the same work employed on different industrial instruments. This is a significant problem, not just for employers but also for workers, and it is one that must be rectified by the government. There are also inconsistencies within the bill with respect to the application of the no disadvantage test and the relevant standard against which these interim AWAs and collective agreements will be tested. In certain workplaces, interim AWAs will be measured against existing collective agreements instead of the new National Employment Standards. This could result in the ratcheting up of wages and conditions where this might not ordinarily occur, leading to wage inflation. This is a great concern. (Time expired)",34
9,Ms GILLARD,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (1.19 pm)-I will answer the points that have been raised so far in consideration in detail. I anticipate that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will have some more. I hope that this is not a tactic to delay the passage of the bill through the House. Can I say, in relation to the Senate inquiry, the representations made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were completely wrong. We were always happy to have a Senate inquiry. The only thing we ever asked of the opposition was that they do it on the same time frame as the last Senate inquiry was done into their last workplace relations changes-that is, we asked the opposition to apply the same standards to itself as it sought to apply to others in government. I know consistency is a hard ask for this opposition, but to represent in this parliament that we opposed having a Senate inquiry on a proper time frame is not true. Secondly, I am bemused, I would have to say, by the reference to Andrew Stewart. He is exactly the sort of person that Howard government ministers used to get up in question time and vilify because he had criticised Work Choices-remarkable indeed. I suggest to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that if she wants to ring up Andrew Stewart and ask him the simple question, ‘What did you think of Work Choices and do you think this is better?' then she had better hold the phone away from her ear as he very loudly proclaims, ‘This is better for Australian working people'-because it so clearly is. On the question of different agreements being in a workplace: now I have heard everything! This is a Liberal Party that changed workplace relations laws so that it is possible in one workplace for some workers to be on an award, for some to be on a collective agreement, for some to be on a pre-reform AWA, for some to be on a pre-fairness test AWA and for some to be on a post-fairness test AWA. Apparently the criticism of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that we are introducing another employment instrument. Can I reassure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that when Labor's system is in full operation-unlike the mess that Work Choices has created-we will have the National Employment Standards and awards creating a modern, simple safety net. We will have people able to collectively bargain to get above that safety net or people able to enter into individual common-law contracts of employment-that is, our system will be a simpler one than the scrambled mess that has been created by Work Choices. It is with some amusement that I note that one of the great debates of the last electionone of the key questions of ideology, one of the things that has defined what it is to be a Liberal in this country-now apparently comes down to a question of drafting. The opposition no longer want to be in government. They want to run the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. That is apparently their highest aspiration in life. They would prefer to be there drafting legislation. Drafting legislation might be the highest aspiration of the opposition, but at some point they are going to have to answer the question: what do they stand for? Do they still stand for Australian workplace agreements? Will they go to the next election reintroducing Australian workplace agreements? Is that what the opposition stand for, as they wander around saying: ‘We don't support and we don't oppose. Now we think we could have drafted it better, but we don't support and we don't oppose. We did have an amendment. Now we don't have an amendment. We don't know whether we will have amendments. Really, we don't really know anything.' Against that backdrop, I would seriously suggest to the opposition that, instead of pretending that they are parliamentary draftspeople, they actually say something about what they believe in and, if they are not able to do that, then they get out of the way of a government that knows what it believes it.",35
10,Ms JULIE BISHOP,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (1.23 pm)Legislation has the potential to impact on the everyday lives of Australians. I am amazed that the Deputy Prime Minister seeks to ridicule the evidence given before a Senate inquiry. She seeks to ridicule the evidence given before a Senate inquiry as to the complexity and the flawed nature of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 and she seeks to ridicule Professor Andrew Stewart, whose evidence was: ... the ... provisions remain unduly complicated and difficult to understand ... I would suggest that Professor Stewart's concerns be treated with respect. The premise upon which this bill is based-that is, the abolition of Australian workplace agreements-is in fact false. That is not what this bill does. The Labor Party have led the public to believe that individual statutory agreements will no longer exist in workplaces in Australia-certainly not beyond 2010. We all remember the statements in their document of April 2007-that is, the document of the now Deputy Prime Minister before the now Prime Minister had to come in and pull her into line. This document said on page 3: AWAs and statutory individual contracts will be a part of Labor's fair and balanced workplace laws. That is, in fact, not the case. Time after the Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, and the Deputy Prime Minister, the then shadow minister for workplace relations, said, for example: Australian Workplace Agreements are no part of Labor's industrial future for this country. Ms Gillard-Hear, hear! Exactly right.",36
11,Ms JULIE BISHOP,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"That is not correct. They went on to say: Our laws will abolish AWAs ... The now Deputy Prime Minister said on 2 May 2007: We will be getting rid of Australian workplace agreements. The Prime Minister, when he was the Leader of the Opposition, said statutory AWAs were, for Labor, ‘simply unacceptable'. He later went on to say: We see no need whatsoever for individual statutory agreements. The Australian public would be able to draw from that that there will be no individual agreements in workplaces across Australia beyond 2010 or, as the Policy implementation plan said, that 31 December 2012 would be the ‘last possible expiry date for all Work Choices AWAs'. The public thought that that meant that Labor's policy was there would be no individual statutory agreements beyond 2010 or, most certainly, beyond 2012. But, in fact, evidence provided to the Senate inquiry has revealed that individual statutory agreements can continue indefinitely where the employer or the employee chooses not to terminate the agreement. These arrangements can continue indefinitely for AWAs and for Labor's interim AWAs, the ITEAs. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister were at it again today in the House, refusnot ing to acknowledge that, at the nominal expiry date of an individual statutory agreement-whether it is an AWA or one of Latime, bor's new interim AWAs-that agreement can continue.

14,Ms GILLARD,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Clearly, there is now a strategy by the opposition to extend Work Choices. It is what they believe in and it is what they are trying to do. This is clearly a content-less filibuster in order to extend Work Choices. They do not want the Australian public, immediately after Easter, to have the reassurance that they can walk into workplaces knowing that no-one can ask them to sign an Australian workplace agreement that rips away award conditions. That is what Work Choices guaranteed. That is what it is guaranteeing even today. We are trying to get rid of it, and here we have a content-less filibuster to try and keep Work Choices going as long as possible. We know that it was the position of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and many in her party room to keep Work Choices. But, as has been so well documented in the media, that was not the position of the balance of her party room, who actually wanted this legislation to go through. The opposition say they do not support, they do not oppose, they do not know and they really cannot think about it. The best thing they could do would be to let this legislation through into the Senate so that we can deliver to the Australian people on a reasonable timetable what they voted for. We know that the concept to actually do what the Australian people voted for in workplace relations strikes the Liberal Party as grandly odd because it is not a concept that has ever exercised the minds of the Liberal Party. They did not go to the 2004 election asking people what they wanted to vote for. They cooked up Work Choices in secret and then imposed it on the Australian Can I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that it does strike me as passing strange that, having introduced Work Choices in this country and having fought the last election in favour of Work Choices, her criticism of the government now is apparently that we are not getting rid of it quickly enough! I mean, really! Mr Deputy Speaker, you would probably recall that industrial relations was one of the single biggest things talked about in the lead-up to the last election. It was not a side issue; it was at the centre of the election campaign. Anybody who had looked at Labor's policy in the period before the last election-and millions of voting Australians did-would have found that it described absolutely that we would pass a transition bill to end the making of new Australian workplace agreements and that we would have a two-year transition period in which awards would be modernised. We said that people would have access to an individual transition employment agreement during that period but it would be strictly limited in terms of which employers could use it and for what categories of employees, and it would have to pass a full no disadvantage test against the underlying industrial instrument-that is, we would end the rip-offs. We said that we would then move to a substantive bill that delivered on the rest of Labor's commitments. We always clearly said in that policy, as part of promising a sensible and measured transition to the Australian people, that Australian workplace agreements that were in operation at the time of the passage of the transition bill would stay in operation for the balance of their term and then, in accordance with normal industrial relations law and practice, when they hit the nominal expiry date, people could make decisions about what to do next. One of the decisions they might make is that they would like to enter into a collective agreement. One of the decisions they might make is that they would like to enter into an individual common-law contract that respects the safety net. Of course, agreements in accordance with industrial law, whether they are collective agreements or individual agreements, continue to the nominal expiry date and beyond until people make that election about what they are going to do next. What is the reason for that? The reason is to give people certainty. This is not a politicontradiction. cal point; this is ‘Labour Law 101'. There would be university lecture halls around this country that are having a more sophisticated dialogue than the opposition is capable of today. We promised this bill to the Australian people and the opposition apparently does not oppose it. So stop filibustering because, if you hold this bill up, any Australian who loses a condition will have you to hold responsible. (Time expired)",38
15,Ms JULIE BISHOP,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (1.34 pm)Indeed, one of the decisions that employees and employers can make upon the expiration of the nominal expiry date is that the Australian workplace agreement or the interim AWA can continue indefinitely. I believe the Australian public will be very interested to know that Labor's own bill does not abolish individual statutory agreements and that, in workplaces across Australia, employees and employers are entitled to continue working under individual statutory agreements. Once again, this is all Labor's spin and when you go to the detail the truth is revealed. There has also been much concern raised in the Senate inquiry by stakeholders and both sides of politics about the workability the award modernisation scheme. The coalition is particularly concerned about comments made to the Senate inquiry by Professor Andrew Stewart, who submitted that: It is simply not possible to standardise conditions in any award-reliant industry or occupation without disadvantaging someone. One of the minister's own Labor colleagues, Senator Marshall, suggested last week that the ALP plan for award modernisation without disadvantaging workers or increasing employers' costs was ‘contradictory and an impossible ask'. I ask the minister to respond to Senator Marshall's concerns about this Of all the areas within the bill, this is the most flawed and of greatest concern. On the one hand the ALP want to oversee the eventual demise, they say, of individual statutory agreements, yet on the other hand they are not prepared to extend the life of ITEAs until such time as there is an adequate set of modern award conditions in place. Senator Marshall's concerns about the contradictory nature of this ought to be taken into account. To top it off, the Senate inquiry revealed that the government had neither undertaken nor commissioned any economic modelling or economic analysis of the impact of its transition bill or indeed its industrial relations agenda more broadly. Given that unemployment is at its lowest level in 34 years and long-term unemployment has decreased significantly during the decade of workplace reform under the Howard government, we are amazed that the Labor Party are so dismissive of the impact this bill will have on jobs. They have done nothing about getting any economic modelling or analysis on its impact on jobs. There is nothing fair about unemployment. I am at a loss to understand why Labor of has not published any analysis-positive or negative-on the impact on jobs. We are aware that the minister has a report from Econtech that analysed the impact of Labor's broader industrial relations agenda and conservatively estimated that it will result in a 2.4 per cent increase in unemployment and a potential loss of 268,000 jobs. The minister has refused to release this report publicly. What does she have to hide? It is the responsibility of the government of the day to draft legislation that can plemented without confusion, without complexity and without subsequent damage to the economy. The government is obliged to consider the evidence given to the Senate inquiry and respond with the necessary amendments to ensure that the legislation reflects the promises that Labor made to business, industry and workers before the election. My initial proposal alluded to in my speech in the second reading debate, to amend the bill to extend the life of Labor's interim statutory agreements, is no longer necessary in the light of the evidence before the inquiry. I remind the House again of the evidence of Finn Pratt, an assistant secretary in DEEWR. Existing AWAs and the new individual statutory agreements introduced by Labor can continue indefinitely-and that is what I was seeking to do with the amendment-into the future, provided neither party seeks to terminate or renegotiate the agreement. It is a well-known fact that there are thousands of agreements that have continued for many decades on the same terms and conditions. The coalition does not support this legislation but we will not oppose its passage to the Senate.",39

If that is the case we will hear again from the Deputy be imLeader of the Opposition and then do what the Australian people want us to do, which is to pass the bill which they voted for. In relation to the last representations and silly statements by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-no doubt she will stand at the dispatch box and make another series of silly statements which I will leave unansweredthe Howard government never produced any economic modelling of Work Choices. I will not stand here as a member of the Rudd Labor government and be lectured by the current opposition on the question of the production of economic modelling. Indeed, her request for it is the height of hypocrisy. For the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to describe her proposal in her speech on the second reading as something that has been satisfied through the Senate inquiry process is a cover-up of the fact that she has clearly been rolled by her party room again. She tried to achieve yet another extension of Australian workplace agreements, because she believes in Work Choices-she believes in AWAs that can rip people off. She put that position to the party room, she got rolled and she clearly got rolled again on the amendment. I will give the Deputy Leader of the Opposition this: at least she knows what she believes in and she is prepared to stand up for it. I have to give the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that. I can understand her high state of anger with her colleagues whom she described in the media as having ‘gone to water'. I can understand that. She at least knows what she believes in. She believes in Work Choices and she always will. But this government was elected to deliver something different. It is this bill. We are seeking sage of it through the House of Representatives today. We will receive the Senate inquiry report. We always supported there being a Senate inquiry with a proper time frame. We will consider what the Senate inquiry report says. But having had that consideration I can see no reason why this bill cannot pass the parliament this week so we can end forever the spectre that Australians walk into their workplaces to be confronted by an Australian workplace agreement that takes away an award condition from them without any, or any proper, compensation. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition can carry on about nominal expiry dates and time periods for agreements, but what she and the Liberal Party know is this: the only thing that ensured the end of Australian workplace agreements that can rip conditions away was the election of the Rudd Labor government. We would never have got to this point had the Howard government been re-elected. She will dismiss it-she will carry on about nominal expiry dates-but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition must concede that next week when this bill is proclaimed there will never again be an Australian worker who walks into their workplace fearful that that is the day when an Australian workplace agreement gets shoved into their hands that takes away an award condition for no proper compensation or perhaps no compensation at all. I think that is a truly historic Rudd Labor government believes it to be a truly historic step. It is what the Australian people voted for when they repudiated Work Choices and the party of Work Choices-the Liberal Party.",40

We also understand that the Senate committee will deliver its report on the inquiry sometime this afternoon. The pascoalition understands that the Labor government is keen to put its election promises into action, but it should heed the warnings that this bill will not achieve what Labor said it would achieve. The minister should put aside her ideological rhetoric and admit that the bill is so poorly drafted and deficient that it should be withdrawn and redrafted. She should listen to the evidence that has already been given that shows what impact the inconsistencies and the complexities will have on business, particularly the construction and mining sector, which has done so much to underpin the economic strength that we are currently experiencing.

The tion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time.",41
21,Ms JACKSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today in support of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Communications Fund) Bill 2008. We are in the midst of an exciting and ever-changing global telecommunications environment. When federal Labor announced its broadband policy last March, it indicated then that it would use the funds in the Communications Fund to partly finance its commitment to establish a national broadband network. This bill represents an early step in the process to deliver on this significant election commitment, a commitment that will see an investment on a promise to deliver a world-class national broadband network, with minimum speeds of 12 megabits per second to 98 per cent of Australian homes and businesses, to be rolled out over the next five years. This bill amends part 9C of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 to enable money in the Communications Fund to be used for the purposes of funding a national broadband network. The use of the fund will be entirely consistent with the purpose for which it was intended: to improve telecommunications in rural and regional Australia. The Rudd Labor government is determined to bring Australia out of the technological black hole we were left to wallow in for 11½ long years by the Howard-Costello government. In his speech to the House on 12 March, the member for Dunkley claimed that this bill was: ... the first effort to unravel all of that sound public policy ... the future proofing protection ... remote ... and regional Australia had looked for to give them comfort ... He referred to the Rudd government's decision to invest in a national broadband network and access the fund as a ‘statesanctioned smash and grab raid'. He called the National Broadband Network commitment a ‘vague' and ‘citycentric idea' and a ‘sound bite' which ‘the Rudd government is struggling to turn into public policy'. It is remarkable that the member for Dunkley would say that when for 11½ years the Howard-Costello government was aware of major problems in accessing broadband around Australia, in particular in regional and remote parts of Australia, much of which is in my own state of Western Australia. In that time it virtually sat on its hands and did nothing or little while the caravan moved on. The previous government did not build a national broadband network. Furthermore, it only promised to create one in 2007 after it realised how popular with voters Labor's plan was. The previous government legislated to quarantine the $2 billion Communications Fund so that only interest earned could be used and to only allow expenditure of the revenue stream. Under this approach, approximately $400 million would have been available to improve telecommunications in regional, rural and remote Australia every three years. The member for Dunkley said that the Communications Fund was put in place to protect rural and regional Australians against the emergence of a new digital divide as technology moves forward. Frankly, by opposing this bill the opposition appear to want to ensure that a digital divide continues. Without the Rudd government's proposal, homes and businesses would have been left out in the cold without the best fibre technology available to them. The Howard-Costello government were that not nation builders. They were tired and out of touch. They completely failed to recognise that a reliable, high-speed broadband network is, to our nation in this century, the modern equivalent of the railway network in the late 19th century. They failed to comprehend how critical a modern telecommunications infrastructure is for productivity growth and to our economy. They failed to understand that a national broadband network is a critical tool for small businesses for effective e-health and education services. We saw something like 17 so-called broadband proposals during the life of the Howard-Costello government which seemed to go nowhere. It took the previous government 11 years to announce a task force, a task force that was widely criticised as not having the requisite skills to ensure the best outcome for Australians, with guidelines that provided almost no clarity on the objectives of that task force and their process. It was only when they found themselves staring down the barrel of the 2007 federal election that the previous government finally announced a belated broadband plan. They came up with a simple two-tiered, two-class plan they called ‘Australia Connected', which was condemned by some people in regional and rural Australia as a second-class service delivered by an outdated system. The tired Howard-Costello government failed the Australian people by promising a substandard broadband plan that would have done little to improve current levels of telecommunications infrastructure in Australia, particularly in my electorate of Hasluck. This was not a long-term vision that would have served the people of this country. This was just another illusion. There can be no denying that, as a consequence of the previous government floundering on the National Broadband Network, Australia is behind in the digital dark ages. Time and again the Howard-Costello government demonstrated that they were not nation builders. Instead, we witnessed bandaid, quick-fix solutions that the now opposition hoped would help them scrape through to the next election, and during that time Australia went backwards compared with the rest of the world in broadband and broadband infrastructure. Our future productivity relies upon a national broadband network that will open new markets for Australian business and drive economic productivity and growth in the future. The Australian people deserve a world-class, fibre-to-thenode broadband future that will guide Australia's economy, and the Rudd Labor government is proud that we have a plan that will contribute to the well-being and long term economic prosperity of Australians everywhere. I hosted a forum in my electorate of Hasluck last year with the now Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator the Hon. Stephen Conroy, to discuss telecommunications with community members. We were both struck by the level of frustration felt by constituents about the lack of adequate, reliable telecommunications and broadband services in their suburbs. These complaints were often from people who lived only a few kilometres from the nearest exchange. My office regularly receives complaints from constituents who are tired and fed up with being passed around and are trying to find out why they and other residents in their streets and suburbs are still unable to obtain broadband access. People who live no more than 10 or 20 minutes from the Perth CBD have no access to broadband, despite several applications to their ISPs, because the infrastructure is not available to them. I find it appalling that even today a web designer who lives in Huntingdale and runs his business from home has to make do with the old dial-up system. These are hard working residents and constituents who depend upon broadband access to provide for their families while trying to sustain their own businesses and livelihoods, yet they have been told again and again that they do not live in areas which can be accessed by broadband. These are just some of the people the previous government failed. Under the Rudd government's National Broadband Network, the hard-working families and business owners in my electorate, from Maddington to Helena Valley, will finally have access to the digital services they deserve. The government has committed an investment of up to $4.7 billion to establish a new high-speed broadband network, in partnership with the private sector, to 98 per cent of Australian homes and businesses over the next five years. As I have said, this is critical to our long-term social and economic prosperity. The bill also ensures that Australians in rural and regional areas are not forgotten. Indeed, the need for investment in telecommunications services is greater in rural and regional Australia than it is in our major capital cities. I know this as someone who grew up in the bush and who understands the importance of services to people who live and work in our rural and regional areas. Increasingly now we are seeing advances in technology, allowing people access to more sophisticated diagnostic services in health and to better and more reliable education services-all dependent on decent access to broadband or a high-speed broadband network, something that for over a decade, as I have said, the Howard government failed to properly invest in. I am also pleased that the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee, chaired by Dr Bill Glasson, announced in February that it intends to run a national program of public meetings in regional Australia to address the adequacy of telecommunications in rural and remote parts of the country and that these public hearings will commence in Western Australia. Given the potential importance of the committee's findings, I welcome the government's decision to extend the report of the Regional and Telecommunications Independent Review Committee to August 2008. This will allow the committee to consider the National Broadband Network and other government policies which will benefit regional telecommunications across Australia in making their recommendations. The bill amends the existing act to allow funds to be drawn from the $2 billion principal in the Communications Fund rather than the revenue stream of $400 million that would have been made available every three years to spend on improving telecommunications in rural and regional Australia. By contrast, this government is prepared to invest $4.7 billion to fund this critical piece of national infrastructure now. The government is determined to ensure that Australians in regional and remote areas are able to access reliable high-speed broadband services. It is worth noting that regional Australians would have been waiting 35 years longer to achieve the same level of investment under the previous government's legislation. We are currently experiencing an unprecedented technological transformation in almost every aspect of our lives. It is time that we started to meet the challenge of putting Australia on an equal footing with our global competitors after so many years of neglect. As I have said, I think it is extraordinary that members opposite claim to be concerned about access to technological services such as high-speed broadband by those in regional and remote Australia when there is such a stark difference in the preparedness to invest in providing that kind of infrastructure to people who live in our regional and remote areas. It demonstrates that the Rudd Labor government understands that broadband and the digital economy are crucial to Australia's long-term prosperity and that, unlike its predecessor, this government has a plan which will lead Australia out of the telecommunications dark ages and into the digital future. This bill represents a significant milestone in the implementation of the Rudd government's initiative to give Australia as a whole a first-class broadband network for the future, a commitment that was extremely popular at the 2007 federal election. I commend this bill to the House. Debate interrupted. NA Hon. Clyde Robert Cameron AO",41
22,Mr RUDD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House record its deep regret at the death on 14 March 2008 of the Hon. Clyde Robert Cameron AO, former minister and member for Hindmarsh, and place on record its appreciation for his long and meritorious public service and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Clyde Cameron was the member for Hindmarsh for 31 years, from 1949 to 1980, an era spanning from the end of Ben Chifley's time as Prime Minister to Bob Hawke's election to the seat of Wills. After the death of Kim Beazley Sr in October last year, he was the sole surviving member of the parliament elected in 1949; Clyde Cameron was the last of ‘the 49ers'. Clyde Cameron was a cabinet minister in the Whitlam government, a prolific author and a leading figure in the Australian labour movement for more than 40 years. Clyde Cameron was born on 11 February 1913 at Murray Bridge, South Australia, the son of a shearer of Scottish descent. It was a poor but happy upbringing. As he said many years later: We assumed that it was the natural order of things that children did not wear shoes and would have to go to school barefooted. He left school at 14 to work as a shearer. He experienced unemployment during the depths of the Great Depression and, during the rest of the 1930s, worked in every Australian state and in New Zealand as well. His harsh experience of working life, combined with a political awareness that he had learned at the family dinner table, led him to become a lifelong supporter of the working people's movement and, in fact, an active participant in the Australian labour movement. In The Confessions of Clyde Cameron, published in 1990, he remarked of his mother: Every mealtime she used to talk with us about the state of society, explaining that it did to be the way it was. If we took an intelligent interest in politics and exercised our right to vote when we became old enough, then we could change things … I can honestly say that I do not remember a meal at which political and social questions were not mentioned by my mother. Clyde Cameron's commitment to changing things began with an active role in the Australian Workers Union from a very early age. He gained a reputation for his dedication to improving the working conditions of shearers. He travelled the sheds across much of southern Australia, meeting with shearers and often sleeping in the back of his car before travelling the next day to another remote location. By 1941, at the age of just 28, he had become South Australian state president and federal vice-president of the AWU. From 1943 to 1948 he was the union's industrial advocate and taught himself industrial law. Clyde became State President of the Labor Party for South Australia in 1946, and at the 1949 election he was elected to the House of Representatives for the Labor seat of Hindmarsh. His entry marked the beginning of 23 years in opposition for Labor. He rose quickly to become a leader of the Left within the Labor caucus and, during the split of the 1950s, he played a prominent role opposing the influence of the industrial groupers. Clyde Cameron served in the shadow cabinet for two decades, from 1953 to 1972. In the Whitlam Labor government, he served as Minister for Labour, from 1972 to 1974; Minister for Labour and Immigration, from 1974 to 1975; and Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs, in 1975. One of Clyde Cameron's greatest achievements in office was taking the case for equal pay for women workers before the arbitration commission. That case was argued by Mary Gaudron, later, of course, the first woman to be appointed to the High Court bench. Clyde Cameron was an effective and able not have parliamentarian, a great storyteller who brought passion, intelligence and colour to parliamentary life and then to political and historical debate afterwards. After retiring from the federal parliament, he played a major role in documenting Labor history and interviewed prominent political and other national figures as part of the National Library's oral history program. His published works include The Cameron Diaries of 1990 and The Confessions of Clyde Cameron, also of that time. Clyde remained a frequent contributor to public debate well into his 80s. Clyde Cameron was a tough and passionate man who was as hard on his own side of politics as he was on his opponents. It is that he could bear the odd grudge for a while, yet he was able to deal with political opponents like Menzies and Gorton with a great generosity of spirit. His personal relationships aside, Clyde Cameron's commitment to working men and women remained paramount throughout his life. This was recognised when, in 1982, he was awarded the Officer of the Order of Australia. On behalf of the government, I offer condolences to his wife, Doris, and his family.",44
23,Dr NELSON,CONDOLENCES,"I rise on behalf of the opposition and alternative government in support of this condolence motion. The Hon. Clyde Cameron was by all accounts a good man: a great servant and sometimes critic of his political party but always a man who believed in building a stronger and a better Australia as he saw it. His passing marks, in many ways, the end of an era in Australian public life. Born in Murray Bridge on 11 February 1913, he was the son of a shearer. He was educated at Gawler but left school at 14 on the eve of the Great Depression and worked as a shearer. At the outbreak of the war, Clyde married Cherie Krahe, with whom he had three children, Warren, Noel and Tania. From an early age he was active in the Australian Workers Union and the Australian Labor Party, becoming an AWU organiser and then South Australian state secretary and federal vice-president of that union in 1941. In 1946 he became State President of the South Australian branch of the Labor Party and in 1949 he was elected to the House of Representatives for the seat of Hindmarsh, being re-elected on 12 subsequent occasions. In 1969, Gough Whitlam appointed him shadow minister for labour, and on 19 December 1972, following the Whitlam victory, true Cameron was appointed Minister for Labour, at the age of 58. It is said that at the first cabinet meeting Gough Whitlam listed the academic qualifications of the cabinet to show that it was the best qualified Labor cabinet ever. Cameron is reported to have said: What a relief, we wouldn't want any drongos here like Scullin and Chifley. Despite the relationship between Whitlam and Cameron disintegrating in later years, Whitlam hailed Clyde as a principal architect of the Whitlam victory in 1972. He played an important role in delivering the necessary reforms that actually made Labor electable that year, and particularly was instrumental in supporting Whitlam's move in 1970 to reform the Victorian branch of the Labor Party and remove its extreme left leadership. Following the 1974 election, he was appointed Minister for Labour and Immigration and finally he retired from the federal parliament at the 1980 election, at which point he was joint father of the House. He was a part of a generation of Labor politicians that spent 23 years in opposition, and he spent only three of his 31 years in parliament on the government benches. Despite his formidable nature and often fiery engagement with his political opponents, Jim Killen once observed, ‘The softest part of Cameron is his teeth.' Clyde Cameron earned the respect of the conservative parties. Phillip Lynch, during his valedictory address, described him as one of the giants of the parliament. Clyde Cameron formed friendships with many of his opponents, including a very strong relationship with the late Sir John Gorton, who often stayed with Clyde when visiting Adelaide. Notwithstanding the many mistakes of the Whitlam years, Clyde Cameron's move to throw the support of the federal government behind equal pay for women workers by appointing now High Court Justice Mary Gaudron to argue the case before the Arbitration and Conciliation Commission was a significant and enduring achievement of which we should all be proud. He improved the pay and conditions of public servants, yet came to later regret seeking to use the public sector as a pacesetter for the private sector. A real wage surge in 1974 of around 12 per cent, led by the public service, was very damaging to the Australian economy and a major contributing factor to rising unemployment. He later described the introduction of a 17.5 per cent annual leave loading as ‘a stupid decision'. He was a dedicated and tireless parliamentarian and a devoted servant of and advocate on behalf of the Labor Party and the labour movement. He died on Friday in Adelaide and he is survived by his wife, Doris, whom he married in 1967, and by his three children. This recognises the passing of a great man, a great Australian, and the condolences of the Liberal and National parties are strongly provided to his family and those who loved him.",46
24,Mr GEORGANAS,CONDOLENCES,"I rise today to speak on the condolence motion for the late the Hon. Clyde Robert Cameron. Clyde was the first politician I ever met. It was during the election of 1977 that I met Clyde and handed out how-tovotes for him at Cowandilla Primary School. Anyone that met Clyde was in awe of his great presence, frank nature and ability, which commanded the attention of any audience. He was a great man, someone that I and all that knew him truly admired. Clyde was one of the last of his era to pass away, following other greats such as Mick Young, Reg Bishop and his brother Don Cameron, among others from South Australia. Personally, I feel very privileged to have known Clyde all these years. Clyde always offered his advice on all matters political throughout my career. He kept a keen interest in politics throughout his entire life, even in his last years. This interest was evident in his involvement in Hindmarsh campaigns. He was active in each one of the last three Hindmarsh campaigns and, as I said, I felt very privileged to have such a great man supporting me and the Labor Party. He colaunched my 1998 and 2001 campaigns, together with Kim Beazley, and was front and centre for the opening of the Hindmarsh electorate office when I was elected a couple of years ago. The 1998 Hindmarsh campaign was launched by Clyde at the Hilton Hotel. A miscommunication lead to Clyde thinking that it was to be at the ritzy Adelaide city Hilton Hotel, only for him to be told, with great relief, that the campaign launch was at the Hilton Hotel in the working class suburb of Hilton. It is a working man's pub, where Clyde felt comfortable and stood proudly to discuss the trials and tribulations of a working man's life. Clyde was always involved in varying ways within the South Australian labour movement and it was his passion to help those that he felt were underrepresented. Clyde would call me on a regular basis, keeping me informed of his dealings within Hindmarsh and passing on messages to be delivered either to the then Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, or to last year's Leader of the Opposition-and today's Prime Minister-Kevin Rudd. I remember a call I received from Clyde shortly after 24 November last year. I could feel the smile radiating from his face. He knew that his passion for the working man would again be something that was taken very seriously. Clyde Cameron was the member for Hindmarsh for 31 years. His dedication to his electorate has been long remembered by many members of the community, who often mention this great man's defence of the working man's rights. Clyde held great rapport with those in the electorate of Hindmarsh and with many individuals across South Australia. He had great links with the array of communities he represented. Clyde was a true believer, a true Labor man. His commitment to the working class was evident in his actions as a member of parliament, as a union representative and as a member of the Australian community. He joined the ALP at the young age of 15, as a young boy who would continue on to become one of the most influential men in the South Australian political and labour movements. His father was a shearer who worked hard to support his family and their farm in rural South Australia. There were many nights around the dinner table where Clyde would be encouraged by his mother to enter into discussions about issues relating to polipolitical tics. Being bought up in a small, modest country town, Clyde's roots in South Australia were firmly placed in Australia's working class. His childhood and the great influence of his parents fomented his beliefs in the Australian fair go. Clyde joined his father as a shearer during his young years before his election as a full time organiser for the Adelaide branch of the Australian Workers Union. His work at the AWU ensured that pastoralists fully observed the shearers award and he focused on the standard of hygiene within the workplace. He sat on the opposition benches from 1953 to 1972, before becoming the Minister for Labour and Immigration and also the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs in the Whitlam government. He introduced equal pay and the concept of flexitime-allowing workers to stagger their hours, principally to accommodate school-age children. These changes initiated by Clyde still have an effect on the working lives of Australians. His legacy will not be forgotten. Clyde's great support of the unions and his reforming of the union movement led to the establishment of the Clyde Cameron College in Wodonga, which was an education centre. Clyde never forgot the working man. He would be smiling down on us today, as the working man's rights are a centrepiece of discussion in our parliament. For me, it has been an honour and a privilege to know Clyde, as it has been for all the others that knew him. I feel very humble that I now represent the seat that such a great man, who contributed so much to Australia and contributed so much to Australian working people, represented. I would like to conclude by expressing my deepest sympathies to his wife, Doris, his children and his many grandchildren.",47
25,Ms JULIE BISHOP,CONDOLENCES,"The passing of significant characters from our history is always a cause for reflection on the part of serving members in this House, and that is an extremely appropriate course of action because it is an opportunity to reflect on the great political debates of the time and on the impact on the nation. Clyde Cameron began his political career as a renowned trade union hard man and was legendary for his so-called hatred of those on this side of the chamber. Yet, over time, he earned the respect of all sides of politics. When appointed to the Whitlam cabinet as Minister for Labour, he demonstrated that he was able to rise above ideology and to act in what he believed to be the national interest. Given his background and beliefs, the unions had high hopes that Clyde Cameron would bring greatly improved benefits for industrial workers. There were great expectations of increased salaries across the board for union members. However, when faced with the realities of managing budgets and managing the economy, Clyde Cameron tried to resist spiralling wage demands, which would fuel inflation. Cameron's stance put him at odds with many of his Labor colleagues at the time and his relationship with Gough Whitlam deteriorated. He became increasingly critical of union leaders who, he saw it, blindly pursued wage rises without regard to the state of the economy or to the policies of their own Labor government. Much to the surprise of some of his colleagues, Clyde Cameron revealed a feminist streak when he appointed Mary Gaudron to argue the government's case before the arbitration commission for equal pay for women workers. Clearly, he recognised Mary Gaudron's competence as a lawyer, and she went on to be the first woman appointed to the High Court bench. Through Clyde Cameron's long parliamentary career and his commitment to the national interest, he demonstrated that he was true to the motivation of most members who enter this parliament-that is, the desire to make a difference and to spend our time here in this place working for the betterment of our fellow Australians. I offer condolences to the family of Clyde Cameron.",48
26,Mr DOWNER,CONDOLENCES,"I just very briefly want to add my support to this condolence motion because it is my view that Clyde Cameron was one of the greatest political figures to emerge from South Australia. He was a really great man in many ways. He was a great friend of my parentsinitially, of my father. They came into the House together in 1949. My father was a quite traditional conservative and Clyde Cameron was not much of what you see on the other side these days but a very traditional representative of working people. He did a wonderful job standing up for working people throughout his life. Whilst I do not think my father ever agreed with too many of his policies, and was very critical of them on occasions, the friendship that developed between them and, in time, between Clyde and my mother, right up until the time of Clyde's death, is an illustration of the type of man Clyde Cameron was. He was a man of enormous integrity. He as was very tough. He was often extremely acerbic, as members on both sides of the House I think would know. He was a great champion of working people, as he saw it. He was also an extremely amusing man and he was able to build relationships right across the political spectrum-very close and very personal relationships. He will be greatly missed. As I said at the beginning, he really was one of the greatest political figures, Liberal or Labor, or Democrat for that matter, that South Australia has produced. He will be very sorely missed, and I want to extend my condolences to Doris and to his family.",49

30,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that, as shadow foreign affairs minister, he accompanied a Chinese importer of Australian telecommunications products, Beijing AustChina Technology, on a paid trip to Sudan, in June and July 2006, where the company pursued a number of business deals?",50
31,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Any sponsored travel of mine is fully documented in my pecuniary interests register. I stand by everything is in that register. HMAS Sydney,50
32,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the discovery of HMAS Sydney?,50
33,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I am pleased to inform the House that one of Australia's most enduring maritime mysteries has now been resolved, at least in substantial part. Last night the final resting place of the missing Royal Australian Navy cruiser HMAS Sydney was confirmed. In 1941 HMAS Sydney, the most famous of the RAN ships at the time, was sunk as the result of a naval engagement with the German raider Kormoran. The Sydney had already returned from the Mediterranean, where it had been engaged gallantly in action, including most significantly against a more heavily armed Italian cruiser, the Bartolomeo Colleoni. In the Indian Ocean, however, the engagement with the Kormoran resulted in both the Kormoran and HMAS Sydney going down. In the case of HMAS Sydney, tragically we lost all 645 members of the crew. This was the largest loss of life in a single naval incident on the part of the Royal Australian Navy. Until yesterday the families of those crew members did not know the final resting place of their loved ones. Now they know. But that knowledge reminds them of a loss and, though more than 60 years have now passed, that loss is still keenly felt. On behalf of the government, and I believe on behalf of the parliament, we convey our condolences to all surviving family members of those who tragically lost their lives in the service of their country on board HMAS Sydney. Finding the location of the German raider which HSK Kormoran was the key to finding HMAS Sydney. The Kormoran was found approximately 112 nautical miles off Steep Point, in Western Australia, and it is lying in about 2,500 metres of water. The Australian government has advised the German government of this find. The Sydney was found around 12 nautical miles from the wreck of the Kormoran, and it is also lying in 2,500 metres of water. The government's advice is that the location of the wreck and its dimensions give certainty to the fact that HMAS Sydney has indeed been found. The debate, however, will now continue as to the precise circumstances surrounding the sinking of the Sydney. That debate will now be aided by undersea photography that will emerge as a result of the discovery of the wreck site. It is important that we have now moved to protect the site of the wreck of HMAS Sydney. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has used interim orders to declare both sites to be historic shipwrecks under the Historic Shipwrecks Act, thereby preventing any removal or disturbance of the shipwrecks without formal approval. I wish to thank all of those involved in the search for HMAS Sydney. The Finding Sydney Foundation has done research work over many years to identify the most likely location of the wreck, and it has organised the current search. The crew of the SV Geosounder, the ship that conducted the search, are to be congratulated for their fine work, as is the Royal Australian Navy for the excellent support they have given to the search foundation. I also thank the governments of New South Wales and Western Australia and the former Australian government for the financial support that they committed to this project. This is a historic day for the nation and it is a sad day for the nation. It is a historic day for the Royal Australian Navy and it is a sad day for the Navy. It is also a deeply sad day for the families of those who lost loved ones on the Sydney. Today in this parliament we honour the memory of those who served their country with courage and with pride. We honour also their families, who now suffer a renewal of acute loss and grief.",50
34,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On indulgence, I strongly support the remarks of the Prime Minister and congratulate the Sydney search group for their determination to find the wreck of HMAS Sydney. HMAS Sydney and the 645 men who went down in 1941 were lost, but never Australia's pride, resilience and determination. The very deep wounds in Australian families, in the Royal Australian Navy and in our nation can now begin to heal. I thank the Prime Minister for his remarks in relation to this. I also recognise the fact that the member for Dunkley and others were instrumental in seeing that the funding was made available for this search. Beijing AustChina Technology",51
35,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to an earlier question concerning his visit to Sudan in 2006. Did the Prime Minister attend any business meetings in Sudan in June and July 2006 involving Beijing AustChina Technology and corporate representatives of the Sudanese government or any other companies?,51
36,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is no, no-one accompanied me on that visit. I am advised that that company has also been a significant financial contributor to the National Party. Tibet",51
37,Ms KING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister advise the House of the Australian government's approach to developments in Tibet?,51
38,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. The Australian government remains deeply concerned about developments in Tibet and neighbouring areas. The government greatly regrets the violence and deeply regrets the loss of life. These are significant developments, and they have been the subject of comment not just by Australia but by the international community. I reiterate the call I made on Saturday, 15 March: that Australia of course recognises China's sovereignty over Tibet-that is not in question-but China should act with restraint in these matters and should deal with protesters peacefully and peaceably and should allow the peaceful expression of dissent. The Australian government again calls for restraintindeed, restraint from all parties-and calls for the violence to end quickly and without further casualties. I raised the Australian government's concerns about human rights, including human rights in Tibet, directly with the Chinese foreign minister, Mr Yang, during his visit to Australia on 5 February. Australia regularly raises these issues with China, including through its regular human rights forum dialogues-the next of which is proposed for later this year. The Australian government believe that China's best interests are served by implementing policies that will foster an environment of greater respect and tolerance. We remain concerned about serious inadequacies in the protection of Tibetans' civil and political rights. Australian officials, both in Canberra and in Beijing, have discussed these developments with Chinese officials, both in Canberra and in Beijing, in recent days. That discussion will continue. I said that not only Australia but also the international community had made public remarks. In recent days the French foreign minister, Mr Kouchner, said: We asked for restraint on the part of the Chinese authorities. We asked for human rights to be respected. The United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, has called for dialogue and for all sides to refrain from violence. The United Kingdom foreign minister, Mr Miliband, said that he believes there are two important messages: One is the need for restraint on all sides, ondly that substantive dialogue is the only way forward. We obviously see that there are real strains there but they need to be addressed in a way that balances restraint and dialogue. I very strongly agree with the sentiment of that remark; it reflects the Australian government's position. Members would be concerned to be assured about the welfare and safety of Australians in the area, particularly in Lhasa. My most recent advice is that some 14 Australians were in Lhasa or thereabouts. They have all been contacted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. They are all safe and arrangements are being made for some of them to exit the area. The department's travel advice for China was updated overnight, on 17 March. It continues to advise Australians to reconsider their need to travel to Lhasa and advises Australians to exercise a high degree of caution in the rest of Tibet, particularly in areas adjoining provinces bordering Tibet, following demonstrations there. I conclude where I started: the Australian government remains deeply concerned about developments in Tibet, and I am sure that concern is reflected by all members of the House. Beijing AustChina Technology",51
39,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, in light of your response to the previous question about business meetings in Sudan, can you explain comments reported today by the Vice-President of Beijing AustChina Technology, Maggie Zeng: Our company needed to do some business in Sudan in 2006, Kevin went with us. We were just doing business with some companies in Sudan, including some telecoms companies.",52
40,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first point is: I am not certain who that individual is. Secondly, during the visit to Sudan I had no meetings whatsoever concerning telecommunications of any description, nor was I in Sudan with but secany representative of that company. Furthermore, on the broad question of why members of parliament use sponsored travel, particularly when they are in opposition, if you had been shadow foreign minister for as long as I was, you would know there is no travel budget provided through the parliament. As a consequence, you rely upon private sponsorship. The way to maintain public accountability in this is to make sure that your pecuniary interest register declares all such sources of sponsored travel and is done so in full conformity with the laws of the country. That is my response to the honourable member's question. Economy",52
41,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the latest developments in global financial markets and the consequences for Australia?,52
42,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The parliament would be aware that financial markets in the United States and around the world are going through a period of great turbulence and severe uncertainty. This instability began last August, when we saw the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. The losses as a result of the subprime market now are estimated to be in excess of some $140 billion, and it is expected that the final losses will substantially higher. As a consequence, financial institutions have become more reluctant to lend money to one another, and this in turn has led to a general tightening of credit markets. Credit has become less available and, as a result, credit has become more expensive. The United States Federal Reserve has taken action in two areas to deal with the challenges currently confronting their own financial markets. Firstly, it is making more liquidity available to a wider range of financial institutions. Over the weekend, the Fed provided capital through an intermediary to Bear Stearns, a major US financial institution exposed to significant subprime related losses. Secondly, the Fed is reducing interest rates. This morning the Fed cut the discount rate on the funds it lends directly to financial institutions from 3.5 per cent to 3.25 per cent. In the six months since September last year, the Fed's key interest rate has been reduced from 5.25 per cent to three per cent. This tightening of liquidity in financial markets has had a significant impact on US equity markets as well, causing steep falls in share prices-and not just in the United States. Now we see an impact on the real economy in the United States; more than 85,000 jobs have been lost since the beginning of the year. Working families in Australia-and the Australian economy more generally-are not immune to developments in global financial markets. Turbulence in global financial markets is putting upward pressure on interest rates through rising credit spreads, at a time when Australian interest rates are already rising as a consequence of domestic inflationary conditions in our domestic economy. This is a double whammy when it comes to the impact on working families dealing with their mortgages. The government will take be hard decisions to help Australia achieve long-term low inflationary growth, and that means taking the measures necessary to boost productivity growth on the one hand while on the other hand taking some of the pressure off inflation by ensuring that public demand is kept under control. Of course, there are some voices in the Australian parliament and in the public debate now who do not believe that inflation is a problem. The member for Higgins contributed last year, saying that inflation was just about right in terms of the level it had reached then. We have had the member for Wentworth describing inflation as something of a fairytale. But the bottom line is this: we have to deal with inflation because higher rates of inflation, fuelled by higher rates of government spending-which we saw in times past-in turn push interest rates up. When the Liberal Party was in government, on the question of expenditure, on the question therefore of contributing to inflationary pressures, it directly contributed to overall upward pressure on interest rates, and the people paying that price today are working families. Of course, on the question of overall inflation and the causes of it, the Reserve Bank of Australia Governor, Glenn Stevens, said last week: ... aggregate demand in the Australian economy rose strongly through 2007 … at a pace well above the economy's likely growth of potential supply. On the supply side, our response, as the Leader of the Opposition would be aware, is to act on skills and infrastructure. On the demand side, what we are dealing withthrough the finance minister, the Treasurer and others-is a record of profligate government spending which we inherited from our predecessors. If those opposite do not believe that, read carefully the biography on the former Prime Minister and the record it contains of the member for Higgins's views about the profligate spending habits of the former Prime Minister-not out of our mouths but out of the Liberals' own mouths. These things require a concrete course of action, pursuing prudent fiscal policy to moderate demand, and that is the sort of budget we will be delivering when we get to May. This is our response-a five-point attack to deal with inflation, the core of which is to make sure that we restrain overall demand by producing a conservative budget outcome. Global financial markets are in a state of turmoil. As a consequence, Australia cannot be made immune from the wash-over effect of those financial markets. We, through the government, through the Treasury, are maintaining close contact with the regulators of Australia's financial institutions. But, when it comes to the impact of fiscal policy on the overall economic well-being of this country, we will be pursuing a rigorous, robust and conservative approach to the management of this country's public finances when it comes to the upcoming budget, unlike the government which preceded us. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I ask the Prime Minister to table the document he read word for word.",53
43,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the Prime Minister reading from a document? Mr Rudd-Yes.,54
44,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the document confidential? Mr Rudd-Yes. Beijing AustChina Technology,54
45,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, in relation to your trip to Sudan in 2006, did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provide any assistance, and did you seek it?",54
46,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not have the details of the trip to Sudan on me, but my recollection is that, through the High Commission in London, I sought assistance in obtaining a visa to visit Sudan. My reason for going to Sudan was to investigate circumstances in western Darfur. I then travelled to western Darfur. My reason for so doing was that the situation on the humanitarian front in western Darfur at the time was deteriorating grossly. At that time there was not a lot of evidence of activity on the part of the previous government on that. I went there with the single objective of trying to shine a light on that problem, and I did so. As a consequence, I had discussions with relevant representatives of the government in Khartoum and relevant Darfurian representatives, most particularly on the state of circumstances in western Darfur. Economy",54
47,Mr TREVOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on recent contributions to the debate about the magnitude and nature of the inflation challenge in the Australian economy?,54
48,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question, because inflation is one of our most pressing domestic challenges. It hurts working families, it puts upward pressure on interest rates, it erodes living standards and it threatens future growth and job creation. In order to fix the problem you need to be upfront and honest about it. As the Prime Minister has indicated again today, inflation is at a 16-year high-and, of course, the member for Higgins last week accepted full responsibility for that 16-year high. These inflationary pressures have been building in our economy for some time. They are the product of a lack of investment in capacity and the product of a previous government that was engaging in reckless spending. Last week in Canberra the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia gave a very important speech about inflation to Treasury officials. He made three very important points. First, he repeated the bank's view about inflation being elevated and that it will remain elevated for a considerable period of time. That was point No. 1. Second-point No. 2-he said that inflationary pressures were broad based. Third, he made the very important point that the surest way to higher average interest rates is to accept higher inflation. Of course, not everybody agrees with the Governor of the Reserve Bank-most notably the member for Wentworth. He is so out of touch with Australians he does not think that there is an inflation problem in this country. He does not have a clue what life is like around the kitchen table. The pretender from Point Piper does not understand that inflationary pressures are eroding the living standards of working families. Last year, he said inflation and interest rates were overdramatised-that was simultaneously with him supporting Work Choices, which was ripping away the wages and working conditions of many people in our community. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Treasurer was asked a question about the current economy; he was not asked about alternative views and he was not asked to give an opinion on other members of the parliament.",54
49,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer was asked about recent contributions to the debate.,55
50,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I am talking about the contribution to inflation from the reckless spending of those opposite. In fact, the member for Wentworth admitted last week that he multiplied a grant application by a factor of five, from $2 million to $10 million-yet another example of reckless spending. There are numerous examples of reckless spending, as the Treasury pointed out only last week. Last week the member for Wentworth gave a 4,000-word speech arguing against fighting inflation. He argued against it. He also denied that we had a skills crisis in the economy. He went on to say that we were heading for a recession and then accused this side of the House of talking down the economy. What a record! Of course, he was then severely embarrassed when he claimed the Treasury had recommended a figure to the government when it came to the minimum wage. He was severely embarrassed about that and, when he was repudiated by the head of Treasury, he attacked the integrity of the head of Treasury. You cannot believe anything the member for Wentworth says. He never lets the truth get in the way of his political ambition. He will say and do anything. Thankfully, this side of the House understands the size of the inflationary problem and the need to deal with it. Those on that side of the House are the best friends that inflation ever had. Economy",55
51,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer to the answer he gave just a moment ago in which he discussed the speech made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia last week. He described that speech as a comprehensive speech about inflation-and so it was. How does the Treasurer explain that the governor, in this comprehensive discussion of inflation and its causes, did not refer to any of the Treasurer's claimed causes of inflation, such as a chronic skills crisis and infrastructure bottlenecks, let alone the reckless spending of the previous government? Who is right: the Treasurer or the governor?",55
52,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The governor is comprehensively right and the member for Wentworth is comprehensively wrong, because what the governor talked about was elevated inflation-pushing up interest rates. The approach of the member for Wentworth is very simple-if people put their heads in the sand about elevated inflation, they condemn this country and householders with a mortgage to permanently higher interest rates. That is recipe of the member for Wentworth. He has an approach which is dangerous. He has an approach which will condemn people to paying permanently higher interest rates because he will not deal with the causes of inflation and has no program to do so. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the speech by the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Leave not granted. Economy",56
53,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. What steps is the government taking to reduce the burden of red tape on businesses?,56
54,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government has inherited economic circumstances that are challenging. We have a major inflation problem in this country-upward pressure on interest rates and government spending that is growing currently at 4½ per cent in real terms. The government is committed to tackling the inflation challenge both term and in the medium term. The critical part of the medium-term attack on inflation is getting better productivity-getting it up from near to zero, where we have inherited it-and ensuring that we have greater pressure on red tape, which will get deregulation moving in this economy so that businesses are unbound and able to create more jobs, greater wealth and higher economic growth. The attack on red tape is a critical part of the government's agenda to bear down on inflation in the medium term. Red tape imposes costs on business, it reduces innovation and, in some cases, it is designed to protect individual businesses against prospective competitors, against innovation and against attacks from outsiders. There are a number of things the government plans to do. Some of these are already in the train. The first and perhaps most obvious is that the government has appointed a minister in the cabinet-me-as Minister for Finance and Deregulation. This was a recommendation from the former government's Banks inquiry, which it chose not to proceed with. We have also appointed Dr Emerson, the member for Rankin, as the assisting minister. Secondly, we have established a working group as part of the COAG process to accelerate and intensify the process of pursuing harmonisation of regulatory arrangements across the states and territories. There was an agreement on this at COAG last year but, unfortunately, there has not been a huge amount of progress in the intervening time. We have turbocharged that process in order to get some outcomes, and that will be reported at the COAG meeting later this month. We are also pursuing internal red tape within the bureaucracy. My department is chairing a working group within the federal bureaucracy which is designed to deliver cuts in red tape within Commonwealth processes, which will indirectly benefit business in the short and the wider community. Finally, we are developing a culture of continuous improvement in regulation. We should not need to have reviews once every 10 years like the former government did. We should not need to have a Banks inquiry or a Bell inquiry into red tape, because our regulatory system should be delivering feedback all the time so that we can build in a process of continuous improvement. This is crucial to reviving productivity in the Australian economy. I am pleased to see that a number of early decisions have been taken by this government to unleash business and to unleash competition. For example, the government decided to get rid of the monopoly wheat export marketing arrangements that we inherited from the previous government-and the opposition still cannot make up its mind whether or not it supports the government's initiative-and to liberalise arrangements in aviation between Australia and the United States in order to provide greater competition and greater opportunities for business in the United States. The previous government talked a lot about removing red tape. It talked a lot about reducing the burden on business. It said when it took office it would cut red tape by 50 per cent. Does anybody believe that red tape was even reduced, let alone by 50 per cent? The answer of course is that very little was achieved-just two reviews, one of which disappeared without a trace, and with the second we are doing our best to follow through with some of the recommendations. I note that the Business Council of Australia is about to release another report which, amongst other things, will deal with these issues. I would commend that report and the views of the Business Council to the members of this parliament. The Business Council has played a very important role in putting pressure on governments on these issues, and I applaud its efforts. I hope that the opposition's response to this report is a little more intelligent than its response to the most recent Business Council report about government spending. The member for Wentworth, in response to the Business Council's claim that there is serious excessive spending and that the government needs to reduce spending, said, ‘They are just the voice of the big end of town.' I have news for you Malcolm: you are the big end of town! And the big end of town does not even agree with you. You cannot even get your own mates to agree with you.",56
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will address his remarks through the chair and refer to members by their titles, and not expand the question too far.",57
56,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I apologise, Mr Speaker. The government are serious about pursuing economic reform and we applaud the contribution to the debate of organisations like the Business Council. Deregulation is central to our agenda-tackling inflation problems, tackling productivity and tackling the barriers to greater wealth creation, greater job creation and greater innovation in our economy. The former government talked a lot about doing something about red tape, but they did very little. We are not on about wild promises; we are on about delivering some outcomes. We are rolling up our sleeves and getting down to work. Economy",57
57,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to reports that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has confirmed that the government is considering a new tax on plastic shopping bags. I also refer the Prime Minister to the new increased road user charge for trucks agreed between state and federal Labor governments. Does the Prime Minister really understand the impact on grocery prices for all Australian families of new Labor taxes on plastic shopping bags and road transport?",57
58,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The Environment Protection and Heritage Council, including all state and territory governments, previously committed to the phase-out of free single-use plastic shopping bags by 1 January 2009. This commitment was made by the previous Howard government, and that position has been supported by this government. Voluntary measures have been trialled but have not been as successful as governments of both persuasions had hoped. This government is still working with states and territories to analyse options for phasing out plastic bags. The Environment Protection and Heritage Council expects to discuss this issue at its upcoming meeting on 17 April 2008. The government has not decided on its preferred option, but let me tell you this: we will not be imposing a Commonwealth levy on plastic bags. Action on plastic bags should not be used as a government revenue raiser. On the broader question of the impact on working families' budgets, the best thing that we can all do to improve the lot of working families is to get rid of Work Choices. The best thing we can do to help working families is to make sure that their penalty rates cannot be ripped off them, that their overtime rates cannot be ripped off them and that their basic, most elementary payments cannot be ripped off them. That is a set of laws that you imposed on working families, and you still stand by them. Workplace Relations",58
59,Ms NEAL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. What is the current status of the assessment of AWAs by the Workplace Authority? What impact is this having on small businesses and Australian businesses at large?",58
60,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Robertson for that question. I know she has a deep concern about the impact of Work Choices on working families in her electorate. During the last few sitting weeks, we have revealed a number of statistics that, to coin a phrase, members of parliament need to ‘really understand'. One of the statistics that members of parliament need to really understand is the dimension of waste of taxpayers' money that was engaged in by the former government on Work Choices propaganda: $121 million, which we know, and as has been revealed in this parliament, caused a plague of mousepads, leftover pens, fridge magnets, pamphlets and all sorts of other paraphernalia. The members over there might think that that is moderately humorous, but let us remember that money was ripped out of the purses and wallets of hard working Australians in order to pay for the propaganda that the former government, the Liberal Party, engaged in in the run-up to the election. A second statistic that members of the House need to really understand relates to the dimension of rip-off of working Australians by Work Choices. I have had the opportunity in this parliament over the last few weeks to confirm that 89 per cent of AWAs sampled removed at least one protected award condition, 83 per cent excluded two or more and 52 per cent excluded six or more. On the question of rip-off",58

62,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I see that they are interjecting about salary. Listen to these statistics about salary. On the question of the dimension of the rip-off of Australian working families engaged in by the Liberal Party, by the members who sit opposite, I referred in the parliament last week to a sample of Australian workplace agreements that showed approximately 45 per cent of the AWAs provided between $1 and $49 per week below the required rate of pay for protected award conditions, 50 per cent provided from $50 to $199 per week less, approximately five per cent provided $200 to $499 per week less and approximately half of one per cent provided for more than $500 per week less than the required rate of pay-statistics that members opposite might need to really understand. Maybe when they come into this place pretending that they care about the future of Australian working families they should start by actually explaining how it is that in government they supported extreme laws like Work Choices and they continue to do so. Today I can reveal new problems that are confronting the Australian community because of Work Choices. These are problems particularly confronting Australian businesses. I can reveal that there are new statistics from the Workplace Authority about the backlog of Australian workplace agreement processing. There was, of course, an initial backlog of 54,000 agreements that was created because of the shambolic way in which the former government introduced the so called fairness test into law. It announced a test it had not formulated, it legislated retrospectively for the test and there were weeks when agreements were backlogging up and no-one knew how to process them. The initial backlog was 54,000 agreements. I can indicate that, to the end of February 2008, approximately 298,524 agreements have been lodged for assessment. Approximately 160,154 of them have been finalised, which means there are approximately 138,000 backlogged agreements waiting to be finalised. At the average rate of processing countenanced by the Howard government, processing this backlog would take 8½ months8½ months when employers and working Australians would have no idea whether or not the agreement that they were working under was lawful. Mr Laming-They were happy enough to sign it.",58
63,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The party of Work Choices, right on cue! They have never met a rip-off they are not prepared to defend, even when the people they are ripping off are businesses who are caught in this processing nightmare. Now, at the average rate of processing countenanced by the Howard government, these agreements would take 8½ months to process. Let me tell you who needs to be apologising to Australian businesses. It is conceivable that, after five, six, seven or eight months of delay in processing, a small business in this country could be told that its agreement had failed. If you were told that your agreement had failed a fortnight after it was made, you would pay up the back pay. It might be a bit inconvenient, but you would deal with that. If you were told it had failed eight months after it had been made then that quantum of back pay could break a small business. That is the shambles that was Work Choices, brought to this country by the Liberal Party of Australia. They sit there and pretend that they care about Australian business when they are responsible for this red-tape nightmare. Like other messes left by the Howard government, we will clear this up. We are accelerating the rate of processing so at least employers and employees know what is going on. Of course, today we have passed the legislation which ends the making of Australian workplace agreements-the first step in getting rid of Work Choices, which failed working families and failed businesses. Pensions and Benefits",59
64,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to letters now being sent to pensioners about the increase in deeming rates for seniors and retirees, which, of course, has the effect of cutting their pensions. Given that this cut, decided by his own minister, will affect over one million pensioners, does the Prime Minister stand by his guarantee to pensioners that they will not be a dollar worse off under his government? Does the Prime Minister really understand the impact of government policies on vulnerable people?",59
65,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As you know, deeming has been a policy which has been in operation now in this country for more than 15 years. When the previous government were elected, I understand they put in place new deeming arrangements from 1996. There are a range of changes for pensioners that come into effect from this Thursday, 20 March. They are as follows: (1) the first $125 payment of the increased utilities allowance, which pensioners will get every quarter; (2) the first payment of the increased telephone allowance, increased by $11 a quarter for those with a home internet connection; (3) indexation increases to the pension of 1.7 per cent or $9.10 per fortnight for singles; and (4) the deeming rates will increase by half a per cent, as the honourable member referred to before. Previous deeming rates have been changed over time by the previous government-both up and down. Let's not try to gild the lily, shall we? The net result on the pension rate will therefore depend on individual circumstances. If pensioners' assets have reduced in value due to volatile share-market activity, this will be taken into account in their pension assessment. If the value of shares has decreased, Centrelink recognises that therefore the total value of an individual's asset has also decreased, so the income able to be derived from that investment will be reduced. Deeming has been around for a long time. It was applied by the previous government at approximately this time each year to adjustments for those who are on the pension. These adjustments have been made consistent with the previous timetable. I conclude where I began: in terms of these additional payments which will be made for the first time to those on the pension-in particular, the first of the $125 quarterly payments of the utilities allowance-our intention is to try and make the financial circumstances of those on these fixed incomes a little bit better. It is very tough out there, given the cost-of-living pressures they are under with groceries, petrol and a whole range of other things as well. This is intended as a modest measure to assist those who are finding the cost-of-living pressures from their weekly basket of goods difficult to handle, but a new $500 utilities allowance should help at the margins. Workplace Relations",60
66,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Will the minister update the House on the government's progress in implementing the fair, balanced and flexible workplace relations policies it took to the last election?",60
67,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Banks for his question. He is a man who you can always hear in this parliament, no matter what the circumstances. Of course, today this House took the step of passing Labor's transition bill, which will go to the Senate later this week. This bill will end forever the making of new Australian workplace agreements. From its passage by this parliament and from its proclamation, Australian workers will no longer have to worry about walking into work only to be confronted by an Australian workplace agreement that rips away their basic terms and conditions. When that debate was finalised in this place, there was a remarkable scene. This was the issue that was at the heart of the last election campaign, the issue on which members of the Liberal Party fought for many months and the issue about which government ministers day after day under the Howard government used to walk to this dispatch box full of brimstone, fire and defence of Work Choices, yet when it came today in this parliament to deal with the bill that would end the first part of Work Choices, what did we see? We saw the Deputy Leader of the Opposition here as the relevant spokesperson. We saw the member for Warringah here, presumably on duty. We saw the member for Cowan sitting on the back bench. Apart from that, we saw nothing. They no longer have the courage to come into this place and defend what they believe in. What they believe in is Work Choices. When it came to dealing with this legislation, which is of so much importance to Australian working families, there was one honest man on the opposition side in that debate, and that was the member for Fisher. I would like to quote the member for Fisher, because I believe it is important in indicating what will happen in the future should the Liberal Party ever be re-elected. He said: I have a little difficulty with the position of the coalitionwhich he described as meaning that ‘we are not going on to oppose Labor's bill'While the government does have an obligation to bring in this bill, on the other hand I would like to vant. have been able to vote in the parliament on the basis of the principles on which I stood for re-election on 24 November… There is one honest man on the opposition benches. Apart from an absence of passion and defence of Work Choices as they cowered in their offices, not supporting and not opposing the legislation, there was one other remarkable thing that was missing from the chamber. Members of parliament might have thought they heard the corridors resounding to a shout of ‘Miranda' during the debate in the parliament. They might have thought that Picnic at Hanging Rock was on the TV again. But it actually was not a shout of Miranda; it was a shout of ‘Malcolm' as the member for Wentworth did not turn up for his allocated speaking spot in the debate. When called uponMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The first answer that the Deputy Prime Minister gave went for six minutes. This answer, I understand, has now been going for around four minutes, if not more. She is now hallucinating at the dispatch box. I ask that you bring her back to the question at hand.",60
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There was no point of order but I do suggest to the Deputy Prime Minister that, given the careful wording from our learned colleague who asked the question, she is now stretching her response. She will bring it to a conclusion.",61
69,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I will conclude shortly. The only hallucination in this parliament was the prospect that the member for Wentworth would come in and stand up for anything, because he is obviously leaving his options open on Work Choices for later leadership ballots within the Liberal Party.",61
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will bring her response to a close and be rele,61
71,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the question of the workplace relations legislation, the bill has cleared the House of Representatives. There will be a Senate inquiry that reports later today. We will, of course, be mindful of what has occurred in the Senate inquiry, but there is no reason why this bill will not clear the parliament by the end of this week other than a desire by the Liberal Party to keep Work Choices staggering on. Transport Workers Union",61
72,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to comments he made on 2 October last year that he had asked Labor's national secretary to conduct an internal investigation into the Transport Workers Union slush fund, allegedly used to illegally support Labor candidates. I also refer the Prime Minister to his comments on 8 October that the investigation was still underway and that the national secretary would make a statement about the findings. Prime Minister, has the Labor Party national secretary made any such statement? Can the Prime Minister guarantee that no Transport Workers Union slush fund money was used to support Labor candidates at the last federal election, including the candidates featured, signing a pledge to that union, in the TWU election brochure I have here-namely, the members for Charlton, Robertson, Dobell and Lindsay? Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In the past, speakers have ruled out of order questions of this nature, which go to the organisational responsibility of the party rather than to the parliamentary wing of a political party.",62
73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The middle part of the question, which directly went to whether the national secretary had done this or that, was out of order. The introduction and the latter part of the question, I will allow. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, there is a rich history in this place of such questions being asked, including, I recall, questions to the previous Prime Minister about the activities of the Liberal Party and to the previous Deputy Prime Minister about the activities of the National Party. I ask that you reconsider the decision if you are heading down the path of ruling that part of the question out of order.",62
74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have made a ruling where I have allowed the introduction and the last part but not the bit in the middle that asks the Prime Minister what the actions of the national secretary were.,62
75,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, further to the point of order, the middle part of the question is, and I quote: I also refer the Prime Minister to … comments on 8 October that the investigation was still underway and that the national secretary would make a statement about the findings. That is the middle part of the question, which relates specifically to comments made by the Prime Minister. So I ask you, Mr Speaker, to consider that that part of the question is in fact in order because it relates directly to comments made by the Prime Minister himself.",62
76,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition and the member for North Sydney for their submissions, but I am standing by my earlier ruling. I make the observation that it is very difficult when these questions arise about statements that have been made by the Prime Minister before becoming the Prime Minister. I allowed the earlier questions today because I understood the intent with which the questions were being put about the Prime Minister's ability to carry out his duties. This goes to matters that are in the political party arena. To that extent the Prime Minister may comment, which is why I am allowing those aspects of the question.",62
77,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am particularly grateful for the intervention by the member for North Sydney, because he was the minister at the time. When these matters came to the public debate, he was the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Insofar as I can work out, the minister in that capacity referred these allegations to a range of different investigative bodies. He referred these matters to (1) the Australian Electoral Commission, (2) the Australian Taxation Office and (3) the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The Workplace Authority and the Australian Industrial Registry also undertook inquiries-that is five. Referring matters to specialised areas of government at both a state and a federal level ensures that the body with the appropriate legislative responsibilities and investigative powers can undertake a thorough examination of the issues. The appropriate course here is to allow these investigations, which are on foot, including that of the AEC, to proceed. On the statement by the national secretary of the Labor Party: I will check where that is up to and whether his investigations have concluded. I say again that I encourage anyone who has any information relevant to these matters to submit it to the relevant authorities, of which there are a large number conducting investigations based on the actions by the minister when he exercised a ministerial office on this side of the House. Economy",62
78,Ms CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Assistant Treasurer. What is the government doing to place downward pressure on the cost-of-living increases for working families? In particular, what is the government doing to protect working families' weekly budgets for groceries and for petrol?",63
79,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bass for her question. Australians have been dealing with increases in the cost of living and financial pressures for some time. Families and individuals with a mortgage have been dealing with 12 interest rate increases in a row and the highest underlying inflation in 16 years. Within those inflation figures there is cause for concern. The price of everyday, unavoidable purchases for working families has been going up even more than the average inflation rate. Inflation is concerning, of course, but, when the price of basic purchases which cannot be avoided is going up more than the average inflation rate, that is a cause for particular concern. Since 1996 in Australia, food inflation has increased by 43.6 per cent. The price of food has gone up by 43.6 per cent. Mr Ciobo interjecting",63
80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Moncrieff!,63
81,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The comparable figure in the United States is 25.1 per cent. The figure in the United Kingdom is 11.6 per cent, while the relevant Canadian figure is 22.1 per cent. So food inflation in Australia has been much higher than in countries that we normally compare ourselves with. Of course, the response of the previous government was to shrug their shoulders and say, ‘Well, Australian working families have never been better off; therefore there is nothing we could or should do,' but this government has a different approach. Whilst recognising that there are a range of factors which lead into increases in grocery and food prices, it is appropriate that we ensure that the grocery market in Australia is as competitive as it can be. There are a range of factors leading to these increases, as we have always said. Whether it is the drought or the growth in demand for food from Asia, there are a range of factors. But the fact that Australia has had the highest food inflation amongst the major OECD countries is cause for concern and presents a good reason for further examination to get all the issues on the public record and all the policy proposals on the public record. We believe that competition is the best way to put downward pressure on grocery prices in Australia. That is why, on 22 January, the government instructed the ACCC to commence a formal inquiry into grocery prices under part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act, implementing another election commitment of this government. This has been supported by a diverse range of groups, from Choice, on the one hand, to the National Farmers Federation, just today. I endorse the comments of the National Farmers Federation, which in its release earlier today said: CONSUMERS – increasingly attuned to rising food bills – are justified in wanting to know what is driving higher food prices. Likewise, Australian farmers are just as eager for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to get to the bottom of where the money is going, the National Farmers' Federation (NFF) said today. I also endorse the comments of the vicepresident, Charles Burke, who said: … The truth is farmers only ever receive a small portion of the price paid at the check-out … There appears to be an increasing gap between farmgate and retail prices, therefore, this is a good opportunity to find out exactly what is happening in the supply chain. I also note that the Leader of the Opposition has called for the terms of reference for this inquiry to be expanded. I am not sure whether he supports it or opposes it or neither supports nor opposes it, but he has clearly called for the terms of reference to be expanded, so presumably he supports it. The closing date for submissions to the inquiry has now passed, and there will be a range of hearings across the country in every state and territory, covering both rural and metropolitan areas. The inquiry has wideranging terms of reference and will examine competition and cost pressures at every point in the supply chain, from the farm gate to the checkout counter. In addition, one practical measure the government can take to assist families in dealing with cost-of-living pressures is to give them more information about supermarkets in their area and which is generally cheapest. This will assist in a modest way to correct the imbalance between retailers and consumers and to bring more transparencyMr Ciobo interjecting",63
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Moncrieff!,64
83,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to the grocery-pricing process. The ACCC is working with the government on developing a basket of goods which can be surveyed to give consumers more information about which supermarket in their area is generally the cheapest. This information will be included on a dedicated website linked to the ACCC website, implementing another election commitment of the Rudd Labor government. Consumers will of course then be able to make their own decisions, based on their own experience, and will compare quality, service delivery and price, based on their own experience and the information available on the website. Of course, it will not be possible to have the price of every good in every supermarket in Australia, but it is important to remember that, the more information consumers have, the more transparency and information we have in the grocery market in this country. Another unavoidable expense for many Australians is, of course, petrol. The House is aware of the steps that the new government has taken since its election to introduce more transparency and competition into the Australian petrol industry. The community is particularly concerned about petrol prices in the lead-up to long weekends and holiday periods. In the lead-up to Easter, the increased investigatory powers that the new government has given to the ACCC will be particularly important. On Friday, the ACCC chair, Graeme Samuel, after consulting with the government's nominee for the office of petrol commissioner, wrote to petrol companies seeking any advance information available to explain any divergence between the Singapore price of oil and the price of petrol in Australia over the Easter period. Honourable members will recall that the divergence between the price of oil in Singapore and the price of petrolMr Dutton- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, which goes to relevance: could the Assistant Treasurer, when he is talking about the impact of the petrol commissioner, explain when the petrol commissioner is actually going to start work?",64

87,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will. Thank you, Mr Speaker. Honourable members will recall that, on the last occasion the price of oil in Singapore diverged from the price of petrol in Australia, the ACCC exercised its powers given to it by the Rudd government. After those powers were exercised, the divergence disappeared and the difference between the price of oil in Singapore and the price of petrol in Australia returned to more normal levels. The House can be assured that the ACCC will not hesitate to use its formal investigative powers over the Easter period. It also can be assured that this government will take every step",65

Economy",65
91,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Given the importance of Australia's strong regulatory and monitoring regime in ensuring our financial system is resilient and secure in the face of international shocks, such as the current global credit crisis, is it still the government's intention to cut $129.8 million in funding to ASIC, as recently announced by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation? Does the Treasurer really understand the impact of this significant budget cut on Australia's independent corporate watchdog?",65
92,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question; it is a very important question. We have experienced regulators in this country. They are first-rate and there could not be a period in our history when they have been more important. We are talking to them daily about international financial turbulence. We have talked to them about their budget. For the next two years, we have rescinded the proposal that we took to the last election for very good reasons-because our regulators need to be as strong as they possibly can be. They need to receive the full support of the government. They are receiving the full support of the government and the full financial answer is commitment of the government. HMAS Sydney",65
93,Ms PARKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Now that the wrecks of HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran have been found, will the minister update the House on further immediate actions to be taken?",65
94,Mr SNOWDON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. With the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, I acknowledge the service, bravery and sacrifice of the 645 men, several of whom were from Air Force, that went down with the Sydney and, of course, the 78 personnel who were lost from the Kormoran. I think it is important that we offer congratulations to the Finding Sydney Foundation and their search leader, Mr David Mearns, who is an internationally renowned shipwreck investigator, who has added another two incredible finds to his reputation this week. He previously found Her Majesty's ship the Hood and refound the Bismarck. Today, further sonar work is being conducted around the wreck of HMAS Sydney and the debris field at increasingly higher resolutions. The Finding Sydney Foundation also hope to collect additional highresolution images of the bow of the Kormoran. The Geosounder, which is the vessel they have leased from Singapore, will be heading back to Fremantle Port later this week to collect a remotely operated vehicle with video filming capabilities that is able operate at a depth of 3,000 metres to further examine the wrecks of both the Sydney and the Kormoran. Defence will be conducting extensive analysis of the imagery of the HMAS Sydney wreckage to see whether it is possible to determine what may have caused her to sink, with such a tragic loss of life. The outcome of that analysis will inform us as to whether or not any further inquiry might be appropriate. I should make it clear here that the wrecks-both the Sydney and the Kormoran-will not be disturbed in any way, and only recorded and photographed. These sites of both nations' war dead will be treated with absolute respect. Already the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has declared both sites as historic shipwrecks, as the Prime Minister pointed out, with a protection zone of 200 hectares around the wrecks under the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976. It is important that we understand that this declaration will give legal protection to these vessels, their crews and the relics, from damage, disturbance and removal. Under the Historic Shipwrecks Act there will be significant penalties for anyone who engages in underwater activity within 200 hectares of the protection zone. This penalty is a fine of up to $10,000 or five years in jail. I will also be asking the environment minister to consider further levels of protection for these wrecks such as Commonwealth heritage listing, which will require the development of a management plan for the wrecks. Further actions and a management plan will also involve consultation with other Commonwealth agencies such as the commemorations and war graves area of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. As we care for the wrecks, what must not be forgotten are the families of those men who lost their lives so long ago. The govto ernment will examine the possibility of conducting a formal commemorative service on the anniversary of the sinking of HMAS Sydney in November of this year. We will also be setting up for those family members a 1800 number so that families can make a call to the Department of Defence to get information that may be available. In the first instance, the Department of Defence will be attempting to contact those family members for whom we have records to inform them of the progress. The hotline service will provide up-to-date information on the status of the search. The number will be released along with updates in coming days. In addition, the Department of Defence will also maintain an up-to-date website to inform the general lic about ongoing developments. Health Services",66

In the light of comments made by the South Australian Minister for Health, John Hill, that GP superclinics ‘don't necessarily have doctors in them', and that no decision has been made whether the superclinic that the minister is establishing in Modbury will have doctors, can the minister assure patients every federally funded GP superclinic will actually be staffed by doctors?",67

103,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The 31 GP superclinics announced by the federal government will all have GPs in them, as our commitments have made clear. The South Australian government and the federal government will be working together on a number of sites. A number of those sites are going to be jointly funded by the state government and the pub- Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will require that the parameters set for our superclinics will be met by any state government. I think that it has been quite mischievous of the member to be raising this issue when he knows full well that the South Australian strategy, although complementary to that being supported by the Rudd Labor government, is not the same as that being initiated by the Rudd Labor government. These superclinics we are very proud of. They are an that opportunity for the federal government to use their substantial contribution to ensure that we do get doctors, nurses and allied health professionals working together for the benefit of the community, providing better chronic disease care management-making sure that parents of young children can go to the one place to get the assistance of a doctor, a dietitian, a physio and others. These are an opportunity for us to make a real difference to the services that are provided in these regions. I know members on this side of the House-including, I am sure, the member for Makin, where the Modbury superclinic will be established-are very pleased that there is a Commonwealth government prepared to invest in health services across this country, prepared to put money into health services in communities where they are needed, and make sure that the Commonwealth investment is used to make sure that we can attract, in particular, doctors to a number of places where there are shortages and where we can work with state governments to complement the money that they are going to put into these sectors as well.

Climate Change Mrs D'ATH (3.35 pm)-My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Will the minister outline how the Rudd government is delivering on its election commitment to take action on climate change? What are the dangers of inaction?",68
107,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Petrie for her question. There is a wide dimension of dangers of inaction in relation to addressing climate change: regional security, our environment, the economy and our society. At the last election the Australian made it clear they wanted a government that was prepared to rise to the tackling of climate change. Since the election, the Rudd Labor government has set about delivering on our commitments-commitments to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions to some 60 per cent of 2000 levels by 2050; a commitment to ratify the Kyoto protocol as the first act of the Rudd government; and a commitment to implement a $500 million national Clean Coal Fund and a $500 million Renewable Energy Fund. Through my own department, we are implementing a range of commitments that will change the way the Australian community goes about energy and water efficiency. These include low-interest green loans for household energy and water efficiency improvements, along with customised home energy audits, expansion of the Solar Cities program with new solar cities in Perth and in Coburg in Victoria and grants of up to $50,000 from 1 July this year to make every school a solar school. Crucially, these initiatives are intended to complement emissions trading, which sits at the heart of our efforts to reduce emissions, and today the government have announced a detailed timetable for the design and implementation of emissions trading. We have set out a detailed timetable, which will see emissions-trading schemes commence in 2010. We will take a careful and methodical approach to finalising the design of emissions trading. An exposure draft of emissions-trading legislation will be released in December 2008 but community and industry, I must stress, will be invited to have their say on a green paper to be released in July 2008 outlining key design issues and options. Emissions trading is a significant undertaking and it has been introduced in response to a significant challenge. Reports that some members may have seen today from the people United Nations Environment Program suggesting that the rate at which some of the world's glaciers are melting has more than doubled are very troubling and concerning indeed. For those of us that have followed closely the science of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change these reports are yet again a very clear symbol, a very clear sign and now very clear evidence of the urgency with which we must address climate change. The member asked me about the dangers of inaction. It is a danger we see almost daily when people engage in a confected debate which raises the spectres of the costs of action without ever recognising the implications of unabated climate change for our economy, for our environment and for our society. It was a debate that was engaged in by the member for Barker in this place last month, when he said: If we are going to have problems as a result of climate change ... I think the most sensible approach would be to adapt. He then said: In the end, some of the other suggestions that have been put forward are going to come at a great cost to the Australian economy. We heard another contribution to this debate from the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, on 5 March in Washington, when he referred to discussions of climate change science as ‘intellectual bullying and moralising'. He said, when he was introducing these remarks: The left liberal grip on educational institutions and large, though not all, sections of the media remains intense. The government is getting on with the job of addressing the great challenge of climate change. It is not caught up in false, arid and ancient debates. This government is not scaremongering about the costs of acting on climate change whilst never acknowledging the dangers to our economy and our way of life from soaring greenhouse gas emissions. And, if there is a danger in climate change debate, it is the danger of 11½ years of delay, inaction, scepticism and scaremongering by members on the other side on this issue. I will just make this final point. When the Assistant Treasurer came to the box and produced what I thought was a compelling answer in the House, the Leader of the Opposition said to him in an interjection, ‘We'll be back to get you when we get a price on carbon.' Dr Nelson interjecting",68
108,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And he has just confirmed those comments. This underscores the different approaches between a government on one hand and an opposition on the other whose only approach to climate change is to scaremonger on the costs of action to deal with this issue. The fact of the matter is that it is the costs of inaction that outweigh the costs of action, something the government understand. We are getting on with the job of taking responsibility for securing Australia's long-term sustainable prosperity, unlike those on the other side. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Ministerial Arrangements",69
109,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. On the question just answered by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts I seek guidance as to ministerial arrangements with regard to climate change in this House. I am following the guidance which you yourself gave to me. Last week on Thursday a question on emissions trading was given to the minister for the environment. He declined to answer it. He has given today an extensive answer in relation to emissions trading and again last week",69

As I recollect, the details of ministerial arrangements and the division between ministers of responsibilities for ministers in the other chamber have been circulated. I thanked the honourable member for giving me notice of this last week of this as a dorothy dixer, but I do not thank him for now raising it again. But I will try to do justice to the point he is making. The general principle that should underpin question time is that this is an opportunity to put the executive to the test about areas of public policy and it would seem appropriate that the executive from time to time would decide who is the appropriate minister to answer the question. It is on that basis that I proceed in this way. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Beijing AustChina Technology",69

Apart from the assistance given to me by the High Commission in London for a visa, there was an officer from the Australian embassy in Cairo who accompanied me to Sudan and assisted in arranging the program that I was on.

Surely, this is ironic and is clearly out of",70
117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The member for North Sydney will get to his question.,70
118,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Page 554 of House of Representatives Practice refers to the length of answers and says that there has been a history in this place of calling for quorums on each occasion that a minister's answer goes for more than five minutes. Given that today we had four answers in excess of five minutes each, and it is a pattern of behaviour from this government, I ask that you look into the issue of the length of answers by ministers to their own questions, and, significantly, if there is any opportunity for us as a parliament to ensure that the answers are of a shorter nature and more relevant to the questions that are being asked.",70
119,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Can I just make the overarching point that it is not my intention to take questions on matters of the proceedings, but on this occasion, to assist the honourable member for North Sydney, I am happy to make some comments. The member for Flinders did the appropriate thing and raised this by way of a point of order on one of the answers given, and I made a comment on that. I think that if we look at House of Representatives Practice in detail, it indicates that, whilst from time to time occupants of the chair have tried to curtail the length of ministers' answers-and to the certain extent that is what I have done-the chair ‘has no power to require that it be followed'. That is one of the difficulties. Can I make the observation that if backbenchers can do a good job of explaining a case in a 90-second statement or a threeminute statement or, indeed, make the case for a number of things in a five-minute adjournment speech, I think that all of us could probably make do with five minutes. Today actually was not the worse day for the length of answers, but I think that this is something that the whole House has to deal with.

126,Mr TANNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-Increasing Australia's long-term productive capacity is the key to maintaining downward pressure on inflation and, therefore, downward pressure on interest rates. As Labor announced prior to the election, a key element in the government's plan to increase Australia's productivity is our deregulation agenda. For the first time, Australia has a cabinet minister for deregulation. This high-level oversight of the government's deregulation agenda is essential for getting things done. The Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation, Dr Craig Emerson, and I are working in cooperation with the states and territories through the Council of Australian Governments Business Regulation and Competition Working Group to tackle areas of regulatory duplication or inconsistency between different levels of government, such as occupational health and safety laws. At the federal level, we are already at work undertaking a stock take of existing regulation and taking action where we find unnecessarily burdensome or ineffective regulation. In partnership with the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law, I have set is up the Financial Services Reform Working to be Group to cut back 50to 80-page product disclosure statements to the essential information that consumers actually need to know. And, in the coming months, I will be working with other portfolio ministers to deliver better regulation and better outcomes for the Australian community. The Rudd Labor government is working towards a culture of continuous regulatory improvement. Under our government, we want more productive relationships between regulators and those they regulate. We want to actively seek out and respond to ideas for improvement all the time. An important part of this commitment to better quality regulation is ensuring that any proposed new regulations are thoroughly scrutinised so that they are introduced only where necessary and at minimum cost to business and consumers. I am pleased to announce to the parliament today further details of Labor's commitment to the best practice regulation requirements and the continuing role of the Office of Best Practice Regulation in their administration. The Rudd Labor government fully endorses the six principles of good regulatory process identified by the 2006 Banks Taskforce on Reducing the Regulatory Burden on Business. These principles state that governments should not act to address problems until a case for action has been clearly established. In acting, governments need to consider the benefits and costs of a range of feasible policy options and then select the one which provides the greatest overall net benefit to the community. Effective guidance should be provided to regulators and regulated parties about the regulation's policy intent and expected compliance requirements. Then there should also be mechanisms to ensure regulation remains relevant and effective over time as well as effective consultation with regulated parties at all stages of the regulatory cycle. The Australian government's Best Practice Regulation Handbook, released in August 2007, sets out best practice regulation requirements in line with these principles. The Rudd Labor government is committed to not just maintaining but further strengthening these requirements. Since Labor took office last year, the Office of Best Practice Regulation, or OBPR, has moved into the Department of Finance and Deregulation. This arrangement better reflects the central role of the OBPR in improving the quality of new regulation through administration of the best practice regulation requirements. Despite this administrative change, the OBPR will retain its distinct identity. It continue to be a one-stop-shop to assist departments and agencies to meet the government's requirements and to assess and report on compliance. Compliance with the procedures and processes outlined in the Best Practice Regulation Handbook remains mandatory for all Australian government departments, agencies, statutory authorities and boards that make, review or reform regulations. This includes not only ‘black-letter law' but also quasi-regulation such as rulings, guidance notes and standards. The level of regulatory impact analysis required is greater the more significant the regulatory proposal is likely to be. A preliminary assessment must be undertaken for all regulatory proposals. Proposals likely to involve medium business compliance costs must also have a further full quantitative assessment of compliance cost implications using the business cost calculator or approved equivalent. Proposals likely to have a significant impact require even greater analysis, including compliance cost quantification, to be undertaken and documented in a regulation impact statement (RIS). The OBPR has responsibility for certifying that compliance costs have been quantified and for assessing the adequacy of RISs. Proposals can generally not proceed to the decision-making stage until OBPR certification has been received. In performing this role, the OBPR is concerned only with the standard of analysis undertaken. It does not endorse or support particular regulatory options or outcomes. Such deregulation policy matters will be dealt with in a separate area of the department as part of the government's broader agenda for reducing the regulatory burden on Australian businesses and consumers. To perform its watchdog role effectively, will the OBPR needs to exercise its decision making functions in an independent manner. The government has put in place procedures to ensure that neither ministers nor their staff can seek to intervene in or influence the OBPR's deliberations. Decisions on the adequacy of a regulatory impact analysis and compliance with the best practice regulation requirements will be made independently by the Executive Director of the OBPR. As the OBPR is now part of the Department of Finance and Deregulation, the department's secretary will be able to support the independence of OBPR's decision making on best practice regulation requirements, helping shield the OBPR executive director from any undue influence, and appropriately advocating and defending the OBPR regulatory assessment process. The OBPR will also continue to prepare the annual Best practice regulation report. This report outlines compliance with the best practice regulation principles on an agency by agency basis, and its public release is an important element in ensuring transparent and accountable regulation making. Publication of the report will be prepared and authorised by the Executive Director of the OBPR and presented to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation as a final report. These existing arrangements are important to ensure any new regulation is effective and any compliance burden is as small as possible. Keeping the regulatory burden down is vital to ensure we do not tie people up in unnecessary red tape and compliance regimes. In a number of areas the Rudd Labor government is moving to further strengthen the transparency of the regulatory impact analysis process. Rather than waiting until the end of each reporting year to publish adequacy data, the government will require that, in all but exceptional circumstances, a RIS and the OBPR's assessment of its adequacy will be made public before regulations come into effect. The best practice regulation requirements will also be amended to require that OBPR assess and make public its assessment of the adequacy of any post-implementation review. The government is truly committed to ongoing, continuous regulatory reform. That is why we have put deregulation front and centre of our agenda to improve Australia's productivity, to keep inflation as low as possible and to remove unnecessary barriers to people finding well paying, secure jobs. I commend the statement to the House.",71
127,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Dickson for speaking for a period not exceeding eight minutes. Question agreed to.,73
128,Mr DUTTON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"At the commencement of this government, Prime Minister Rudd outlined a process by which he claimed the incoming government would be more accountable, open and transparent. He said that one of the processes by which the government would deliver on that promise would be for ministers to deliver ministerial statements. At the time, there was no qualification made that ministerial statements needed to be of substance, and today proves that very point. This ministerial statement is certainly light on substance and really is a tick-the-box exercise for the minister. The coalition welcomes any proposal for genuine deregulation. This statement today focuses on the best practice for regulation the government intends to maintain-which, on the reading of it, is merely a continuation of the practices introduced by the coalition government. This is just another example of ‘me-tooism'. It is proof that the government, even at this early time in its first term, has no plan for the future, and it is proof that it is simply trying to remodel coalition government initiatives and policies. Of course, the question has to be asked: ‘When the coalition has a proven track record of decreasing regulatory burdens on business and increasing productivity, why wouldn't you?' In its annual review of reform, Going for Growth, the OECD rated Australia first in terms of both having the lowest overall level of regulation and imposing the least impact on economic behaviour. I quote from the OECD report: In the last decade of the 20th century, Australia became a model for other OECD countries in two respects: first, the tenacity and thoroughness which deep structural reforms were proposed, discussed, legislated, implemented and followed up in virtually all markets, creating a deep-seated “competition culture”; and second, the adoption of fiscal and monetary frameworks that emphasised transparency and accountability and established stability oriented macro policies as stant largely protected from political debate. gether, these structural and macro policy anchors conferred an enviable degree of resilience and flexibility on the Australian economy. The combination resulted in a prolonged period of good economic performance that shrugged off crises in its main trading partners as well as a devastating drought at home. The short-term outlook is for continuing strong growth of productivity and output, low inflation and budget surpluses accompanied by tax cuts. This flattering testimony from the OECD is slightly embarrassing for the minister, because it not only gives a glowing endorsement to the coalition but also takes the wind out of the minister's crusade to wind back apparent restrictive regulatory costs on business. In fact, productivity improvements across the economy mean that the average worker now produces over 20 per cent more than he or she did in 1996. That is, what used to take Australians five hours to produce now takes four hours. The minister's statement does not tell us much, but it does tell us that the government think that the coalition did so well with deregulation that they will continue with the best practice that the coalition introduced. The minister states that the government endorses the six principles of good regulatory process identified by the 2006 Banks task force. It was the coalition who established the 2006 Banks Taskforce on Reducing the Regulatory Burden on Business; it was the coalition who implemented the six principles of good regulatory process identified by the task force; and, in 2007, it was the coalition who launched the Best Practice with Regulation Handbook, which sets out best practice regulations requirements in line with those principles. Now Labor are trying to sell regulation best practice as their own. The record of the Rudd government so far on red tape is definitely bad. Similarly to a con- their statements about being economic conTo- servatives, the ALP are all talk and no action in this area. In particular, the most important new regulation introduced by the Rudd government-and certainly Labor's first substantive piece of legislation-the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008-clearly fails the tests set out in the minister's statement. The minister has indicated that policy proposals that are likely to have a significant impact should be subject to detailed analysis, including compliance cost measurement, to be undertaken and documented in a regulation impact statement. The transition to Forward with Fairness bill does have an RIS; however, it is totally inadequate by the government's own test. It is only a couple of pages long and does not measure a single compliance cost change. This is clearly against the guidelines issued only a few moments ago. Where is the analysis of whether Forward with Fairness will actually reduce business compliance costs, as the ALP repeatedly argues? It is a question that the minister might like to answer. Evidence presented at the Senate inquiry over the past two weeks has highlighted a high level of confusion and difficulty for business, particularly small business, once Labor's transitional workplace relations legislation is enacted. Business has raised concerns about increased costs associated with the reinvigoration of the award system, as has a member of the Labor Party, with Senator Marshall suggesting last week that the ALP plan for award modernisation without disadvantaging workers or increasing employer costs is contradictory and an impossible ask. Where is the analysis of the costs imposed on business from the abolition of AWAs and award rationalisation? These huge gaps suggest to me that either the government has no plan for reducing red tape or it knows that its plan with Forward with Fairness will increase red tape and costs on business. Today's ministerial statement also says an assessment of an RIS will be released publicly before regulations come into effect. Will the government do this for the transition to Forward with Fairness bill? Or will the government put pressure on the Office of Best Practice Regulation to clear the bill, even though the minister explicitly rules this out? I note that two other significant Rudd government changes do not contain an RIS. Those are the changes to tax deductibility for political donations contained in the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008 and the removal of the higher education workplace relations requirements contained in another bill. The purpose of ministerial statements is to deliver a statement from the government, by the minister, on an issue of substance. This is liament. a particularly important issue for all business, not just for large business but, most importantly, for small and medium business. The expectation is that if the minister is ing to make a ministerial statement to this parliament to address the very important issue of deregulation and reduction of red tape for small business, then he should make a statement which business can rely on and which business can look to in order to see some substantive outcome. The reality is that this government is full of rhetoric. The Rudd government's actions on this show that today's statement is without substance. The minister should take the first opportunity to address the concerns and the questions that I have raised as part of my contribution to this ministerial statement, but the reality still is that this was a policy announcement that was not substantive in nature and was an abuse of process of this chamber. I think that it shows the contempt and the arrogance of the minister so early on. (Time expired) NA Private Members' Motions",73

Your petitioners therefore request the House to ask the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia to raise with the government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh the importance of fully investigating war crimes committed during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War and bringing the perpetrators of such crimes to fair and just trial. by Mr Speaker (from 104 residents of Western Australia) Cluster Munitions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: That unexploded cluster submunitions disproportionately kill and maim civilians, including a high percentage of children, delay relief efforts in post-conflict countries as well as disrupting long-term development, and continue to kill and maim long after they are deployed and the conflict has ended. We note that Australia does not possess cluster munitions and does not use them. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to - Legislate a ban on the production, transfer, stockpiling and use of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians; - Pass a motion supporting the Oslo Declaration committing Australia to working towards an international treaty that would ban the production, transfer, stockpiling and use of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians globally by Mr Speaker (from 48 citizens) Anti-Vehicle Mines To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully shows: That the undersigned note that like anti-personnel landmines, anti-vehicle mines are indiscriminate in who they effect, that they disproportionately kill and maim civilians, they delay relief efforts in war affected countries and they go on killing for decades after the conflict has ended. We note that Australia's existing stock of anti-vehicle mines is obsolete and only used for training purposes, so now is the perfect time to commit to supporting a ban on these indiscriminate weapons. We welcome the Australian Government's support for further restrictions on the use of anti-vehicle mines, but believe such measures to be inadequate to address the humanitarian problems caused by anti-vehicle mines. We, your Petitioners, call on the Federal Government to: - Legislate a ban on the production, transfer, importation and use of anti-vehicle mines in Australia and by Australians other than by the Australian Defence Forces for training in demining and avoiding the hazards of antivehicle mines; and - Pass a motion supporting the development of an international treaty that would ban the production, transfer, importation and use of anti-vehicle mines globally. by Mr Speaker (from 104 citizens) Northern Territory Intervention Strategy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the many well known public figures of this country who have publicly rejected the actions of the current Federal Government in its Northern Territory Intervention Strategy and Legislation and expresses our deep concern about it because: the Government's strategy has been implemented with no consultation with Indigenous community leaders; - the bulk of the $587 million allocated is to be spent on administration and bureaucrats rather than directly assisting Indigenous Communities; - quarantining of welfare payments will result in many families, who are already struggling, being worse off; - removal of the entry permit system exposes communities and children to further risk. - We call on the incoming Federal Government to revisit the Northern Territory strategy and legislation in consultation with Indigenous leaders as a matter of urgency and to review its appropriateness for the goal of protecting Indigenous women and children in the Northern Territory or any other part of Australia. by Mr Speaker (from 90 citizens) Mesothelioma To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We, the undersigned, call on the House of Representatives to urgently draft and pass legislation enabling the provision of special funding to subsidise the cost of standard-of-care chemotherapy treatment for the lung disease called mesothelioma. We believe that the best treatment available should be made accessible to all victims, where medically appropriate, at a price everyone can afford under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) listing, regardless of where victims live or how they contracted the disease. Furthermore, we respectfully request that the House take note that: - An independent report has found up to half of all Australians with mesothelioma aren't gaining access to this standard-of-care treatment for the disease, while others receive fully subsidised access to the same therapy. - That the report found extreme access inequities exist between mesothelioma patients in different States, among those attending different hospitals, and between those exposed to asbestos via occupational hazard and those who cannot establish how they were exposed. - We respectfully request urgent attention and action to address the inequity of access to treatment that currently faces victims of mesothelioma in Australia: by Mr Speaker (from 833 citizens) Port Keats Road To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the Northern Territory of Australia draws to the attention of House the drastic need for the Commonwealth to allocate sufficient funds from the $22.3 billion AusLink 2 program to: Upgrade the Port Keats Road to sealed, all weather condition. The Port Keats Road provides access to Wadeye, the largest Indigenous town in Australia; and also several thousand other indigenous residents. The economic and social prosperity of the people of this region depends on the upgrade of this road. Your petitioners therefore requests the House commit to this project. by Mr Speaker (from 284 residents of the Northern Territory) Centrelink To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. Centrelink and in particular Morwell Centrelink has given us very bad customer service and is generally unwilling to help even when legislative (laws) criteria's are met. We request the House take action to remedy the situation and consulting with the Customers of the Commonwealth is advised. by Mr Speaker (from 1,713 citizens) Water To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia, particularly those residents in the Division of Wimmera/Mallee Victoria, points out to the House that Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water has proposed Natimuk Lake, 2.5km from the township of Natimuk, will not be required when the federal, state and locally funded Wimmera Mallee Pipeline is completed. The importance of environmental values has been recognised; however, the GWM proposal fails to recognise the social value of safe recreational waters to inland country communities and families, especially those which don't have a town pool. Your petitioners therefore request that the Federal Government ensures the Victorian State Government, GWM Water and other relevant authorities acknowledge the enormous social value of safe the recreation water to country communities. Considering the huge community financial investment in the pipeline project to create water savings, we ask that permanent water be guaranteed for recreational purposes, in particular Natimuk Lake. This water must be allocated by the State Government as a community service obligation when the Wimmera Mallee Pipeline water savings are available. by Mr Speaker (from 320 citizens) To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia, ticularly those resident in the Division of Mallee, points out to the House that GWM Water has proposed Green Lake and Dock Lake, south east of Horsham, will be designated as low-priority water storages when the federal, state and locally funded Wimmera Mallee Pipeline is completed. The importance of environmental values has been recognised; however, the GWM proposal fails to recognise the social value of safe recreational waters to inland country communities and families. Your petitioners therefore request the Federal Government ensures the Victorian State Government, GWM Water and other relevant authorities acknowledge the enormous social value of safe recreational water to Country communities. Considering the huge community financial investment in the pipeline project to create water savings, we ask that permanent water be guaranteed for recreational purposes, in particular Green Lake and Dock Lake. This water must be allocated by the State Government as a community service obligation when the Wimmera Mallee Pipeline water savings are available. by Mr Speaker (from 3,254 citizens) Immigration To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The humble petition of the Citizens of Australia, respectfully showeth: That we re affirm our support for the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia which states “Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth…..” (Constitution Act 9th July 1900) and the affirmation of 69% of our Australian population that they are Christians, and the statement of one of our founders that “this Commonwealth of Australia from its first stage will be a Christian Commonwealth” (Sir John Downer Water 1898), and the Opening Prayer of the Parliaments “Almighty God we humbly beseech Thee to vouchsafe Thy blessing upon this Parliament. Direct and prosper our deliberations to the adparvancement of Thy glory” and recognises the importance of these beliefs in ensuring the ongoing stability and unity of our Christian nation. Your petitioners therefore pray the Parliament of Australia will: 1. Review our Commonwealth Immigration Policy to ensure the priority for Christians from all races and colours, especially from persecuted nations, as both immigrants and refugees. 2. Adopt a ten year moratorium on Muslim immigration, so an assessment can be made on the social and political disharmony currently occurring in the Netherlands, France and the UK, so as to ensure we avoid making the same mistakes; and allow a decade for the Muslim leadership and community in Australia to reassess their situation so as to reject any attempt to establish an Islamic nation within our Australian nation.

135,Mr BIDGOOD,INTERESTS,"Dawson) (4.08 pm)When the laws that govern a nation are unjust then those laws and the government that created them must be changed. This is what the people of Australia comprehensively did on 24 November 2007. They rejected the coalition of conservative parties and their policies on Work Choices and nuclear power. In the seat of Dawson there was a primary vote swing to the Australian Labor Party of 16.9 per cent and 13.2 per cent on the twoparty preferred vote. This wiped out 32 years of National Party rule. Yes, it is the first time since Dr Rex Patterson, the former Whitlam Labor government minister-the only person 2008 to hold this seat for Labor for nine years until 1975. Ironically, on election day, I met him at the polling booth, where he said to me: ‘I think you could just do this.' Dr Rex is highly regarded. The people of Dawson still talk about how his visionary plans for the region were years ahead of anyone else of his time. Yes, he is a true Labor Party hero. Members of any political party should be warned: a 10 per cent margin is not a safe seat, especially when gross injustice has been done to working people and their families, when the laws of the nation allow wages and conditions to be legitimately ripped away from them. No-one should ever forget that. Ten per cent is not safe in those circumstances. The Bible says: ‘Where there is no vision, the people perish.' The previous government had no real vision for the future of this nation. They had lost their way. The Rudd Labor government has a very clear vision. Labor is about justice for all, regardless of wealth, race, religion, political view, sexuality or birth right. Labor is about treating everybody equally-a real fair go for all. Labor is about the freedom of speech, association, and liberties. Labor is about the strong helping the weak. Labor is about a bright vision for the future. Labor has a plan and a strategy that will invest in health, education and research, housing and key infrastructure to produce the productivity of this nation for the benefit and common good of all. In the first 100 days of this Rudd Labor government we have delivered on our promises to, first, sign the Kyoto agreement; second, apologise to the stolen generations; and, third, introduce legislation to scrap the unfair Work Choices laws. The Australian people, under a Rudd Labor government, have a nuclear-free future. We will not waste $25 billion on 25 nuclear power stations around this country which in 50 years time would have cost hundreds of billions of dollars to decommission. The people of Dawson and Australia have rejected that nuclear notion and have given a mandate to the Rudd Labor government to invest in green, environmentally friendly clean coal technology and to invest in solar, wind, wave and hot-rock thermal technology. Under the leadership of Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan, the Labor future for energy in Australia is safe. Our great-grandchildren will look back and thank this generation of leaders for creating a safe, renewable and sustainable energy system. I am so proud, humbled and honoured to be a part of this government. I am elected to serve, and I commit to serve with all my energy, as a representative for the people of Dawson, and to serve their interests well. We are all the product of our own experienceswhere and what circumstances we were born into. My political philosophy has been shaped by my development as a person and will guide my time as a representative in this place. Primarily, I am utilitarian. I believe that the role of government is to bring about the greatest amount of good to the greatest number of people. I believe in the fair go for all Australians. I love the ‘have a go' culture: ‘Give it a go and, if you fall over, here's a hand up, mate-and have another go.' That is what I love about our Australian attitude. is positive and encourages people not to give up. If at first you do not succeed, try again. believe in community and grassroots democracy. It is all about everyday people wanting to live a healthy, peaceful life, free from the fear of poverty, homelessness and war. My mother, Milly, was a single parent. I was fostered out when I was born at St Andrews Hospital, by the railway tracks in Bromley-by-Bow in the East End of London in 1959. I can truly say that I was born on the wrong side of the tracks. I was ‘adopted back' when I was one, when my mother married my stepfather, Michael Patrick Lynch. He was ‘Dad' to me. Dad was a labourer on building sites-a man who worked hard all of his life for very little reward. He passed away in February 2000. He would have been so proud to have seen me standing here today-St Patrick's Day-in parliament. My mother, Milly, is still alive, aged 87. She lives in Southend-on-Sea in Essex, England, where we moved in my first year of life and where I grew up sharing a house with my grandparents. I know what crowded housing is all about; I have lived it. My mother may be frail in her body but she is strong and young in her spirit and will argue her point strongly. Not a lot has changed there. When I left school I went into the print trade as an apprentice darkroom technician, planner and platemaker for the presses. As a young apprentice in the print trade in England, I witnessed first hand the workings of the Conservative Thatcher government against the printers, the miners, the steelworkers, the car workers and the shipbuilders. I saw first hand the way the government marginalised generations of the working class in my community and kept honest people trampled under foot. Three and a half million people were officially unemployed in 1982 in the UK. Living through that injustice instilled in me-long before Work ChoicesIt the notion that working people deserve a fair go and that government has no place in makI ing the lives of working families worse off. The government of the day, whoever that may be, should lift up working families, not put them down. That is why, as a Christian, I feel at home in the Labor Party. It is the party that stands up for social justice for all people, not just those who can afford it. My faith is what drives me spiritually, with the conviction that society can change when people change their way of thinking and leaders make plans that benefit the whole community, not just one selfish part of it. Prior to entering this place, I owned and managed two medical centres in Mackay as the financial director. I understand first hand the issues that face small businesses. I have proven that you can run a successful business and look after your workers. I also understand the needs of the health system in this country. The provision of health care is a core Labor priority. That is why we need Labor's National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission to end duplication and cost shifting, and we are committed to getting it right. Already, $150 million has been invested to fund 25,000 additional elective surgery procedures for those waiting beyond recommended times. Every child needs access to good health and a decent education from day one in order to have the best foundations in life. That is why we need Labor's plan to appoint Professor Barry MCGaw to chair a new national curriculum board to create consistent curricula across Australia in maths, English, science and history. Equality of opportunity in these fundamentals is not negotiable, and we are committed to getting it right. My electorate of Dawson is in the heart of Queensland, spanning from Mackay, Proserpine, Airlie Beach, the Whitsunday Islands, Bowen, Ayr, Home Hill, Stuart and Oonoonba to the Ross River in South Townsville. Stretching over 19,000 square kilometres, it is a seat of wonderful diversity, from agriculture to fishing and from sugar to meat works and mines. Dawson is a true economic powerhouse of the Australian economy. We need to move on and develop the economic triangle from Mount Isa to Townsville to Mackay. We need to have Chalco based at Abbotts Point, 20 kilometres north of Bowen, and a baseload power station between Bowen and Collinsville to power North Queensland. These are some of the key infrastructure, along with road and rail, that will boost the export productivity of the nation. I will be lobbying my fellow members of government and advocating these issues. Mining production value in Queensland as at 2007 equalled $25.3 billion, according to the Queensland Resources Council. From that, 36,000 jobs were created, and one in four of those are in the Bowen Basin. Queensland will need another 15,000 skilled resource workers by 2015. The sugar and coal industries are key economies in Dawson. The sugar industry has created many of the great townships of Mackay, Farleigh, Proserpine, Ayr and Home Hill in my electorate. Theirs is a rich history and they have an exciting future under a Rudd Labor government. Indeed, many of my constituents are descendants of sugar industry pioneers, among them South Sea Islanders, Italians and Maltese-those manual canecutters who slogged it out in the tropical Queensland heat to earn a hard living off the land, to build a life and raise a family in the region. They have come up the tough way, building their lives over the generations. Dawson is a region founded on sugar, and the sugar industry has a friend in Labor. There are exciting projects like the Rudd Labor government's investment, direct to canefarmers, of $200 million to help them in managing the water to reef run-off. There is also the $15 million commitment into research grants into Next Gen Ethanol, which offers real possibilities to the region for innovation allowing for continuous sustainability and growth of the sugar industry. Especially in times of low international sugar prices, we the Labor government will add value to the sugar industry by encouraging research in these areas. My vision for the future of Dawson is for real investments, not just lip service. This includes real investment in education and training to address the skills shortage which has so acutely affected regional Australia. The Rudd Labor government's investment in 450,000 new training places and our commitment to upskilling our workforce into the future is essential to deliver real results. There is also our investment into developing a $14 million mining technology and innovation skills centre in Mackay, which is a specialised centre that will deliver terrific term outcomes for all of Australia. Investment in such essential infrastructure is needed to secure our future prosperity. We need to work to ease capacity constraints in our economy. In Dawson we are powering on and contributing to the nation's bottom line. We on this side of the House are heading in the right direction on skills and training. We put priority on investing for the future: real commitments, real investment and real results. The Labor Party is the miner's friend-always has been and always will be. The coal industry has a true friend in the Labor Party, a true friend that will not give up on the industry. Dawson's economy relies on a sustainable coal industry, and I applaud our government's clear commitment to clean coal technologies, a technology that will ensure a real future for our coal industries. The $150 million fund-$50 million by government, $100 million by industry-will deliver clean coal technology to cut carbon emissions and clean up the industry. The workers in the coal industry have a true friend in Labor. These workers, above all, want health and safety and a fair go at work. They want their union by their side, and they see that Labor has a plan to secure the future of the coal industry. Another key industry is tourism and it continues to contribute significantly to employment in the region. Tourism, especially international tourism, is something that I am very passionate and determined about, as I can see great potential for Dawson to build on its image as a dynamic international tourist destination. To develop a greater range of tourist experiences, in partnership with the industry, is an achievable goal. Already, within my electorate, the world renowned Whitsunday region increased total visitations by nine per cent and the Mackay region increased total visitations by 11 per cent for the year ended 2007. Sports tourism is another longaspect that has potential in our region. One thing about the people who live in Dawson is that they love sport. I thank the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, for coming to Mackay during the election and promising to fund $8 million into the Mackay rugby league and junior rugby league stadium. The people of Dawson voted to scrap Work Choices and move forward with fairness in the workplace. The people of Dawson voted to say no to 25 nuclear power stations in Australia. The people of Dawson voted yes to new leadership, yes to fresh ideas, yes to an education revolution and yes to a government with vision. The Rudd Labor government has that vision for the future. I pay tribute to the tireless work of over 300 Labor Party members and supporters throughout the entire electorate who have worked selflessly towards electing me into a Rudd Labor government. There would be no Labor Party without these true believers: the rank and file. A special thanks must go to my committed campaign team. I thank my campaign director, Frank Gilbert, and his wife, Julieanne. It is amazing to think that I campaigned for Frank in this seat after I had just arrived from the UK in January 1993, and also in 1996. It is especially pleasing for him to see this victory in Dawson. I want to say thank you to my old friend, and assistant campaign director, John Pollitt. He singlehandedly managed my successful Mackay City Council election campaign in 2004. He is in the gallery today. John, I salute you for all the hours and hard work you have put this victory. Thanks go to my campaign office manager, Nurse Wendy Clement, and her husband, Jeff. Wendy and Jeff gave so much time and energy. Thanks for everything. Thanks also to my campaign team: Deborah Green; Dennis Bailey; Andrea Pozza and his fiancee Zoe; Therese Kingston and Muddy Waters; James Sullivan, who organised the pre-poll booths; and all of the branches of the ALP in Dawson. I could not have won this victory without you, the true believers. Thank you, one and all. Thank you, Queensland Labor campaign organisers Chris Forrester, Antony Chisolm and Lynis Powell; Queensland president Ron Moynahan; and state secretary Milton Dick. Thank you, Sharan Burrow of the ACTU. Thank you for your support, Dave Smith, from my union, the ASU. Thank you, Dave Hannah, from the BLF-the building labourers will always be special to me. Thank you, Andrew Vickers, Tony Maher from the CFMEU, and Bill Ludwig and Bill Shorten from the AWU, whom I am pleased to see is now the member for Maribyrnong. Thank you to the entire Your Rights at Work campaign team across the great Australian union movement. Locally, Lara Watson was the Dawson Your Rights at Work organiser. Thank you for the ‘Rock off Johnny' concert and all that you did. We won't-or can't-forget it. Thank you to the rank and file of the MUA locally in Dawson for their dedication, especially Laurie Horgan and Gary Bell. It really is ‘all the way with the MUA'. Thank you to Glenn Hall from the ETU and Shane Brunker from the CFMEU. Thank you to Les Mofit of RTBU and Margie Dale of QCU Townsville. Thank you to the Queensland state member for Mackay, Tim Mulherin, and the state member for Whitsunday, Jan Jarrat, for their wisdom and advice. To my former Labor councillors who I served time with on the Mackay City Council for the last into four years, Don Rolls, Kev Casey and Greg Thomsen, I thank you for your support. To my friends in the gallery today, Rex Small, Brendan Greenhill and Lee Webster, I thank you for your friendship and support. To my friend and the pastor of Christian City Church Mackay, John Gilbank, I thank you for all your prayers-more will be required. To Kevin Rudd, Kim Beazley, Simon Crean, Wayne Swan, Martin Ferguson and Kirsten Livermore, I thank you all for visiting me and for giving your time in Dawson. Thank you to Senators Chris Evans, John Hogg, Claire Moore, Joe Ludwig, Kerry O'Brien, Kate Lundy and Kim Carr and to the new Senator-elect Mark Furner. Thank you also for coming to support me in Dawson. I want to personally thank Senator Jan MCLucas, whom I first met during Cherry Feeney's two federal campaigns. Jan, you really have been a great help in this victory. It was your encouragement and support that convinced me to stand and you were there at key times during my very long campaign. I congratulate the new mayors in Dawson on their election on Saturday, 15 March 2008. Well done to Les Tryell in the Townsville City Council, Lyn MCLaughlin in the Burdekin Shire Council, Mike Brunker in the Whitsunday Regional Council and Col Meng in the Mackay Regional Council. I promise to work with you all, regardless of political lines, for positive outcomes for our people. The recent flooding in my electorate has been nothing short of devastating. From Ayr, Bowen and Proserpine to the Whitsundays, it really has been a big wet. Indeed, in Mackay, this year's rain has been the worse seen in 90 years. Over 600 millimetres of rain fell in 24 hours. There has been $170 million worth of damage-and rising-done to date, which has left 8,000 homes affected; 400 families cannot return to their home for six months. My electorate office has also has also been completely knocked out and my staff have been working out of my home office while we wait six months for new premises. Thank you Jane Casey, Adel Howland, James Sullivan, John Pollitt and Andrea Pozza; you are a great staff team. You are the mobile office. Since the flooding, the community have rallied together and responded magnificently in their moment of crisis. Their spirits have been comforted and lifted by the visit of His Excellency the Governor General; the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd; and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh. Thank you, Prime Minister, for your immediate action in releasing $1,000 per adult and $400 per child in emergency relief payments. Thank you also for giving half a million dollars while you were on your visit in Mackay to match the Queensland government's half a million dollars in its flood appeal. That will help all floodaffected areas in Queensland. On behalf of the people of Dawson, I say, from my heart, thank you. I sincerely congratulate and thank all the volunteers and emergency service workers on the ground. They have been working around the clock to help local families and small businesses get back on their feet as soon as possible. I say to the SES, Red Cross, all the emergency services and Meals on Wheels: you are the true community heroes; you have done a magnificent job and we are proud of you. There is no greater honour than to be elected to serve, represent and be a real voice for the community in this parliament. I promise to honourably represent my constituency, following in the footsteps of great community leaders such as William Forgan Smith; Dr Rex Patterson; and, in the state seat of Mackay, the former state opposition leader against the Bjelke-Petersen government, the late, great Edmund Casey. For me, Australia truly has been the lucky country and the land of opportunity. From the East End of London to Southend in Essex, then to the east end of Mackay and now to the east wing of parliament, it has been a long journey and one that I only ever dreamed of. Mackay has given me among the things that I cherish most in life. It is in Mackay that I have built a home and raised a family. My daughters-Jazmin, 12, and Zoe, six-and son, Jade, nine, are my pride and joy, born to my former wife, Dr Rachel Bidgood, at the Mackay Base Hospital birthing centre. Unfortunately, the kids cannot be here today, but I have a photo of us together on the night that we won Dawson. I am so proud that they could share that historic moment with me. I want to thank my partner, Davina, for her love and support over the last couple of years. To conclude, I promise to continue to listen and act on behalf of the people of Dawson. Rest assured that I listened when the prospect of a nuclear Australia was rejected by the constituents of Dawson. I listened when the people said they did not want unfair industrial relations laws. I will work for the people and, in government, make their voice heard. Labor will give voice to the the voiceless, homes to the homeless, power to the powerless and strength to the weak. This Rudd Labor government stands for the rights and freedoms of association for the common good of all. The Labor Party stands united with the workers of this great nation of Australia, and this unity is the strength that will deliver a great future for Australia. (Time expired)",79
136,The SPEAKER,INTERESTS,I indicate to the chamber that here endeth the first speeches.,84
137,Dr SOUTHCOTT,INTERESTS,"I congratulate the member for Dawson on his maiden speech. We all remember our maiden speech. I cannot help but think that his skills in oratory might have been honed on a soapbox in Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park. I would also like to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your election to that office, an office that was also occupied by your father. We have enormous respect in this House for the way you have carried out all of your duties and responsibilities as Deputy Speaker and also Speaker. I would like to congratulate you very sincerely on your election to that position. I would also like to record my thanks to the voters in Boothby who, on 24 November, re-elected me as their representative. I will do my best to see that their views are faithfully represented in this chamber. It is a great honour for anyone to be a member of the House of Representatives in the federal parliament. Since Federation in 1901, just over 1,000 people have served in this House. It is an honour that none of us takes lightly. I regard it as a great honour, and I am glad that I have the opportunity to continue in this role. A lot has been written and said about the 2007 campaign in the electorate of Boothby. The Labor Party said a lot about it before the campaign, during the campaign and after the campaign. I do not seek to add to the commentary on the 2007 campaign, but I will say that a lot of hard work went into it and that I would not have missed a second of anything that happened during it. Since 2004, I, as the member, and my team have doorknocked over 10,000 homes on our spare Saturday and Sunday afternoons. I have held thousands of conversations with the local people and their families on their doorsteps, sometimes from behind their doors. I heard directly from them about the issues that they would like to see action on-the issues that are important to them. I have many memories of these conversations. For instance, I remember being at a railway station at 7 am and explaining to a constituent the intricacies of our tax plan and the low income tax offset, which had been released only the day before. It is the sort of thing that you are expected to do as a member-to be on top of everything. I found many people in their front gardens when I came to talk to them, and they spoke of their enormous frustration over the lack of water and lack of security for Adelaide's water supply. This was one issue that many voters in Boothby wanted to see action on. The crippling drought and the severe water restrictions were almost always a topic of conversation at the door or in the front garden. Last week, I presented a petition from 7,000 constituents calling on the South Australian government to do more in providing security for our water supply and to revisit the water restrictions, including the bucket policy. The petition was distributed last September, and I am pleased that the South Australian state government has moved, slowly, to begin work on a desalination plant and that it has modified its water restrictions in the face of overwhelming community opposition. I am also pleased to note that it is the Liberal Party in South Australia that is now setting the agenda on a whole range of things. They have a vision for South Australia and a comprehensive plan to deal with the drought and our reliance on the Murray. At the beginning of the year, I flew over the Murray, from Mildura to Murray Bridge, and it was clear that, where once lagoons supported bird life, all that was left was a salt pan. Beaches were exposed in the river which were previously the river bottom. The state of the Murray, the drying up of Lake Alexandrina and what that means for the environment of the Coorong are the reasons I supported the $10 billion plan for water security in the Murray-Darling. It is worth noting that the new government is over 100 days into its term. This plan was 90 per cent complete when it was presented to Labor on the change of government, but we still have not seen any action on it. This is a very important issue for my constituents, and it is one that I will take an interest in as long as the member for Boothby. The environmental issues raised by constituents ranged from local to global. I am pleased that the Liberal Party supports the ratification of the Kyoto protocol. While our concerns about signing it were legitimate, once we were on track to meet our commitments it made little sense to continue to decline ratification of the protocol. I pledge work with local groups to help restore our coastal dunes, eradicate weeds in our local reserves, improve the quality of the Sturt River and Sturt Creek and help reduce the bushfire risk to homes in the Hills Face Zone. In January, our local community had a serious bushfire which threatened homes in Brownhill Creek, Mitcham and Belair and which consumed over 20 hectares of bushland. The CFS and MFS responded with every asset they had and were able to contain the fire within three hours of its outbreak. It is 25 years on from Ash Wednesday, and this recent fire has been a reminder that many of our built-up areas are too vulnerable to the threat of bushfire. This makes it absolutely critical that households eliminate any fuel loads on their property and have a detailed fire safety plan available that they can implement when they make their decision to stay or go. Local and state governments also have a role in helping to reduce the risk of flammable weeds and in ensuring that fire services have the assets that they require. I have ken on this previously, but we have a particular problem in our area with feral olives; are highly flammable. It requires a concerted effort from all levels of government to reduce this fuel load. On the issue of fire assets, the helicopter did fantastic work filling up from the Playford Lake and dumping its load on fires. However, I wonder whether the I am time has come for us to consider having an Erickson sky crane full-time in South Australia. The one currently based in Canberra is available to us. But fires occur very quickly. This latest fire broke out at 4 o'clock and was contained by 7 o'clock, with the work dealing with the logs and so on continued overnight. Another issue which I will continue to to speak out about is the quality of local infrastructure. You do not have to travel far to realise that the quality of infrastructure in Adelaide is very poor by comparison with other capital cities. During the campaign, while talking to people at railway stations last year, it was clear that people are fed up with the lack of investment in infrastructure by successive state governments. Breakdowns are a common occurrence on the South Australian rail network, and delays on our simple train system are part of commuters' daily routine. Something else that I have also spoken about is the vision of a north-south road corridor. The RAA visited me on this issue last year, and I took up the issue of the north-south road corridor and putting a stretch of South Road from Sir Donald Bradman Drive to Darlington on the national road network, which allows it to receive AusLink funding. I was very pleased that, after a lot of lobbying, the Prime Minister made this announcement in August last year. While I am disappointed that it will not be my side of politics that will now be in a position to fund this north-south spo- road corridor, I am pleased that the Labor Party made a similar commitment to the one they made by the Howard government, so this important project will go ahead. I welcome the $500 million which was committed by the Labor Party to continue the work on this vital piece of infrastructure. It is not clear to me how much the South Australian state government will be contributing over the same period-we had a proposal that it would be matching funding-but I do welcome the $500 million which has been committed by the Labor Party to work on grade separations and an upgrade of South Road between 2009 and 2014. Another issue which concerns residents is law and order and crime. Just last month, there was a serious incident in my electorate involving over 100 youths from the southern suburbs swarming on a party. Police cars were vandalised. It was apparent that people had used the internet and SMS to descend on what was a child's party. This now means parents have to have security for children's parties, and we also have an issue with gangs in the southern suburbs. One of the things I was very keen to do, had the Howard government been re-elected, was push for CCTV cameras to help local policing. With the City of Holdfast Bay, we were able to get a CCTV camera in Moseley Square in Glenelg. This was the major priority for the Sturt LSA and also for the southern suburbs. That has been welcomed by the community, it has been welcomed by traders in that area, and it has also been welcomed by the police. The Labor Party made a number of commitments in the electorate of Boothby during the campaign. They made a commitment for $3 million for a feasibility study on alternagrowth tive rail routes through the Adelaide Hills. They made a commitment for $2 million for a performing arts centre at the Brighton Secondary School. They made a commitment for $1 million for an upgrade of the Marion Sports & Community Club. They made a commitment for $130,000 for lights at the Blackwood Football Club. And they made a commitment for $20,000 for the Sturt Baseball Club for nets and for junior sport. Of those commitments, four were taken from my future plans, but I am pleased that they did take up my future plans, and I look forward to these commitments being delivered by the Labor Party as soon as possible. These are all worthy projects which have my support and, I am sure, the community's support, and I will be asking that this money is forwarded to the local groups as soon as possible. There are many features of the electorate of Boothby which I have spoken on in the past. One of the things that make it special is that we have a number of landmark institutions in disability services: Minda Inc., Bedford Industries and CanDo4Kids, which used to be the old Townsend House. While these names are not always known interstate, they are certainly outstanding facilities. Bedford is now the second largest provider of disability employment services in Australia. Also, Townsend House has been providing education for children with multiple sensory disabilities for over 130 years. As the local member, I have been pleased to have a great relationship with all of these organisations, and I look forward to working with them on any issues that they would like addressed. There are a number of issues that the parliament will have to consider. One of them is, obviously, the ageing of our population. It is expected that, in less than 40 years, a quarter of our population will be over 65. As a result, we are going to have much lower of the labour force, and this means it is absolutely critical that we improve workforce participation. This was a focus of the previous government. There are a number of areas for older workers, for men aged between 25 and 54 and especially for women in their late 20s, 30s and early 40s where our participation rates are much lower than those of comparable countries. We can do better there, and we will need to do better if we are going to maintain our standard of living into the future. The most recent unemployment figures show that the unemployment rate is at four per cent. This is before the new government has made any changes to any of our settings on workplace relations or tax-although it is our tax policy that the new government will be implementing. However, I saw in the newspaper that Access Economics believe that, as a result of Labor's strategy on inflathe tion, we will see the unemployment rate go up to five per cent. That will mean that 100,000 people who would otherwise be in work will be put out of work under this government's economic policies. Recently I visited the Mitsubishi car plant in my electorate. As members would be aware, a decision was made in February to cease operations in Australia this month. The plant has been operating since 1964. At the time it was opened, it was one of the jewels in the crown of South Australian manufacturing. It has been an important source of employment in the southern suburbs. My principal concern is for the workers at Mitsubishi. I am pleased to say to the House that the support they have had from the company, from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, DEEWR; from the South Australian Department of Further Education, Employment, Science and Technology, DFEEST; and from a whole host of businesses and training providers has been outstanding. The way that all of the workers are getting advice about their futures has been well thought through. I think it is certainly a very good example of government, the company and business working together to find jobs for these skilled workers. In concluding my speech in the address in reply debate, I would like to say that it is a great honour to represent the electorate of Boothby. It is a fantastic electorate to represent and I am very pleased to have the opportunity to continue my work as its member.",84
138,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,INTERESTS," Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, it is nice to have a friend and fellow Tasmanian in the chair for this address-in-reply debate, to have a friend who is also returning to parliament, the member for Hasluck, to have my friend member for Lowe at the table and to have new members with me as well. Mr Baldwin-What about us? Dr Southcott-Yes, what about us?",88
139,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,INTERESTS,"I am just about to get to you. Congratulations to returning members and to new members. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I am in the unusual but certainly not unique position, having two other members in this House in the same position, of being a new member again, a resurrected MP, which is probably rather apt around Easter time. My return journey to this place, like that of my colleagues no doubt, has taught me some very valuable lessons, some personally very painful I must say and others very salient-salient perhaps for others in this House, new and renewed, high and low. Today gives me an opportunity to share some of these, if I may. As I said, this journey is both a personal and a political journey. At its heart are the people and communities of the north-west coast of Tasmania and King Island-that is, the electorate of Braddon. I have the privilege to live in and represent a truly beautiful part of the world. Physically, the electorate of Braddon, from east to west, takes in the townships of Port Sorell and Latrobe, the city of Devonport, the towns of Ulverstone and Penguin, the city of Burnie and the towns of Somerset, Wynyard, Stanley and Smithton-and the gem in this north-western crown is King Island itself. To the south lies the fertile rugged hinterlands of pasture, mountains and forests and to the west lies the magnificent rugged west coast with its mineral wealth, forests and abundant fishing, bordering on the electorate of Lyons, so ably represented by you, Mr Deputy Speaker. When we talk about economic activity, several traditional industries are associated with Braddon. It is renowned as a major food-producing area, particularly in relation to vegetable growing and processing. I have always said that the soil is so fertile where live you could throw a toenail in the ground and grow a foot. It is so wonderful. Dairy, beef and fish are iconic products of the region, along with forestry, papermaking and mineral producing. Our region also is, as some may not know, a quality producer of fine carpets and towels. Braddon's tradespeople are well known for their practicality and skills. The region has a long history of light industry often associated with the more traditional manufacturing and processing industries. Newer industries have emerged along with an economy that is becoming more diversified, so necessary in the light of challenges facing our more traditional manufacturing industries. Light industries and an innovative range of service industries have grown up around the wind energy industry, for example. Innovative companies service the agricultural and horticultural sectors. Local small and highly creative IT companies have emerged. Viticulture, with the production of wine and with the spirits industry, continues to expand. Tourist ventures further seek to cash in on this magnificent environment. There are many strengths in our region and in our communities. Businesses leaders and organisations strive to build on those in partnership with local, state and federal ernments. But, like so much of regional and rural Australia, my region faces many challenges. My region is an ageing one-we still lose many of our young to other parts of Australia and the world, often to seek better education and careers prospects; many never return, however, to work and live and settle with their families. Comparatively low educational standards, low university participation rates and low retention rates to years 11 and 12 are hindering productivity and employment opportunities for many of our young. The reliance on attracting and retaining professional services and skills is doubly I difficult because of this, a problem I know we share with many regions. Whilst unemployment has declined in our region, we still have a comparatively high national rate of youth and long-term unemployment. This, along with the ageing population, puts even more pressure on the demand for social services, benefits, health and well-being services, and social and physical infrastructure such as housing, aged-care facilities, comlarger munications and transport. My region is positively responding to many of these challenges, and I look forward to encouraging and supporting individuals, businesses and communities in this process. I am really proud to say that many of this new government's policies are designed to support this process and that I have been able, in the last few years, to actually have some input into some of these at the national and electorate level. I first campaigned as a federal candidate for Braddon in 1996 and managed a three per cent swing to Labor in very difficult electoral times. I continued to campaign between 1996 and 1998 and, with a swing of around 10 per cent, won the seat in 1998 with a campaign that cost around $17,000. If my memory serves me correctly, the polling said we could not win. In 2001-again, against the gov- odds-we had a further three per cent swing in Braddon to Labor. For me and my region, the period 1998 to 2004 was indeed a time of exciting change, opportunity and challenge. The innovative Cradle Coast Authority came into being and, with politically and organisationally rejuvenated local councils and regional leadership, the region began to coherently adjust to the changing economic and social challenges facing us. A dynamic state government led by the late Jim Bacon promoted and nurtured a resurgent, outward-looking and more confident Tasmania, and the north-west coast contributed to and benefited from this renewed sense of optimism. Much of this legacy is still with us as we seek to consolidate and then expand on our successes and come to grips with the challenges that continue to face us. One of these challenges is sociocultural in nature. It involves a need to adopt practical, realistic expectations of service availability, delivery and costs. This is never more so than in the area of health services, matching traditional expectations with modern standards of sustainable service delivery, safety and cost. In 2004 I lost my seat. Needless to say, I was devastated, along with my family and hard working and loyal staff. I am confident, however, that what happened in Braddon, rather than to Sid Sidebottom, is a salient lesson-not just for me but, I humbly suggest, for others, both politicians and political operatives, in this place. Indeed, another returning member, the member for Canning, has returned to the House, and I thank him for his personal support. I see a parallel between the 2004 election and its result in Braddon and this election past in November 2007. In both cases, Braddon reflected the national verdict and, I suggest, for primarily the same reason: crossing the line between acceptable practices and policy and those which were not-in short, violating the fair go principle. Until the 1998 election, Braddon had voted conservative for nearly 25 years after a long stint of voting Labor. The change coincided with the introduction of the GST by the Howard government which disadvantaged many low-income people in Braddon. I would like to claim that my standing as a candidate made a significant difference this time; however, the pollsters told me: ‘minimal'. In 2001, federal Labor was preferred again to a Howard government intent on selling off Telstra, increasingly strident about industrial relations and pursuing social policies that divided rather than united Australians-sound familiar?even if many in Braddon sympathised with Mr Howard's strong anti-boat-people policies. But many of these same folk saw the policy for what it was; the methods became increasingly objectionable. In contrast with many other parts of the country, Labor's vote in Braddon went up by about three per cent, reflective again of a good national campaign led by Kim Beazley in the face of the after-effects of 9-11, the Tampa affair and ‘children overboard'. On 9 October 2004, I lost my seat in a major swing against Labor of around seven per cent. I can honestly tell you that I knew this was going to happen when I heard of the extent of Labor's forest policy on the Monday of the final week of the campaign, when Mark Latham delivered his bombshell in Hobart and immediately flew out of the state. Howard's subsequent forest policy was far less explosive in comparison, although still substantive in effect, but it was greeted with enthusiasm by the industry and many in my electorate, in comparison with the Latham blitzkrieg policy. The images of workers greeting and cheering John Howard at the Albert Hall in Launceston later in the final week all but ended the campaigns in Braddon, Bass, MCMillan and Eden-Monaro. While some analysts will say that to blame the forest policy for the loss of these seats is somewhat simplistic-and I will grant that the Latham Labor campaign was becoming progressively more volatile and problematic the further the election campaign went-I have no doubt that the loss of Braddon was guaranteed. Indeed, the last EMRS poll taken in Tasmania late in the campaign had Labor in Braddon at around 53 per cent of the two-party preferred vote ing into the last week. However, we literally saw-and I mean literally saw-and heard prepolling voters turn dramatically away from us after the Monday with the same message: ‘Your radical forest policy was a disaster for our region and working families.' The people of Braddon voted accordingly and I have always said that I can understand why. Call me vain, but I never interpreted it as an anti-Sid vote, and that is why I announced on the day after the election that I would seek preselection again-to put right what I believed was a wrong policy and, most importantly, what I saw as a betrayal of working people. It was not just the end in this case; it was also the means. To announce without consultation and without notice a policy which so affected the lives and jobs of so many people in my electorate and state, both directly and especially indirectly, was both an insult and terrible politics. It was not fair in any sense of the word. Labor had to go in Braddon and so did I as its representative. I cannot deny that I was bitter over what happened, and it took me over 12 months to come to terms with this loss. However, my family and close friends were very supportive and I took heart from the many people I met who encouraged me to stand again. The Labor Party was also supportive and I thank all those who helped and encouraged me to keep at it. I also had a chance to directly help correct our flawed forest policy, which I was able to do through direct personal lobbying and nagging over three years.",88
140,Mr MELHAM,INTERESTS,You have always been a nagger!,91
141,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,INTERESTS,"I am very pleased to nag but will never reach your Olympian nagging heights! I was therefore very proud when our Prime Minister chose Smithton and the historic mill of the Britton Bros to anleadnounce our forest policy and $20 million industry package. This, along with our other working family positive policies and our industrial relations policy, saw an 11 per cent swing back to Labor in Smithton and other forest booths. I felt in no small way vindicated in my stance and grateful to a party and a leader prepared to do the right thing by once again balancing the important needs of industry, working families and the environment and by putting that policy out publicly and early. The rest is history. The return of Braddon to Labor was no accident. The voters of Braddon perceived unfairness and arrogance in Labor in the 2004 election. The same verdict played out for the Howard government in November 2007. I would like to place on the record that the 2007 vote was not primarily a reflection of the work of my predecessor, Mark Baker, as such-and I thank him and his team for their hard work from 2004 to 2007. It was, I suggest, a repudiation of the methods and arrogance of John Howard and his government. Just as Mark Latham adopted without consultation or notice a radical policy which affected the lives and jobs of working people in Braddon, so too did John Howard with his so-called Work Choices legislation, which cruelly offered little choice to workers. This was introduced only after he had won the 2004 election and gained control of the Senate. It stirred a dispirited union movement into a grand cause, which in turn rallied many working families and individuals to action. Federal Labor joined this cause and, for the first time in many years, the Labor movement united in a common campaign against an unfair industrial relations system. Mums and dads, grandparents, uncles and aunts and the young rallied against this attack on the fair go. Mr Howard's self-professed aspirational nationalism had nothing to do with uniting the nation. People in Braddon saw through this and they saw that it had a lot to do with Mr Howard's political aspirations. Kevin Rudd, on the other hand, captured the mood, interest and aspirations of millions of Australians, in stark contrast to the old politics the Howard era of wedge politics and pandering to interest groups. The people of Braddon know what is fair and reasonable and, just as they did in the elections before and no doubt will continue to do in the future, they voted accordingly in 2004 and 2007. There is nothing fickle about this. They vote primarily on what they perceive to be a fair go for the majority and, as much as I suffered from it in 2004, I would not want it any other way. I sincerely thank the electors of Braddon for again choosing me to represent them both in Canberra and at home, and I will do so to the best of my ability and energy. I have a new team on board and already we are flat out with constituent enquiries. My journey back was encouraged and supported by many people, many of whom are in this place and gave that as a result of my association with them as a former member and colleague. I hope that I do not embarrass anyone, as some belong to the other side, but they were concerned for me as a friend and individual and shared the similar prospect of winning or losing. I thank in no particular order and with equal gratitude, and I pray I have not left anybody out, the following: Kim Beazley, Martin Ferguson, Julia Gillard, Craig Emerson, Michael Danby, Steve Gibbons, Julia Irwin, Brendan O'Connor, Simon Crean, Carol Brown, Kerry O'Brien, Kirsten Livermore, Dick Adams, John Murphy and Harry Jenkins. My friend and colleague Senator Nick Sherry and his office were constant supporters and provided invaluable help. In particular, I thank my special mate and confidante Sally Young, along with my lovely cousin, Tresa, and Shane, Robyn, Marcus, Richard and Leonie. Andrew K. from Canberra gave up his annual leave to come down and work on my campaign, and I will always be grateful. Special thanks also go to Tracey Winters, of Kim Pagan, Sally Pugsley and Michael O'Connor for their individual friendship and encouragement. Kerry Whittle, Norm Britton, Leigh Jordan, Matt Tidswell, Steve Allen, Justine Keay, Beth Lockett, Ken and Brenton Best, Grace Matcham, Dee Alty and Julie Collins were always there with their support and encouragement, as were my local Labor Party branches. I also want to sincerely thank Labor's National Secretary, Tim Gartrell, Elias, David Feeney, Paul Foster and Monique Woodham-Earsman for their terrific support. I was very proud to work alongside my very active local Your Rights at Work team, so ably led by Jill Batt, and I thank them for their hard work, determination and solidarity. So too do I thank the many unions who backed me in my campaign. My friend Christian Zahra, the former wonderful member for MCMillan, never stopped encouraging and supporting me even though he too lost his seat in 2004. Christian Zahra was probably the most inspirational of my parliamentary peers from my first class, the class of '98, and was a major reason why I am fortunate to be a member of the class of 2007-thank you, matey. I am already missing our games of squash. The driving force behind my campaign was the indomitable, hard working, superorganised, ultranagging political warrior and all-round good bloke John Dowling. I thank you, John, from the bottom of my heart. I was so very proud when you were recently appointed state secretary of the Tasmanian branch of the Labor Party. In speech after speech there comes a time when new and returning MPs reach a point of almost emotional saturation-where there is an extra deep breath, a slight pause, somea times a moist eye, and the gathering of the self-when they reflect in an instant on the influence, love and support of their loved ones. My mum and dad were alive to see me elected to this House in 1998 and 2001. They both died before I lost my seat in 2004, but I know they would be pleased to see their ‘Pete' not throw the towel in after 2004 but keep pressing on to finish the business. They are constantly in my heart and they are certainly with me now. I also love and thank my brothers and sister-Geoff, John, Essie and Jenny-and their lovely families. My strongest supporters and the ones who love me most-so often undeserved by me-are my family: my lovely wife, Bron, who asks and expects nothing of me but encourages me to find personal happiness and fulfilmentwhenever and if ever; and my two beautiful sons, Julian and William, who have always supported my endeavours whether they be in career, theatre or politics. I thank them for their love and indulgence. I thank all members and wish you a very successful and happy parliamentary career.",91
142,Mr TURNBULL,INTERESTS,"When the February unemployment figure of four per cent was released last Thursday, we did not hear much about it from the government. All we hear from the Treasurer is how he wants to modernise the economy, whatever that is supposed to mean. He provides very few particulars. He was asked last week a dorothy dixer about unemployment and he gave what is fast becoming his stump speech-an explosion of complete incoherence and utter confusion. His first quarter headline CPI, which in this context the ‘competence performance indicator', is not good; and his underlying measure of CPI, his ability to answer questions coherently, is even worse. Late last year the member for Higgins said that the now Treasurer reminded him of ‘a political cyborg who runs line over and over again in the hope that journalists will pick it up'. Well, the cyborg is malfunctioning. It needs reprogramming; it needs help. It is the cyborg, not the Australian economy, that is in desperate need of modernisation! The Treasurer thinks he can get away with commenting on the Australian economy in a way that persistently misrepresents our economic circumstances and our economic history. And it is not just our history that he misrepresents; he misrepresents all the members of the opposition who speak about the economy. Only today he said again in question time, as did the Prime Minister, that I have described inflation as a fairytale. So once again I wearily rose to my feet on a point of personal explanation and corrected it. The Treasurer knows full well that I have never said inflation is a fairytale. Inflation is a very significant economic challenge, particularly in these times where we have high economic growth and historically very low unemployment-and I have said that again and again. What I have criticised the Treasurer for doing is telling falsehoods and fairytales about our economic history and, in particular, the history of inflation. There is a transcript of my remarks in that context from 23 January-a public document that is on my website-but he misrepresents them every time he has the opportunity. But the person whom the Treasurer, the cyborg, misrepresents the most is surely the Governor of the Reserve Bank. There is nobody in Australia at present who is more misleadingly cited than the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Last week the governor gave is a very comprehensive speech about inflation, its causes, its remedies and its context in modern Australia-it was a speech in the Australian Treasury seminar series-and today we had the Treasurer claiming that this supported his views about inflation. The Treasurer wants to set up a straw man to the effect that the opposition does not believe inflation exists. Of course, the Reserve Bank supports the Treasurer's views that inflation exists. But nobody has denied that and nobody has denied that it is a challenge. Where we take issue with the Treasurer is not in the form of the straw man, the bogus proposition that he puts up as our case; our criticism of the Treasurer is that he is misrepresenting a very serious challenge and that, in doing so, he is talking down the strength of our economy and exacerbating inflationary expectations. Every time he opens his mouth on this subject, the Treasurer says that inflation has been caused by the ‘reckless spending' of the Howard government, by a ‘chronic skills crisis'-that is his phrase-and by a failure to invest in remedying what he describes as infrastructure bottlenecks, the ones we are most familiar with, being the problems at ports that export raw materials, particularly coal. There are certainly infrastructure bottlenecks in our society. There are certainly skills shortages in a number of industrieswe would say many sectors now-where there is strong demand. But it is untrue to say that there is a chronic skills crisis, because, by saying that, it suggests that there is a shortage of skills right across the economy, that it is pervasive, that it is chronic, that is of long endurance and that it is not being addressed. Yet we know from the many speeches and papers given by the Reserve Bank-you only have to look at the speech last week by the Reserve Bank Governorthat our inflation has not come from wages. It is obvious that a chronic skills crisis would cause wage inflation right across the economy. That is why you would not want to have a chronic skills crisis. The Reserve Bank Governor said he is not saying that wage earners have been responsible for inflation. He said: This episodethis episode of elevated inflation through which we are living at the momenthas not been caused by some exogenous ‘break out' in wages. Until recently, it was, in fact, possible to say that wages growth had been remarkably steady at an aggregate level in the face of a very tight labour market, with relative wages across industries and regions doing what one would expect given the shocks hitting the economy. At one stage, I described this as a textbook case of adjustment, in a labour market made much more flexible by a long sequence of reforms. That statement, which is in the same terms as many remarks from the Reserve Bank, underlines the nonsense that is being spread by the Treasurer. Yes, we have skills shortages, particularly in those areas with the strongest demand, the mining sector being the classic case. But, because we have a flexible labour market and because we have an efficient labour market, workers have been able to move to the areas of greatest demand and, remarkably, we have not seen the type of wage inflation that we had in the past. If you go to the conclusion of the governor's speech, and this is a speech by the governor that the Treasurer calls in aid for himself, it rejects the notion of a chronic skills crisis-it does not even mention the termbut it makes it clear that it is not skills shortages that are driving inflation. He compares our economy today with the circumstances of the 1950s and the mid-seventies, when in the early fifties CPI inflation reached 25 per cent and in the mid-seventies it reached about 18 per cent. He said: This time, we are grappling with a peak CPI inflation rate that looks like it will be around 4 per cent in CPI terms, and trying to assess how soon it can reasonably return to 2-3 per cent. I should add that the average headline CPI throughout all of the 47 quarters of the Howard government-including the December quarter of last year which was, of course, only partly under the Howard governmentis exactly 2½ per cent, right in the midpoint of the RBA's range, so it is mission accomplished in terms of inflation targeting. But the governor went on to say: This is a far cry from the problems of yesteryear. He then said: The reason we are doing better this time around not hard to fathom ... a flexible exchange rate, reformed and flexible industrial environment, better private-sector management ... stronger cal and monetary policy frameworks have made a lot of difference. The fruits of those decades of effort of reform are an economy that, for all its strains, is doing well under the circumstances. And further: Our challenge is to keep those improved structures in place and to develop them further, period in which we have the privilege of having some influence. That is a balanced description of our economic circumstances. Yes, inflation is an issue; it is a challenge; it is consequent upon, as the governor says, the extraordinary improvement-a good, positive shock-in our terms of trade. We have been able nonetheless to manage our economy, thanks to the sound economic management during the Howard and Costello years, with low unemployment, high economic growth and inflation managed within the range. Why does it matter that the Treasurer misrepresents our economic history? Well, the fact is that inflation is a function of expectation. He chose to misrepresent our economic history and, for purely politically partisan purposes, to try to paint a picture of a new government that had been handed an economic mess. That was the picture he tried to create, presumably so he and the Prime Minister could be given the credit for resolving it. The fact is that we have a very strong economy. We have very considerable international pressures and threats. We are strong and we are resilient, but we are not immune to the rest of the world, and everything that senior officials say in this country is taken seriously in the rest of the world. When our Treasurer said in early February, just before the bank board met, ‘The inflation genie is out of the bottle,' and, ‘Inflation has been on the march for two years,' is the headlines around the world described a a country where inflation was out of control. He has the effrontery to call the Reserve fisBank Governor in aid in support of this nonsense. The Reserve Bank Governor is there saying, ‘Yes, it is an issue. Yes, we are going to tackle it. That is why we've put up rates.' That, of course, is what central banks do: they put up rates when the economy is growing and they want to moderate growth, and in the they pull them off-as Governor Bernanke is doing in the United States-if the economy is heading in the other direction and they want to avoid slowdown or, as in the United States, a recession. What the Treasurer has done, instead of talking about our economy in a measured, objective and informed way, in a way that assists the markets to understand and deal with the complex challenges we face, is create his own ‘Wayne's world' parallel universe in the hope that if, cyborg like, he continues to repeat one falsehood after another often enough, it will be picked up. This ‘cyborgitis' is infectious, because the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has been infected by it. Only last week he said that on 20 occasions the Reserve Bank has called for the national coordination of infrastructure. The national coordination of infrastructure may or may not be a good thing. There are advocates for it, there are sceptics about it, but we would all like to see better and more timely investment in infrastructure. I particularly committed to that when I was the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, we undertook the National Plan for Water Security, which was a $10 billion investment, almost all of it in water infrastructure-and what could be more important than that? The Howard government committed the $2 billion Australian Government Water Fund-again, almost all of that went into water infrastructure-not to speak of the investment in transport infrastructure through AusLink. So, yes, investing in infrastructure where there is a real net benefit good thing-we all agree with that. But the Reserve Bank has not called for the national coordination of infrastructure on 20 occasions. It is absurd. It is a falsehood. It is made up. It is no different from the approach that the Treasurer takes: find a falsehood that serves a political purpose and just repeat it and repeat it in the hope that it will be accepted. The former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and his predecessor, Mr Keating, both said that when you change the government you change the country. Well, we have certainly seen a lot in our country change since the election of the Rudd government. Since the election, business confidence has declined and consumer confidence has plummeted. Since the change of government, inflationary expectations have risen particularly, as is plain, among trade union officials. That is precisely why the Reserve Bank is not as confident as it was six or nine months ago that wage pressures will continue to be ‘a textbook case of adjustment'. Is this all just an unhappy coincidence? When the coalition took office on 11 March 1996, the Reserve Bank's cash rate was 7½ per cent. The coalition's goal was to eliminate Labor's $96 billion worth of debt and take pressure off interest rates. It is a of public record that this was achieved. Labor's debt was paid off and interest rates came down, no thanks to the Labor Party, which opposed that form of fiscal prudence. Australians found the coalition's commitment to fiscal consolidation and good economic management highly credible. They had confidence in the coalition. How do we know that? For a start we can look at the measures of confidence. In 1996 there was not a 15-point drop in the WestpacMelbourne Institute measure of consumer confidence in two months, which is what has happened under this government. In fact, the is a index jumped seven points in the month of March 1996, when the coalition took office. On average the Westpac index was 11 points higher during the coalition years than it was under Labor, and the National Australia Bank's quarterly business confidence index jumped by almost 12 points in the March quarter of 1996, the fourth largest in the history of that index. When the coalition took office, inflationary expectations fell; they did not rise. What has happened with bank interest rates under the Rudd government? The US subprime crisis has started to affect banks' wholesale borrowing costs. That started in last August, long before the election. The cost of some of our banks' funding base rose and now, I think it would be fair to say, all of the banks have significantly increased wholesale borrowing costs. They chose to wait until after the election to pass on those increased wholesale costs, and some people have suggested this was due to the Treasurer. I would not make that claim. Those costs inevitably had to be passed on at some point in time, and I imagine many banks balancing, on the one hand, their commitment to their customers and their desire to maintain the loyalty of their customers and, on the other hand, the speculation-and it genumatter inely is speculation-as to how long this disruption in global credit markets will continue. There is a key issue here. It is one of fidence. Confidence is absolutely essential to financial markets; it is everything. Once the participants in financial markets lose confidence in each other, they will not lend to each other. You can see the consequences of that now in the credit crunch. Bear Stearns, the fifth largest investment bank in America, nearly collapsed and was taken over by JP Morgan at a tiny fraction of its value a few months ago with the support of the US Federal Reserve. That was decisive action by the US Federal Reserve to stop a bank collapse that would have had shocking global ramifications. What caused that lack of confidence? If people do not have confidence in other institutions they will not lend; if investors do not have confidence in markets they will not invest. These elements of confidence are fundamental to the security of our economy. That is why the Treasurer is so reckless in his constant refrain of running down our economy and talking up a skills shortage across a number of sectors of the economy into a chronic skills crisis. Instead of speaking about inflation in measured and objective terms, he talks about it as though it is another crisis. (Time expired)",93
143,Ms JACKSON,INTERESTS,"I want to commence by acknowledging the Ngunawal people, the traditional owners of the land upon which we meet. I also pay my respects to the Noongar people, the traditional owners and custodians of the land that encompasses the seat of Hasluck, in Western Australia. I said in my first speech in this chamber, in 2001, that during my time in the parliament I hoped to participate in and be witness to real and meaningful reconciliation with Indigenous Australians, something I believe is essential for Australia to become a united and just nation. Unfortunately, this was not to be. Instead it seemed that the country became driven by the values that divide us-blame, suspicion, self-interest con- and greed-rather than the values that unite us-respect, empathy, compassion and equality of opportunity. I truly hope that this 42nd Parliament, commencing as it has with a national apology, will witness a huge leap forward for social justice. I have been a member of the Labor Party since the early 1980s. The day of the national apology, 13 February 2008, led by our Prime Minister, was the proudest day of my party membership. I was asked recently by a year 7 student at St Brigid's College in my electorate whether we intend to commemorate the day every year. My reply was that I sincerely hope so. This opportunity to speak in the debate on the address-in-reply can be described, perhaps oddly, as my second first speech. As one joker quipped to me, ‘You can't be a maiden twice.' I do not resile from anything I said in my first speech, but I can say on this occasion, Mr Deputy Speaker Bevis-with respect to you, to the chamber and to my fellow Labor colleagues and especially to the class of 2001-as they say in the classics: ‘I'm back.' I have wanted to do that for some time! Perhaps contrary to the perception created by my last remarks. I believe I am older and wiser since last I was here. It is with a sense of achievement but also humility that I stand in this House again as the elected member for Hasluck and make this speech. I know it will not be as eloquent or as profound as the first speeches delivered by my colleagues in the class of 2007. They are an awesome group who have spoken from the heart, full of passion, commitment and vision. I am proud that my name will stand in the history books as one of them. The 42 members of the class of 2007 include 11 outstanding women, 10 of whom are Labor women. At the opening today of the refurbished ‘women in parliament' exhibition, I was reminded that we still have a very long way to go before our parliament is truly representative of our community. Since Federation, of the 1,059 people elected to the House of Representatives only 77 have been women. Forty of the current 150 members of the House are women-only 26.7 per cent. This is another list that records my name. I am pleased that Labor's representation is better, albeit only marginally, with 27 of the 83 members, or 32.5 per cent, and 13 of the 28 senators, or 46.4 per cent, being women. I hope to see the numbers on this list grow exponentially. With my re-election to the seat of Hasluck in 2007 my name joins yet another list in history. I am one of a select group of over 80 people who have regained a House of Representatives seat after losing their seat at an election. Seventy-eight people have served two separate terms, returning after a defeat, and another eight people have served three separate terms-that is, returning after two defeats. I said a ‘select group'; I perhaps should say it is a select and diverse group, it includes great leaders such as Ben Chifley and WA's own John Curtin as well as the infamous Hugh Mahon, the only person ever to be expelled from the Australian parliament-alas, another Western Australian. There are six current members of the House who share this extraordinary experience with me-the members for MCEwen, Canning, MCMillan, Paterson, Lilley and Braddon. The most special to me and the one whom I wish to welcome back, acknowledge and say, ‘Well done, mate,' to is the member for Braddon, Sid Sidebottom. I know that he, along with me, will today be thinking of former colleagues who also lost their seats at the 2004 election, especially talented, passionate people like Christian Zahra and Michelle O'Byrne. I wish they were both sharing this with us today, and perhaps they are. would like to salute their service. It is also appropriate for me to acknowledge Stuart Henry, the former member, who was defeated at the last election and to thank him for his hard work on behalf of Hasluck constituents during the last parliament. The lesson of our individual experience is that politics is not always fair or just-it just is. In life we learn and grow stronger from the tough times and the personal challenges. We learn that it is always better to live in the moment. So, whilst I again have this moment, this privileged opportunity to represent and advocate for my community of Hasluck, I promise to do so passionately and diligently. I thank the voters of Hasluck for the chance to do so and I thank the Labor Party for entrusting me with the responsibility of contesting the seat at the 2007 election. Behind every member in this place stand many others. In my case I have a loving partner and family, a circle of close and dear friends, a magnificent campaign team, a as strong union and an army of true believers. I am grateful to them all. I especially want to record my appreciation of Catrina Tierney. No words will ever express the feelings I have for her and the thanks I wish to extend. I hope it is enough to simply say that I would not be here without her. She, along with Juliana Plummer, John Halden, Hayden Falconer, Liz Nedela, Terry Healy, Ron Sao and my partner, John Walker, held the key roles in my campaign team. I would also like to record my appreciation of my door-knocking mates James Turnball, Tristan Cockman and Peter Collins. I thank others like Marcia Maher, Paul Cheah, Nita Sadler, Di Meakins, my ‘bookends' Brian Wright and Mat Nugent, the Your Rights at Work campaign team-especially Chris Merfield-my crew of truck drivers, the branch members, the I local residents and supporters for their good wishes and their tireless hard work on the campaign trail. I wish I had time to name them all, but with over 750 volunteers it is simply not possible. Their unquestioning support was both heart-warming and humbling. I am also fortunate to have behind me many women in WA and around Australia who supported my decision to stand again, including EMILY's List. I am and always will be a campaigner for women's rights. I want to pay my respects to the women who have come before me who have made it possible for women like me to get here. I hope that leap in social justice I want and referred to in my opening remarks will include, among other things, pay equity for women in Australia. The Hon. Kim Beazley, Senator the Hon. Chris Evans and Senator Glenn Sterle cajoled, nagged or counselled me through the decision to stand again. For their benefit and for the benefit of the record I will now admit that they were right. I thank them for their support and encouragement. It was a big decision and a hard one for me. It is difficult to run for a marginal seat, especially when you know what the task requires-and, believe me, I knew exactly what the job entailed. I was joined in that task by a number of outstanding candidates in WA who were not successful: the former member for Swan, Kim Wilkie, but also Sharon Theile, John Hughes, Peter MCFarlane and the two whom I worked most closely with, Liz Prime and Peter Tinley. I want to thank them and their families for their friendship and support, for the campaigns that they ran and the sacrifices they made to help Labor achieve its election victory. As I said earlier, politics is not always just or fair. It was a hard contest for the seat of Hasluck. I am part of the Hasluck community; it is where I live. They are the people I had the privilege to represent as the first member for Hasluck. From Midland to Maddington, Gosnells to Guildford, Kalamunda to Koongamia, I know the diverse communities that make up the electorate of Hasluck and the local issues that concern them. Hasluck communities are full of good peoplegenuine, hard working Australians doing their best for themselves and their families. As the local member, I established a good reputation and was known for being active in the local community. We ran a strong local campaign highlighting the ways in which the Howard-Costello government had lost touch with Australians, and I believe this, combined with Kevin Rudd's positive plan for Australia's future, was responsible for the increase in our support among Hasluck voters. I said I had returned to the parliament older and wiser. I have learnt a lot since the 2004 federal election, especially about government and my great home state of Western Australia. I thank the Hon. Bob Kucera for offering me the opportunity to work as his chief of staff when he was Minister for Disability Services, Sport and Recreation, Citizenship and Multicultural Interests, Seniors and Volunteering. It provided me with even greater insight into the lives of people encompassed by the portfolios, especially people with disabilities and their carers. I understand the level of unmet need in the areas of supported accommodation, respite and therapy. I share the frustration felt by many in the disability services sector about the inadequate levels of funding committed to the Commonwealth state/territory disability agreement. This must become a priority area for reform and improvement. In a nation that reveres sport, it is ironic that we do relatively little to genuinely sustain and support recreation and sport in our community. Whether it is providing the funding necessary to establish and maintain community sporting facilities or supporting and developing the volunteers who are critical to the operation of most of our sporting clubs and associations, we do not do enough. I was appalled to discover that, other than a grant of $8.5 million from the Keating government in 1995, the federal government had provided Western Australia with no funding for sports infrastructure since the Empire Games, now called the Commonwealth Games, held in Perth in 1962. It was a fabulous year, the year of my birth, but that is simply not good enough and must be addressed. My thanks also go to the Hon. Alan Carpenter, Premier of Western Australia, for the opportunity to work in the Premier's Policy Division of the Western Australian state public service. There is a dedicated group of policy officers employed in the division and I enjoyed working with them. Doing so restored my faith in the public service and made me realise that effective government can and will make a difference to people's lives. Where there is a will there is a way. That is why ending the blame game between Commonwealth and state governments is vitally important. I note the announcements by the Treasurer last week following the meeting with all state and territory treasurers, and I welcome this commitment to try and genuinely tackle the issues associated with Commonwealth and state funding. Most Australians expect all levels of government to work cooperatively and efficiently in the interests of the whole community-a not unreasonable expectation. I would like to wish ‘Carps' and his team the best for the coming WA state election. I have said that I have learnt a lot since 2004 election. I am pleased to say that the voters of Hasluck showed that they had also learnt since 2004. They know they had many rises in interest rates after John Howard and Peter Costello promised to keep them low. They know that many people are doing it tough with rising mortgage payments or rents, high childcare costs and high petrol and grocery prices. They know that, under the Howard government's extreme workplace laws, the basic conditions which make up the take-home pay of working Australians, like overtime and penalty rates, were under threat. They know that the Howard government wasted a decade with their inaction on climate change. They were disturbed by the controversies that plagued the Howard government: the disgraceful AWB wheat payments scandal; the circumstances of the detention and treatment of Australian citizens such as Cornelia Rau, Vivian Alvarez and David Hicks; and, of course, the deterioration of the war in Iraq and Australia's role in it. Wherever they lived-in the suburbs of the cities of Swan and Gosnells at either end of the electorate, where they are experiencing both the pleasure and the pain of urban renewal, rapid growth and development, or in the foothills and surrounding suburbs where there is great anger at the Howard government decision to allow a brickworks to be established on Perth airport land in the middle of a residential area-the 2007 election presented all Australians with a choice about the sort of future they wanted for themselves and their kids: did they want more of the same or a change for the better? After more than a decade of John Howard's leadership, the electorate were ready to make a change. They want a better and fairer future. They want high-quality, affordable health care for themselves and their families throughout their lives. They want a national the dental program that fixes people's teeth when they need it, not months or years later. They want real investment in healthcare services and cooperation that ends the blame game between federal and state governments over funding. They want better education services and fair funding for Australian schools. They know that learning does not start at school; it starts on the first day of life. They want investment in the early years of a child's development. They want high-quality, affordable schools and child care, whether community, government or private, with great teachers, good carers, good discipline and sufficient resources. They want every child to have the chance of a quality education. They want to know that their kids or grandkids have real opportunities for postsecondary education and skilled employment. They want more university and TAFE places closer to where they live. They do not want to see kids who are making an effort missing out on a place because they cannot afford to pay. They want safe and fair workplaces that appreciate the realities of family life and respect the dignity of working people, where everyone has the right to a fair go no matter how they are employed or engagedemployee, contractor or small business person. They want a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. They want action on climate change and sustainability. They want to secure our water and energy future. They want a national government that is wise to the pressures on our natural environment and that is proactive in protecting and conserving it. They want a federal government that is committed to nation building and investing in our infrastructure, like a high-speed national broadband network, to meet the challenges of Australia's future. They want Australia to be a proud and independent nation that is a good international friend and a strong voice for human rights and freedoms. That is the sort of future that I want, too. I am honoured to be part of the Rudd Labor government. In closing, I will borrow from my leader's style and ask: do I believe the Rudd Labor government can build a better future for Australia? The answer: yes, we can. Thank you. Debate (on motion by Mrs Moylan) adjourned. NA 2008 Report from Main Committee Bill returned from Main Committee for further consideration; certified copy of the bill presented. Ordered that this bill be considered immediately. Second Reading Debate resumed.",97
144,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL,The question is that this bill be now read a second time.,101
145,Mr ALBANESE,INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (5.54 pm)-in reply-I thank those members of the House who have contributed to the debate on the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008 and the creation of Infrastructure Australia. I want to make some comments in summing up those contributions. One statement in particular was made by the shadow minister for infrastructure, the member for Wide Bay, in his speech in the second reading debate that was illustrative of where the coalition are at when it comes to infrastructure development. This statement, I think, epitomises the coalition's lack of understanding of the infrastructure challenges faced by Australia today. After the member for Wide Bay, along with a number of other coalition members, spent a considerable amount of time blaming the states for the nation's infrastructure problems, after he tried to mount an argument that spending money on infrastructure is inflationary and after he pointed out that any new infrastructure prioritised for development will not actually be built for years to come, the member for Wide Bay asked the following question: So what is Infrastructure Australia going to do that is not already being done under the current AusLink process? I think the member should have a look not just at the legislation but at the speeches given by government members during this debate. We know that for almost 12 years infrastructure was not given priority by the previous government. There was no federal infrastructure minister, there was no leadership and it was easier to blame the states than to get on with the job. However, it is clear that, when it comes to planning on infrastructure, we need to do much more than just have the AusLink process. We need a coordinated approach to infrastructure that is whole of government and that recognises that there are relationships between our transport infrastructure - that is, roads, rail, shipping and aviation-and our water infrastructure, energy infrastructure, communications infrastructure and social infrastructure. We need to do much better on these issues in future than we have done in the recent past. The idea of Infrastructure Australia conducting an audit and producing an infrastructure priority list for the nation beyond the term of an electoral cycle is a critical element. In last year's budget, the coalition established AusLink 2, which was to run in future years with a budget of $17 billion. But in the election campaign it promised projects worth more than $20 billion. That showed pretty clearly that the planning mechanisms had not lasted from budget day to the days of the election campaign, and that of course excluded the other areas of infrastructure from the national debate. We know that CEDA has stated that investment in infrastructure generates higher returns than investment in other sectors of the economy, yet in the economic debate in the parliament the opposition has confused the issues of capital expenditure and recurrent expenditure. It has failed to acknowledge the importance of capital investment in infrastructure. For the previous government to have sat back and filled its coffers with over $390 billion additional revenue from the mining boom and let Australia slip to 20th out of 25 OECD countries for its investment in public infrastructure is economic mismanagement at its worse. In terms of the role of Infrastructure Australia, it is quite clear that we have a commitment to re-engage the Commonwealth with our cities policy. We are the most urbanised country on earth. We need plans for regional development, but we also need plans for our cities, and our Infrastructure Australia agenda is a part of that. Business group after business group-for example, BCA, Australian Industry Group, Engineers Australia and CEDA-have called for national coordination of infrastructure, but nothing happened under the previous government. Indeed, the member for Barker made an extraordinary contribution in the second reading debate in the House when he said: Infrastructure Australia is not actually an original idea. It was the Howard government that in 1996 conceived the idea of a national infrastructure council. That is an extraordinary comment to make in 2008. It is an acknowledgement that they had thought about it in 1996, but they just did not do anything about it for 12 long years. Indeed, the opposition spokesperson, the member for Wide Bay, has stated: Infrastructure failures have damaged our growth and our quality of life over the years. He was absolutely correct when he said that. That identifies the problem and we have identified the solution-doing something about it, getting that coordination going, saying no to the blame game and no to a disjointed approach to infrastructure and saying yes to national coordination, and working with the different tiers of government but also, importantly, with the private sector. The Rudd Labor government are firmly focused on the future. We know that there have been 20 warnings from the RBA about unsustainable inflationary pressure being put on the economy. We have had back-to-back interest rate increases. We know that infrastructure shortfalls are costing us 0.8 per cent of GDP and that our infrastructure backlog is conservatively estimated at tens of billions of dollars. We know that working families are experiencing long-term water restrictions and slow internet speeds and are spending too much time in their cars commuting rather than being at home with their children. Infrastructure has a social implication as well and we need to integrate economic policy with social policy. On our 99th day in office, the Prime Minister and I, along with the member for Blair and the member for Oxley, turned the sod on a critical road project in south-east Queensland-the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. It represents a $700 million injection of funds for stage 1 of the Wacol to Darra project, which will eventually upgrade a road used every day by 80,000 cars and trucks. In other critical areas like broadband, we have rolled up our sleeves. The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, announced last week the panel of experts to assess proposals to build a new national high-speed fibre broadband network. There is much more to do and it does take time for infrastructure, from conception to finalisation, to be put into place. That is the reason for more urgency in this debate. Infrastructure Australia will drive investment where it is needed most. Infrastructure Australia is much more than just AusLink; it is a different way of proceeding in acknowledgement that the old ways simply were not working. I have been extremely pleased with the support, particularly from the business community, for this infrastructure agenda. Last Friday, I addressed a gathering of hundreds of businesspeople in Melbourne. All of them were extremely supportive of this agenda. The announcement of Sir Rod Eddington as the chair of Infrastructure Australia has been extremely well received by those engaged in the infrastructure agenda and by the broader community. I think the fact that someone of his stature has been prepared to take up this position shows how serious the Labor government are about our economic reform agenda for this term of government by placing Infrastructure Australia as one of the central features. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",101
146,Mr TRUSS,INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL,"by leave-I move opposition amendments (1) to (5): (1) Clause 5, page 4 (lines 18-19), omit paragraph 5(2)(j), substitute “(j) any functions that the Minister, by writing, directs Infrastructure Australia to perform, provided that the Minister shall first table in each House of the Parliament a description of the additional functions the Minister proposes that Infrastructure Australia perform.” (2) Clause 5, page 4 (lines 23-26), omit subclause (3), substitute “(3) Infrastructure Australia may perform a function under subsection (1) or paragraph (2)(a), (b), (c), (d), (g) or (i), if it thinks fit.” (3) Clause 5, page 4 (lines 27-28), omit subclause (4). (4) Clause 5, page 4 (lines 29-31), omit subclause (5). (5) Clause 29, page 16, line 5, after subclause (1), insert “(1A) Before appointing the Infrastructure Coordinator, the Minister shall consult with the Chair and members.” There are five opposition amendments but they deal with just three issues. Essentially, the opposition have agreed to permit passage of the bill, but we think there are some ways in which Infrastructure Australia can be improved and our amendments seek to address those issues. The first amendment refers to directions to Infrastructure Australia by the minister. Under the bill, the minister may give a direction to Infrastructure Australia without reference to parliament. All of the functions of Infrastructure Australia are essentially prescribed in the bill, so they are authorised by the parliament. But the minister can on a whim, whether wisely or unwisely, add other duties as he sees fit. I think that these should also be subject to the same kind of parliamentary scrutiny that applies to the original functions allocated to Infrastructure Australia. In the interests of transparency, directions by the minister to Infrastructure Australia should be tabled in each chamber rather than, as is currently proposed, just being buried in the annual report of Infrastructure Australia. It could be a year, even two, after the minister has given an instruction that that advice is actually made known to the parliament and to the people of Australia. It is in the interests of transparency and open governmentwords that the incoming government likes to use quite often-that any additional instructions given by the minister to Infrastructure (e), (f), Australia be the subject of parliamentary scrutiny. The second issue deals with a range of measures. The bill, as it is currently drafted, stipulates that Infrastructure Australia may evaluate infrastructure proposals on advice from the minister. In effect, Infrastructure Australia is unable to initiate independently an examination of its own. A good example is the government's saying that all of its election promises will be delivered ‘no ifs, no buts', to quote them exactly, so Infrastructure Australia would be wasting its time if it wanted to investigate any of Labor's election promises. Indeed, since Labor has already spent all of the money that has been allocated to AusLink under the budget process, there will not be much capacity to deliver any money for any priorities that might happen to be developed by Infrastructure Australia unless that money is going to be provided outside the forward estimates process. In effect, Infrastructure Australia is virtually immune from examining any of the ALP's infrastructure election promises. I, for one, would like to see a number of those promises examined to see how well they fit into the priorities. At the present time, the minister and I are having a little debate in my local newspaper about the importance of the upgrade to the Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway. The minister thinks it is worth only $200 million, but I think it is worth at least $700 million under the current program. Nevertheless, Infrastructure Australia will not have an opportunity to decide whether the minister is right or whether I am right-whether the Australian Automobile Association is right or whether the transport ministers are right-about this being the highest valued project in Queensland. The government has said it will spend only $200 million-that that was its election promise and it will be delivered lock, stock and barrel-no matter how many more accidents there might be, no matter how many more compelling arguments might come forward. I think this is a restrictive component of the legislation that constrains the capacity of Infrastructure Australia to engage in infrastructure reviews of its own volition. If it body that is to be trusted and to be relied upon, it should have the capacity to instigate inquiries that it considers important, whether or not the government gives it that direction. The third and final group of amendments provides for the minister to consult with the board of Infrastructure Australia before appointing the infrastructure coordinator. The coordinator obviously fills an important executive position. It would be incomprehensible that Infrastructure Australia could work well if the minister of the day were to impose an infrastructure coordinator that did not have the support or confidence of the members appointed to that authority. Whilst respecting the right of the minister to make the final appointment, he should be obliged to consult effectively with the chair and members of Infrastructure Australia so that he can be certain that the person who is the best for the job is appointed. (Extension of time granted) In reality, Infrastructure Australia must have confidence in its staff, and, if people are imposed upon it from outside, it would not help in developing effective working relationships. The opposition support the bill, but we think these three groups of amendments would make it a better organisation that is more independent, more capable of doing the work and more capable of delivering good outcomes for the government and for the people of Australia.",103
147,Mr ALBANESE,INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (6.12 pm)-The government will not support the amendments that were moved by the opposition. I will just go through them and briefly indicate why. The first amendments referred to are amendment (1) and amendment (4), which is linked to amendment (1). The opposition has indicated that the proposed amendments seek to place under parliamentary scrutiny the minister's power to give is a Infrastructure Australia new functions. The Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008, as it currently reads, allows the minister to direct Infrastructure Australia to perform other functions. The opposition's amendment that seeks to require the minister to first table in the parliament a description of any such additional function would do nothing other than introduce delays into Infrastructure Australia's work program. I bring to the opposition's attention that division 4 of the bill requires Infrastructure Australia to prepare a report on its operations after the end of each financial year. This report must be given to the minister for presentation to the parliament. Transparency is built into this bill, and the opposition's proposed amendment does not add any further value. Indeed, opposition amendment (4) becomes redundant if amendment (1) is not carried. I would like to point out to the opposition that clause 5 covers the fact that directions relating to the functions of Infrastructure Australia are not legislative instruments. Clauses of this type are good drafting practice, and they avoid potential ambiguity. Removal of this clause, as suggested by the opposition, would have no effect other than to decrease the clarity of the bill. Amendments (2) and (3) are the second lot of amendments that are related, and both are opposed by the government. The bill, as it currently reads, ensures that Infrastructure Australia is engaged in work that allows it to provide advice where it is needed most. It would not be an efficient use of Infrastructure Australia's time to be reviewing thousands of business cases it might randomly receive from individual organisations, nor would it be a good use of its time to duplicate work that is being undertaken by other bodies or other ministers. It is for these sons that subclauses (3) and (4) have been drafted as they currently read. I note that the member for Wide Bay expressed concern in his speech on the second reading that Infrastructure Australia is unable to independently consider the ALP's election promises. I would say to the member that we do take our election commitments very seriously. We do have a mandate for them. Election promises were developed after wide consultation with stakeholders. The expenditure that we will put into the Pacific and Bruce highways, for example, is absolutely critical, and we are committed to it. We are also committed to providing critical water infrastructure for our cities. We are committed to providing support for water infrastructure in the Murray-Darling Basin. We are committed to communications infrastructure through our national broadband plan. We are committed to these projects, we have a mandate for them and we intend to implement them. Unlike the previous governmentwhich, upon coming to office, put its commitments into core and non-core categories so as to justify breaking them-we are absolutely committed. For the National Party to come in here and talk about transparency is, quite frankly, extraordinary. Amendment (5) moved by the opposition is opposed by the government in the interests of transparency. Firstly, as the position of infrastructure coordinator is created by the Infrastructure Australia legislation, it is by definition a statutory position. Secondly, on 5 February this year, the Australian government introduced a policy implementing transparent and merit based assessment in the selection of statutory officers working in or in conjunction with APS agencies. The appointment of the infrastructure coordinator will follow the rules set out in this policy. The merit based selection of statutory office holders includes requirements for the overreasight of the advertising process and assessment of the applicant's claim to be undertaken by the secretary of my department and the Public Service Commissioner; selections to be made against a core set of selection criteria; and a report, endorsed by the Public Service Commissioner, to be provided by the secretary to the minister, recommending short-listed candidates. Where the minister wishes to appoint someone not recommended by the panel, the minister will need to write to the Prime Minister setting out reasons. (Extension of time granted) The member for Wide Bay should have a look at the cross-government reforms introduced by the Rudd government, because they make it very clear that we will have merit based selection and that it will be transparent. This is a reform that was never there under the previous government. In conclusion, I say to the opposition that this legislation finally gives priority to national infrastructure under the Rudd government. We see it very much as part of our five-point plan to fight inflation. We see it as a necessary reform. I note that the opposition now has a shadow infrastructure minister, the member for Wide Bay, and I congratulate him on his appointment to that position. But why was there no infrastructure minister during the 12 years of the Howard government? When it comes to infrastructure, you do need someone who will be responsible for more than just transport, and you need to link that-as the new government have done in our department-with regional development and local government as well as with transport. But you need in Infrastructure Australia a body which will be a critical statutory advisory body that will give advice to the government about our national infrastructure priorities. And you do need to engage the private sector in this debate. The business community have welcomed this reform. All around the country I am attending conferences, boardrooms and representational meetings from people who are very enthusiastic about this reform. I would hope that this legislation will not just this House but also the Senate this week. We are determined to get on with the job of nation building in the fine Labor tradiposed tion that we have inherited. I commend the bill to the House unamended.",105
148,Mr TRUSS,INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL,"I thank the minister for his response, although I have to say that his words really confirm the need for these amendments. When he spoke about his concern that there might be delays as a result of the minister giving a direction under the special powers to be granted to him, he ignored the importance of accountability. Indeed, he confirmed in his comments that the first the parliament would know about these extra instructions would be when an annual report is presented. We all know that it could be at least a year, and maybe longer, before anyone could make an assessment about whether the direction given was an appropriate one. We are not really talking about delays; we are talking about 14 sitting days. That is not an extraordinary period of delay to achieve an acceptable level of accountability. Let me go on to talk about the minister's concern that Infrastructure Australia may just waste its time by dealing with a whole lot of submissions that are put in by various people around the country. Frankly, I hope that Infrastructure Australia will listen to the of people around Australia who have views on issues that are important. One would assume that a body of that substance, with a $20 million budget, will actually develop some priorities for itself. It will be under no obligation to respond to issues raised with it by the community, but it ought to have a right, where it sees an issue is important, to actually take the initiative and put some time and effort into it. No-one is suggesting that it should waste its time. In fact, I believe that, if Infrastructure Australia thought something pass was worth doing, the community would think it was worth doing. For that reason I do not think that the proamendments will delay Infrastructure Australia inordinately. In fact, the amendments give it the opportunity to cut through where it needs to cut through, to deal with key issues that perhaps the minister had not even thought of-and there may be some of those. I know that we have a very wise and all-knowing minister, but there will be things that will come forward where the wisdom has not been residing in the government and may come from somewhere else. I think Infrastructure Australia should be able to address those issues if it sees fit. Finally, in relation to the appointment, I am sorry that the list of criteria that the minister has outlined does not relieve me of my concerns. The previous government had similar kinds of checks and balances. The reality is that we have already seen with this government that, when it wants to appoint its mates to do a particular job, the measures put in place have not prevented that. I am keen to ensure that Infrastructure Australia has a staff that it can have confidence in and that they can work constructively together. They are the reasons for these amendments and why we are pursuing them. We think these amendments would make the bill input better, and I urge the government, as the Senate deals with these issues, to give this a bit of additional thought and perhaps recognise the wisdom of some of these proposals and take them on board.",107
149,Mr ALBANESE,INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (6.23 pm)-I want to respond with a few points. Firstly, the legislation very specifically sets out that I can ask Infrastructure Australia to inquire, but I cannot ask it for a result. That is very explicitly ruled out in the legislation. Infrastructure Australia cannot be given direction as to what it will find. That is very clear in the legislation. That is the first point. The second point is that we have already announced that Infrastructure Australia will develop its infrastructure priority list. We have announced the timetable for that, and it will report to the March 2009 COAG meeting. I have already had two meetings of the COAG infrastructure working group, which has established the criteria for the audit and submissions from the state departments and the federal department, so that, when Infrastructure Australia does get going, it hits the ground running. We are absolutely committed to that happening. The budget of Infrastructure Australia is modest. I do not want Infrastructure Australia to be potentially diverted in terms of its work and operation. The figure used by the member for Wide Bay was of course its fouryear budget. The idea that it will be able to respond to individual constituents about specific infrastructure issues is simply beyond its capacity. It is important that Infrastructure Australia engages in nationally significant infrastructure. It is important that it not be diverted away from the important task that it has been set. The final comment I would make is in relation to appointments. The appointment of Sir Rod Eddington as the chair of Infrastructure Australia has been welcomed by the business and financial communities. He is someone with extraordinary connections and experience with not only domestic infrastructure but also global infrastructure, and he has prepared a substantial report. To have someone from the National Party talk about the appointment of mates is quite unbelievable, when we have appointed someone like Sir Rod Eddington to the chair. That is our bona fides on this agenda. There will be a strong team putMr Truss-That's what we are worried about.",107
150,Mr ALBANESE,INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL,"Let the member for Wide Bay say that he opposes Sir Rod Eddington's appointment as chair. Infrastructure Partnerships Australia and business groups in this nation have welcomed it, and I think that shows the significance with which we are prepared to proceed on this issue. Question put: That the amendments (Mr Truss's) be agreed to. The House divided. [6.32 pm] (The Deputy Speaker-Hon. AR Bevis) Ayes………… 59 Noes………… 80 Majority……… 21 NA Abbott, A.J. Andrews, K.J.

152,Mrs MOYLAN,NOES,"It is a great privilege to have been elected to this House for a sixth time. As I said in my address-in-reply speech in 2005, I still have that feeling of wonder that we are able to reinvent the process of democracy every three years-the apparent simplicity of it all, yet the sheer incredibility of it when one looks at how utterly few and endangered are the true democratic societies of our world. That feeling of wonder has not diminished. If anything, world events and the fragility of some so-called democracies show us that more than a facade of polling day is needed to ensure that a country is truly democratic and that its peoples can express their views and opinions without fear and cast their votes without intimidation. Indeed, apart from free and fair elections, strong democracies also have a judiciary free from political interference and a parliament with a strong opposition. So, although I find myself on the opposition benches, as I did when I first entered this place in 1993, I appreciate the importance of being a strong opposition and keeping the government accountable, and I remain steadfast in my advocacy on behalf of the electors of Pearce. May I therefore begin by thanking the electors for re-electing me and my campaign team who made the way smooth during the course of this election campaign and who organised the campaign with great skill and efficiency. The team was led by campaign chair, Mr Lane Taylor, assisted at all times by his wife, Julie, and from time to time by his son, James, and daughter, Jessie. No candidate could ask for a steadier hand on the tiller than Lane Taylor's. He has been an important support person right from my first election in 1993, and his wise counsel and calm demeanour have always been generously offered. I want to record my appreciation to my family and to all the campaign team members and my staff: Jana Allan, Anne Bagot, Amy Chadbourne, Richard Johnston and Neil Oliver, a former state member of parliament who came out of retirement to assist. Ron Farris, my long standing friend, was a tower of strength, assisted by my former personal assistant, Kirstin Mardardy, and Stuart Burling and a host of loyal supporters who manned the campaign office and helped out on polling booths on election day. They are too numerous to mention personally, but to each of them. I say thank you. Members and executives of the division of Pearce, led by president, Rod Henderson, have been unstinting in their support and I am indebted to them, as I am to the Western Australian Liberal Party. To know that these people care enough about preserving our democratic way of life and the laws being passed in this place is heartening and inspiring. These are the people who volunteer to ensure that the wheels of democracy remain oiled and functioning strongly. In February, I had served 15 years as the member for Pearce. I always feel proud of the contribution that people within the electorate make to their communities, to their state and to their country. It has been a privipublic lege to represent their interests in the federal parliament and to support the many initiatives that the communities foster. One of the marvellous things about being elected as a member of parliament is the opportunity not only to see the problems and challenges that face many people on a day-today basis but to see the triumph of the human spirit and to experience the kind personalities and the generosity that is so often extended. During the address-in-reply debate in 2005, I raised several issues which I wish to revisit briefly. I raised mental health as an issue that was pressing due to the steady rise in the number of people who were homeless, often because their mental health issues were not diagnosed, treated and managed. The Howard government made a substantial funding commitment and, indeed, provided leadership in taking up mental health issues in consultation with the states. Attention to mental health policy was urged in no small measure by my former colleague the then member for Leichhardt, the Hon. Warren Entsch, whose representations were tireless. I think the House is grateful for his advocacy in that regard. I see the current Prime Minister taking an interest in homeless people. I sincerely hope that the momentum of the previous government in addressing these issues will not be lost, as the issues of mental health and homelessness have taken on a more urgent dimension with changes to the social security pensions and work requirements and the current crisis in housing affordability. Indeed, I intend to raise this with the parliamentary Standing Committee on Community, Families, Housing and Youth, to which I have been elected deputy chair. I thank my colleagues in that respect. For people on low and fixed incomes trying to find affordable rental accommodation, the current housing affordability crisis is a tragedy. The supply of housing is failing to keep up with demand and the level of rental subsidies is falling short of the mark with the rapid escalation of rent, which is heading to an average of $400 per week in Perth-a trend that is followed by most of the other states and territories. Having spoken in the previous address-in reply debate on the issue of children in detention and my concerns about indefinite detention, I was pleased to be able to support the private member's bill put forward in the last parliament by the member for Kooyong to amend the Migration Act to ensure that families with children were housed in community housing rather than in detention centres. That amendment bill was passed in this place and the operation of that law is, I understand, working very well. For those being held in detention indefinitely, the amendment bill gave greater transparency and accountability. The oversight role was given to the Ombudsman, who is now required to report to this parliament, followed by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, which must report every six months to both houses on the reasons why someone is in detention for more than two years. I am pleased to learn that the Ombudsman, in the most recent report, has reported on some of those issues and that the current minister is trying to find a way to deal with some of the more intractable cases, as difficult as these are. In 2005, I said on Aboriginal reconciliation and Aboriginal health: It is a matter of enduring shame that so many Aboriginal people still live in circumstances unacceptable to most of us. I also made the point that, while practical measures are important, there is a pressing need to recognise the injustices and the illconceived policies of the past, no matter how well-meaning they were. In that respect, I again pay tribute to the former Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs the Hon. Mal Brough for progressing the practical measures so urgently needed and to the current Prime Minister for the apology extended to Indigenous people at the commencement of this 42nd parliament. Whatever progress we have made in these areas and more, there are great challenges ahead. The Howard government presided over an incredibly stable economy characterised by low inflation, low interest rates, low unemployment and the retirement of $96 billion of debt. With the $8.5 billion in interest saved annually, tax cuts were possible and both business tax and the personal rate of tax were cut substantially. Industrial disputes fell from 79 working days lost per 1,000 employees to a very low 15 working days lost per 1,000 employees. Keeping inflation low is one of the greatest challenges facing the government. Inflation and interest rate rises hurt those on fixed and low incomes in particular, and everyone in general, as it erodes savings and increases the price of day-today necessities. If wages and industrial disputes are allowed to escalate, inflation will quickly erode any value both to those working and to those relying on fixed incomes and pensions. The work of reform needs to be continuous, as we live in a dynamic, global system. Without constant attention to education and training, we will soon fall behind other competing countries. Education continues to be a major focus for me. I want to see the young people in Pearce continue to have options to long enter university, vocational education and training, traineeships and apprenticeships so that they will find fulfilment in their long working lives as well as being able to contribute to the prosperity of their families, their community and the nation. Pearce does have several TAFE colleges, as well as several agricultural colleges, and these play a vital role in providing options for rural and regional students in higher education and vocational training. I pay tribute to the work of those teachers and administrators, who maintain a high standard despite the constant struggle to attract sufficient funding. Agriculture is a multibillion-dollar industry and, in my view, we do not place a high enough value on clean food production and those who labour to provide food both at a domestic level and to boost our balance of trade through the international export market. We have some of the most efficient farmers in the world, yet they continue to battle unfair international competition, with some countries providing significant levels of government subsidies to their growers. In addition, our growers often meet much more stringent regulations-and quite rightly so, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott; it is an issue which you would fully understand and appreciate-on the use of chemicals, pesticides and hygiene, while products from competing countries, whose standards are not as good, often make their way onto our grocery shelves at very competitive prices. Besides addressing the unfair competition, we need to support our farmers by ensuring that we have the best agricultural scientists, land managers, agronomists, farm machinery mechanics, engineers, water scientists and the whole range of people that work hard to grow high-quality, clean produce by staying at the forefront of agricultural science. Wherever you turn in Pearce-whether it is farming, where there is a critical shortage of farm labour; the hospitality industry; mining; retail; the sciences; or medicine-all areas have difficulty attracting qualified staff. The education policies of the Howard government saw record increases in the number of students enrolling in medicinenursing went up by 47 per cent and medicine by 63.5 per cent nationally between 2001-05. In the past five years the number of medical students in Western Australia has doubled, and this has necessitated an expansion in the number of clinical training places. I look forward to working with the community, the University of Western Australia and Notre Dame University to influence a decision to fund clinical training places in regional hospitals so that the current pressure on the major city teaching hospitals does not see new graduates leave Western Australia. I strongly support the proposal put by the universities for regional training places, as doctors trained in regional hospitals are more likely to settle in those regions when they complete their training. Education and training remains one of the key issues, and I will continue to build on my support for community initiatives to improve training and education options for the local community. Other issues that I believe need to be addressed in this 42nd Parliament include federal-state relations. Given that Federation was created in 1901, we must turn our minds to building a federal system of government that recognises contemporary issues. There is a need for much clearer delineation of responsibility between state and federal governments and a need to stop the blame game. I am not a centralist, because I believe such a policy requires total conformity and diminishes the ability of individual communities to shine by building on their natural attributes. Conversely, a decentralised system encourages diversity and competition. This resonates with the electors of Pearce, as I know they work hard to convince the WA state government of the merit of investing in their region-a lot of the time without any great success under the current regime. Of the regions, Pearce will be the key to managing the rapid growth that is taking place in Western Australia. By 2015 the population of the state of Western Australia is projected to reach 2.3 million-almost double what it is now. This is double the growth projections for New South Wales and Victoria. Diversity and decentralisation will therefore be pivotal to managing the explosion of growth in Western Australia, and planning for that needs to be taking place now so that it is managed in a way that recognises the sensitive environment of the outer metropolitan regions. Pearce includes the Hills, the Swan, the Chittering and Avon valleys, as well as many rural areas that need to preserve local flora and fauna and to manage land degradation and water conservation issues. The need for careful and sensitive environmental management is critical. There are, of course, many other issues in torate as diverse as Pearce that will make demands on elected members at all levels of government. It has been no secret that, since 2000, I have taken a particularly keen interest in issue of both type 1 and 2 diabetes. The number of people with diabetes continues to escalate in our community. Such is the concern internationally that the United Nations passed a special resolution last year for the first time recognising diabetes as a problem of international dimension. If we are unable to stem the growth in the number of people presenting with diabetes, the burden on the budgets of all countries, both developed and developing, will be unsustainable. So I hope to continue the work in this parliament that I started in 2000, the work of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, ably assisted by my colleagues the member for Lyons, Senator Barnett and the member for Moore. We are hoping to have a few more people on board. Many members of this chamber and of the Senate have taken a keen interest in the work of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. After Easter, the New Zealand parliament will pull together a group of people from the Pacific to try and engage parliaments in the region on how we deal with the diabetes pandemic within the western Pacific. This parliament is committed to making poverty history; it is one of the millennium goals. quickly as we make progress on a number of fronts-in forgiving debt and in other measures to help deal with this problem-diabetes threatens to undo much of the good work. Diabetes is a very serious health problem that leads to many complications, and the cost to national budgets, not to mention the cost to the quality of life of individuals diagnosed with diabetes, is extremely high. So we are hoping to progress this matter in other parliaments and, very shortly, to look at this an elec- issue in the western Pacific. We also made representations both to our own ministers in the latter part of our term in government and to the current ministers to make sure that every Australian child who the has type 1 diabetes who needs a pump to deliver insulin has access to one. We are hoping that the government in its forthcoming budget will honour the commitment made by the Howard government to make this possible for children and young adults with type 1 diabetes. With the best of care, their life term is likely to be 15 years less than the rest of us. Insulin pumps often deliver far better outcomes in regulating the amount of insulin they have and that, in turn, prevents many of the complications that come from diabetes. Many in this House have heard the incredible speeches given by young people coming to this House for the Kids in the House functions. We have had two of them over the last few years, and they have been touching indeed. So I am hopeful, as I said, that the current government will understand the urgency and importance of that measure and make money available in the forthcoming budget to improve the health outcomes of children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Finally, as has been my practice in the past, I will continue to actively visit the many country towns and suburbs that make up the electorate of Pearce. I want to meet local people and more fully understand their As aspirations and assist them in ensuring that those aspirations become a reality so that they have effective representation-an effective voice-in this place.

155,Mr ROBERT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak against the government's Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Communications Fund) Bill 2008, an appalling piece of legislation, on which it went to the polls pre election. In summary, this bill will allow the government to spend not only the interest but the principal of the $2 billion mittee Communications Fund that was designed to future-proof the unique communication requirements of remote, rural and regional Australia. Furthermore, this bill allows the interest and principal to be spent on any communications project, not necessarily in rural and remote Australia, that Prime Minister Rudd or communications minister Senator Conroy consider politically expedient. The bill allows the Rudd government to buy shares or other interests in companies, make unconditional grants to telcos or even directly purchase assets and equipment connected to a broadband network. Any revenue the government may earn from its share purchase, unconditional grants or asset purchase will not necessarily go back to regional and remote Australia but will simply go into consolidated revenue. In summary, the bill allows for the rape of regional, rural and remote communities by taking away the future-proofing Communications Fund, leaving them vulnerable to being left behind on the wrong side of the digital divide. By way of background: the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee was established by the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. It was established to review the adequacy of telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia and to report to the responinterest sible minister. The passing of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Future Proofing and Other Measures) Bill in 2005 created the $2 billion Communications Fund. This added to a $1.1 billion plan for direct capital investment under a Connect Australia initiative as the future-proofing package to support the full-scale sale of Telstra. On 26 September 2005, the coalition government allocated funding to the fund with moneys invested in a short-term deposit with the Reserve Bank, while a low-risk investment framework and management by the Australian Office of Financial Management was agreed. This package aimed to ensure the ongoing adequacy of telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote parts Australia. The income stream from interest earned on the $2 billion fund investmentsestimated to be up to $400 million every three years-was quarantined to be used to finance the government's response to independent reviews of regional communications services. The fund was also to be used to fund infrastructure for regional communities, such as additional mobile towers, broadband provision and even backhaul fibre capabilities. In September 2007, the coalition government reinforced the Communications Fund as a perpetual fund by the passage of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Protecting Services for Rural and Regional Australia into the Future) Bill 2007, which required the fund to maintain a minimum principal of $2 billion. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Communications Fund) Bill 2008-this insidious piece of legislation brought to the House-seeks to repeal this safeguard. After paying off $96 billion of Labor's debt, after inheriting a $10 billion deficit in the budget, after saving over $8 billion in by getting rid of this debt, we were able to save for the future. The previous Treasurer, the member for Higgins-one of the greatest treasurers this nation has ever seen, as I think we would all agree-allowed the nation to save and indeed allowed an investment of $2 billion for the interest to be used to safeguard telecommunications services and to build on those services for the bush. This piece of legislation will amend part 9C of the Telecommunications Act 1999 to enable this money-this hard-earned money that was put aside after paying back Labor's exorbitant debt-to be used for purposes relating to the creation or development of a broadband telecommunications network, if of required. The final decision on the use of the fund will be made, apparently, in the context of the government's overall fiscal strategy. Why doesn't cabinet simply come out and say, ‘We have no idea what we're going to invest in. We have no idea what to spend this money on. We understand that industry does not want the government's money, that industry is prepared to go it alone and fund the investment itself, but we still want to take this money away just in case our overall fiscal strategy requires money to be spent somewhere in the digital divide.' Where I come from, out in industry, that type of comment or that type of position gets people sacked; clearly, in this House, it gets them into cabinet. At the very time that metropolitan areas are benefiting from competition between telecommunication providers and the rollout of new services and technologies, the Rudd Labor government are trying to rip away from the bush the remedy to the digital divide and to spend taxpayer money on a vague city-centric plan that Minister Conroy cannot even describe. It would be one thing if the government had a plan for how they would spend the money and knew the type of network they were trying to design and what the intended outcomes were. But at present there is not even a hint of that. There is a vague seven-expert panel being put together to review and provide comment back to the minister. Rural, regional and remote communities welcomed the former coalition government's commitment to ensuring that they had access to modern telecommunication services, with targeted and strategic assistance that was available not just as a one-off initiative perpetuity. But now all of that is out the window. All of the certainty, all of the futureproofing and all of the understanding that their needs would be met in the future are gone. So much for the Rudd government governing for all Australia. Now the Labor government wants to raid not only the interest from the fund but the fund itself. It is one thing to pull the cookie from the jar and eat it behind the back. It is another thing to pull all the cookies out and then pick the jar up and toss it out the window-the very fund itself, taking not only the interest but the principal, taking away the very support that those currently most disadvantaged rely upon to ensure that they can be full participants in an information society. The former coalition government put forward a clear plan to ensure that fast broadband, wireless and other ancillary services were available for the people of rural and regional Australia. That plan did not require Rudd's hand caught in the cookie jar. It did not require a raid on the communications plan. It did not require the fund to be turned upside down and every last penny pulled out. Last September, this parliament passed legislation introduced by the former government to ensure the principal of the fund did not fall below $2 billion. It was designed to protect the fund from the very mercenary pirates that this government is made up of. It was designed to prevent the fund from blatant unadulterated misuse. The Rudd government's proposed amendments will remove this safeguard to allow the hands of both the Prime Minister and Senator Conroy to squirm around in the cookie jar. It is ironic that Senator Conroy endorsed the current work of the review team established by the former coalition government and headed by Dr Bill Glasson at the very same time that the Rudd government decided to raid the dedicated resources needed to implement the but in committee's findings. But this bill allows the expenditure of not only the interest but the principal as well. It takes away the funding that was designed to future-proof the unique communication requirements of rural and remote Australia. Clearly, the Rudd government does not understand the unique requirements of this part of Australia-no doubt, though, putting on his akubra and going out once in a while to look at parched earth, he tries to tell the Australian people that he does. Of greater concern is that the interest and principal can be spent on any communication project, not necessarily in rural and remote Australiaany communication project at all that the Prime Minister and communications minister Senator Conroy consider politically expedient. Ominously, the finance minister is quoted by AAP on 14 February as saying: The final decision on use of the fund will be made in the context of the Government's overall fiscal strategy. Listening to the Treasurer every day in question time has convinced me, beyond any sense of reasonable doubt, that he has no fiscal strategy and he has no understanding of the economy. His view simply is to blame a previous government that was very clear that there were economic warnings coming through internationally. Yet the Treasurer has no plan; he has no fiscal strategy. If he were to have a telecommunications strategy, why wouldn't the government enunciate it? The Labor government cannot seem to think of telecommunications as being more than just broadband. It seems to be completely and utterly broadband-centric and beholden to it. Indeed, for the minister's title to include ‘broadband' suggests that Labor is completely myopic on the issue. The bill seeks to allow the fund itself to be accessed and applied in a broader range of financial instruments, including the acquisition of shares, debentures and assets, and for the development of a broadband telecommunications network. Well, what is this network that is being envisaged? The minister indicated that tenders were apparently to be closed in six months, yet they will be lucky to have the report from their seven-member expert panel within the year. And every day that this farcical phantom network continues to be a mere shadow of anything possibly realistic is another day where the people of Fadden, the people of my electorate, do not have access to broadband. Telstra has made it perfectly clear that they will not add any more broadband ports into any exchanges in Fadden because it is old telecommunications equipment. They are waiting for the government's new direction so they can invest in that rather than invest what they see as outdated technology. At the current rate, new subscribers in Faddenbusinesses, individuals, families, schoolswill not be able to get access to broadband for at least 18 months and, looking at the government's performance in this, it could be many, many years. I refer the House's attention to the Australian from last week where Mark Day wrote: The problem for Stephen Conroy, the federal Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy Minister, is that he has moved from the easy part-pouring scorn on anything his predecessor said or did-into the hot seat. Now he has to make decisions. And that is precisely what he's not doing. … … … Conroy's biggest game is fulfilling his pre-election pledge to provide Australia with a modern broadband network that will deliver a minimum speed of 12mps to a minimum 98 per cent of the population. He has proposed contributing $4.7 billion of taxpayer funds to this aim, but since the election we are none the wiser about how this will work. ... Conroy bragged that his grand fibre-to-thenode (or will it be fibre-to-the-home?) network would be under way within a year. A quarter of the way to that target, all we've had is a lot of questions and the appointment of an expert body to look at the issues. … … … Broadband is the issue Convoy has nailed to the mast, but there are plenty of others. Former minister Helen Coonan built her 2006 media reforms around a ‘digital dividend' for the public and nominated new TV services-six or a dozen channels on Licence A to provide new services to the home and up to 30 channels on Licence B for services to handheld mobiles-as the ultimate benefit of her proposals. Her nominated timetable-spectrum auctions by August last year-got away from her, then the election intervened. Convoy said Labor would endorse the proposals, but so far nothing has hapin pened. There have been mutterings about Convoy blaming the delays on the Australian Communications and Media Authority processes, but ACMA insiders insist the reverse is true; they're just waiting for decisions from Canberra. … … … If Convoy is using his settling-in time to through these big issues and act accordingly, I would say it is time well spent. But I don't think that's happening. We're just seeing more dithering and time wasting. I could not concur with Mark Day, the journalist, more. Conroy is not across his brief. The government is not across its timetable. There is no clear plan forward for Australia on providing broadband and ancillary services to provide the high-speed network the nation needs. Furthermore, funds being raped from rural and remote Australia can be used to buy shares or interest in any other companies. The ambiguity makes it clear: the government does not know what it wants; it just knows it wants something. My 2½-year-old knows he wants ‘something'. This is only the beginning. Clearly this is the first move to raid rural Australia's future-proofing Communications Fund for other purposes. It is also a sign of things to come from Laborraiding funds to pay for their ill-principled half-baked policies dreamt up on the bus campaigning from town to town. The question is: why doesn't the government know what it wants? Why doesn't it know what it wants to spend the money on? Why does it want to raid money to spend on some nebulous telecommunications network that the telcos do not want government money for anyway? The Rudd Labor government have made their first moves to raid rural Australia's future-proofing Communications Fund for any communication purpose with the introduction of this insipid piece of legislation. Labor's proposal aims to make the fund fair game for any broadband related expenditure that Prime Minister Rudd or Senator Conroy consider expedient. This fund can be used for any plan they dream up on their next bus trip from town to town. It also aims to open the door for Labor to spend not only the interest think but the principal as well, ensuring that any dividends from this misguided adventure go back to consolidated revenue, not back to rural and remote communities. Labor have let rural and remote Australia down. They have left them in the lurch. A significant fund available to future-proof our rural and remote communities, to ensure that they enjoyed the same prosperity and dividend from the digital economy, has been taken away. The Communications Fund provided a vital safeguard to some of the most disadvantaged consumers-those in rural and remote Australia, some of them tens, hundreds and thousands of kilometres apart, who do not have a voice with which to stand up and say ‘This is wrong.' Spending the principal of the fund on assets undermines future opportunities to assist with the affordability of services for these most disadvantaged of consumers. This bill is a farce. It is a joke dreamt up by a former opposition, desperate to try and get some broad appeal on a fanciful idea for a network. Senator Conroy needs to come clean with the Australian people and explain exactly what network is being dreamt up, in what time frame it will be delivered, how much it will cost and what it will deliver to the Australian people-because, at present, all we have is a taking away of the digital future that rural and remote Australia needs so desperately.

156,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Communications Fund) Bill 2008. This bill is a small but highly nificant step forward for telecommunications in this nation. The bill represents the first step in the Rudd government's rollout of high-speed broadband to 98 per cent of the population. Of course, the first stage of the broadband rollout is to appropriate funding for that purpose. This bill will amend part 9C of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999, removing the requirement for the balance of the Communications Fund to remain above $2 billion. This will enable government to access the $2 billion in the Communications Fund to part-fund the rollout of Labor's national broadband plan. Labor's national broadband network will transform communications in this country. With applications in e-medicine, education, commerce and entertainment, Labor's network will be a revolution for those people in our community who cannot access high speed broadband, let alone at an affordable price. Labor made it very, very clear in the lead-up to the election campaign what its policies were in the area of broadband. It was a policy area of very stark contrast between our policies for the future and those of the coalition, who I believe had a backward view and were trying to play catch-up in this area. Labor's national broadband plan will provide speeds of up to 12 megabits per second-40 divitimes faster than is currently available to many households and businesses. The Rudd government understands that access to high speed broadband is highly beneficial to business, to communities and to individuals. It is vital for the long-term productivity and pros2008 perity of our nation. That is why we announced, prior to the election, that we would invest up to $4.7 billion to build a national broadband network. This major investment in infrastructure will provide the basis for ongoing economic growth for decades to come. As my colleague the Minister for Insig- frastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the member for Grayndler, pointed out in his second reading speech, under the previous government's snail pace, residents and business throughout Australia would be waiting 35 years to reach the same level of investment that Labor is now prepared to make. Given that the internet was not available those 35 years ago, imagine where we could be in 35 years time when you consider where we are starting now with Labor's broadband network. The Communications Fund was established by the former government to fund, albeit very slowly, the telecommunications needs of residents and businesses in rural, remote and regional areas, and this is exactly the purpose for which we will use the $2 billion in the fund. But we will invest in infrastructure much, much faster than had been intended by those opposite. Australians are tired of waiting for high-speed internet access. They know that we are a broadband backwater, thanks to the inaction and the slow progress of the former government. I know that here in my own electorate of Canberra there is a great need for improved broadband access-even in the national capital. I think that many people believe that difficulties in accessing broadband are predominantly a problem in rural and regional areas, but this is not so. I would like to share with the House some of the experiences from my electorate. Approximately 10 kilometres from Parliament House is the suburb of Chifley in the Woden Valley-and a lovely suburb it is too. I know of one apartment block in Chifley called The Hermitage, right on the main road, which cannot get access to broadband. There are 75 units in the complex. Telstra tells the residents that they are too far away from the exchange. My office has been contacted by one lady there who is semi-retired. She uses the internet to keep in touch with family and friends, as well as it making a major contribution to the professional society in which she is very active. My office has made representations to Telstra on her behalf, and for the possible benefit of all of the other residents in The Hermitage or elsewhere in that region, but unfortunately so far without success. She is forced to rely on dial-up internet or she has to pay thousands of dollars for a satellite dish to be installed on the roof of her apartment block. They are the suggestions. That is no small cost when you consider her apartment is on the ground floor. I would like the people opposite to explain to this lovely lady why she cannot access ADSL in the national capital, only 10 kilometres from this very building. After almost 12 years in government, I really think that the ball was dropped in relation to broadband and the extension of communications at a new-world level here in Australia. I would like to share another experience from my electorate which highlights the economic and environmental benefits of Labor's rollout of high-speed broadband. Some months ago my office was contacted by a gentleman who lives in the suburb of Bonython, a little bit further south than Chifley. is about 20 kilometres south of Parliament House. He works in computer programming for a large multinational technology company. He cannot get ADSL at home, let alone anything faster such as ADSL2. The lack of high-speed broadband is directly limiting his productivity and that of the company he works for. This means that instead of working from home, which was his preferred option-which his employer was very happy for him to do-he has to commute to work each day. That means of course another car on the road, more cost and so on. I know that his case is not unique. I know that this is happening in other parts of the country-in many, many parts of the country-and we really do need to do something about it to move us forward into the digital age. Prior to the election, I had the opportunity to visit the Canberra Hospital with the then Leader of the Opposition, the now Prime Minister. Amongst other things, we met senior medical staff who told us of the huge benefits high-speed broadband can deliver to patients of that hospital. For those who do not know, the local Canberra Hospital services a very large part of southern New South Wales. It is a regional centre, in many ways, for medicine. The introduction of emedicine via high-speed broadband will have massive benefits to patients and hospital staff. Doctors will be able to conduct interviews with patients over the internet and it will allow the transmission of complex case documents and the results of medical testing and diagnosis procedures to be sent over the internet. This is only one area where we could stand to benefit from high-speed broadband here in my local community. I can remember, at an earlier time in this place, an inquiry by a parliamentary committee into telemedicine. My recollection of that inquiry is that the faster the speed, the better the connection for broadband and IT connecIt tions generally, and the possibilities were almost limitless for diagnosis of a range of issues, transfer of X-rays and transfer of data. I know that in some parts of the country we were already able to do that and do it well, but we have not reached our potential. There is far more that we can do, but we must have very good, high-quality, high speed data transmission to really reach the potential of what we can do in the area of emedicine or telemedicine, as we called it then. That would also, of course, help us with some of our regional neighbours. I hope that, through the examples I have given today, people begin to understand the breadth of the problems with the current telecommunications networks. They are simply not sufficient and we as a nation cannot afford to sit back and wait for industry to get around to making the required investments. Government really must take a lead in the debate in this country, and that is exactly what the Rudd Labor government said it would do and it is exactly what the Rudd Labor government is doing. As I said at the outset, the bill represents very significant first step in bringing the Australian community and economy into the digital age. The Australian public wants a high-speed broadband network and our economy needs it sooner rather than later. I am very proud to speak on this bill today, as it represents the first step in a quantum leap forward for all Australians. Can I conclude by referring to the large number of consultations I have been involved in, particularly over the last 12 months, around the region on this very question. You could not go anywhere without people saying: ‘One of the best things that the Rudd opposition is proposing is to do the broadband thing-to pick up this policy and run with it. Do everything in your power to offer as many people as possible good, high-quality, high-speed data connection.' We are talking about individuals, families and small business particularly around the different parts of this region. I am very pleased to think that we are moving forward. We are determined to get this policy up and running, and I am very much looking forward to seeing the improvements that I know we can offer to the majority, 98 per cent, of Australians over the coming years in respect of broadband connection in Australia.",119
157,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,The member for Herbert.,121
158,Mr LINDSAY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The member for Paradise, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker! It is almost like being a Western Australian. Member for Canberra, have I got a deal for you in relation to the units in Chifley that you mentioned in your speech. You said that 75 units had no access to broadband. Tomorrow, Member for Canberra, I can get all of those residents connected to a broadband system faster than ADSL-and it is not satellite. If you would like me to tell you the way to do it after this speech, I am happy to do that. It is available now, tonight. You basically misled parliaa ment tonight when you indicated that those people in those units cannot get broadband. They can get broadband, and I will explain how it is possible. That is one of the problems-getting everyone to understand the technology and how things can be done. I have good news for you. For those who are listening to this broadcast tonight-wherever you are across this big, brown land of ours; from the north to the south, from the east to the west-I want you to know what this Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Communications Fund) Bill 2008 in the parliament tonight is about. The bill is giving the parliament the licence to steal from the Australian taxpayers. They are pretty emotive words, but that is effectively what the Labor Party is asking the parliament for tonight. The former government set aside $2 billion, partially out of the sale of the proceeds of TelstraMr Windsor-Shame.",121
159,Mr LINDSAY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Member for New England. Haven't you noticed that telecommunications have got much better in this country since that was done? Of course, you would want to stay in the past. Now I have been thrown off track. Two billion dollars was set aside from the sale of Telstra to be used as a perpetual fund to improve telecommunications progressively in rural and regional Australia. I unashamedly and proudly stand here tonight as a representative from regional Australia, and I am being forced to defend the Labor Party's decision to effectively transfer this money back into metropolitan Australia. How dare they do that. How dare they put that to the parliament. How dare they treat rural and regional residents in such a way. How they propose to do it is in fact to take the money out of the Communications Fund and basically spend it on broadband infrastructure in metropolitan Australia, an area where services are already being provided at no cost to the government, through private providers. It just does not make sense. It concerns me very much that rural and regional Australia is being treated in this way. Why does it surprise me that the Labor Party would be proposing to steal money out of this fund, to steal thousands of millions dollars? I remember, and the defence community continues to remind me, that initially defence superannuation was fully funded. That means that money was put aside every year to pay the entitlements of defence members when they fell due. So what happened in the Whitlam years? Mr Whitlam, his cabinet and his Labor government raided the superannuation fund of Defence Force members. What did they do? They spent the lot. Here we are again, 30 years later, with a communications fund that is locked up for the purpose of providing faster, more appropriate services to rural and regional Australia. What are Labor up to? They are raiding the fund. That should not be allowed to happen. Surely my colleagues on the other side-like the member for Lowe-are sensible enough to understand that this is wrong. It is not what should be done. Mr Murphy-I can assure you I am very sensitive.",121
160,Mr LINDSAY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I thank the member for Lowe for his support for me, and I hope that he stands up in his party room tomorrow and says, ‘I object to this.' Mr Windsor-What a nonsensical proposition.",122
161,Mr LINDSAY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Perhaps the member for New England would like to support me in this as well. It is wrong. What is Labor's position on broadband? Summed up in a nutshell: it is to spend public money providing broadband speeds to everybody in Australia. If that means running a fibre-optic cable up every gum tree in the country, that is what Labor will do. That is Labor's commitment, but it is a nonsense. Telecommunications is expanding and changing so rapidly these days that new technologies are constantly becoming available. I remind you that it was only four years ago that Labor was pushing 40 kilobytes per second dial-up internet as of the way of the future. By the time we get around to doing the things that this bill is proposed to fund, things will have changed yet again. These days, dial-up internet is a dinosaur. They do not even have a computer anymore that will perform the dial-up function. That is the way of the world as things move faster and faster with new technology. We have seen the advent of wireless technology, where large areas can be serviced from a single-base station cell. That wireless technology can be WiMAX or it can be Next G. Already Next G is available in 98 per cent of the country. You can get fast broadband speeds now. The only place that you cannot service with this technology-perhaps two per cent of the country-is the back of Bourke. Mr Windsor-Rubbish!",122
162,Mr LINDSAY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I said ‘the back of Bourke'. I did not say ‘Bourke', Member for New England. Lord Howe Island has difficulty. The way to solve that is through the former government's and the current government's broadband guarantee, which allows a subsidy for satellite services so that no Australian is disadvantaged. And that is the way it should be. Labor's fixed broadband proposal comes at a time when broadband delivery through wireless and other mixed technologies is rapidly gaining momentum. You now see people all over the place with their laptops, wherever they are, with their little cards plugged into the side of their laptops. They are on the net, surfing and doing their business. Of course, this is the way that the member for Canberra can solve her problem in respect of the 75 units in Chifley. It works at high speed-faster than ADSL-it is reliable and it works wherever you are. Labor wants to roll out broadband across the country over the next five years. It will slowly bleed the Communications Fund dry and have little to show for it at the end of the day. The private providers in the metropolitan areas should be providing the capital to do all of this, because they are the people who will take the benefit, the dividend and the profit. In the metro areas it is quite lucrative for the private providers to provide these services, yet Labor wants to spend rural and regional Australia's money on metro services that would be provided anyway by the private providers. That is just not sensible. That is why this bill should be voted down. I started off by saying that this bill was effectively a licence to steal-to steal from regional and rural Australia. The previous government's-now the alternative government of this country-attempt to futureproof regional Australia from falling behind metro centres in accessing improved communications technology is now very much under threat. And it should not be. This fund was set up for the ongoing benefit of households in rural and regional Australia, and they should be protected. It is wrong; it is stealing. Income from the fund was specifically and exclusively mandated to support communications services outside the metro area but, if this fund is run down, there will be no income. It therefore follows that there will be no support. Those in rural and regional Australia who are listening to the parliament tonight will be quite angry to know that Labor is stealing their money. This is not just rhetoric-it is not about my standing up at the dispatch box-it is what is happening. A fund that was set up for the benefit of rural and regional Australia-thousands of millions of dollars-will now be snaffled up by the Labor Party and spent in metropolitan Australia. I think there will be a revolt when people in rural and regional Australia understand what the Labor Party is doing. The Prime Minister and the Labor Party went to the electorate promising that they would do something about petrol prices, grocery prices and mortgage rates. It was part of the central plank of the Labor Party's campaign. The electorate trusted the Labor Party and expected this to happen, but the government is now taking away the money earmarked for rural and regional Australia. We will see telecommunications prices, petrol prices, grocery prices and mortgage rates go up. People will realise by the time of the next election that they have been sold a pup, just as this bill is a pup in relation to rural and regional Australia. I absolutely reject and oppose the legislation before the parliament tonight.",123
163,Mr WINDSOR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I listened with some degree of interest to the member for Herbert's contribution to this debate on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Communications Fund) Bill 2008. I noted that he was having some difficulty determining whether it was Lord Howe Island or Norfolk Island; having listened to his contribution, I think he has visit to Fantasy Island. I can assure the member for Herbert that he is very much out of touch with the service levels that a lot of country Australians are getting. And he stood up as a proponent of regional telecommunications. I would invite him to come to an electorate which is not at the back of Bourke but within 350 kilometres of Sydney and spend some time looking at some of the issues that happen in the real world. In the community of Yetman, on the Queensland border, for instance, they are still having difficulty getting mobile phones. The so-called Communications Fund that the member for Herbert was talking about allowed $100 million a year. Many of those communities, like Acacia Plateau, closer to Brisbane, have had proposals put to them by Telstra Country Wide-the company that the former Liberal government was more than happy to sell and where competition was going to deliver outcomes to peoplewhereby if they provide the land, the electricity to the land, the road to the land and the tower on the land, Telstra will look at putting an antenna on the tower. That is what this has come to: all of the promises, commitments and rubbish that were peddled about the sale of Telstra and the guarantees that were given time and time again as to what would happen, and it would all be all right. I have attended meetings at the Yetmans and the Acacia Plateaus, and I have not seen all the private providers gathered there in a competitive process to provide modern technology to country people. The $100 million that the member for Herbert has spent time talking about tonight-and no doubt others will as well-is a pittance and was a pittance. The member for Herbert and others who were in government at the time would have known that our Constitution does not allow for one parliament to bind another parliament. They knew exactly had a what they were doing when this compromise-a $2 billion Communications Fund to future-proof country Australia-was put in place. More times than not they forgot to add that it was actually the interest on the $2 billion, which is probably about $100 million annually, to future-proof country Australia. The first bit of future that came along was Next G; and we have this absurd scenario being played out at the moment where people have been sold product not fit for purpose. Where has this future-proofing been in the last 12 months? What has it been doing for those people who have been sold dodgy phones, who have been sold a pup in terms of the technology that they were told would be an improvement on the technology that they had before? If there was ever a reason for the demise of the National Party, this is a classic example of it. This whole scenario really encapsulates the reason that people have walked away. Even some of the elderly, retired members and some of those who have more recently retired are walking away and agreeing to a merger with the Liberal Party. Ninety to 95 per cent of country Australians did not want Telstra sold. So what did the National Party do? They sold it. The Page Research Centre did a survey about what would be the price of the sale. What would we need to adequately ensure that country Australians had an equitable service? It came up with $7 billion. Then the saviour of the country, Senator Barnaby Joyce, called for a $5 billion future-proofing arrangement. Eventually they settled on the interest on $2 billion, which was back to $100 million annually-or 20 years to get to the $2 billion, for something that the people they represented did not want sold in the first place. Out of a $57.7 billion asset, Australia has enjoyed the benefits of about $1.1 billion. And the member for Herbert describes what is happening today as a disgraceful thing. I think the disgrace occurred some time back. I was at the Senate doors on the day the then President of the National Farmers Federation, Peter Corish, came out of a meeting with some of the government ministersMark Vaile, John Anderson and a few others-and endorsed the sale. And the National Farmers Federation wonder why they have absolutely no regard in this building! He endorsed the sale of Telstra, even though their membership, their constituency, had said no-as was the case with the National Party constituency. The reason he gave was the reason that Senator Joyce eventually gave in his support in the Senate debate at the time. The President of the National Farmers Federation, Peter Corish, said: ‘We are about delivering equity of access to country Australians, and the government has guaranteed us that it will be enshrined in legislation there be equity of access to broadband and telephone services.' Some hours later, the ‘champion of the bush', Senator Barnaby Joyce, supported the sale-on the back of that promise. That was when the damage was done, Member for Herbert. That is when the sellout, the theft, occurred. That is when country Australians were sold out by their so-called representatives. That was the last opportunity that the National Party and, in my view, the National Farmers Federation had to purport to actually represent a constituency. Polls done in a number of electorates, including many of the then government electorates, showed opposition to the sale. In Gwydir, 81 per cent were opposed; in Parkes, 88 per cent were opposed; in Riverina, 85 per cent were opposed; in Farrer, 82 per cent were opposed; in Page, 81 per cent were opposed; in Richmond, 73 per cent were opposed; and in Cowper, 91 per cent were opposed. Mr Murphy-Who was the member for Gwydir?",123
164,Mr WINDSOR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I think you would recall who the member for Gwydir was, Member for Lowe. The New South Wales Farmers Federation, an organisation that I was proud to be a member of, sold out their constituency-absolutely sold out. They are now running around the countryside complaining about Next G and how they are going to champion those people who cannot receive modern technology, when they supported the sale of the vehicle that was producing enormous dividends. They sold not only a vehicle that was producing enormous dividends but also the political capacity to influence the debate into the future-and that is the great tragedy of this. For people to suggest that the yearly interest on the $2 billion Communications Fund would future-proof country Australia is abthat surd. It is an absurd proposition. How are you going to guarantee technology that has not yet been invented? It is absurd to think that a fund such as the Communications Fund would carry so much weight that private entrepreneurs, including Telstra, and private businesses would capitulate and deliver technologies that have not even been thought of yet into the marketplace when they know full well that they are not going to get a financial return, a shareholder return, on delivering into communities like Yetman and Acacia Plateau or even into pockets of some bigger communities as well. The former government sold the political leverage that was required to deliver an essential service to country Australians. We have had a lot of talk in this place about infrastructure-and we passed the Infrastructure Australia Bill only about an hour ago. The most important piece of infrastructure for this nation this century is not a road and it is not a railway line; it is telecommunications. Telecommunications is the one thing that negates distance as a disadvantage of being a country resident. In fact, it is the one piece of infrastructure that has the tial to reverse the slide. People are able to enjoy a lifestyle in the country and still form at full capacity, productively et cetera, by way of modern telecommunications, if they can get access to that at equitable prices and if they can get an equitable quality of service. The former government sold out country Australians by selling the capacity to make sure that that happens through the political process. A private company would not have been bound by the Communications Fund to provide telecommunications technology that has not yet been invented. Obviously its marketing would be driven by the size of the market and the potential to make money. If you do not believe that, have a look at what is happening in the airline business, where it costs nearly $1,000 to fly from Tamworth to Canberra and back when you can nearly go around the world for the same price. That is what we sold out on when the former government sold Telstra. A number of issues have been raised here tonight, but there are two that I would like bring up. I congratulate the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, for deferring the switch-off of CDMA to Next G.. There are still enormous problems there. I am actually in the process of surveying my electorate to find out where those problems are and what should be happening. There have been a number of mixed messages. One thing that came out of Senator Conroy's decision is that he still maintains some degree of political leverage on Telstra. Once he says that CDMA can be turned off, any political pressure that can be leveraged against Telstra will be removed. The minister still has the capacity to influence the outcome of that particular issue. Mr Lindsay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise potenon a point of order. The member for New England is not speaking to the bill, as he is perrequired to, and I ask you to bring him back to the content of the bill, please.",125
165,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The member for New England will address the bill. Mr Murphy-On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the member for New England is making a lot of sense and a very valuable contribution to the debate.",126
166,Mr WINDSOR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Thank you to the member for Lowe. As I said, I congratulate Senator Conroy. If the member for Herbert had missed the connection with telecommunications, I note that Senator Conroy is the minister for communications and the minister in charge of this legislation, apparently. I congratulate him for the deferment of the switch-off. Mr Lindsay- Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: the standing orders of the parliament require the member speaking to address the content of the bill. This is not the to content of the bill, Member for New England, and you must address it, under the standing orders. Mr Murphy-On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: with great respect to my colleague the member for Herbert, this is a wide-ranging debate and many issues have been canvassed by previous speakers. I think the member for New England is being very relevant and he should be allowed to continue. Mr Lindsay-On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: if you accept that it is a wide-ranging debate, the member for New England should speak about the OPEL proposal, which the former government signed and which delivers the telecommunications that he says are not being delivered.",126
167,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Order! This is not a matter for debate. The member for New England is to address the bill, please.",127
168,Mr WINDSOR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The issue that the member for Herbert raises in terms of OPEL is an absolutely fascinating issue. I would like to spend a couple of minutes on it because it shows some of the ineptitude of the former government on this issue-probably more so than most other things. A contract was let. People tendered, including Telstraand I have been critical of Telstra. From memory, I think they were asked to quote on $600 million. The contract that was finally let out to OPEL was for nearly $1 billion. Companies were asked to quote on providing a service for $600 million, but all of a sudden another $358 million, I think, was added when the contract was let. Mr Lindsay-For your constituents.",127
169,Mr WINDSOR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Yes-have a look at the WiMAX technology! I congratulate Senator Conroy, who is in charge of this particular piece of legislation, for not turning off the CDMA service until the handsets particularly-but also some of the towers for reception in country areas-are brought up to scratch. I would urge him not to switch off CDMA on 28 April either, because we need to make sure that at this particular time in our history, with the former government having sold out a public instrumentality and with us converting to a new technology-that of Next G, access to which country Australians are not up to scratch with-we do not lose this piece of political leverage. The former government said-and I would have thought that the member for Herbert would be supportive of this-that they would enshrine in legislation equity of access, in terms of ity and cost, to broadband and telephone services. If the member for Herbert wants to address these issues with respect to fairness, maybe he could elaborate as to where that particular guarantee was enshrined. Where was it enshrined in legislation? The answer is that it was not. Country people and members of parliament who were here then know they were duped into selling an asset that was not only a valuable commodity but far more valuable in terms of its capacity to deliver services to people. The role of government is to provide those sorts of services into the future. Providing those services-which may or may not be economic in terms of size, scale and magnitude of delivery-is what the role of government is supposed to be about, I would have thought. They sold out. For the National Party to be part and parcel of it and actually carry the coffin to the grave really encapsulates why the credibility of that party has diminished and why it will fade away, and deserves to fade away, into the sunset. (Time expired)",127
170,Mr COULTON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today to oppose the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Communications Fund) Bill 2008 as I believe it is a raid on rural Australia and its telecommunications future, but I cannot leave the comments from the previous speaker, the member for New England, unanswered. I was not in this House last year; I am a new member. But last year I was the mayor of a shire that was partly inside the member for New England's area. Part of my role as a mayor was to encourage businesspeople and skilled tradespeople to come to fill particular skills shortages in my electorate and to move and build up our population. We went to a function in Sydney called Country Week, to which medical professionals, builders, plumbers and small business people came. They asked me where I was from. I said that I came from qualthe Gwydir shire, which is in the New England region of New South Wales. Someone said, ‘We can't go there; the phones don't work. I run a business and I need to have a mobile phone. If our family is going to be away, we need broadband.' But the member for New England did not say in his speech that all the towns in his electorate have broadband and mobile phone coverage and that most of the rural areas in between do as well. We hear a lot of half-truths in this debate about the rollout of telecommunications in regional Australia. Later on I will get on to how we have some holes to fill and how we will have problems in the future. I think that the negative argument that has been led by the member for New England has done irreparable damage to the growth of that electorate. I am wondering, as the representative of that area for over 20 years, what sort of a contribution he has made to the growth of that area. He spoke of 95 per cent of the people in his electorate opposing the sale of Telstra. What he did not say was that it was 95 per cent of the five per cent of the people that responded to his survey. He spoke about Next G not being up to scratch. I can remember hearing him on ABC radio late last year, having spent all day with a stra crew in a car, commenting that the Next G coverage that he was experiencing as he drove from Tamworth through the electorate, ending up at Wallangra and Yetman, was actually better than CDMA. While I acknowledge that we do have problems, I think the idea of taking a debate and focusing on the negatives is doing enormous damage to rural Australia, and I take particular offence that it is affecting my area as well. The interest from the Communications Fund, as the member for New England stated, was to fund upgrades of regional telecommunications. People living outside metropolitan areas need reliable access to telecommunications services. The days of having mobile coverage are no longer a luxury; they are part of doing business in Australia. If you listen to the arguments of the member for New England, you would think that phones did not work. He mentioned the town of Yetman. Yetman is in need of a phone tower because there are areas where phones do not work. I pass through Yetman on a regular basis. I used to cart cattle through there on a weekly basis and I have memories of making phone calls in that same area on my mobile phone. In the 12 years of the previous government we saw an enormous rollout of mobile phone coverage and towers right across regional Australia, but there are still some holes. In areas of my electorate we still have some holes in mobile phone coverage. The Mudgee-Goolma area has poor mobile phone coverage, as do the towns of Pilliga and Collie and a few other places like those. This fund was vitally important to keep that upgrade going. The Next G network is having major problems, but the issue is with the handsets. I have spent considerable time testing the network. I am convinced that the network is up to scratch, but Telstra has sold many handsets that are not up to scratch. I Telthink that it needs to address that problem. Mr Murphy-How is it in Dunedoo?",127
171,Mr COULTON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I actually spoke on my mobile phone in Dunedoo the week before last. I can hold a conversation from Dubbo through Dunedoo and Coolah right up Mullaley into Gunnedah and it does not drop out. This is one of the falsehoods that has been put around. I am not denying that we have problems with telecommunications. That is why I am speaking to this bill and that is why I think it is appalling that the new government is taking away this infrastructure fund and putting it into the cities. This telecommunications debate is doing enormous harm to regional Australia because it is actually slanting the real picture. We have farmers right across the electorate now doing business as they sit on their tractors. In my last harvest, I was dealing with three or four grain traders interstate and I was keeping up to date with the latest cargo prices on my satellite broadband under the HiBIS scheme that was brought in by the previous government, even though I was living in a remote area. I might add that, upon complaints from our local areas, Telstra spent over $1 million on my local remote exchange and the people where I formerly lived had their issues addressed. I think we need to keep a balance in this debate. The issue of telecommunications involves more than mobile phones; it also involves broadband. Some of the areas where my electorate is deficient in broadband might surprise you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Dubbo is the largest town in my electorate and large areas of Dubbo do not have broadband access. They do have access to broadband on the Next G network, but it is dearer than ADSL. It is causing enormous problems. I was speaking to a teacher who is doing a masters degree and was frustrated at not having ADSL connected to his house whereas the people on the other side of the street did. The proposal by the previous government, with the OPEL consortium, to install WiMAX would have solved this problem in Dubbo in a very short time. I know that the people of Dubbo cannot wait for a fibre-to the-node system to be delivered by 2013. They need a reliable broadband service now. They were waiting with great anticipation for the rollout of the OPEL network and have been disappointed that that has not happened. The other issue with broadband is that with ADSL we have good coverage in the towns but we need to continue the HiBIS scheme with satellite connections in regional areas. Broadband is vitally important for people in regional Australia. Due to their isolation, many children are now doing their lessons by broadband on satellite. Many people undertaking tertiary education are doing remote courses using broadband. We need to make sure that people in regional Australia are kept up to date with the latest technology when it comes out. With the overall debate on the proposal to raid the infrastructure fund, I think that the government should reconsider. Rural Australia is on the verge of growth. The quality of life in city areas has got to the stage now where people are looking inland. It is important that we keep that infrastructure rolled out so that people can do business in regional areas. I know with transport, it is important that companies can keep track of their trucks and, for safety, drivers need to be in touch with home bases all the time, so we need to fill in these holes in mobile coverage. The bill takes away the measures that were put in place by the previous government to protect the people of rural and regional Australia. I think that the warning bells should probably be ringing, because one of the first bills introduced by the new government into this House is attacking rural and regional Australia. We in regional Australia are not looking for a superior service to that of the cities, but we are looking for an equal service. I think fibre to the node is an ill-conceived proposal. It is estimated that it will take until 2013 to roll out and it is supposedly going to achieve 98 per cent coverage, but I can guess where that other two per cent will be. The other issue with fibre to the node is that it is replicating a network and giving the opportunity for monopoly control over broadband. It will take broadband away from the system and out of the exchanges we have now. A parallel network will be set up which will give the opportunity for monopoly control over future broadband. I think that the government needs to consider this aspect of the rollout. If this bill is passed then the money that should be spent on ensuring that regional areas get the telecommunications upgrade they need will be diverted back in Labor's city based policies. This bill comes at a time when money needs to be spent on improving telecommunications in rural and regional Australia. This bill is not in the best interest of rural and regional Australians and I strongly oppose it.",128
172,Mr HARTSUYKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to speak in the House on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Communications Fund) Bill 2008, because it is a very important bill for this country. We have only 0.3 per cent of the world's population living on some 5.1 per cent of the world's landmass. Australians live and work in communities scattered right around the country. The tyranny of distance and isolation presents a set of unique challenges for regional and remote Australia. Today I rise to speak of the challenges facing regional Australia in the area of telecommunications and to highlight the danger that this bill poses to the future of telecommunications in regional areas. When it undertook to privatise Telstra, the coalition government realised that private enterprise would struggle to provide viable telecommunications services in many regional areas. We needed to allow for additional funding to protect the interests of the people who lived in those areas where it was not commercially viable to provide many of the services which people in the city take for granted. As a result, the coalition announced a $1.1 billion plan for direct capital investment into regional telecommunications through the Connect Australia scheme. Connect Australia aimed to improve broadband to people living in regional, rural and remote areas; extend mobile phone coverage; build new regional communications networks; and set up telecommunications services for remote Indigenous communities. All of these, members would have to agree, are worthy ends. In addition, the previous government fought for and delivered a $2 billion Communications Fund, with interest gained from this investment to be used to deliver First World communications services to remote and regional Australia-areas in which, as I said, these particular services would not be commercially viable. It was interesting that this particular program aimed not only to deliver the services that we know and take for granted today but also to deliver services that are yet to be invented. I found it quite curious that the member for New England, being the intellectual giant that we all know he is, could not contemplate services that he could not imagine. I am sorry to say that the member for New England is living in the past. The member for New England perhaps cannot imagine services in the future, but the former government could. The former government very clearly realised that there would be technologies coming on stream that are either in the very early stages of development now or yet to be developed. The former government also realised that if regional Australia was going to compete and continue to be competitive in world markets then it would have to have access to those types of technologies and that perhaps those technologies would not be commercially viable in remote areas. That was just one of the reasons why this fund was set up. Income from the fund was earmarked to finance the government's response to independent reviews of regional telecommunications services. This would include the development of infrastructure for regional communities, such as additional mobile towers, the provision of broadband and backhaul fibre capabilities. The Communications Fund was not a one-off exercise; it was a visionary plan to protect regional telecommunications services well into the future. If the past two decades are anything to go by, the next two decades will be a time of great advancement and great development in technology. Who would have imagined 15 years ago the progress of the internet today? Who would have imagined that young students in an isolated area would be receiving their lessons via satellite? It is not that long ago that we experimenting with the pedal wireless for the flying doctor. Telecommunications is moving at a fast pace. Who would have imagined the growth in mobile phone use? Labor anticipated future developments in telecommunications so well that just four years ago they wanted to extend dial-up internet to every Australian. Dial-up was apparently the answer four years ago to our communication needs. What happened? Their policy changed. They went from having a policy where Australia would be left behind to looking at something different. They said: ‘What's trendy in the area of telecommunications? Fibre is trendy. We'll roll out fibre everywhere-where it is viable, where it is not viable and where it is needed.' It is really quite ridiculous. The previous government had a very balanced stance. They had a program in place that would basically use a range of technologies to provide the very best telecommunications services for the circumstances in which they were to be delivered. Labor, on the other hand, is purely using hype to talk about the fibre optic backbone that will not be delivered for many years to come. As technology develops, it is vitally important that our businesspeople, educators, students and medical professionals in regional areas have access to the very best in telecommunications services-and the previous government was working to deliver that. The previous government knew that medical services needed quality telecommunications and that business, if it was to compete, needed exactly the same-and we were delivering that. This legislation is paving the way for the current government to effectively turn the clock back on regional Australia. This legislation will not take us forward; it will turn the clock back. Labor's broadband policy were was released 11 months ago, and we still have no details about the network, who will build it, how much it will cost, how it will be accessed, who can access it and where it can be accessed from. We do not know those facts at this late stage, and regional Australia is rightfully concerned about this. It is quite clearly another example of Labor policy on the run. It is quite clearly another area in which Labor has looked at the trendy solutions to make a good sound bite and then proposed to roll it out, regardless of what that means for the future of telecommunications in regional areas. The Prime Minister announced that Labor would build a broadband network, but then there was silence. There have been no details of costings and no consultation. So far, all we have heard is a notion that one day, off in the future, at least 98 per cent of Australians will have access to high-speed broadband. I see problems with this lack of a plan. The first is that the government's plan will be rolled out over the next five years. Presumably, regional areas will receive their network much later. If you are in a metropolitan area where services could have been provided commercially and there was no need for taxpayer funded investment, you will get your fibre-optic rollout quickly. If you are in a regional area that is absolutely dependent on telecommunications to remain competitive, you will have to wait an indeterminate time for it. You will have to wait for a service that you do not know how, when, where and by whom it will be delivered. All these things are unknown. It is quite right that there is concern among people in regional areas about this. We have seen Labor's form in telecommunications. We have seen them in the past turn off the analog phone network. What did they put in its place? They put nothing in its place. They turned off the log network, sold off the licences and put nothing in its place. That is the way that bor dealt with the telecommunications needs of regional consumers in the past. I would say that current regional consumers do not trust Labor anymore and that they are very concerned. The Australian reported on 1 February that both Telstra and the G9 group were privately saying that the government's plan to reach 98 per cent of the population with fibre to the node may be unviable and that a mix of technologies would be a better outcome. A mix of technologies sounds very much like the OPEL consortium that the previous government proposed to deliver quality broadband service through a range of technologies. We live in a very large land, with very diffitake cult conditions in which to deliver telecommunications services. It demands a range of technical solutions to provide the best service at the best cost. Anybody in this room could probably design a bridge that would stand up, but it takes a skilled engineer to design a bridge that provides a maximum strength at the least cost-and it is the same with a telecommunications network. You can design a network by press release, or you can design a network by using the best possible technologies for the applications required. The OPEL consortium was in stark contrast to Labor's telecommunications policy by press release. It planned to deliver broadbe band strategy to 99 per cent of the population by 2009-not years off into the future, but by 2009-and achieve network speeds of 10 megabits by June 2009. What is going to happen to the government's proposal by June 2009? There will probably be a lot more press releases, probably a lot more hype, probably a lot more hot air but probably fewer services to people in regional areas. Another problem that I see with this plan is that the very companies the government anaexpects to build the network have already told Labor that they will build it themselves. LaAs I said, this is investment in communications infrastructure by the taxpayer that would have been provided commercially at commercial rates of return. Is it good use of taxpayers' money to invest in a service that the private sector was going to deliver anyway? I think not. It is a woeful use of taxpayers' money. We should, as the previous government did, invest in telecommunications services where it would not have been commercially viable. That is a far better use of public money. It is far more logical and far more responsible than telecommunications services by press release. The whole purpose of the telecommunications fundthe fund that this government is proposing to away-was to invest in those very technologies that would not be provided commercially. On top of the fact that the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy wants to use taxpayers' funds to build a network that would almost certainly be commercially viable without funding, the government's plan still has no detail. The minister is apparently confused about his own plan. He is apparently not sure whether he wants fibre to the node or fibre to the home. They are very basic concepts but there seems to be a degree of confusion on the part of the good senator. Senator Conroy seems to confusing the two concepts-fibre to the node or fibre to the home. Which is it going to be, Minister? During the election campaign, he passed through a small town in my electorate-the town of Lowanna-spruiking Labor's broadband plan. The problem is that he could not then and cannot now tell the people of a lot Lowanna whether they will get high-speed fibre under the government's plan. Will Lowanna be in the two per cent who miss out, or will it be serviced by its very own fibre optic network? I am not sure. The minister is not sure. People are not sure what they will get out of the government's plan. I would suggest that the only thing they can be certain to get from the government's plan is years of neglect. The people in regional Australia are all too used to the Labor Party's endless neglect. It will be just like the time when Labor turned off the analog networkan unconscionable move. Labor does not aim to deliver better services; instead, it turns services and puts nothing in their place. Considering that the government has introduced a bill that deals with more than $2 billion that belongs to the people of Australia, I believe it would be appropriate for the people of regional Australia to know what was going to happen to the $2 billion that was previously earmarked to provide them with the services that they rightly deserve. I contend that they are not going to be receiving value for that money, which could be invested in Sydney or Melbourne. I think that the people of regional Australia are being ripped off by the proposed government bill. In opposing this bill, I have another major objection. As I mentioned, the Communications Fund is intended to address the ongoing needs of regional Australians.",130
173,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Order! It being 8.30 pm the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34.

NA TERRORISM LAWS BILL 2008 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Georgiou.",133
174,Mr GEORGIOU,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,"Kooyong) (8.30 pm)Since the terrorist attacks on the USA on 11 September 2001, the Australian parliament has enacted more than 30 laws dealing with terrorism. This legislature has agreed on a bipartisan basis that protecting Australians from the threat of terrorism demands exceptional restrictions on civil liberties and on freedom of speech and of association. Offences and procedures have been established which depart significantly from traditional principles and practices of our criminal law. off The Attorney-General has been given power to ‘list' organisations as involved in terrorism. This means that membership and support of such organisations are criminalised. ASIO can detain people for interrogation. Those suspected of terrorist involvement may be subjected to control orders and preventative detention. Within the parliament and the community, there has been considerable debate about the necessity for and the desirability of such measures. Parliament has given its imprimatur, though not always unanimously and often with considerable reservation. I and a number of others have expressed concern that aspects of the current regime are draconian. I have also voiced my belief that the system's severity could be eased without undermining its effectiveness and that such reform could potentially enhance it. The fact is that a democracy's response to the threat of terrorism cannot simply be more stringent laws, more police and more intelligence personnel. The point was well made by European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security, Franco Frattini, when he said: … our citizens entrust us with the task of protecting them against crime and terrorist attacks; however, at the same, they entrust us with safeguarding their fundamental rights … [the] necessary steps we take to enforce security must always be accompanied by adequate safeguards to ensure scrutiny, accountability and transparency. Mr Frattini's observation has been widely endorsed, not least by the Attorney-General, Mr MCClelland, and I support it. The challenge of protecting security without undermining fundamental rights requires constant vigilance. But the reality is that the machinery of vigilance in Australia is deficient. When the government proposed sweeping new measures in 2005, I said it was important that the parliament identify a credible mechanism to continuously review the operations of the legislation. I suggested that we consider appointing an independent expert to undertake the task, as the UK had done so since at least 2000. Since then, strong support for having an independent reviewer of terrorism laws has come from, amongst others, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Human Rights Commissioner and the unanimous bipartisan support of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security-such soft left-wingers as David Jull and Robert Ray. When the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security was examining the proposal, a witness from the Attorney General's Department assured it that our system of review by parliamentary committees and government agencies-that which existed-was not only adequate but superior to the UK's approach. I am sure that the committee was flattered, but nonetheless it was not persuaded. The committee observed that reviews of the law had been sporadic and fragmented, with limited mandates, and the result was that critical issues fell outside its terms of reference-for example, the impact of requirements about the nondisclosure of security sensitive information on the conduct of trials. In the committee's view, an independent reviewer would be able to undertake the necessary ongoing oversight and contribute positively to community confidence, as well as providing the parliament with regular factual reports. This view was not just stated once; it was reiterated. It is vital that parliament and the executive receive expert advice on an ongoing basis about the effectiveness and impact of the regime of counterterrorism measures that have been put in place. A legislatively provided-for Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Laws would provide a much-needed additional safeguard for the protection of our security and our rights. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",133
175,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,"In accordance with standing order 41(d), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Housing Affordability",134
176,Mr CLARE,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,"I move: That the House: (1) notes: (a) the pain being felt by Australian families struggling to pay off mortgages due to rising interest rates; (b) the failure of the previous government to heed the warnings of the Reserve Bank; and (c) the need for low cost home ownership and reduced entry costs for home buyers as well as a range of rental options for moderate to low income households; (2) supports the Government's commitment to tackling this problem by appointing a Minister for Housing and by making it a key priority for COAG in 2008; and (3) welcomes the Government's plan to help first homebuyers break into the housing market with the first-home saver account scheme. Housing affordability is the most important issue in Australia today. It is the human face of the inflation problem. Tonight, 1.1 million Australians are suffering from housing stress. Last year, 9,751 Australians lost their homes, and tomorrow three families in my electorate will be evicted from their homes. Homeownership, the great Australian dream, is slipping out of the reach of many Australians. This is what we inherited from the former government. This is what we inherited from the people who said Australians have never been better off. And this is what we inherited from the people who last week told us that the Howard government was the golden age of compassion. We inherited this, and we inherited the highest interest rates in 16 years, second highest in the developed world. This is the unravelling legacy of the Howard government. With every interest rate rise, more and more people are losing their homes. Nowhere is this a bigger problem than in my electorate of Blaxland in Western Sydney. Blaxland is the mortgage stress capital of Australia. One in two people with a mortgage in Blaxland are suffering from mortgage stress. More homes are repossessed in my electorate than anywhere else in the country. More than 300 homes were repossessed last year and the year before thatand I fear there is worse to come. Evictions have doubled in the last six months. The Bankstown Sheriff's Office is now evicting 15 families a week and, on top of this, house prices have plummeted. Housing prices have dropped by 16 per cent in the last three years. Some families now have negative equity in their homes. They owe the bank more than the house is worth. In addition, as if we do not have enough problems, ‘sharks' are circling in the neighbourhood, looking to make a profit out of others' misery. Companies have sprung up recently offering to buy your home in less than 10 days for zero fees and with zero commissions, and their targets are the most vulnerable-people who are behind in their repayments and facing foreclosure, people with health problems, people who have lost their job, people who are about to get divorced. One company offers a finder's fee of $1,000 if you can help them to buy a house. Desperate, vulnerable people are likely to make bad decisions, and I am concerned that some people are not getting a fair deal and are getting ripped off. That is why I have asked the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs to get the ACCC to investigate these companies-to see what they are up to and whether there is a need for the reform. We already know there are dodgy mortgage brokers out there that are ripping people off. Last Thursday, ASIC released a report that gave examples of people being charged up to $24,000 just to refinance their loan. They call it equity stripping; I call it a rip-off. I think it is an area that is screaming out for reform. People who rent are not any better off. The rental market has been flooded by people who can no longer afford to buy and are pushing up demand and pushing up rents. Average rents have increased by 82 per cent in the last 12 years. In the last three years, rental vacancy rates have halved. In most capital cities, the vacancy rate is now at about two per cent. In Bankstown, in my electorate, it is now about one per cent. One local agent told me that he no longer advertises rental properties. Another agent has 70 people on his waiting list. I met a man at a men's refuge I was visiting a couple of weeks ago; he was living in that refuge for a couple of weeks to give him enough time to save the money for a bond. This is what we have inherited. Housing affordability has never been this bad. In the last 10 years, house prices have doubled. In 1996, the average home was four times the average wage; it is now seven times the average wage. We have never been in so much debt. In the last five years, the average mortgage has also doubled. That is why interest rates are so deadly. That is why more homes are being repossessed today than when interest rates were at 17 per cent. That is why the great Australian dream has become a nightmare for some and unimaginable for others. This is why we need to act. It is going to take a lot of hard work, but I congratulate this government for getting started: for appointing the first housing minister in 12 years; for the First Home Saver Account scheme; for a $500 million Housing Affordability Fund to cut the cost of housing and spark construction activity; for the National Rental Affordability Scheme-for putting all of this on the COAG agenda-and, most importantly, for a plan to fight inflation.",134
177,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,I call for a seconder for this motion. Is there a seconder? Mr Bradbury-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,136
178,Mr ROBERT,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,"I rise to join the government in noting that interest rates do hurt family budgets where they have home loans and, of course, benefit those many Australians with savings. It must be noted, however, that interest rates are set by the independent Reserve Bank, albeit as a blunt instrument of monetary policy. Interest rates in Australia came off a very low base, due to the outstanding economic management of the previous Treasurer, the member for Higgins. This low base was, in part, due to paying off Labor's previous $96 billion debt and not having to pay the over $8 billion in interest payments that accorded due to that. This allowed the previous government to raise real wages in the last decade by over 21 per cent, whereas under the previous Labor government there was a decline in real wages of 1.8 per cent. Tax reform over the last decade returned more money to taxpayers and to companies. All of this allowed the Australian economy to become the envy and, indeed, the miracle of the world. Remember that the Governor of the Reserve Bank in his June statement said that inflationary pressures were moderating and the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook released in October forecast inflation at 2.75 per cent for this financial year and 2.5 per cent for the next financial year, noting also that the inflation rate over the previous 11 years was an average of 2.5 per cent. In other words, these are recently emerging but real inflationary pressures that we are experiencing, which is why the Reserve Bank is exercising monetary policy. Far from the Reserve Bank issuing these fanciful and farcical 20 warnings, the Reserve Bank simply said that inflationary pressures were moderating and the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook forecast was 2.75 per cent for this financial year and 2.5 per cent for the next financial year. What is concerning, though, is that this Treasurer has been talking up inflationary pressure with ill-timed and, dare I say, reckless comments such as ‘the inflation genie is out of the bottle' one day before the Reserve Bank met to consider rates. Combine this with oil prices of over US$100 a barrel, food prices impacted by drought, a rapid increase in the cost of financial services driven by a fallout from the US subprime market collapse and the subsequent global credit squeeze, all of which have contributed to underlying inflation moving ahead of headline inflation. During the election campaign, the people of Australia and the now government were warned that we were entering difficult economic times driven by international forces. Yet far be it from the Treasurer to act responsibly! In fact, he is acting more like a goose, with over 100 squawks about the previous government doing this or doing that, rather than facing these internationally-driven inflationary issues that have emerged. This is not the time for aimless squawking, Mr Treasurer, or for talking the economy down. It is a time for a flexible labour market. It is a time for retaining the strong $20 billion surplus this government was left. It is a time for implementing those coalition policies that Labor borrowed during the election. I have a copy of these supposed 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank, which I read, looking for where it said that the economy was being mismanaged. I was looking for where it said ‘poor fiscal management by the coalition government' and-you can imagine my surprise!-I could not find it. I was looking for where it said poor fiscal management by the coalition government was responsible for inflationary pressure and-believe it or not!-it was not there. Let me read from 20 August 2007, which apparently is the 20th warning that this government put forward. All the Reserve Bank Governor said was: “As far as I know, our liaison work still tells us that people find labour hard to get. As I said in my opening remarks, in some surveys it is the single most constraining factor ... There was another apparent warning, from August 2006, that: ... clearly more has to be done to attract people into occupations.” What a nonsense that 20 warnings were given-that is an absolute nonsense. The Labor opposition's previous track record on economic management is an absolute farce. They were left an economy in top order. It is incumbent upon them to ensure that it stays that way.",136
179,Mr BRADBURY,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,"I rise in support of the motion moved by the member for Blaxland. It just goes to show that, notwithstanding the election, those on the other side have not learnt the lessons that are there to be learnt from the election. Principally, one of the things the Australian people were telling the former government was that there was real pain in the community. That is what this motion is demonstratingthat there is considerable pain out there. Hearing the member for Fadden reminds me of the former Prime Minister's comment that working Australians, working families, had never been better off. He forgot to mention that we currently have the second highest level of interest rates in the developed world and the highest inflation in 16 years. This is the legacy that we have been left by the former government. But compounding these national figures is the impact that these figures are having on the ground, the impact that they are having in terms of mortgage stress in my electorate of Lindsay. These are the 2006 ABS figures, so this is not a recent phenomenon. It is not about international pressures that have all of a sudden come on the scene since the last election, as the member for Fadden would have you believe. Mortgage stress figures from 2006 indicate that 33.5 per cent of households in the Lindsay electorate are suffering from mortgage stress. That is up from 19.5 per cent in 2001. Equally, the problem of rental affordability is a challenge that many people in my local community are facing. As I was handing out leaflets in my local community at the train stations a couple of weeks ago, a number of people came up to me and told me that they were facing massive increases in rents. And I saw recently in the Penrith Press, one of the local papers in my area, a local real estate agent, Mr Sandy Almazan, the director of Ray White Glenmore Park, stating: Two years ago we'd be lucky to receive three or four applications for every propertythose being rental properties. But now, he says: ... we get at least 20 applications for every house and have had up to 80 names of people interested in a particular property. This is a crisis. I know that the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, said that it was not a crisis. As recently as July last year he refused to admit that there was an affordability crisis for housing in this country. We, on the other hand, have recognised that and we put forward to the people at the last election a range of policies, a package of policies, that will address, in part, some of the challenges that we face on the housing affordability front. First and foremost we have created the position of Minister for Housing. The former government saw it as such an important priority that they did not even have someone sitting within the ministry who had housing as their area of responsibility! On top of that we have a plan that includes our First Home Saver Account scheme, which will allow young people in particular but first home buyers more generally to save the funds that they need in order to get a deposit with which to then crack the housing marketwhich is very difficult, particularly in areas such as the area that I represent and the area that the member for Blaxland represents in Western Sydney. We have also proposed a National Rental Affordability Scheme, where 100,000 new rental homes will be built and delivered at rental prices 20 per cent below the market value. Our Housing Affordability Fund will be a key element of our fight against the housing affordability crisis. From time to time those on the other side will simply say that the housing affordability crisis is the result of the entry taxes that exist on properties, whether they be local government or developer charges or state government taxes. There is no question that these factors are a consideration, and that is why we need to be working with the states to address that situation. But, unlike those on the other side, we have a plan to address that. One of the key elements of our plan is to ensure that money is available to fund the essential infrastructure that is needed, to take the burden off those developer charges, to ensure that the cost of buying a property will be reduced-and our plan will reduce the cost of individual blocks of land by up to $20,000 as a result of our National Housing Affordability Fund. On top of that, Labor have a clear plan for not only identifying surplus Commonwealth land but also actually getting on with the job of releasing it. There is one property in my particular area, the North Penrith Army Land, a site that has been ready for development for many years but which has not been developed because the former Commonwealth government were dragging their feet. These obstacles will not get in the way of a federal Labor government, and that is why we intend to implement the plan that we put to the Australian people and to deliver greater housing affordability to people throughout this country.",137
180,Mr MORRISON,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,"Cook) (8.52 pm)Mortgages are a key issue for my constituents in the electorate of Cook. There are 15,361 dwellings being purchased, which represents about a third of all the dwellings in my electorate, and more than 50 per cent of constituents-based on the last censushad a mortgage payment greater than $2,000 per month. The electors of Cook have steadfastly supported the Liberal Party because of our economic management credentials. It has been the Liberal Party to whom they have entrusted the economic management of this country. The last time that the electorate of Cook elected a Labor member was at the time of the Whitlam government. He was dispensed with, along with that government, for many reasons but principally, I would say, because of that government's economic record. This motion deals with interest rates, so let us consider some facts on interest rates. Under the coalition, the average interest rate was 7.25 per cent; under Labor, it was 12.75 per cent. The government likes to talk about 12 straight interest rate rises. Let us look at the quantum of those increases and the period of time. Looking at the standard variable rate under the coalition, from April 2002 interest rates were 6.05 per cent; at November 2007 they had risen to 8.55 per cent. That is a 2½ percentage increase over five years and seven months-67 months. Labor could do a lot better than that, I can assure you! In March 1985 interest rates were 11.5 per cent under Labor, and in just 13 months they went to 15.5 per cent-that is a four percentage point increase. In June 1988 they were at 13.5 per cent, and in just 12 months they rose 3.5 points to 17 per cent. In August 1994 they were at 8.75 per cent, and by December 1994-just four months later-they had gone up 1.2 percentage points. When Labor put down the pedal on interest rates, they went up on average 0.3 per cent per month. Under the coalition, they went up by 0.04 per cent per month. So under Labor we had an interest rate accelerator, when they put the pedal down, that was 7½ times higher than under the coalition. And not once, I should note, did the starting point under Labor ever get lower than the finishing point under the coalition. So it is just bizarre to have those posite come into this place and deliver lectures on interest rates when Labor have written the book on how to increase interest rates in this country and have presided over an interest rate accelerator that exceeds all oth- pired). ers. Inflation at this same time under the tion averaged just 2½ per cent. If you look at the headline rate for inflation, you see that of December 2007 it was at three per cent, which was in the band set by the former Treasurer. Under Labor, the average was 5.2 per cent. A lot is also said about what is driving inflation. The shadow Treasurer made a very good point today where he showed that the Reserve Bank governor has given the government two out of five for their fivepoint inflation plan. Only two issues that are referred to by the government were covered by the Reserve Bank governor. The Reserve Bank governor also made a very good point back in January when he said that inflation expectations up until that point were under control. What has happened since then? The first figure to come out on inflation expectations, from the Melbourne Institute, shows that inflation expectations have risen from 3.8 per cent to 4.3 per cent. That is what happens when you talk about ‘genies' and ‘bottles': you drive inflation expectations. It is very concerning to those who have mortgages-and around 15,000 in my electorate do-to see a reckless Treasurer bounding about our financial markets, talking about genies and bottles and driving up inflation expectations. The Reserve Bank governor talks about many things when he talks about inflation. He talks about fuel prices, which the government said they would keep under control. That is what the people of Australia are now looking to the government for; the government have made the promise and they will need to be held to account for it. They are the op- ones who are going to have to deal with $80 billion worth of state government debt on their watch; they will have to address that also. The previous government has left an excellent record on interest rates. (Time ex",138
181,Ms GEORGE,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,"I coaliwant to begin by commending the member for Blaxland for bringing this important issue as to the attention of the House. The contribution he and the member for Lindsay have made will give their constituents great hope for effective representation in this chamber from these two new members of parliament. Regrettably, I cannot say the same for the member for Cook, because I think he completely missed the point of the issue that is here before us. His speech was a great exposition on issues to do with inflation and interest rates-which I am not saying are not part of the problem-but he really does not understand that out there in the community there is growing desperation about the issue of housing and rental affordability. It is true to say that his government really fell asleep at the watch on these important issues and that Labor in government have made these issues very much part of our agenda for the future. I am not surprised that recent research data from NATSEM, a very authoritative body based here in Canberra, shows that more than a million of our fellow Australians are spending more than 30 per cent of their income on rent or a mortgage and that, arising from this, housing affordability in our country has fallen to record lows. The average home cost four times the average wage back in 1996. In 2007 that factor had risen to seven times the average annual wage. It is no wonder that, for many young people and for many families, the idea of ever owning their own home is no longer part of the Australian dream-a dream that we in earlier generations grew up with, believing that it was within the means of all to aspire to home ownership. I say that because, when you look at the average first home mortgage of about $300,000, the interest rate legacy left by the former government has now made repayments on that amount in the order of $2,700 per month. That is a huge impost on many of the people that I represent. It is not just mortgage stress that is an sue. When you look at the rental market in Sydney, in the year ending September last year the increases were in the order of 14 per cent on an annual basis, and in places like Perth they were up around 23 per cent. Rental vacancy rates have halved since 2004. Like the electorates of the members for Blaxland and Lindsay, the issue of housing and rental affordability is also a major one in my electorate of Throsby and in the Illawarra region generally. When I looked at the most recent 2006 census data across the Illawarra, I found that nearly 11,000 households were suffering mortgage stress. That data is a bit out of date now, with the consecutive interest rate rises that came after that data was collected. But, in the five-year period from the 2001 census, there has been a 100 per cent increase in the number of households suffering mortgage stress. Over 40 per cent of households in private rental arrangements in my electorate of Throsby are in rental stress, paying more than 30 per cent of their income on rents, and the queues for public housing keep getting longer and longer-no surprise, because of the impact of the huge cuts of around $3 billion in real terms from social housing under the Howard government. While there are no silver bullets to cure the affordability issues that I touched on tonight, the Rudd Labor government is committed to a comprehensive, affordable housing agenda. For the first time, the Minister for Housing has been proactive in raising a number of innovative suggestions to try and deal with this legacy from an uncaring government for whom the issue of affordability of housing and rents did not even register. Could I just say that in terms of those policies, I am very pleased about the fleshing out of the details of the first homebuyers saving scheme. I think that will be a great incentive for young people to save in a taxeffective account for a deposit for their first ishome. I am very keen about the provision of funding for infrastructure so that we can hopefully reduce state and local government development charges. The investment scheme for rental properties at 20 per cent below market rates I think will help relieve some of the obvious pressure that exists. (Time expired)",139
182,Mr SLIPPER,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,"Fisher) (9.02 pm)Firstly, may I congratulate you, Madam Deputy Speaker Vale, on the new position you currently hold. It is clear that rising terest rates under the Labor government is a matter which is of great concern to most homeowners and homebuyers right throughout the country. The former government reduced interest rates very substantially. One thing you can always be certain about is that when Liberal and National parties are in government interest rates will be much lower than they would be under a Labor government. We have a transparent system where the Reserve Bank sets interest rates, but over many years when we were in government we had the situation where interest rates were much lower than they would have been under Labor. In recent times, interest rates have gone up a little but, having said that, interest rates are still much lower than they were historically under previous Labor governments. As a government, we were able to bring about a situation where more and more Australians have been able to achieve the Australian dream of home-ownership. It is somewhat concerning to me that our economic record is being demonised by those opposite. There is the suggestion that, despite the fact that we provided 11 years of sound economic management, we were not cognisant of the dangers of inflation. There seems to be a suggestion that the previous government, as it was prior to 24 November last year, was spending irresponsibly and not taking into account the future needs of the Australian people. Let us face it, when we came to government we inherited a government debt of $90 billion. Over 11 years, we repaid all of that debt and got to a situation where the government and therefore the nation was debt free. That meant that we were able to spend money on desirable social outcomes. Of course, the very best way of achieving desirable social outcomes is by having sound economic growth and a wellrun economy. We were only able to do that inby making difficult decisions, by dotting i's and crossing t's. The funding announcements that we were able to make prior to the election were, in effect, the dividends from the sound economic management over the last 11 years. The new government has inherited a budget surplus of anywhere up to $30 billion. That hardly indicates that the former government followed the mistakes made by the Keating, Hawke and Whitlam governments. Those governments spent in order to create an artificial sense of prosperity and, in doing so, mortgaged the future of our children and grandchildren in the pursuit of this artificial prosperity. I am very proud to have been part of a party that supported the previous government over the last 11 years. The previous government has a sound economic record, and we created a proud nation. Right around the world, we are regarded as a nation which is greatly respected, a nation which has been a good international citizen and a nation which has been prepared to stand up and be counted and make some difficult decisions, particularly in the international interest. In this regard, I particularly refer to the Asian currency crisis, where we took a lead role and quarantined the economies in Asia from the worse aspects of that crisis. In doing so, we helped them to rebuild and also to, shall we say, reinforce the fact that we are a good international citizen and that we want to play our part in this part of the world. Having said that, there is no doubt that many homeowners and homebuyers are feeling the pinch because every time the interest rates go up there is a drain on the pocket and another strain on the household income. But I do not think it is right to say that the former government was responsible for the interest rate rises which have occurred. One has a situation where interest rates go up and come down, but through sound economic management we were able to see very much lower interest rates than before, whereas the new government stands condemned",141
183,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Indigenous Communities,142
184,Mr ABBOTT,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,"I move: That the House: (1) calls on the Government to end the permit system preventing access to remote Northern Territory townships; (2) calls on the Government to restore the pornography bans put in place by the former Government; and (3) urges the Government to not further waterdown the Northern Territory intervention. Over the last few days I have been very lucky to hear two government ministers speak passionately in support of the Northern Territory intervention. I heard the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy speak with palpable sincerity about the importance of the intervention on the Lateline program on Friday and, when prerecording the SBS Insight program on Saturday night, I heard the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs defend the intervention in a hostile ambience when it would have been easier for her in some respects to have fudged her attitude. I want to congratulate both those government ministers for the strong position that they have taken and to say to the House that the intervention is about upholding the same standards of decency and humanity in Indigenous townships that we would expect in our own suburbs and neighbourhoods. The important thing is to ensure that nothing we do detracts from that intervention and waters down its impact. I would remind the House of what the most senior Aboriginal person in the federal Labor Party, the former national president, Warren Mundine, said about the permit system: The permit system didn't stop crime. In fact, if you look at all of the reports that have come out in the last few years, crime has flourished under the permit system, so it's a fallacy to say that it helps law-and-order problems. It really embedded these problems because some powerful people were able to get away with things without being watched. Mr Mundine went on: If you want to create a real economy you're going to have to have more commercial activity happening and that happens by allowing people to flow in and out of places. But it is not just Warren Mundine who is urging the new Labor government here in Canberra to think again about the permit system. The central Northern Territory member of parliament in the Territory legislature, Alison Anderson, said that the permit system: ... has been used as a tool by some people in communities to reject certain people that they disagreed with or don't want out there. So here you have two very senior Labor people, of impeccable Labor credentials, who are saying to the new government, ‘Don't restore the permit system.' I say to members opposite: please don't let ideology get in the way of common sense on this issue. If there is any doubt about just how ideological the new government's position is on the permit system, I refer to a report in the Northern Territory News last week, where a Territory man who drove a road accident victim to a health clinic was charged by Northern Territory police for entering Aboriginal land without a permit. This is the kind of nonsense that the permit system has permitted. Let me also talk about the pornography ban which the Howard government sought to enshrine in legislation and which is now being watered down by the incoming government. The Little children are sacred report said: The issue of children's and the community's exposure to pornography was raised regularly in submissions and consultations with the Inquiry. The use of pornography as a way to encourage or prepare children for sex ... has featured heavily recent prominent cases. … … It was subsequently confirmed at the regional meetings conducted by the Inquiry ... that pornography was a major factor in communities and that it should be stopped. That is what the report said, and that is what the Howard government sought to do. We even had the new Prime Minister claiming in his booklet on his first 100 days to have introduced legislation to ban R18+ content in Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. Not true! The legislation, as introduced by the government, bans pay TV porn only if there is 35 per cent pornographic content, if the community asks for it and if that request passes a public interest test. Please think again. What earthly good can pay TV porn be doing in these communities? We do not need it. Let us get rid of it. Let us support the intervention by restoring the original legislation on this point.",142
185,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,Is the motion seconded? Dr Stone-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,143
186,Mr DREYFUS,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,"Isaacs) (9.12 pm)There is presently a bill before this House which reinstates the permit system that was removed without justification when the former government announced the legislation that it was proceeding with last year at the time of the Northern Territory intervention. The removal of the permit system-the ‘scrapping of the permit system' was the way it was described at the time-occurred without any real consultation by the former government and without any justification. I say ‘without any justification' because, although the removal of the permit system was announced in June 2007, when the then Prime Minister and the then Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs announced the intervention in the Territory, it in was not explained or justified at that time. There was a media release that referred to … the scrapping of the permit system. It directed attention to two so-called fact sheets that were put out with regard to changes to the permit system, but they contained no justification for its removal. It is a fact that the Little children are sacred report, by Pat Anderson and Rex Wild, on which the intervention into the Northern Territory and Indigenous communities was said to have been based, did not call for changes to the permit system. There is no evidence that the permit system was in any way related to child sex abuse. In fact, it can squarely be said that there is some risk that removing permit requirements might worsen the problem of child sex abuse. By contrast, there is evidence that the proposal to abolish the permit system predates the Little children are sacred report by some years. The pursuit of the proposal last year by the former government, and its continued pursuit in the guise of this motion today, is simply the pursuit of an ideological position which does not have a factual basis. Indeed, it is an ideologiregrettably, cal position which is opposed to the control of traditional land by Aboriginal people, an ideological position which is apparently opposed to consultation and an ideological position which is prepared to proceed entirely without any evidence. It is clear that the member for Warringah is intent on listening very selectively-only to voices that he agrees with. It is laughable to suggest that the government is letting ideology get in the way of common sense. The opposition is so blinded by the ideology that drove its legislation last year that even now it is not prepared to let go of it. Mr Abbott interjecting",143
187,Mr DREYFUS,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,"I am not prepared to comment on a matter that is apparently before the courts. The member for Warringah has referred to the case of someone who has been charged. It is worth reflecting on the wealth of material that was available to the former government, and is still available to the opposition to consider, if it wishes, in the form of not one but two reports. There is a report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs from 1999 and another report, much more recent, from September 2007, by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs-both of which make it clear that Aboriginal communities are very, very directly opposed to the removal of the permit system. Not only are they opposed; almost all other groups who have any involvement in this matter have expressed trenchant opposition to the removal of the permit system, which, I repeat, will do nothing to address the scourge of child sex abuse which was one of the reasons behind the intervention. It is worth making the point that many communities, not in the Northern Territory have a high incidence of child abuse-just as high as those in the Northern Territory-and they do not have a permit system. This opposition is intent on ignoring the views of Aboriginal people; ignoring the views of Aboriginal communities; ignoring the views of the Northern Territory police, who have expressed a very clear opposition to the scrapping of the permit system; and ignoring the recommendations of the House of Representatives committee when it looked at this in 1999 and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee when it looked at the matter as recently as last year. I could go on to point to the way in which the former government- (Time expired)",144
188,Dr STONE,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,"I rise to wholeheartedly support the motion moved by the member for Warringah. The opposition condemns the watering down of any elements of coalition policy or legislation concerning the Northern Territory intervention, because it would have the effect of diminishing the protection of Indigenous women and children who are subjected to sexual abuse and violence. The Kevin Rudd government has introduced a bill into this House which would certainly diminish that protection by reinstating, in particular, the old permit system, which ensured that the atrocious conditions of some Indigenous settlements were kept out of sight and, so, out of mind of mainstream Australia. The Labor government's bill, the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Emergency Response Consolidation) Bill 2008, also seeks to water down our policy intent in relation to access to an avalanche of brutal and degrading pornography. This material is regularly seen by Indigenous children, given the overcrowding in many houses in the prescribed communities. The John Howard government decided that it had to act when we received a copy of the report of the Northern Territory government's board of inquiry into the protection of Aboriginal children from sexual abuse. The co-chairs called their report Little children are sacred. This report described the shocking nature of the sexual abuse-its extent, its prevalence, who the perpetrators were and the immediate, long-term and intergenerational effects of this abuse on the children the community. The John Howard government decided not to wait interminably for a Northern Territory response; rather, we acted decisively and comprehensively-and in consultation with the Northern Territory government and Indigenous leadership. The media brought to people's attention the contents of the Little children are sacred report, which shocked and shamed ordinary Australians, both Indigenous and nonIndigenous, across the country. People commonly asked how the dangerous and dysfunctional communities identified in the report could exist in a developed and caring country like ours, which boasts freedom of the press and freedom of movement for all, a fair go and a decent, peaceful life. Of course, one of the reasons that this crisis of abuse, fuelled by alcohol, drugs and pornography, persisted in the squalid ghettos of the remote Northern Territory was that the settlements in question were hidden from the view of the wider public. The permit system ensured that. The grey nomads could not stop on their way up the highway to buy a can of Coke at the local store, they could not drop into the settlement art galleries to buy a painting from the locals, and they could not spend a night in the caravan park admiring the beautiful scenery and having conversations with the community because, with the exception of a few-who painstakingly charted their way through the confusing and ridiculous permit approval system-ordinary Australians were excluded from these settlements. It is hard to see how the squalid un-Australian standards of living would have been tolerated if their existence had been more regularly seen. The Northern Territory government's inertia could not have persisted as it did. The permit system did not protect dysfunctional Indigenous communities from in exploitation by both Indigenous and nonIndigenous pushers of drugs, alcohol and pornography. I believe that locking the blighted settlements away from the public's gaze ensured the appalling conditions of the houses, the neglected and vandalised schools, the packs of wandering dogs, the neglected and dirty kids sitting in the dust and not going to school, and the drunk and doped adults-all of these un-Australian circumstances-were perpetuated because few people beyond the victims knew it was happening, and so they could not care and complain. We decided that just 0.2 per cent of the areas previously covered by the permit system would be changed and the public would be allowed access to the usual places you visit when you drive through a town: places like the public store, other shops and perhaps galleries. People could stop at a public place. We had a lot of support from the women and children for this to happen. Unfortunately, the federal election approached, the member for Lingiari put about the myth that sacred places would be trampled on, that people would enter houses. How ridiculous. That was not our intention. We ask that the permit system for 0.2 per cent of the towns be reinstated. Then there was the pornography. We said that it must be banned. The ridiculous proposed legislation says that it is okay for broadcasts containing 35 per cent R18+ pornography to be seen in these communitiesunless the minister is satisfied that the community wants a ban to occur. I want to know how they are going to get that permission from the community when it is so abused and victimised, when the women and children are so afraid of standing up against those who want the pornography to be perpetuated in those communities-those who make money from it and those who groom children, in particular, for sexual abuse through the use of that pornography. I say it is a shame to see these changes ing brought into this House. I am wondering why the actual bill has been delayed now for two days. It looks like it will not get up tomorrow either. It should be brought on and we should deal with it properly. (Time expired)",144
189,Ms REA,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,"The Rudd Labor government, when in opposition, supported the then government's Northern Territory emergency response because we were prepared to support any measures that dealt with the elimination of sexual abuse and violence against women and children in Indigenous communities. That has been made clear in statements made by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs prior to and subsequent to the last election. is also clear from the legislation before the House. That is why I think this motion is very confusing. I do not really understand why this motion is before us. I am particularly concerned and confused by the second dot point, which calls on the government to ‘restore the pornography bans put in place by the former government'. What does the member for Warringah mean by ‘restore'? As the shadow minister, surely he has read the current legislation and the second reading speech by the minister. When he calls on the government to restore something, it implies that the government is taking something away. The government is taking nothing away. In fact, it is actually extending the pornography ban to include pay TV licences, ensuring that they do not provide television channels that include R18+ content. It is actually an extension of the ban. The previous government's legislation clearly talks about X-rated pornography. The motion before us says that the government is taking something away, when the legislation before the House in fact extends be- the pornography ban. We are absolutely clear in our commitment to protecting children from sexual abuse and violence and we are absolutely committed to cracking down on children being exposed to pornography, particularly in these communities and particularly when they are exposed to X-rated and, in this case, pay television licensed channels which include R-rated material as well. I hear from the opposition criticism that this is also a watering down because it includes consultation with communities. This government is committed to consulting with Indigenous communities on such far-reaching proposals as those that are contained within this legislation and the previous government's legislation. It is also a requirement of the Racial Discrimination Act It that this particular measure be declared a special measure, which requires a community member to make the request. It also requires that the relevant community be consulted and informed and it does allow for a time ban. So, not only are we adhering to what I believe is a genuine approach to working in partnership with many people in Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory who wish to see some form of action taken against sexual abuse and violence; it is actually a requirement under the Racial Discrimination Act, and it could lead to a legal challenge if we do not have that included in the legislation that is before the House. I do not understand why the member for Warringah has moved this motion. He talks about permits, which are clearly irrelevant to the stamping out of sexual abuse and violence-as my colleague the member for Isaacs very clearly outlined. The member for Warringah's statements about pornography bans were completely erroneous and his last point about ‘watering down' does not make sense. What does he mean by ‘watering down'? Does he not think that we should review and assess this legislation? Does he not think that, if things are not working, we should have the opportunity to change them? Does he not think that, if we can identify areas for improvement, we should not do that? Clearly he does. Clearly this motion is not about outcomes or achieving things. The member for Warringah has clearly identified that he is ill-informed. His motion is sloppy. In fact, he is much more concerned about politicking than actually getting outcomes for Indigenous communities. That is absolutely clear. (Time expired)",146
190,Mr TRUSS,INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF,"What a disappointing contribution we have just heard. It sought to misrepresent the facts of the situation and to defend the indefensible. The reality is that many Indigenous communities are locked into a lifestyle that offers no opportunities, no productive jobs and no hope. It is distressing to visit communities where alcohol abuse and violence, filth and hopelessness are a way of life. With all the effort and all the funding that has been provided, we should have been able to achieve much more. But all of the abuse and loss of productivity have been locked behind a permit system which has hidden the reality of what has happened. It has been out of sight and out of mind. Poor health, sexual abuse, violence and lost hope have been hidden behind a permit system that has served no-one well. So much effort has been dedicated to delivering and creating outcomes, but it has not achieved the desired objectives because these communities have essentially been closed to the world. You cannot lock away what is happening in one part of our community if you expect it to progress. Aborigines too are in the world but they do not have to be of the world. That is why this decision by the government to wind back the previous arrangements in relation to banning pornography in these communities is so disappointing. I was appalled to see in the glossy publication about the Rudd government's first 100 days, a statement in relation to Indigenous Australians which said: In its first 100 days the Rudd Government has: - introduced legislation to ban R18+ content in Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory ... The truth is the opposite. They have sought to wind back the bans that were in place, to allow pornography to once again enter into these communities and destroy the lives of people-taking away their opportunities and undermining the safety that we have been trying to build up through the intervention and by providing an effective police and health presence in these sorts of communities. Over the years, what was thought to be right has had perverse effects. Debate interrupted. NA",147
191,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Health Services",147
192,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"According to the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, at least 1,000 doctors are needed immediately to provide even just basic medical care in rural Australia. Yet over the past 15 years less than five per cent of New South Wales and Queensland medical graduates have moved to the bush to work. In fact, of the 280 Queensland medical students who graduated in 2005, only two were working in rural and remote locations this time last year. These are just some of the many facts the Rural Doctors Association of Australia has collected to show that rural health care is a long way behind. Unfortunately, in my electorate of Maranoa things are no different. The people of the town of Goondiwindi, in Maranoa, are somewhat lucky when it comes to accessing a doctor. Unlike many rural Australians who must wait at least six weeks for a basic consultation, the people of Goondiwindi have to wait only three weeks. The Goondiwindi Medical Practice, managed by the dedicated Matt Gilchrist, is in desperate need of more doctors. The practice turns away more than 50 patients a day. Goondiwindi Medical Practice currently services Goondiwindi, Inglewood, Texas, Talwood, Yelarbon and, across the New South Wales and Queensland border, the communities of Boggabilla and Toomelah. Mr Gilchrist's many attempts to have the practice considered as being in a district of workforce age were finally rewarded with the news earlier this year that the Department of Health and Ageing has permitted the practice to employ two overseas-trained doctors. But the Goondiwindi Medical Practice services many more people than is recognised by the department, and it needs at least one more doctor. The Myall Medical Practice in Dalby is suffering the same plight as the Goondiwindi Medical Practice. Last year, the doctors of the practice serviced patients from 38 different locations in just three months. However, the practice is not deemed to be in a district of workforce shortage-only the town of Dalby, not the other 37 different locations, considered a district of workforce shortage. Yet the doctors are experiencing even heavier traffic following the construction of an ethanol plant, a power plant and the nearby coal mines. Up to 1,000 temporary and contract workers needing health care have put an even heavier strain on the already stressed doctors and staff. Dalby is a perfect example of the troubles that health providers are facing in rural and regional Queensland. Dalby is just over 200 kilometres from Brisbane-barely a stone's throw from the Sunshine Coast-and yet doctors there are experiencing the same problems as those doctors in rural, remote and regional Australia. Young doctors and medical students do not want to work in the bush. One GP, who recently retired after 28 years in Dalby, put his medical practice and equipment up for sale for the bargain price of $1, and yet no-one was interested. Down the road from his practice, the anaesthetist and obstetrician at the Dalby Hospital are on call 365 days a year. And just 130 kilometres west of Dalby, the town of Miles has only one doctor for a shire population of 1,400 residents. Yet the situation is only going to get worse shortfor Dalby and Miles. With the impending construction in the area of the Surat Coal Basin and the development of that basinAustralia's largest coal reserve-and the expansion of gas and energy industries, these areas will see a huge population explosion. These doctors, already overworked and under resourced, will be in even higher demand. Therefore, we must move urgently to address medical shortages both in my electorate of Maranoa and, more generally, in rural, regional and remote parts of Australia. The former coalition government made a great effort to boost doctor numbers in rural, regional and remote parts of Australia. We introduced the rural medical scholarships, is which financially supported medical students during their studies in turn for a dedicated period of employment in the bush. We provided important grant programs to provide better facilities, such as the Rural Medical Infrastructure Fund, which helps small rural and remote communities recruit and retain GPs. Yet I am the first to admit that we still have a long way to go. I urge this new government and the new Minister for Health and Ageing to make the doctor shortage in rural Australia a top priority.

193,Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT,"Few conflicts today inspire the level of mistrust and misunderstanding that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict does, and few have the capacity to divide public opinion so sharply. These divisions are not new. Rather, they are symptomatic of the vastly different and competing national narratives alternatively advocated by Palestinians and Israelis over the meaning and legacy of May 1948. Among Israelis, 1948 is celebrated as a war of independence where Jewish determination, resilience and sacrifice gave modern state of Israel. Measured against centuries of Jewish persecution, the full significance of this achievement becomes evident. In sharp contrast, Palestinians remember 1948 as the year of the Nakba, or catastrophe, when 750,000 Palestinians were uprooted from their land and homes. They see 1948 through the prism of dispossession, exile and loss, as an open wound whose only remedy lies in Palestinian statehood and UN Resolution 194 on the right of return for Palestinian refugees. 1948 is a contested history over which Israeli narratives of statehood and independence and Palestinian narratives of statelessness and exile continue to clash. More importantly, it is a contested history that continues to be played out in the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict. In the intervening years since 1948, neither side has achieved security. Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories has shown itself to be a zero sum game, the siege of Gaza has only fuelled Palestinian anger, and the emergence of Hamas has further undermined the already fragile hope of peace. If the origins of this conflict lie in 1948, then perhaps the lesson to be learned is this: that a just and lasting peace will continue to remain elusive until the historical grievances of 1948 are resolved. Yet, as many Palestinians are quick to point out, the Palestinian experience of 1948 is often ignored and routinely devalued despite an already sizable literature dealing with the Palestinian exodus of 1948. Palestinians see themselves as victims of a colonial heritage in which Britain took for granted the right of a colonial power to make decisions about the future of Palestine without consulting the Palestinians themselves. This was certainly true in the lead-up to the Balfour Declaration of 1917, and it also explains Palestine's rejection of birth to the the 1947 UN partition plan. Regardless of whatever positions are taken on the current conflict, the brute historical fact is that the establishment of Israel cannot be separated from the displacement of 80 per cent of Palestine's indigenous ArabPalestinian population. Opinions remain sharply divided on the causes of the Palestinian exodus. Historians like Efrain Karsh maintain that orders issued by the surrounding Arab governments led to the mass evacuation of Palestinians in preparation for war. This thesis has been disputed by Israeli revisionist historians like Benny Morris. Collating an enormous archive of primarily Israeli and British material, Morris argues that the Palestinian exodus was both multicausal and multidimensional. He identifies four distinct waves of Palestinian flight which Morris argues were a de facto consequence of Jewish strategic and military planning, and he goes on to famously conclude that the Palestinian exodus was ‘born of war, not by design'. Other Israeli historians like Avi Shlaim and Ilan Pappe uncover what they see as a tacit Jewish-Hashemite agreement concluded between Golda Meir and King Abdullah of Jordan in November 1947, which centred on their mutual desire to thwart the establishment of a future Palestinian state. ther still, historians like Norman Finkelstein and the Palestinian academic Nur Masalha argue that an explicit Israeli policy of ling Palestinians was in full swing by May 1948 under the guise of Plan Dalet. What all of these authors exemplify is the richness of the debate that now surrounds the historiography of 1948. They show that 1948 contains a Palestinian history as well as an Israeli history with each woven into the very fabric of today's conflict. If we in Australia are to be even-handed in our approach to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and if we are to play a constructive role in encouraging peace initiatives consistent with our status as a middle power that supports multilateralism and dialogue over unilateral acts of aggression, then we must be attuned to and attentive to both of these histories. I strongly lieve that many Australians share this view. The Palestinian experience of 1948 continues to shape Palestinian aspirations in 2008. Let us not forget that. Kangaroo Culling",149
194,Mrs MIRABELLA,ADJOURNMENT,"Indi) (9.39 pm)We are told that very soon there will be a cull of some 400 kangaroos on a former naval site at Belconnen here in Canberra. In 2002 a kangaroo cull on a larger scale took place at Puckapunyal in Victoria just outside the electorate of Indi. It is one of the Army's major training bases and the cull was an absolute necessity. At times the overpopulation can be in the tens of thousands, and I am informed that up to 100,000 kangaroos at Puckapunyal were dying of thirst and starvation. Obviously it is one of the highest densely populated areas of Australia with regard to kanga- to say: roos. Whilst very different in nature and in its reasons, there is one thing in common between the two culls: an outcry of epic proportions by rich and famous celebrities who have been the precursor to any cull. We are Furaccustomed to celebrities jumping on popular crusades. We had punk rocker Pink joining the anti-mulesing brigade against Austraexpellian wool. Following hot on her heels was our very own Toni Collette, the woman who in 2004 said, ‘I will slit my wrists if Howard gets elected again.' Thankfully, post election she returned to the US to make another film for Australian audiences. Thankfully again, both of them did their own research and changed their position on mulesing. More recently, we have had Dick Smith become supporter and best mate of convicted terrorist David Hicks. Last year, in the middle of an election campaign John Newcombe, fresh from advertising support of housing estates, condemned the Gunns pulp mill along with fellow cheerleaders David Williamson, Rebecca Gibney and Kylie beKwong, to name a few. I do not know why the self-appointed arbiters of public opinion believe their opinion is worth any more than a member of the general public, whether that member lives in the electorate of Indi, in the country or in metropolitan Australia. I do not know why they believe that their opinion is worth any more than any other Australian who may not have the thousands of dollars to shell out on advertising campaigns to support the latest trendy cause. The debate on the kangaroo cull in Belconnen slipped further into farce when former Beatle Paul MCCartney threw his hat into the ring recently. He joined animal rights group VIVA, the British based Vegetarians International Voice for Animals, and labelled the commercial slaughter of kangaroos ‘a shameful massacre'. Sir Paul goes on There is an urgent need for action to protect kangaroos from a barbaric industry which slaughters them for meat and leather. Please do all you can to help VIVA! end this shameful massacre. As if it is not bad enough being told from afar how to run our country's affairs- Sir Paul should stick to sorting out his own affairs before offering advice on Australia's domestic, environmental and native grassland and flora and fauna issues-this farce is only made worse by the contribution from Senator Bob Brown in the other place who said: Australia is coming into the spotlight over this, it's very rapidly becoming an international cause celebre. We ought to be able to demonstrate to the world that we have done everything possible to obviate the need for killing 400 to 500 kangaroos. I suppose jeering and howling down the President of the United States of America in this very chamber was not cause celebre enough for Senator Brown. The loopier wing of the environmental movement is notorious for its belief that the life of a gnat is of if not greater worth than that of a human being. This view is expressed in a bumper sticker distributed openly and proudly by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals that proclaims ‘Rats have rights'. All this talk might make some people in the community feel good, but we have to get real. The kangaroo cull in Belconnen, like the one previously at Puckapunyal, is part of a necessary environmental protection plan to protect grasslands and threatened species where overpopulation is damaging the landscape and other important flora and fauna. In the ACT, I am advised, kangaroos outnumber humans by three to one. Anyone in my electorate who has driven the Hume Highway in north-east Victoria or through thoroughfares such as the Three Chain Road in Springhurst, the Snow Road in Milawa, the Warby Ranges or near Lake MCCowen knows the inherent danger of coming off second best to a kangaroo whilst driving. Some of these loopy environmentalists would want us to stop driving, because we interfere with the free movement of kangaroos. The cull at Belconnen is on a small scale. It is time to stand up for common sense; it is time to stand up for the good management of our natural environment and to listen to the good sense of the people of Australia. Terrorism",150
195,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT,"Holt-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (9.45 pm)Today I had the honour of announcing the Research Support for Counter-Terrorism program grants of the federal government. This program is under the auspices of the National Security Science and Technology Unit, which is located in the Office of National Security in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Australia is confronted with significant scientific challenges in several key areas, one of the biggest being national security. To meet these challenges, equal Australia needs to further develop its research capacity and encourage scientific collaboration. If we can increase our national research capacity and capability, Australian research organisations can provide much greater security outcomes. The RSCT program aims to build Australia's security and counterterrorism capability. The program has proved to be a highly effective way of helping organisations develop projects which may not have been developed with the key government seed funding. The investment is dedicated directly to project costs and does not fund institutional infrastructure or fixed costs. Combined with the co-funding arrangements, it means that comparatively small grants can yield rather major results. For universities or small to medium enterprises, the injection of several hundred thousand dollars can be of invaluable assistance. It needs to be emphasised that the RSCT is one highly targeted program that runs parallel to other funding programs and research avenues used by the Australian government to develop national security capabilities. Operating the RSCT program on its current scale allows a high level of participato tion, advice and feedback from user agencies. Partner organisations in this round have provided over $11 million. The federal government has provided $5.9 million through the RSCT program. We are finding that more technologies developed with a specific counterterrorism application in mind have the transportability that allows them to be used in areas in areas outside of counterterrorism. Clearly, tools which help first responders, such as better radio communications, critical infrastructure modelling and scenario testing, can be put into use not only in the event of a counterterrorism response but also in the event of natural disasters, such as bushfires, floods or an avian flu epidemic. Grants are given to the organisations which are best able to conduct research in response to a specific requirement. As such, the nature of an organisation is not as important to the program as its experience and potential to deliver a useful product to our frontline agencies. Over the period that the program has been operating, universities have been the largest recipients of grants, with a close division between government and private industry. The program is most successful where the money it is contributing can make a significant difference to the viability of the project. Some of the project outcomes are quite spectacular, such as, in the biological area, device called the surface plasmon resonance biosensor. This device is a handheld detector which can identify and analyse biological agents. The biosensor was developed by the CSIRO in collaboration with the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and provides law enforcement and emergency service agencies with support in the detection and identification of a range of biological threats that may arise from a terrorist attack. The biosensor's technology allows the user to immediately identify and take action deal with a direct biological threat. As part of the program grants, I announced that the Australian government will provide an additional $248,000 to the CSIRO, in collaboration with Emergency Management Australia and the Australian Federal Police, to extend the biosensor development, allowing the device to simultaneously identify more than one biological agent from any single sample. While the project represents a significant advancement of Australia's counterterrorism capabilities, the biosensor can also identify other biological threats, including avian and equine influenza. There are other areas that have benefited from this counterterrorism research funding. For example, in the physical and information security area, the NSST Unit co-funded with the CSIRO the development and trialling of neutron scanning technology for air cargo scanning of containers, representing the next generation of cargo-scanning capability. The project enabled laboratory tests of the effectiveness of the scanning technology in the detection of explosives. This type of scanner is currently being trialled by Customs at Brisbane Airport. It was my pleasure as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister to announce these funding grants, which are putting Australia at the very forefront of counterterrorism research. I think we will see the benefits a of this funding over the next couple of years. Camp Kookaburra",151
196,Mr MORRISON,ADJOURNMENT,"Cook) (9.50 pm)Last Saturday week, I visited Camp Kookaburra at the Anglican youth department camp in the national park in my electorate of Cook to congratulate Camp Kookaburra founder and Sutherland shire resident Dianne Madden on becoming the 2008 New South Wales Woman of the Year. Dianne formed Camp Kookaburra seven years ago to provide care and support to shire and St George children aged eight to 12 years who live with a parent, brother or sister with a mental illness. They are brave kids who love their families passionately and often act as primary carers. For the last seven years, Dianne and her fellow dedicated volunteers at Camp Kookaburra have given these children something very, very precious: the chance to be kids, to have a break, to meet new friends and to share their experiences in a safe and caring environment. The message to the kids at Camp Kookaburra is simple: they are not alone and they are deeply valued by our community. Dianne knows well the challenges faced by young children dealing with family members who have a mental illness. These children that she cares for often have parents who have committed or attempted suicide or who have been involved in various forms of alcohol and drug dependency. They have had to do it tough. Dianne also did it tough in a time when our understanding of mental illness was not as great as it is today, having grown up in a family which was also characterised by mental illness. Dianne is able to use her experience and her deep understanding and knowledge of these issues to identify with these kids. At a recent camp, one of the kids said to her, ‘You wouldn't understand what it's like for me.' She went and told that child her story. Later that day, as they were walking through the beautiful national park in my electorate, this child came up to her, held hand and shared their story with her. These are the sorts of things that happen on a regular basis at Camp Kookaburra. It is a truly inspiring event that takes place once a year. In addition, the kids at Camp Kookaburra and at other similar events have put together a quilt. The quilt, which is on display in various places around the Sutherland shire, tells the story of these young children's experiences. It shows the emotion-the deep affection, care and love-they have for their parents and how they are seeking to deal with the challenges that, at such a young age, they really should not have to be dealing with. This year, over 50 children attended Camp Kookaburra-up from 16 on their first camp. These children and their families also have the chance to be involved in two fun days a year and a family picnic day later in the year. It costs around $300 per child to support their involvement in the camp. I thank the many individuals and community organisations-in particular, the local Rotary clubswhose generous contributions make Camp Kookaburra possible. It is an initiative that deserves strong community and government support. I acknowledge the support that the state government has given to this initiative, but a commitment needs to be made to it on an ongoing basis. It also needs significant support from the corporate sector and from individuals, not only in the shire but throughout St George and across New South Wales, to ensure that it can continue. It was a privilege to accept Dianne's invitation to meet with her volunteers and the kids during the most recent camp. I look forward to going back next year and doing all we can to support this important work. Following the camp, we have been able to arrange to get them a website, and the next step will be to write to GPs and other comher munity workers to encourage them to refer families to the opportunities provided by Camp Kookaburra. I am also delighted that Dianne's work has been recognised. Dianne is the New South Wales Woman of the Year. I would also like to commend the state member for Miranda, Barry Collier, for nominating Dianne. Dianne's passion is infectious and is matched only by the selfless volunteers and professionals who share this great work with her. Through their selfsacrifice and dedication, they have had a positive effect on the lives of many children who are in very difficult circumstances. The award also provides a great opportunity for getting the message out to our community and to families about the work of Camp Kookaburra in an effort to ensure that more kids get the opportunity to be part of this inspiring program. I also suggest that there is a very real opportunity for this gram to be successfully implemented right around the country. I would encourage those members who are interested in learning more about Camp Kookaburra and those people who may be listening to this debate, wherever they may be, who know of an instance where they believe there is a child who could greatly benefit from this opportunity, even if it is for only 2½ days, to get in contact with my office and we can put them in contact with Camp Kookaburra. Isaacs Electorate: Surf-Lifesaving",152
197,Mr DREYFUS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak about some of the unsung heroes in my electorate of Isaacs. These are the fantastic men and women who volunteer as lifesavers on the magnificent beaches in my electorate from Mentone to Carrum, along Port Phillip Bay. Isaacs has seven lifesaving clubs: Mentone LSC, Mordialloc LSC, Aspendale LSC, Edithvale LSC, Chelsea Longbeach SLSC, Bonbeach LSC and Carrum SLSC. Our lifesavers protect us. Lifesaving is part of a quintessentially Australian activity and holds a very special place in Australian culture. Many of my constituents give up hundreds of hours of their valuable time each year to contribute their services to the local community. They are joined by paid lifeguards and support staff from across the state of Victoria. In 2006-07, lifesaving clubs in Victoria recorded 796 rescues and over 39,000 preventative actions. The combined lifesaving clubs of Isaacs contributed to some 20 rescues and 390 preventative actions. The Year of the Surf Life Saver was 2007-the centenary of the founding of surflifesaving at Bondi in 1907. The year 2007 was also the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Bonbeach Life Saving Club. It has provided 75 years of outstanding service proto the community-and may it for many more years. I would like to commend Debra Jordan, a very capable president of the club and an editor of the fantastic photographic history book which was produced for the 75th anniversary of the Bonbeach Life Saving Club. On 2 March this year, I was privileged to attend the book launch of this brilliant pictorial history. The history records that the Bonbeach Life Saving Club was founded in 1932 and, within two months, had conducted three rescues. It grew quickly and within two years it had reached an extraordinary number of 200 members. Over the war years, membership dropped as members joined the services, but a very forward-thinking president, Dick Hutchings, formed a strong junior membership plan, which provided the outstanding talent for what the club sees as its golden years of 1945-65. There was a lull in activities in the late seventies, but with investment and reorganisation in the early 1980s the club recovered and is definitely still going strong. Just last year, members of the Bonbeach club, along with lifesavers from Chelsea, rescued two sailors from a de-masted and sinking boat on the bay. Three of the lifesaving clubs in Isaacs take part in the Open Water Swim Series along the Victorian coastline each summer. Edithvale and Aspendale clubs have a fantastic joint event called the Club 2 Club, which is a 1.5 kilometre swim from the Edithvale clubhouse to the Aspendale clubhouse. The Bonbeach club has a 1.2 kilometre swim, which is the last of the season for these open water swims. I had the privilege, with hundreds of other swimmers, of taking part in both the Club 2 Club on 9 February and the Bonbeach Life Saving Club's Open Water Swim for 2008 on 16 March. They were invigorating events and, even though I was definitely not the fastest swimmer to complete either event, at least I did not require the services of the lifesavers. It is clear that lifesaving clubs do much more than patrol their allotted patch of beach and water. From providing much needed assistance to the emergency services way back in the devastating floods of 1934 to providing lifesaving and first aid to residents and visitors, teaching children to swim and providing public education on safe beach practices and competition and activities for young people, lifesaving clubs are very much part of the local community fabric along the bay-indeed, they are hubs of community activity. I would like to thank all these clubs and their members for their service to the people of Isaacs. Question agreed to. House adjourned at 9.59 pm",154
