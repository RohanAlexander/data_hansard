NA NA 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 June, on motion by Mr Moore: That the bill be now read a second time.",14
6,Mr CREAN,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"The Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill essentially puts in place measures which were announced by Labor in the innovation statement in December of last year. Those changes seek to limit the ability of companies to obtain the concession for past expenditure-the so-called gravedigging. The main effect of this bill is to insert new provisions into the Industry Research and Development Act, allowing a company to register prospectively for the R&D tax concession; to provide new format and content requirements for applications for registration for the concession; to provide for the validation of certain decisions of the !R&D Board made under the IR&D legislation, subject to the exercise by applicants of their administrative review rights; and to limit the concession obtainable under section 73B of the Income PAIRS Tax Assessment Act 1936 to activities registered by the !R&D Board for a particular year of income. Activities not registered by the board for the year of income in which they were undertaken will not be eligible for the concession. Principally, the bill closes off access to the concession for research conducted well into the past. Companies must lodge applications for registration for the concession within six months of the end of the income year in which the research and development expenditure was incurred. Under transitional arrangements in the bill, no registrations may be made in respect of the 1993-94 and 1994-95 income years if the applications were received after 7 June 1996. No registrations for research and development expenditure incurred in the 1992-93 and earlier income years may be made after 6 December 1995, even if those applications were lodged prior to that date. As I have already said, the bill is essentially Labor's bill, and Labor will therefore support its passage in the House. However, we do have concerns in relation to one provision and have therefore supported reference of the bill to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. I have received a number of representations from companies, which benefit from the concession, about the anomalous effect of this provision. These companies have engaged in genuine research and development activities in 1992-93 or earlier income years and had lodged applications with the Industry Research and Development Board on or before the cut-off date--6 December 1995. However, if the board has not processed those applications and registered such companies for the concession by 6 December, they will not be eligible to claim the tax concession. Through no fault of their own, they have done all that was required of them. On the surface at least, this appears to be an unfair application of the innovation statement decision, and it accordingly bears further investigation. We have asked the Senate committee to look at the issue and, in particular, to look at the revenue implications of an amendment to the bill which would rectify this anomaly by allowing those companies which had lodged their applications by 6 December to be considered by the Industrial Research and Development Board for the concession. So, overall, subject to that point, Labor will support the bill. However, we strongly oppose a number of other measures taken in the budget on research and development: namely, the reduction of the level of concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent and the abolition of research and development syndication. Taken together, these two measures will rip $2.2 billion from the clever country over the next four years in what must constitute the most massive assault on our national research effort in living memory. This is a government that mouths the cliches of industry support, that pretends to support small business but which has cut away at the support that underpins the growth of small, clever, export oriented firms. To give one example, Flexichem is a small Adelaide based chemical company with exports to the value of half a million dollars, import replacement worth $400,000 and which employs six full-time people. The company claims concessions worth around $25,000 per year. According to their managing director, Dr Geoffrey Swincer: I can say first hand that innovative businesses are feeling very uncertain about their future and there is a great reluctance to invest in anything beyond necessities until this matter is resolved. I believe that the 150% tax deduction scheme is the most efficient industrial research scheme of recent years. If the current policy direction is not reversed, it will be necessary for companies like ours to employ less staff [and] stop doing R&D ... which will mean less exports and less import replacement.This encapsulates the problem with the budget. The budget has cut for the sake of it, cut regardless of the consequences and cut into programs which do not cost the nation but which are investments for the nation. They produce dividends for the nationdividends in exports, import replacement, diversified industry and jobs. Why would you get rid of something that was as successful as that? Why would you be so myopic in the search for the budget bottom line that you would cut the capacity for this country to be clever, innovative and to produce and expand? Why would you do it in a way that will impact negatively on what could otherwise be a higher growth outcome? The budget decision to cut the research and development tax concession is a particularly cynical move because it breaches a specific election commitment. I see both the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) at the table. The minister for science, as the then shadow minister, ran around the country telling businesses all over the place that they were committed to science, that they were committed to research and development and that under them, once elected, the 150 per cent tax concession would stay. He went to the electorate and said, 'Under us, have no doubt at all: the 150 per cent tax concession will remain.' It could not have been a clearer commitment. It was repeated often because industry knew that these programs work, that Labor had introduced them and that Labor had continued to stick with them despite pressures from time to time to reduce them. We knew they worked and we were prepared to back industry. We were prepared to back clever industry. It was one of those promises that we now have to accept did not qualify as a core promise. I am not too sure whether the minister went out and told these companies, 'It is just a promise that we will give you research and development and keep the 150 per cent. It is not-wink, wink-a core promise, though.' Do you think they understood the code? Well, they will understand it next time. This decision is cynical because little effort has been made to justify the decision as anything but a revenue grab. Again, according to a report in the West Australian, when asked why he broke his promise and ratted on industry the science minister said: It had to be reduced to 125 per cent in the budget to enable retention of the diesel fuel rebate. It was the trade-off for the diesel fuel rebate. So understand this connection: the 150 per cent R&D tax concession was the price for propping up Tim Fischer's leadership of the National Party. Not a very clever investment, I would suggest. Last year more than 3,000 companies claimed against the tax concession for their research. I wonder whether they think it was a clever investment. Is propping up the failing leadership of the National Party more important than advancing the clever country? Is propping up the National Party leadership the price we have to pay for seeing innovation go backwards; for seeing production, diversity and jobs go backwards? Do the Australian people think Tim Fischer is worth that much? I doubt it very much, but they need to understand the connection. The only basis upon which the 150 per cent went to 125 per cent-and we know it occurred in the last week of budget deliberations-was the insistence by the National Party on the retention of the diesel fuel rebate. They won that but at the cost of the clever country. A disgraceful outcome! But the decision was more than cynical; it was also not clever. The research and development tax concession has had an enormous positive impact on Australia's employment and on our international competitiveness. The concession was introduced in 1986. It was specifically designed to address the key weakness of Australia's research effort: the appallingly low level of business sector research. Its success was almost instantaneous because, from 1987-88 when Labor introduced it to 1994-95, total business spending on research and development almost doubled. It now stands at $3.4 billion. It would not have happened to that extent but for this concession. In 1995 a report by the Industry Commission, which the government of the day is very fond of quoting when it suits it, concluded: The 150 per cent tax concession has brought net benefits to the Australian economy. The commission recommends that the 150 per cent tax concession be maintained. The problem with this government is that it commissions reports but takes no notice of them, or it takes account of reports and then implements decisions which are clearly contrary to them. It uses the reports only when it suits it. But I go further. The report by the Bureau of Industry Economics found that 23 per cent of companies surveyed reported that the concession had been critical to their decision to proceed with research and development projects. One of those you might have seen reference to today on the front page of the Melbourne Age concerns the breakthrough on salmonella. That research would not have been undertaken if they could not have got the 150 per cent. They say, speaking to them today, that they will continue that research but, no doubt, It will be at a lesser level. It never would have got started without the 150 per cent. The 150 per cent tax concession was critical as an incentive up-front as there are all sorts of risks associated with getting these things going. This occurred some years ago. If the 150 per cent had not been there, we would not have this breakthrough today. You have to ask yourself, now that the 150 per cent concession has been cut to 125 per cent, how many decisions are being put on ice. How many people are saying to themselves, 'This is very risky business, and although we believe we have something here, we are not prepared to do it here if we can get bigger incentives overseas'? In countries overseas it is not just 125 per cent some of them pay; some of them pay 200 per cent. We were often as a government under pressure to review whether the amount should be 150 versus 125, but we never looked at it from the perspective of the budget bottom line. We looked at it from the point of view of what makes Australian industry get into the game. What gives them a chance to compete against those countries that do not operate on a level playing field, that have access to incentives? Research and development can travel. If some other country is offering a better deal overall-a better incentive is not the only thing that comes into it; the incentive is only an important component-why would they do it here? This is the problem. We will see more research and development going offshore because of this government's short sighted decision. These companies said that the 150 per cent concession was critical to their decision to proceed with research and development projects, and 50 per cent of companies surveyed by the Bureau of Industry Economics said that their research and development would have been lower if research and development deductibility were reduced. This Bureau of Industry Economics report also found that the concession benefits flow beyond the firms undertaking the research and development. It has a flow-on effect. It spills over to other companies that can draw off the technology and develop it. The report also found that the estimated net social return was positive in respect of the Australian owned company. In other words, these commitments, these incentives, are not costs to the budget; they return benefits to the nation. That is what government should be about. It should be about stimulating industry, stimulating innovation, getting economic growth going, being prepared to work in partnership with industry, providing these sorts of incentives to try to match the sorts of things that are being done overseas and to make sure that we keep in this country what we are good at. What we are very good at is extraction of the natural resources. We also have a very high skill base. The trick is combining them, putting clever people with natural resources. But you do not do that unless you are prepared to encourage research and development, and that is why Labor did commit heavily to these programs. That is why it is a tragedy that this budget now sees them cut-one cut, one abolished. What the government fails to understand is that the job is far from over. While our these business spending on research and development compared with international standards is significantly better than it was because of the Labor programs that doubled it, we still have a long way to go. We are only 19th on the international league table of 24 when it comes to business investment in research and development. We are at the top of the tree in terms of public expenditure but when it comes to business investment we are always at the bottom. Labor has dragged us up towards a better position but we have to persist with these programs if we want to make further inroads. I repeat: these programs are an investment; they are not a cost. As a result of these cuts we will see growth held back. The budget acknowledges that. The budget says that we will only grow this year at best 31;2 per cent and 3Y2 per cent for every other year. Labor in its last three years grew at 4.2 per cent because it supported programs like this. It was prepared to make the investment off the budget. Because it was prepared to make the investment, we got better economic growth. We know what comes from better economic growth-more jobs. That is what the prime issue has to be about. But they have to be not just any sorts of jobs; they have to be the clever jobs, they have to be jobs associated with innovation and value adding and natural resources, not moving away from a commodity base but doing more with the commodities before they leave the country. You cannot do that unless you are prepared to invest in research and development. Now is not the time to drop the momentum. I tum now to the syndication aspect of the research and development cuts. Like the cut to the tax concession from ISO to 125 per cent, which I have just been talking about, the complete abolition of research and deVelopment syndication is an exercise in political cynicism. Not only did the coalition promise to retain syndication during the election campaign; they consistently opposed measures taken by Labor to tighten up on applications to ensure that only genuine research was approved. In the 1995 budget, Labor moved to close off access to the 150 per cent R&D tax concession for private sector tax exempt bodies. The coalition-would you believe it?--opposed those elements, claiming it was being applied retrospectively. They cited in support of their position syndicates such as the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute. The institute submitted their application before the 9 May deadline and was advised would be considered at the June Industry Research and Development Board meeting but that, under transitional arrangements, they would no longer have their application conwhat sidered. What do we have now? We have a list of syndicates which submitted applications to the IR&D Board and were told by board that their applications would, in all likelihood, be approved. All of them were cut off without notice. Effectively there are three stages of approvtion al for syndication. We are saying that, one of those stages has been approved, should be sufficient to keep these syndicates in the race. Otherwise you are doing nothing more than retrospectively applying your election stated: decision. We all know you opposed retrospecChanges tivity when you were in opposition. If you are to be consistent at all you have got to ensure that those applications that were submitted and which have gone through some approval still have the opportunity to considered and fully approved. That means that you have got to make the money available. There is no point in the IR&D Board going on to ultimate approval-which it would have done in these cases-if it has not got the money to do it. We are saying that it should be given the chance to be heard and that it should be given the opportunity for approval to be finalised. It is very interesting that the minister wrote to a number of these syndicates on 22 July and told them that their applications were still being considered-he could not interfere in them, of course-and that they should persist with the IR&D approval process. The very next day the scheme was abolished. What sort of minister writes one day telling people they are still in the game and abolishes the scheme the next day? He either does not know what he is signing or he is being rolled over by Treasury. He is having the decision imposed on him, even though he told industry the day before that they could still have their syndicates considered. It is a retrospective application. It is not just a broken promise; it is a retrospective application. Why do you encourage people to expend time, effort and money putting these proposals it forward and then abolish the scheme? You abolished it with no notice; you abolished it with a press release. That is what you did. There are something like 46 companies on has been termed in the industry as the 'A' list of syndicates. They must be allowed to proceed unless the government can produce the new information to show otherwise. Apart from the budget measures which the coalition opposed and which I referred to earlier, Labor went further to tighten syndicain the innovation statement last year. We if any announced new and more strict finance that scheme guidelines for R&D syndication. Again, the coalition opposed the tightening measures. Its science policy for the 1996 to the syndicated research and development tax concession guidelines may well result in the drying up of one of the few effective fonns of venture capital available in Australia to fund stage of research and development. be What cant! What hypocrisy! You were out there telling people in the election campaign, 'We'll keep 150 per cent. We won't tighten 4510 the R&D guidelines for syndication.' As soon as the coalition were in government-and without any discussion with the industrythey abolished one scheme and cut the other. The reality is that the checks and balances were in place for the research and development scheme. We put them in place last year in the tightening up process, together with the appointment of Mr Trevor Boucher. Mr Trevor Boucher is the former distinguished taxation commissioner. Mr Moore-He did a good job.",15
7,Mr CREAN,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"As the minister says, he did a good job. As taxation commissioner he did not let any rorts through. He was most concerned that the revenue base be maintained. We appointed him to actually vet the syndicated proposals that came through. He was in charge of the committee that let them through the gate. It was that committee, chaired by Mr Boucher, that resulted in this 'A' list-this of 46 syndicates that have now been cut off retrospecti vely. There is no better authority than the minister himself for saying that the rorts have been closed up. He is very fond of saying, 'This syndication was ended to close off rorts.' The minister was asked on ABC radio why the government was not prosecuting rorters. This is what he said: Well, they've been knocked back in the research and development committee which do the research and evaluation of the various projects. The minister himself is admitting that the rorts do not get through. The minister himself is admitting that the circumstances in which we effectively made the system foolproofMr Sercombe-Did he really say that?",20
8,Mr CREAN,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"He did say that, yet he will not stand up and argue that in cabinet. That is the problem with this minister. He goes out and tells industry he is on their side, but what sort of a champion is he when he lets these things which undercut the basis on which industry can really prosper in this country go through? For the government to accuse Labor of supporting the rorters is gross hypocrisy. Why? We tightened the system. We appointed Trevor Boucher, and essentially the system became foolproof. REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, 18 September 1996 My challenge to the minister is: show us where, in any of the 'A' list companies, rorting is apparent. Demonstrate that. I know you put out a press release with four examples in it when you abolished the scheme saying, 'This is the reason we abolished it.' Not one of those four got money. Yet this is the basis on which you scrap the scheme. But my challenge is different. Go to the 46 that are on the list now. Go to the 46 that you have retrospectively wiped off the books and tell us where they have rorted. If not, you have got to allow them to proceed in all good faith and in all good interests of the Australian economy. I want to make our position crystal clear. We, as an opposition, support the removal of rorts where the existence is proved. If there are loopholes in syndication which allow rorts, they should be closed off. That was always our practice in government, a practice list which the coalition opposed. I am happy, at any time, to receive a briefing from the minister about the loopholes, if they still exist. I would also be interested to hear why such loopholes, if they still exist according to him, cannot be closed off. Until strong evidence is shown to the contrary, we will continue to oppose throwing out the baby with the bathwater because that is what is involved. You are saying, without any evidence, that there are rorts but, instead of producing the evidence, you abolish the scheme. By all means close the rorts, but do not abolish the scheme. This is an approach which is favoured by eminent Australians such as Sir Gustav Nossal. Writing with characteristic understatement in the international science journal Nature, he described the decision to abolish syndication as 'a pity', but he went on to say: It would have been fairly straightforward to close the tax loopholes without axing the scheme altogether. If this had been a genuine attempt to support research, rather than a blatant revenue grab, the government would have replaced syndication with a scheme of equal value. Instead, it has cut $2.2 billion from the research effort and replaced it with a grants scheme called START worth $340 million. It should be renamed 'finish', because that is what will happen to research and development in this country. From $2.2 billion down to $340 million, and you expect us to become a clever country! I quote Gustav Nossal again: The sums foreseen for Start are those saved on syndication. The scheme will also take some time to get going, and in the meantime much momentum will be lost. I do not think those members of the backbench who are concerned about this debate can have a better authority. Don't just take it from us. Don't just take it from the industry which, you might say, is a special pleader. Go to the people who have been involved in research in this country throughout its history. Go to the people who have made it eminent. Go to the people who have put us on the world stage because of what we have been able to develop because, as a government, we have supported research; but take away the programs and it simply will not happen. At the very least, the proposals on the IR&D Board's 'A' list-approved by Trevor Boucher but retrospectively shelved-should be allowed to proceed. We will essentially support the bill, but I can promise a rougher road for job destroying industrial research and development cuts. How many jobs will have to be lost overseas before the government wakes up to the damage it is doing? This is another reason why the predictions are that unemployment will rise to nine per cent under this government's budget policy, and we will seek to prevent it. (Time expired)",20
9,Mrs WEST,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"I should remind the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), that the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1996 is about proposed changes to the Research and Development Act 1986 which make research and development tax concessions better value for Australian taxpayers-and we are going to do that. The government has, as its brief, to fix up the problems that you created and that you started to improve but did not go far enough in the direction of improving in the system. That has been left to us. This government recognises the effect and the positive impact of R&D for business and technology and, when applied appropriately, R&D is to be restored to its primary purpose: support for business and innovation. This government will put into action the words and the empty rhetoric that we were left with in much smaller than December 1995. What this bill addresses is the slothful way the previous government moved in doing something about making R&D better value. What did it do? The previous speaker spoke of statistics. They doubled, but I will address the dollars and cents issue later on. The previous speaker used statistics, but really statistics can hide and mask a measure of sins. I have a positive outlook for R&D under the auspices of this government, not the doom and gloom perceived by the previous speaker. No growth: I think not. If anything, our policies will be designed for growth and, putting it in its proper perspective, good value for taxpayers' money, not what we got before-a rorted system. The reality is that we, the current government, will put R&D into an accountable perspective. We agree with your sentiment on the importance of R&D and we acknowledge the attempts by you to address this in government. But it was too late. And what happened? We are now on the government side of the House and you are on the other. Who put us in the 19th position? Labor put us in the 19th position as far as the estimates of value and the effort that we put into R&D are concerned. Industry and research development is what this government is committed to. This bill proposes the changes and we are going to deliver them. We will do this by both stopping the unintended use of the concession and making the administrative procedures better suited to the needs of industry. The amendments bring the R&D tax concession program closer to its aim of stimulating the performance of R&D which, in the absence of a government subsidy, would not be undertaken. This is achieved, as has been stated by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), by reducing retrospective access to the subsidy under section 39J to a reasonable period after the end of the year of income in which the R&D activities are conducted. In speaking to this bill, Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the fact that during the election campaign the coalition endorsed the revenue protection measures proposed by the previous government with respect to the operation of the 150 per cent R&D tax concession policy. The government will implement these measures, subject to minor modifications which will improve the operation of the tax concession. This bill confirms measures the previous government announced in their innovation statement in December 1995 and endorsed by the coalition prior to the March federal election. Our government is, in effect, meeting our election commitments and at the same time putting into place changes proposed by the former administration. However, while the previous government proposed changes to the IR&D legislation, they have since walked away from these measures. Under the previous government the administration of R&D was in a parlous state. Once again, it has been left up to the coalition government to take the initiative and tum words into action. It has been the job of this government to act in the most responsible and accountable way with respect to R&D programs. One of the aims of this bill is to address the proliferation of gravedigging, not to be confused with the opposition's current scaremongering of elderly and frail nursing home clients. Gravedigging was the practice of consultants ploughing through years of companies' accounts looking for a tax sweetener for their clients. This practice generates no additional R&D but results in significant cost to revenue and runs counter to the intention of the concession - taxpayers A secondary industry has developed around this retrospective access to R&D tax concession whereby a consultant approaches a company and offers to identify activities conducted as early as 1985 which qualify for the concession in return for a percentage of the obtained deduction. The intent of this bill is to end gravedigging. This will be manifest by requiring the companies to lodge their application for registration with the IR&D Board within six months of the end of the relevant income year. The scope of this activity is so extensive that measures are expected to result in revenue protection totalling $235 million over the next three financial years. What a saving! The minister has stated that other advantages and improvements will be made to the registration process, such as advanced registration and registration of activities which also encourage companies to direct their creativity towards new technologies and new markets. The specific measures which will improve the operation of tax concessions were released in a joint statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism on 3 June this year. The statement said: The measures, which are to operate from the time of the original announcement, 2.30 PM EST 6 December 1995 are to: apply the measures on the basis of a year of income rather than a financial year. This is the basis of registration under the current law and is practical for different tax accounting periods; affirm the announcement of the former Government that there be no new registrations for expenditures incurred in the 1992-93 and earlier income years, irrespective of when applications for such registration may have been made; The statement goes on: allow time for registration for expenditures incurred in the 1993-94, 1994-95 and subsequent income years to apply on the basis of lodgement of application for registration and not actual registration. That is - in respect of years of income ending after 6 December 1995, taxpayers may lodge applications up to six months following the income year in which the expenditure was incurred; and may also lodge applications for registration in respect of the 1993-94 and 1994-95 transitional years of income at any time before 7 June 1996 (within six months following the former Government's Innovate Australia announcement); and an application cannot be amended after the lodgement time for the application has expired. The government has already allowed for a one-off transitional period of six months, ending on 7 June 1996, during which companies could continue to submit applications for registration, in respect of the tax concession, for the 1993-94 and 1994-95 income years. A number of changes have been introduced to bring the administration of the research and development tax concession into line with the self-assessment principles of taxation administration. These include reducing the obligations of the research and development board prior to registering a company and introducing the ability to set fees by regulation in relation to applications and requests to the board. This bill represents a huge boost to the integrity of the research and development tax concession which is long overdue. This amendment begins the process of retuming the program to its rightful focus of encouraging new research and new development. The effectiveness of the scheme has been examined in recent years with various studies by the Industry Commission, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Australian National Audit Office. The various studies were used by the Treasury, which examined the cost-effectiveness of the tax concession in the winter of 1995 edition of the economic roundup. According to Chris Field, both the Industry Commission and the Bureau of Industry Economics found that the scheme provided net benefits to Australia. Both sides of the House agree on this point. The Industry Commission found that as much as 90 per cent of R&D investment would have occurred without tax concession, while the Bureau of Industry Economics found that the concession encouraged between 10 per cent and 17 per cent of R&D expenditure. The Labor government repeatedly acknowledged the need to encourage Australian firms to increase their expenditure on R&D, yet in 1993 the Bureau of Industry Economics report conceded: The amount of additional R&D expenditure induced by the concession appears to be between 10 and 17 per cent of eligible R&D. This implies that 90 per cent of R&D would be undertaken even in the absence of the concession. The Labor opposition boast the statistic that BERD had doubled, as the previous speaker alluded to, in the period 1981 to 1993. What they did not quote was the very low base from which the statistic was generated, making even the smallest increase appear proportionately large. Therein lies the dilemma. It sounds good. Only 20 per cent of R&D expenditure was on genuinely innovative projects-hardly a high record. Here is the significant finding: investment decisions are often based on the tax consequences of the investment rather than the nature of the R&D being undertaken, particularly when investment syndicates are involved. There you have it: a government sponsored taxation benefiting scheme masquerading as a research and development program. One has to wonder, like the previous speaker, how many genuinely innovative ideas and industrial ventures were stifled or put on the backburner because some companies were more interested in the tax concession than promoting employment, fostering manufacturing industry, building an innovative product and strengthening our business edge and wealth. The former government and the former speaker talk about hypocrisy. Here it is, ladies and gentlemen. The former government's response was released on 6 December 1995 and foreshadowed a tightening of certain eligibility criteria, but not before the ramifications of this were leaked and there was a surge of applications submitted to catch the last wave of government assistance for tax concessions. As stated previously, our government recognised the need to close this concession loophole. Here we are today restoring research and development to its proper placeas an incentive for business and companies to promote innovations, ideas, industry and intellectual property that will truly generate wealth and prosperity in the marketplace and not in the bank accounts of financial advisers and consultants. Details of tax expenditure issued by the 83 to Treasury estimate that the scheme cost $400 million in 1992-93 and-it gets better-$525 million in 1993-94. The estimated revenue protection expected as a result of the passage of this measure is $235 million over three years-good value for the Australian taxpayers. For these reasons I commend this bill to the House.",21
10,Mr SERCOMBE,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"It is interesting that the member for Bowman (Mrs West) spent some time talking about gravedigging this morning. I would have thought that when it comes to the question of research and development the principal gravedigging that seems to be going on is of Liberal Party and coalition election promises. In relation to the question of syndicated research, for example, the policy was quite explicit. The science document states: ... changes to the syndicated research and development tax concession guidelines may well result in the drying up of one of the few effective forms of venture capital available in Australia to fund research and development. I will come back to that a little later. This legislation, as my colleague the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has indicated, basically has the support of the opposition inasmuch as it implements announcements made by the former government in the context of the innovation statement of December 1995. The legislation, with one area of exception, which is being looked at by a Senate committee, is consistent with that position. The exception the opposition does have significant concerns about relates to a point of difference between the bill and the innovation statement. There is a provision in the bill that closes off access to concessions from applications for the 1992-93 income years and earlier which were not registered prior to 6 December 1995, even if lodged before that date. That is a technical matter that needs to be looked at, in our judgment, in order to ensure that no injustices are done by the creation of an anomaly in that respect. I think the worse aspect of what the government is about in its approach to research and development is this myopic view of Australia's longer term needs in relation to our positioning on research. The member for Bowman was talking about a number of issues, but companies simply do not have to operate in Australia to carry out research and development if there is not an appropriate environment to encourage them to do so. They can carry out those activities, in many instances, in all sorts of places within our region or elsewhere. In order for this country to achieve and maintain high, sustainable rates of growth, to improve our trading position and to improve our competitiveness in our region, we simply need to be competitive in this area and offer a package of measures and support for our businesses that are competitive elsewhere. This is, I believe, one of the crucial issues facing the Australian community because I believe there are very few things in Australia now more important than ensuring that this country diversifies its manufacturing base and continues to build on the achievements of the last decade in that respect. That diversification has to be in the areas of production of goods and services which are described as knowledge intensive goods and services. Elaborately transformed manufactures are an important component of what represents the fastest growing area of world trade. They are industries that offer the people of this country opportunities-provided we are assuming and holding and, in fact, increasing market share-to achieve significantly increased incomes. Those industries offer the opportunity of stretching out the balance of payments constraint on our growth, which has historically been such a key inhibitor in Australia. Research and development activity is a key in that respect. The budget that is currently before this House is really a disaster in that respect. We have had the spectacle in the parliament of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) last week really obscuring the key betrayal of trust that this government are carrying out in respect of their reductions in the tax concession on R&D and the abolition of syndication by pretending that they are about some sort of elimination of tax rorts. Even for the Liberals that is a bit rich when one takes account of the fact that it was they in opposition who opposed some of the tightening up measures that the former Labor government had been undertaking with respect to the elimination of rorts. I believe the member for Hotham again today gave the minister for industry the opportunity to deny that the four examples of alleged rorts that were gi ven by the government in its decision to abolish syndication were actually picked up by the checks and balances in the system that Labor had in place, and did not proceed. Once again in this House this morning Minister Moore has had the opportunity to deny or amplify the comments that he was quoted as making as reported in the Australian Financial Review on 1 August. He was quoted as saying: Well, they've been knocked back in the research and development committee which do the research and evaluation of the various projects. I am referring to the very examples which he and the Treasurer were touting around in this House last week as being some sort of rationale for abolishing syndication and tightening up generally. Yet he has not chosen to amplify his position this morning and has not denied the assertions from the member for Hotham that the four that he was referring to in the House last week are the same ones that he acknowledged on 1 August were knocked back. The government's credibility in this respect is pretty narrow. As the member for Hotham indicated, the government really is in the process of throwing out the baby with the bath water in relation to this. The member for Hotham referred to a very gentle comment by a person who is probably Australia's eminent scientist, Sir Gustav Nossal. Sir Gustav was quoted in the Australian saying somewhat stronger things on 27 August. The article says: The nation's leading scientist, Professor Sir Gustav Nossal, warned yesterday that Australia's futurethis is very stronghad been jeopardised by the federal Budget cuts tertiary education and incentives for research development. Sir Gustav, the president of the Australian Academy of Science, said the Budget threatened the gains made in recent years in redressing the traditional imbalance in Australia between mental research and applied R&D that led to industrial innovation. These are very strong words from such an eminent scientist and words that it would appear the government is not heeding. A series of other articles have appeared in the media in relation to the government's budget announcements. There was a particularly interesting article in the Australian Financial Review of 27 August, of which I will quote several sections. It is written by Peter Roberts under the 'Best practice' section. It says: Australians, and especially those who drafted last week's federal Budget, seem to have a peculiarly dated idea of the role played by science and technology in a modem economy. It goes on and makes a whole series of points. One very interesting one really goes to some of the points that the member for Bowman was making. It says: Transnational corporations will rightly see Australia as a less desirable place for R&D which will lead to fewer innovative activities with their potential to generate manufacturing and service industry opportunities. And indigenous small and medium-sized businesses will find the remaining grants and deductions far less easy to access. This is a classic case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Just so that the discussion does not proceed on too abstract a level, perhaps I can give some examples of the sorts of activities that are highly unlikely to be replicated in future as a result of the approach that this government is taking by its extraordinarily short sighted approach to research and development. In my own city of Melbourne a company called JNA Telecommunications has been involved in the development of the AS200 multiplexers under syndication for supply to telecommunications carriers. That product is expected to generate about $60 million internationally and $30 million domestically over the next three years. A very high-tech, sophisticated technology, commerto cialised through the operation of R&D syndiand cation, is precisely the sort of activity which is now in serious doubt in Australia. Another Melbourne company, SCITEC, is a communications systems supplier and is funda- listed on the ASX. It employs 176 people. Syndication financed about $17 million investment in R&D at a time when the company was severely capital constrained. Nucleus Ltd used syndication to finance the development of the defibrillator, a high technology implantable medical device. A company in New South Wales, EOS, financed some $19 million of R&D through syndication on fire control, navigation systems, avionics and computer systems. Another company, ABCL, is a manufacturer of advanced laboratory instruments that assists in the processing of tissue and smear samples used to diagnose various illnesses, including cancer. A syndicate formed involving the MCFarlane Burnett Centre, the New South Wales Blood Bank and the Amrad Corporation has been making very important gains in AIDS through the syndication process. We are not talking abstractly; we are talking about tangible, leading edge technologies in which Australia has an outstanding research base, where the opportunities that arise ought to be picked up aggressively and commercialised by any government, given the importance of that type of leading edge . ndustry for Australia's future. What does government do? It sends all the wrong and inappropriate signals. It tears up its own election commitments. That absolutely ought to be condemned. Reference was made earlier to the START scheme as being some sort of substitute. But Mark Abernethy, in an article in the Australian Financial Review on 27 August, put the argument that that particular scheme is going to severely disadvantage small businesses in Australia, as opposed to the existing arrangements that are in the process of being scrapped. Let me go back to some basics. The critical point needs to be made that Australia under successive governments has always had a fairly enviable record in public sector research, but in the area of business research and development Australia has lagged. But, because of the sorts of policies that the former government put in place, business research and development trebled as a share of gross domestic product in the decade just past under Labor. There has been a sharp rise in Australia in what is regarded as the research and development intensity of Australian manufacture; that is, Australian manufacture is increasingly emphasising high technology and is increasingly emphasising, and getting into, fields of elaborately transformed manufacturing. R&D is critical to our success in that. There is powerful academic evidence which links increased business research and development to increased exports. The Centre for Strategic Economic Studies, which is part of the Victoria University, has carried out some outstanding work over recent years in that area. Without boring you with econometric models, which, frankly, I would struggle with and bore everybody stupid with even if I did understand them, the evidence is nonetheless compelling that increased business research and development translate directly into increased exports. The final conclusion that that centre has come to in its recent study is that Australia at present is extraordinarily cost competitive internationally as a place for business to carry out research and development. I am saying what the opposition is saying through the this words of the member for Hotham; that is, with the short-sighted, stupid changes that this government has before the House at the present time, there is a real danger of the baby being thrown out with the bathwater in these important areas of technology, and, frankly, quite unnecessarily so. The fact is that syndicated research and development have been found to be a uniquely Australian and uniquely successful means of providing government support to building high-tech businesses. The only economy in the Asia-Pacific area with a comparable level of business research and development is Singapore. But one has to be fearful, as I have indicated already, that our strong position in that respect may well be coming under some question. There has been some reference by both the member for Hotham and the member for Bowman to the 1994 report of the Bureau of Industry Economics on syndication. Despite the government's rhetoric about tax rorts, that BIE study found that there was a high rate of inducement for new research and development, with about $2.60 additional research and development expenditure being induced for every dollar of research undertaken by participants, which would have gone ahead anyway. Frankly, I do not know where the figures that the member for Bowman was touting came from, because the BIE report of 1994 states in black and white that $2.60 of additional R&D was induced for every dollar of research, which would have been undertaken without the government arrangements. The BIE concluded that the syndication program is a unique and highly effective instrument for cheaply stimulating new R&D. I certainly join other members of the opposition in calling on the government, in the interests of Australia's manufacturing future and other sectors of our economy, to review the decision that they have taken on research and development and to come back to something approximating the sorts of commitments they went to the Australian people with. I believe that they have made a very serious error of judgment in this area.",24
11,Mr ROSS CAMERON,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"I have listened with interest to the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), and I would have to begin by saying that I regard his citing of the research on this subject as somewhat disingenuous, in the similar fashion as I regarded the remarks of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). In fact, considerable research has been undertaken by a number of organisations on the effectiveness of these programs. I would regard the summation of syndication as 'uniquely successful' as being a gross distortion of the facts. We are speaking about research and development today. Beginning on a matter of definition, the OECD defines research and development as the following: creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledgeincluding knowledge of man, culture and societyand the use of this knowledge to devise new applications. It is my contention that there are a number of points at which the previous scheme failed that definition; in particular, its failure to solicit creative work, its failure to do so on a systematic basis, and its failure to do so in a manner which devised new applications for the knowledge in question. The purpose of this bill is to provide for advanced registration of bodies undertaking eligible research and development and to impose restrictions on the time by which the applications for registration must be made. The bill should be understood in the context of the government's total reforms to the R&D sector, including the removal of syndication and the reduction of the concessional R&D rate from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. But, more particularly, it needs to be understood in the context of the government's total commitment to research and development in the wider budget context. Looking at the history of the scheme, it was in May 1995 that the then government introduced the concession as a temporary measure in the hope of stimulating research and development, particularly private business expenditure on research and development. That measure was taken as a recognition of the fact that the unwillingness of the private sector in Australia to invest in research and development was becoming a substantial impediment to economic growth. We need only cite the fact that Australia had fallen to 21 st in the world in gross domestic product from 10th in the world a decade previously. So between 1976 and 1986 we fell from 21 st to 10th and, at the same time, we witnessed this decline in expenditure in investment in the future of technology in the form of research and development. It was in 1965 that the issue was first brought to the attention of this parliament when the Menzies government established a science committee and recommended the provision of tax incentives for research and development. Prior to 1973, Australia had been just ticking along at roughly the same rate as many of our competitors, but admittedly at a very low rate as the whole region was yet to fully galvanise and appreciate the possibilities of the emerging new global economy. In 1973 we saw our position deteriorate very substantially in terms of business expenditure on research and development. We saw a virtual evacuation of the field by business and we fell to the lowest level ever in Australia's history of 0.23 per cent of GDP in 1978-79 in terms of business expenditure on research and development. We clearly had a major problem to address, and particularly so because our competitors in the OECD were going in exactly the opposite direction. They were massively upgrading their expenditure. They were making the investments. They were spending the money where they needed to in order to enhance the productive capacity of their economies. Then in the 1980s there was a welcome change in trend and Australia did begin to finally spend money in this vital area, but it was still well below that of our competitors. We find today that our position is something like 17th out of OECD nations compared to 18th at the beginning of the 1980s. So the bottom line of whether the policy has delivered the intended outcome must be no. In fact, it has not enhanced Australia's competitiveness. That is really what this government and this bill are about. They are about a willingness to go back and assess the performance of policy instruments and not just take it as a given, not just believe recitation of some sort of policy mantra with sufficient frequency and at sufficient volume it must in fact be doing the job. I now would like to tum to some of the evaluation that has taken place on the effectiveness of the program. The whole syndication initiative was introduced as a sort of turbocharger in recognition of the fact that existing tax incentive simply was not delivering the outcomes that were required to make Australia competitive. Let us look at what the indications are from the research undertaken by the Industry Commission in its report of May 1995 entitled Research and development report No. 44 and the report of the Bureau of Industry Economics entitled R&D, innovation and competitiveness, research report No. 501993. Additional work has been undertaken by Austrade and also by the Australian National Audit Office. I would like to quote from some of those reports I have just mentioned. The Industry Commission and the Bureau of Industry Economics found that the scheme provided some benefit to Australia, but it had not made us more competitive as against our principal OECD partners. Australia's gross expenditure on research and development as a proportion of GDP is 25 per cent lower than both the average of all OECD countries and the median figure for other medium sized R&D performing countries. The Industry Commission found that as much as 90 per cent of the R&D investment would have occurred without the tax concession. Somewhere between 10 per cent and 17 per cent was the only new R&D that resulted from the concession. So we are really talking about between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of the government's expenditure on this issue in forgone tax revenue effectively being wasted. It has been flushed down the sink. It has not hit the target to which it was directed. To hear the opposition moaning and bleating about reduced expenditure in this area is somewhat galling. Our task here is not to constantly throw more money at the problem, not to constantly give more and more generous tax incentives, but to ensure that the incentives get to the policy target to which that by the they were originally directed. The BIE's analysis was that only 20 per cent of the R&D expenditure under the scheme was on genuinely innovative projects. One of the explicit policy goals of the concession was to encourage the development of novel industry applications which would enhance our productive capacity. Clearly, only the one in five of those bullets were hitting the target; the other four were simply being wasted. In my view, the member for Hotham was complaining, again, in a completely disingenuous way about the importance of the concession to small business. In fact, the Industry Commission reported that the scheme delivered 'disproportionate benefits to large companies'. In 1993-94, 2,882 companies claimed the concession. The total expenditure claim was approximately $2 billion, but I have to inform the House that the top 10 companies making claims accounted for more than half of the total cost of the scheme. So you have 10 companies averaging $100 million each. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not know what your definition of small business is and I am not sure what the definition of the member for Hotham is, but I suggest, at an average of $100 million each, this scheme is not targeting small business effectively. In fact, what we see is the emergence of a scheme that is pandering to the strongest of the strong. In that regard, I note that the Bureau of Industry Economics noted what it calls the 'excessively high administrative and transaction costs of the scheme whereby an average syndication costs $195,000 in overheads'. Those funds are not going to small business, they are not going to researchers, they are not going to innovators, they are not going to science. They are going to a small club of bankers and lawyers who will wander around the halls of Grosvenor Place and Collins Street, muttering to one another about this scheme and characterising it as 'a nice little earner'. It is widely regarded as a great rort and, at the cost of approximately $190,000 per syndication, it is no wonder. So, effectively, here you have a little club made up of Bain and Co., Macquarie Bank and Bankers Trust whose members have built themselves a little industry around this government concession. I do not begrudge them that little industry in the sense that they are acting lawfully within the bounds of an excessively generous and ill-conceived scheme which was created by the previous government. They are simply doing what all market profit seekers will do: they are occupying a niche that has been offered-and they are doing it very effectively. But I do not believe that it was the purpose of this scheme to fill the pockets of some of Australia's largest and most powerful corporate entities. This demonstrates the duplicity of the Labor Party now: to get up and criticise this scheme on the basis that it is opposed to the battlers or small business, when the ones who are benefiting from it live in these palatial skyscrapers in the central business districts of Sydney and do not get anywhere near the R&D concern. The analysis further goes on to explain that business expenditure on research and development-and that is the key element; not gross expenditure, not state and federal expenditure, but business expenditure on research and development-grew during the 1980s but continued to remain well below the GECD average. So in 1991-92 only 44 per cent of Australia's research and development was undertaken by business, reflecting only 0.71 per cent of the total domestic product. Clearly, in the long run, if we take a step back and ask, 'Is it enough? Will it do the job for Australia as an economy? Will it give our children better prospects of employment and better prospects of participating in a vibrant, healthy economy?' the answer most certainly is, 'No'. Quoting again from the Industry Commission report: Of more concern however is the fact that the overall number of registrants has been relatively constant since the inception of the scheme, so that this inflow of new R&D performers has not increased the stock of consistent R&D performers. Again, if we go back and ask ourselves the original question, 'Is the policy instrument achieving the policy objective?' we have to say on any objective test, 'No, it's not.' Any minister, such as the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), is under an obligation in those circumstances-it is a basic matter of public policy-to go back, undertake a review and consider ways in which to redirect the resources to achieve the outcomes they were originally created to achieve. I note, likewise, that: For foreign owned companies the net social impact is negative-often substantially so. This is because the benefits from the concession flow outside Australia. So the scheme is doing marvellously well in building up the economies of Malaysia, Singapore, the United States, Germany and Japan; it is just not doing very much for indigenous Australian industry, which I would have thought was a relevant consideration in structuring the policy. I tum again to the comment by the member for Hotham that this government has somehow abandoned its commitment to research because it has introduced reforms to a system which was patently being rorted. I just make the comment that we have to look at the government's commitment to research in the context of its total budget program, not on the basis of its reform to an individual, low performing scheme. If we look at this government's first budget-a historic budget, a budget that is doing the things that most commentators said have needed to be done for the last 15 years-we see that the Commonwealth's support for major programs of science and innovation in 1996-97 is estimated to be at $3.75 billion. Total support for industrial research and development and innovation, including both direct support through appropriations and the 1996-99. estimated effects of tax revenue forgone, is expected to be somewhere in the vicinity $700 million-not, in my view, an insignififor cant amount. The industrial component of for special purpose grants will increase to $154 million from $126 million in 1995-96, a real increase of 19 per cent in support of R&D and innovation in the business sector. We tum now to the START program, which capital is delivering strategic assistance for research and development. One of the key features of the program is its flexibility. It market with a range of different measures: from loans, to interest rate subsidies, targeted grants. That is a recognition that innovative companies do not have a uniform set of needs. They have different sets of needs, so the policy instrument has to be structured to be flexible enough to respond those needs. An extra $340 million is providtargeted ed in this budget, bringing the total funding for the program to $520 million over the next four years. Likewise, the government is extending cooperative research centre program to prosearch. vide for two additional centres in 1997-98. This initiative will strengthen the ability the program to develop links between reand searchers in the CSIRO and universities and users of that research in industry and in the public sector. One of those cooperative research centres will take effective control of the Australian space effort, with responsibility to develop a launch capability for small experimental satellites. Likewise, the CSIRO will receive $60 million for research purposes over the 1997-2000 triennium. The increase will allow the CSIRO to maintain appropriate priority both its national research objectives and the needs of rural Australia. The government's commitment to the fostering of international collaboration in science, engineering and technology is reflected in its ongoing support for a range of programs which will allow Australian scientists to travel around the world and meet with their colleagues under the international science and technology program. We are providing $16.6 million over the three-year period Likewise, the Minister for Industry, Science of and Tourism (Mr Moore) is providing funding research into an alternative equity market small business. This is one of the challenges that small businesses face: access to capital. We find that small business failure is very often caused not by lack of good ideas or good services but by lack of access to in the critical set-up phase of business. We are taking positive, constructive steps to try to increase the access to capital of Australgoes to the ians in small business. We regard small business not only as the to engine room of employment but also as an engine room of innovation. That is why we, unlike the previous government, are not going to allow a rort to continue which just funnels money into the pockets of Australia's largest to corporations. We are producing innovative, strategies that ensure that the resources get to the areas that most need them. It is my contention that it is demonstrably false to suggest that this government is the backing away from its commitment to reIn many areas we are increasing it. We are giving taxpayers better value for the of research dollar, we are eliminating the rorts we are eliminating the artificial advisory industry of bankers and lawyers who fed off the previous scheme. We are treating research as a whole of government task and responding in a diversified, flexible manner to help meet the real needs of innovative industry. In the couple of moments left I just want to touch on some of the future challenges that we face as a nation in this field. In particular, I want to quote from Professor Robert Gregory of the Australian National University, for who produced a chapter on Australia's R&D effort in the book entitled National innovation systems: a comparative analysis. In that book Professor Gregory highlighted the fact that Australia's R&D history had the following features: a low level of science and technology expenditure; a high level of government involvement in financing and undertaking research; a low level of private sector research and development; and an exceptionally high dependence on foreign technology. These are the things that we have to overcome. Professor Gregory went on to identify some of the structural impediments to overcoming those problems. If I can just touch on those very briefly. He said that our success historically as a small, highly productive nation in agriculture and in primary products made it difficult for us to appreciate the importance of high technology. In that regard, I remember Lee Kuan Yew saying that the worse thing that ever happened to Australia was Donald Home's expression 'the lucky country' because it lulled us all into this false sense of security that we did not need to innovate, that we did not need to invest and that we did not need to become more clever. Likewise, he identifies as a second structural feature the fact that our small population with a high wage has led to small-scale, simple manufacturing and made it difficult for us to compete against imports. As a result, there has been a low level of private sector investment in research and development. Likewise, the prevalence of institutional wealth in this country as opposed to private wealth is an obstacle that we have to overcome. The final point Professor Gregory mentioned was the high degree of government provision of business and social services which he described as 'colonial socialism'. He says that a high degree of government involvement in research financing was to be expected and that right from the days of the First Fleet we have had this distinctive dependence on government. This government is making decisions which are going to help us overcome those much more fundamental, deep-seated cultural traits. Nothing has been done in the past IS years to address those needs.

12,Mr CAMPBELL,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"There is no doubt that research and development is an area of great importance to Australia. I find myself a little depressed having listened to the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron). I know nothing of his history, but I will take a punt that he is either a schoolteacher or a lawyer. He had at his fingertips a great number of facts and figures. It seems to me that he has a clear inability to interpret them. To rely on Professor Gregory and Gregory's very flawed analysis is, to say the least, pathetic. There is no doubt that syndicated R&D had become a rort. It was a rort, basically, because brokers were able to take out very high front-end fees. Brokers were making as much out of it as was actually going to R&D itself. This legislation could have been amended, but I think the amendments that the Labor Party put into overcome this simply did not work. Probably the only option was to shut it down, which the government has done. When one reflects on history, Lord Allenby was probably one of the more successful generals of the First World War-certainly in his campaign in the Middle East. Allenby had a view that, if you were confronted with a strategic problem and you simply were not in a position to know the options, the best option was to do nothing. His view was that that was usually best. I think the government is acting because it felt it had to do something and did not quite know what to do. History will show that R&D will drop in this country. It was not at a high base. Any drop is significant and any drop will be disastrous. The government says it is going to fund R&D directly. What has actually happened? Let us examine the situation. The government's Energy Research and Development Corporation was one body that was handling R&D directly and it was very successful. By any measure, the Energy Research and Development Corporation was a successful organisation. It was getting research done and a lot of it was cutting edge research. We were told in the budget that the government was simply removing the ERDC reserves but not affecting its capacity to fund development. The truth is that there is simply no money in the budget for any new projects. The ERDC had committed itself and told people that their projects would be funded. It has now had to go back and write letters stating, 'There are simply no funds for this.' I think that gives the lie to the fact that the government is going to look for other methods. I think that is a great sadness. You have to look at what I call the public perception of R&D. People talk about 150 per cent. A lot of the public actually think that the government is getting 50 per cent more than it spends, which of course is not true. The formula is exactly like this: if a company spend $100, the tax detection is $150. The tax savings at 36c in the dollar-36 per cent of $150-is 54c in the dollar. So they are getting a 54c saving for every dollar they spend, or about half of it back as a tax concession. I think that is not generally understood by a lot of the public. If you reduce this to 25 per cent, it drops significantly. They get 46c back in the dollar; in fact, 9c more than they would normally get in the course of the taxation regime. Given that the minimum entry level is $20,000, the saving on that is $1,800. The fact is that small business is simply not going to spend the time, the energy or the compliance costs to save what is, in fact, a minimal amount of money. It will either bear it itself or it simply will not do the R&D. If you look at R&D, what we had to do was examine the understanding of it. It seemed to me, having looked at this over a lot of years, that the government or the people in DIST had a view that the methods of R&D had to be novel and innovative. What should have always been the criterion, and clearly was not, was that the outcome was new and innovative. A lot of new, innovative outcomes are arrived at by very regular proven research methods. I know of at least one company which was told that because of their good track record with R&D, the fact that their R&D had been very successful, there was really no risk and they therefore should not get the grant. If that occurred in that one company, it was a widespread belief and it was an erroneous belief. What it was basically saying was that, if R&D were novel and innovative and competent, you would get the money regardless of the outcome. That is the fact that led to a lot of waste in R&D. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) said in the budget that our new rates were still very competitive with those of our competitors. This is a fact that is simply not true. R&D can still be funded very readily in Malaysia and Singapore. Malaysia's regime is 200 per cent, and it was always better than ours. A 200 per cent tax regime basically means R&D does not cost the researcher any cash at all. It is certainly working very well for Malaysia. It is simply not true to say that we are still competitive with our neighbours. I suspect the Treasurer knows this. I suspect he is too locked in by the ideological straitjacket of the people in Treasury. One thing may be said of these people: collectively and individually they have created nothing, and they never will. I think there has to be a statement of a philosophical point of view, because the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill that the government has introduced is highly philosophical and ideological. I have a philosophical view that the only future I want for my children is one in a high wage country, a high skill country, a high productivity country. There is no indication at the moment from either side of politics that my children are going to inherit this. It is something that has to be addressed with great urgency. I want to comment on something the member for Parramatta said about the 'lucky country'. When Donald Home coined that phrase, he was being very cynical. Donald Home is not a man for whom I have any high regard, but I think his book did serve a useful purpose. It pointed out that what he really should have said is that we should be the lucky country. The reason we are not the lucky country is, in my view, entirely due to the actions of successive governments, going right back to the Menzies government when this country had enormous opportunity. I remember that things were good in those days, but there was no thought for the future. We allowed our protectionist regime to lead to sloth and incompetence in industry. It need not have been so. There is nothing inherently wrong with protection. It should be remembered that in 1954 this country made far more and far better motor vehicles than Japan. Last year we made 280,000 and they made over 14 million. They always had a protection regime far more severe than ours, and they still have it. The difference was that they owned their industry; we never owned ours. No matter how much we improved the product-and we did improve it-we could not sell it anywhere the masters did not want it sold. The companies, principally General Motors and Ford, were happy to undercapitalise Australian car manufacturing and then to berate Australian workers because they were not getting the same productivity as the Japanese. It was simply impossible. They did not have the capital investment. They did not have the equipment. They did not have the tools to do the job. It is just another example of blaming the victim, which one sees so much in the world today. The government have a view that you cannot pick winners. They are not lonely, because it is also the view of the They hold that view despite the fact that there is clear evidence that countries overseas have picked winners. Japan, Germany and Korea have all been quite successful at picking winners. But you do not have to pick winners. You only have to determine areas where you have a natural advantage or a strategic need, and concentrate on those areas-and that concentrates the mind. The government has said that competition will determine where the new R&D allocations go. It was interesting to hear the member for Parramatta talk about the large percentage that went to the large companies. He is absolutely right-it did. Where you introduce this concept of competition allocation of funds, the large companies will get an ever increasing amount. The truth is that the large companies are not good at R&D. They are not good at all. That is where a lot of the money was wasted. But, with what the government is doing, we will see an increasing share going to large companies. The people who need to be encouraged are those in the SMEs, the small and medium enterprises. That is where the true and valuable research and development is done. But they will not be able to compete under this regime, and you will see an ever increasing amount of funds go to the large companies. I believe there have been many cases where very good R&D has been knocked back basically out of fear-it was seen as too much of a risk. I have heard members speak about the fact that only one in five bullets hits the mark. Quite frankly, in R&D you can operate commercially-and companies in America do operate commercially-on the basis that probably one in 10 hits the mark. One in five, in my view, is a very good strike rate. It is not one that should be denigrated. After all, if one out of the five hits the mark and is a great success, two out of the five were probably marginal, leaving two that were significant losers. But we should not be deterred with the strike rate of one in five. If you want to increase that substantially, the simple solution is to not spend your money on anything that requires any real research or development. By doing that, you minimise Labor Party. your risks enormously. I think we are now in a situation where we have to make a decision about whether we want to be a high wage country, a high productivity country and a high skill country. If we genuinely want that, we have to get a commitment to it-a commitment which is certainly not in the bill and is, sadly, not in any of the ALP policies that I have seen. Despite the rhetoric of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the record of the Labor Party has not been good. I recall being in the Labor Party caucus when Keating said that the future lay in the service industries. Service industries are of course a code for tourism. Tourism, overwhelmingly but not absolutely, means low paid jobs, part-time jobs and jobs for women and kids. It is not jobs for bluecollar workers, but then nobody represents them nowadays, do they? This country that used to produce arguably the best metal trades apprentices in the world now does not. This country that desperately needs these sorts of people cannot get them. In my own electorate of Kalgoorlie, you cannot get a competent boilermaker for love nor money because we as a nation have stopped training them. A lot of the R&D that you see is incremental. That is where the big advances are made; it is not from suddenly getting some brilliant new flash of inspiration out of the ether. It is incremental development-improvement upon improvement. This is the strategy that has made the French the world leaders in nuclear power generation. They took a technology that certainly was not the best and improved it incrementally. Every reactor has been an improvement on the last. That is a bit different from the British policy, where the advanced gas coal reactor was undoubtedly the safest and best in the world but, every time they wanted to build a new one, they put it out for tender and got a new company. So while that method might have meant there were some improvements, it also meant there were some disadvantages, so much so that the British have now abandoned what had the potential to be world leading technology. If we are serious about research and development, we have got to fund it and we have got to find a mechanism for getting that money into the small and medium enterprises. I do not think you can do that with a board. I think DIST was disproportionately overcome with what I call the Indian public service mentality-the idea that you do nothing, which is one sure way of not making mistakes, and you be very cautious about what you do. The area that was successful was the ERDC, but we have seen that area of success cut back. Surely, as I said, R&D is incremental-one should build on one's successes, not throw the baby out with the bathwater. I would urge the government to go back and have another look at what they have done-to go back and realise that what they have done is retrospective because the ERDC had committed money to new projects. Small companies had already spent money on the basis that they were told they were going to be funded. Now it has all gone. That is a direct cost for those small and medium size companies. It is money down the drain directly as a result of the ideology that is inherent in this bill. I would like to be in here praising the government for its actions. I certainly believe that the syndicated R&D as it was had to be stopped, but that does not mean that we should not have syndicated R&D. It would seem to me that the part played by brokers would be one very good area to start reform. There is no facility for R&D money from the large corporations in this country, nor is there any facility from superannuation. Superannuation in my view has been a failure. It will not produce the much flaunted rewards, nor will it produce, as we were told, money for research and development. They are universally short term in their actions and are looking for that 90-day return. I do not like compulsion as a rule, but I would be very happy to legislate to compel large superannuation companies to commit a percentage of their income to genuine R&D. Frankly, I think it would be to their benefit because, if you look at the record, their returns on their investment-that is, the superannuation of the average Australianhave been appalling. In many cases, it has been negative. I think a one in five strike rate in new technology might enhance their return to their shareholders. If the government wants to bring in legislation to direct them in that way, I will be very happy to support it.",31
13,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"The Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill represents a long overdue boost to the integrity of the research and development tax concession. It will ensure that Australian people get better value for money from their R&D tax concession program. The bill will do this by stopping unintended use of the concession and making the administrative procedures better suited to the needs of industry. The proposed amendments give effect to changes to the research and development tax concession announced by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the Hon. John Moore, on 3 June 1996. That announcement confirmed that the government would implement measures announced by the previous government in its Innovative Australia statement of 6 December 1995 with some minor modifications. The R&D tax concessions have always been intended to encourage firms to undertake more research and development in Australia. One of the principal objectives of this policy is to introduce a higher level of research and development than would otherwise have been undertaken. Unfortunately, the R&D tax concession program has been misused in the past. This legislation will protect some $235 million of taxpayers' revenue over the next three years. Over recent years a number of reports, including one from the Industry Commission, have suggested that there is significant scope for the government to improve the efficiency of the R&D tax concession. It was noted in the research that some companies would only undertake R&D to provide themselves with a substantial tax concession. only 15 per cent of the concession is provided to companies venturing into new and innovative research and development. These companies practise what has been commonly known as 'gravedigging'. This is where the company uses accountants and financial advisers to sift through old company records seeking out expenditures undertaken in previous years. As the member for Bowman (Mrs West) said, sometimes these 'sifters' go back as far as 1995 to search out company records which could be classified as eligible for R&D concessions. These companies then receive the tax benefit and the accountant or financial adviser would receive a percentage of the deduction obtained. In short, these companies were driven by tax advantages rather than the goal of pursuing innovative research and development. These amendments provide for advanced registration of organisations undertaking eligible research and development expenditure. This will put an end to gravedigging because companies will be required to lodge their application with the Industry Research and Development Board within six months of the end of the relevant year. Advance registration of activities will encourage companies to direct their creativity towards new technologies and markets. Consistent with the previous government's announcement on 6 December 1995, there will be no new registrations for expenditure incurred in the 1992-93 and earlier income years, irrespective of when those applications were made. The government has already allowed for a one-off transitional period of six months ending on 7 June 1996. During this time companies can continue to submit applications for registration in respect of the tax concession for 1993-94 and the 1994-95 income years. These changes will ensure that retrospective access to the tax concession is curtailed to a reasonable period after the research and development activities have been conducted. This amendment returns the program to its rightful focus of encouraging new research and new development rather than encouraging companies to 'trawl' for tax It is estimated that sweeteners. A new provision will set fees for application or request to the board. These specific changes have been introduced to bring the administration of the research and development tax concession into line with the selfassessment principles of tax administration. These include reducing the obligation of the Industry Research and Development Board prior to registering a company and introducing the ability to set fees by regulation in relation to application and request to the board. Amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act require a company to register for each year of income those particular R&D activities which it wishes to claim a deduction for with the Industry Research and Development Board. Access to concessions will be confined to a reasonable period after research and development activities have been conducted. This means that the tax concession program can return to its rightful focus of encouraging new research and development. The scope of this misuse of the R&D tax concession program is so extensive that our measures are expected to result in a protection totalling $235 million over the next three years. The Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill introduces a number of amendments designed to facilitate better administration of the R&D tax concessions. The government remains committed to ensuring that there is support for genuine R&D. The government will ensure that such assistance is delivered in a cost-effective manner and that opportunities for abuse and rorting are eliminated. The aim of the bill is to stimulate the performance of R&D which could not have been undertaken in the absence of government subsidy. I commend this bill to the House.",34
14,Mr MARTIN,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"There is no doubt that the legislation that is before the parliament today, the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill, is worthy of thorough and in-depth consideration. I would like to respond to a couple of the comments that my friend the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) made in respect of R&D, particularly about apprentices and training and how, regrettably, in Australian manufacturing we have seen almost an absolute tap tum-off in the training of apprentices. I agree with him. I represent the great industrial heartland of Illawarra. We have had a concern for a number of years now that, regrettably, the major players in the heavy industry environment of the Illawarra have not seen fit, for a variety of reasons, to train apprentices in the numbers which they clearly need. To take the example of big business and BHP, when we came into government in 1983, after a period of some seven years out of government, the IIIawarra was faced with a very hard decision. BHP seriously contemplated shutting down steel industry production in this country. It is a well-known fact that they were seriously talking about getting out of steel and just being in minerals, energy, oil, gas and so on. It was the former Hawke government which actually stitched up in 100 days the steel industry plan that saw the steel industry in this country saved. Not only was the steel industry saved: the plan has meant that productivity has increased and we are now world competitive. BHP itself has expended billions of dollars on modernising its plants around Australia, particularly at Port Kembla. We have seen pollution levels dramatically reduced in cities like Wollongong in the Illawarra as a result of this expenditure. We have 'also seen a reduction in the number of employees directly employed by companies such as BHP. In 1983, 26,000 people were employed by BHP in Wollongong. Today that figure is closer to 6,500. You can imagine the effect that that had in the Illawarra over that period. I have said something about that in speeches in this place in the past. As part of putting in place improved technology, as part of that process of there being an industrial revolution impact on the Illawarra, we have seen the number of people employed drop off dramatically. Regrettably, we have also seen the number of people who were trained as apprentices and who were taking advantage of the R&D programs that might be there to assist drop away. BHP took decisions in the middle and late 1980s that they needed to downsize their operation, and they offered voluntary retrenchment schemes to people. The people the who took those voluntary retrenchments were the skilled craftspeople, those who had been trained as boilermakers and so on-the people the member for Kalgoorlie mentioned. What we did not see happen was training to replace those sorts of people. Of course, BHP suddenly realised that they needed to do something about it, and we have seen them actively revisiting those programs. Sadly, there is no doubt that R&D in this country has not led to some of the major benefits that we would like to see. On previous occasions I have heard the member for Kalgoorlie and others in this place talk about the lead time between when somebody invents something-taking advantage of R&D products that might be around or programs that are in place-and when you see something manufactured. There is a view within the manufacturing sector in Australia that unless you see a return on investment within a period of 12 months people are not going to take the risk. Australian business people are not prepared to have long vision. They are not prepared to look at the far horizon in terms of the time they carry out R&D; the time when the process has been finetuned, the time when the process is put in place; and the time when they start getting a return for capital investment. That is one of the sad things about this country. I think it says something about the so-called entrepreneurial class in Australia that they are not prepared to look at the long term horizon, as they do perhaps in the United States, and as they certainly do in Japan and Korea. People in those countries know that you do not get instant recognition. They know that you do not get an instant return for the capital that you invest. They are prepared to wait to see those processes that are developed through R&D programs come to fruition. As I said, in Australia, regrettably, that simply is not the case. One of the things which is part of this whole area of R&D and which needs to be considered is access to capital for the manufacturing process once R&D has been completed. For the many companies which are prepared to expend funds on R&D processes and the individuals who dream up a brilliant idea in the shower one day and then go about trying to work out how it should be put in place, the next phase is trying to get capital so that the idea goes from R&D to facilitation to manufacture. Regrettably, financial institutions in this country have been very backward in coming forward to give support to Australian industry for that process. This is a simple fact of life. Going back a few years ago to the depths of the recession in the 1980s, our caucus looked at the available opportunities to provide access to capital for manufacturers. I am pleased that the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) is here, because this goes to his area of responsibility. We suggested that those massive amounts of capital which existed in superannuation funds be directed towards industrial production. When R&D was completed and small and medium sized businesses-which the member for Kalgoorlie also referred to-needed to get access to capital, they simply could not get it. The banks were not there, the financial institutions and the financial intermediaries were not there. They were not prepared to take a punt. They were - ot prepared to give some comfort to industry III the development of those processes and in taking it from the R&D phase through to manufacturing. It is something which our side of the House chose not to pursue when we were in government. I honestly think we should have. I was a member of the caucus committee that looked at this. I said at the time that we should look at ways in which superannuation funds could be forced to provide some funds for the manufacturing process after R&D had been completed. I will conclude my brief contribution here this afternoon on this very important subject. I am now surrounded by a number of speakers on our side of the House who want to get a tum, and they have prepared speeches. I will just say that this is an area of great significance, particularly to a manufacturing region like the Illawarra. R&D is an area where people think up important and innovative ways in which manufacturing processes particularly might be extended, and it needs support. What they do not need is a government coming along and cutting out funding for R&D programs. They do not want to hear a government saying, 'Industry will look after industry.' I am sorry to have to say to the government that that simply is not the case: industry will not look after industry. These are often people in small and medium sized operations who need access to and the support of government funding. I simply commend to this government that they revisit this issue. I think it is part of their overall budget strategy. It is something which may come back to affect them in the future. Our industrial and manufacturing bases are slipping-there is no question of that. If we are to build on the concept of being the clever country and if we are to revitalise our industrial and manufacturing bases, people need to know that there will be funding and support from the government of the day-irrespective of political persuasion-to give support to their endeavours. I ask the government to give consideration to that fact.",36
15,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"I am indebted in more ways than one to my friend and colleague the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) for his very erudite exposition as to the importance of research and development to the IIlawarra. While he concentrated on the Illawarra, he did briefly touch upon two very important factors that go to research and development in Australia. One is providing incentives to Australian companies for research and development and the second is access to finance to develop Australian ideas here. Having checked that the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), who follows me, is in the chamber, I am not proposing to go over the ground that the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) covered comprehensively in their contributions to the debate on the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill. Suffice to say that, on this side of the House, we support the bill in general terms because to a very large extent, subject to one matter, the bill effectively implements measures announced in the previous government's innovation statement. The one matter that we have reservations about we would be happy to see referred to the relevant Senate committee for consideration. The bill cannot be viewed in isolation because, viewed in isolation, it would give a massively and comprehensively wrong and incorrect view as to what the government's attitude to research and development is. The government's attitude to research and development needs to be viewed in the context of the measures it has taken in the budget. When you talk about research and development there are two obvious divides that one can draw attention to. One is our public sector research effort and the second is our private sector research effort. This bill goes to our private sector research effort. So far as our public sector research effort is concerned, Australia has always done, internationally, very well in the public sector research effort that it makes. In particular, applies to the CSIRO. I was in the chamber when the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) was making his contribution. He used the word 'disingenuous' which, I must confess, is a word I have used in this House before. I must say, so far as public sector research effort was concerned, that the Treasurer (Mr Costello), in his budget speech, gave an entirely disingenuous account about the government's attitude to public sector research. In his speech he said that CSIRO funding had been increased in the order of $114 million, which met the government's commitment to CSIRO triennium funding. What he deliberately did not say in his speech was to not advise the House that, when you looked at the fine print of the budget, what you found was that the efficiency dividend applied to CSIRO took off precisely that amount to the dollar and to the cent. So if there have been any disingenuous contributions in this place on research, it has been the Treasurer's and the government's deliberate disinformation so far as their approach to CSIRO funding is concerned. This measure is about private sector research and our private sector effort. Historically, Australia has made a very poor contribution to private sector research when that is judged internationally or judged against some relevant countries in the OECD. The efforts that the previous government made to try to raise that private sector research effort had, as one of the centrepieces, the R&D 150 per cent tax concession-that has changed over the years but was effectively made permanent, from memory, in I 992-93-and the introduction of the syndication measures which were introduced, again from memory, in 1987. The effort that the previous government made to try to raise a quite small contribution of private sector research was through the 150 per cent taxation concession measure and, coupled with that, syndication. The coalition, in the course of their election commitments, under the heading 'Research and development tax concession', pledged: Changes to the syndicated research and development tax concession scheme guidelines may well result in the drying up of one of the few effective forms of venture capital available in Australia to that fund research and development. And a separate quote: Maintain support for R&D through the ISO per cent tax concession. What they have done is reduced the permanent 150 per cent tax concession to 125 per cent with no indication whatsoever that that will be permanent. Their commitment-which I have referred to-to the drying up of one of the very few forms of venture capital availraised able in Australia to fund research and develthe opment has been to knock it off. The argument that they are using to knock this off is to say, 'There's a rort here, we've got to knock it off.' We have made .it very clear on this side of the government and now, that we are also in favour of ensuring that rorts do not occur. the notion of knocking off an incentive to the private sector which helps research, which helps development, which helps develop Australian ideas here and which helps our elaborately transformed manufactures producrather tion and export-the notion that there rorts to be knocked off here-is also an argument that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) has used for knocking off the export market developjobs. ment grants scheme, reducing the funding the scheme by some $426.3 million over years. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade is reported in the Australian on 27 August, a week after the budget, in an article headed 'Export aid cuts target rorting', as saying: The need to stamp out rorts and direct from professional consultants to small exporters were the motives for big Budget cuts to a export program, the Minister for Trade, Mr Fischer, said yesterday. Mr Fischer said he W'lS not prepared to let the 'open-ended feeding of white-collar crime' continue under the Export Market Development - ra.nts scheme, which suffered a four-year $343 cut in last week's Budget. David MCKenzie and Natasha Bita from the Australian got the $343 million figure wrong but they got the rest of it right. actually examine what has occurred III the export market development grants scheme over the period that has been in operation you find that prosecutions for fraud or investi.gations for fraud have accounted over a sustamed period of time for about one per cent .of the appropriations in that area. Just as III export market development scheme you throw the baby out with the bath water, you use rorts as the excuse for cutting a decent program, so they do it here. The member for Hotham has consistently questions in this House and outside for government to show where those rorts are occurring, where there are rorts which have not previously been closed off or where there so are not commitments on both sides of the House to close them off. So the rort argument House, both m is basically an excuse. When you come to look at the effectiveness But of the 150 per cent taxation concession, what is the rationale here? The rationale here is to give Australian companies an incentive to do research, to give Australian companies an incentive to develop Australian ideas here than seeing them developed offshore. are Why do we do that? If you develop your Australian ideas here, you ensure that you make a positive contribution to growth and you make a positive contribution to Australian In the end, this is about providing an of incentive to Australian companies to ensure four that employment in Australia grows and unemployment is reduced. There has been a range of analyses of the 150 per cent R&D concession over the years. In 1995, the Industry Commission brought down a report on this matter. The member for Cunningham might be able to disabuse me of funds this, but I have never known the Industry Commission to be soft on an incentive to an key Australian company. On the contrary, I have heard from time to time the Industry Commission described as the 'industry abolition commission' which, given some of the reports from the Industry Commission I have read, ITI1lhon would not be far wide of the mark. What did the Industry Commission have to say in 1995 about the 150 per cent tax concession? The Industry Commission concluded Whe? you in its 1995 report that: ""the 150% tax concession has brought net benefits to the Australian economy"" ""removal of the concession would lead to a reduction in GDP"" ""the 150% tax concession be maintained"" the What the Industry Commission is saying is that the maintenance of the 150 per cent taxation concession makes a positive contribution to growth and therefore makes a positive contribution to jobs. In 1993, a couple of years earlier, the Bureau of Industry Economics also did a report on the 150 per cent taxation concession. The BIE came to the following conclusions: . .. the concession clearly contributes to increased technological innovativeness, and is likely to contribute to increased since the concession was introduced Australia's business expenditure on R&D (BERD) doubled-the average annual growth rate of 14% between 1981-89 was the fastest of any OECD country That, in my view, gives the lie to the notion that the 150 per cent has not been an effective or successful incentive. The BIE went on to report: innovativeness-the share of innovative products in sales-increases with R&D intensity 23% of companies surveyed by the BIE reported that the concession had been critical in their decision to proceed with R&D projects in the preceding 3 years 50% said that their R&D expenditure would have been lower if the R&D deductibility were reduced from 150 to 100% the estimated net social return was found to be positive in respect of Australian-owned companies Just as the Industry Commission did, the BIE recommended the retention of the concession. So we have the Industry Commission in 1995 saying that this is helping to produce growth in the economy and helping to produce jobs. We have the BIE saying that this is helping the Australian economy, this is helping to produce jobs, this is helping to produce growth. We have the coalition in the run up to the election committing itself to the retention of the 150 per cent taxation concession for R&D. What do we find? We find a broken promise. Why do we find a broken promise? The truth is that those on the other side do not believe in providing incentives to Australian companies to do research. They do not believe in providing incentives to Australian companies to develop Australian ideas here. In their heart of hearts, they do not believe in growth in the economy. In their heart of hearts, they do not care whether there is growth in the economy and therefore jobs or whether unemployment rises. Members of the House may have seen the budget response by the MTIA, which was issued about nine days after the budget on 29 August. In the MTIA's budget response, under the heading 'Risks and Challenges' the competitiveness MTIA states: In the medium term, the challenge for the Budget is to generate higher growth, and through this, more jobs and better living standards. The preponderance of 3 plus forecasts for growth until the end of the century, clearly fall well short of what is possible if we harness more of our resources to the task. 4 plus growth must be our goal. That is unambiguously correct. It is clear when you look at the budget forecasts, even if you do not form the view I have, that recent statistics and recent events will knock the budget forecasts for growth and employment down and unemployment up, and that four per cent growth is the minimum you need to ensure that you do get some improvement in employment and unemployment. What is one of the things that can help lead to economic growth? Australian companies developing their ideas here, producing elaborately transferred manufactures and exporting them. The MTIA, in the course of their response, were very critical of the cutting of the range of industry support programs and incentives to industries for trade and export enhancement, because this R&D attack ought not to be viewed in isolation. I have referred to the export market development grant schemes but the litany of sins is long. There is lTES. There is lAMP. There are the Asia business feJIowships and Asia business links. There are also the bounty schemes-the shipbuilding bounty, the computer bounty, the book bounty. All of these things which provide incentives to Australian companies to export are all cast aside and just as the 150 per cent R&D was a broken eJection commitment, so are they. The MTIA went on to refer to the quid pro quo of cutting industry programs. This required a range of things, one of which must include a culture that values innovation and success in the global marketplace. If you value a culture that values innovation and success in the global marketplace, how can you stand and argue that the 150 per cent incentive for research and development ought to be considerably downgraded? It is a massive downgrade. The cut to research and development in the budget is in the order of $2.2 billion. Mr Martin-How much?",37
16,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,$2.2 billion. Mr Martin-No!,41
17,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,I assure the member for Cunningham that it is true. Mr Martin-Even after what I said about the Illawarra?,41
18,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"Even after what you said about the 111 awarra. There is a $2.2 billion cut to incentives for Australian companies to research and develop here, to get growth in the economy and to provide jobs. Mr Martin-This is a pro-job government, is it?",41
19,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"No, this is the anti-job government. This is Jobless Johnny's first budget. That this governmerit will pretend on the one hand to support the notion of jobs and growth and export but do something entirely different in the fine print of the budget is found in the transcript of the interview with the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) on the Face to Face program of Sunday night. On one of the rare occasions he mentioned trade or exports, in the course of his interview he said: There are changes, there are industries which are expanding rapidly, there are export industries, high tech fenies being exported to the world expanding absolutely rapidly ... What he did not tell the Face to Face program was that the shipbuilding industry in Australia is these days almost exclusively an export industry. If they are not building them in Western Australia, they are building them in Tasmania. They are aluminium, light, fast ferries. The market is almost exclusively export. What does the government do? It knocks off the shipbuilding bounty. This represents a consistent course of conduct by the government. They are not in favour of research and development, they are not in favour of developing Australian ideas here, they are not in favour of ensuring that Australian companies do better in elaborately transformed manufactures, they are not in favour of Australian companies exporting more, they are not in favour of growth in the economy and they are not in favour of jobs.",41
20,Mr WILTON,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"It gives me great pleasure to follow the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), one of the finer contributors to debate in this House, a man who goes by the initials SS. Contrary to popular belief, that does not stand for 'seldom seen'. I rise to join with my colleagues in supporting the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill. On the surface, the message contained in this legislation may seem to the world to be simply of a housekeeping nature. It is not particularly controversial in any major way and, given the support from both sides of the House, perhaps indicative of the shared philosophy and practice of government between the two parties. However, I believe that the bill we are debating here today and the issues that are involved, their history and future prospects, go to the heart of the difference between the two sides in both philosophy and approach to economic policy and specifically to industry policy. The 150 per cent research and development tax concession was introduced back in May 1985 by the then Labor government to address concerns that Australia's economic growth rate was suffering due to a less than optimal investment in research and developthe ment by Australian businesses. The tax concession scheme was implemented and designed to boost Australia's international competitiveness and innovation through encouraging increased investment by companies in research and development. This was to be done by maximising the use of existing research infrastructure, by improving conditions for commercialising new processes and product technology developed by Australian companies and by developing greater capacity for the adoption of foreign technology. The R&D tax concession effectively provides firms with a subsidy which they can use either directly or by utilising a syndicate arrangement with other taxpayers. Syndication, which was introduced back in November 1987, was a major and important progression in the development of the tax concession as it allowed groups of companies to form syndicates to undertake projects which would have too high a level of risk or would be beyond the capacity of any single or individual firm to pursue. In fact, a survey by the Bureau of Industry Economics showed that up to 70 per cent of research and development conducted under syndication would not have occurred without this syndication facility. As with any scheme of this nature, its workings and effectiveness have been reviewed over the years. Where appropriate, changes have been implemented to review and improve its functioning. In line with this, the previous Labor government announced in December last year as part of its innovation statement a number of changes to the operation of the scheme and to the eligibility of companies able to apply for this scheme. The key changes in the innovation statement included limiting the ability of firms to obtain a concession for previous expenditure, refining the definition of what constitutes eligible research and development to qualify for the concession, and enabling applicants for the concession to register for future research and development projects for up to three years. This, of course, would enable them to more effectively plan their ongoing and future investment in research and development. That was part of the innovation statement, a major document and major initiative of the then Keating government of late last year. These changes were designed to improve the viability of what was widely recognised by businesses of all sizes as a highly beneficial scheme. The bill before us today is in the most part based on the refinements suggested by the previous Labor government and, to that extent, naturally earns the support of the opposition. One issue of a somewhat technical nature that does merit further consideration the amendment proposed by the government to close off access to the concession for applicants for the 1992-93 income years and earlier who were not registered prior to 6 December last year, even though they may have lodged their applications before that date with the Industry Research and Development Board. This provision would appear to be grossly unfair and, equally, unjust. I understand that at least one company lodged an application for the tax concession with the IR&D Board at least six months before the proposed cut-off date of 6 December last year. For some reason the IR&D Board did not register the application prior to that date. Even though the application was lodged in accordance with the guidelines set down by the relevant authorities but was not formally registered by the board, the company would be ineligible to receive that tax concession. Clearly, this is a very harsh and unjustifiable position for the government to take when the particular company in question no doubt acted in good faith and has been the victim of nothing less than bureaucratic incompetence. The provision needs considerable examination before it can be passed into law. I certainly support the bill and this particular provision being referred to the appropriate Senate committee for further investigation. I would like to return to some comments that I made earlier when I spoke of the fundamentally defining nature of this bill and the broader issue of industry policy and how it demarks the underlying thrust to that policy between the opposition and the now government. The Labor government introduced the 150 per cent research and development tax concession in 1995 because we both believed and accepted that there was a strategic role-a very important role-for government to play in working with the private sector to develop our industry for the benefit of us all. Research and development play a crucial role in the development of industry per se. No doubt, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) has gone into some detail as to the benefits of R&D in his beloved area of the JIlawarra. That role, whether it be in the IIIawarra or is the broader Australian business community, is not about picking winners. It is not a heavy-handed approach. We believed then and we still believe now that governments have a pivotal role to play in ensuring that the best economic conditions exist in which our businesses can flourish through building a strong and enduring base from which they can branch out into export markets. The analysis of the Metal Trades Industry Association, which the member for Perth has referred to-he referred at some length to their response to the budget issued some two weeks after the budget was tabled in this place-stated the need for the government to produce an environment for business in Australia which includes 'a culture that values innovation and success in the global marketplace'. Whether through the provision of high quality infrastructure in transport and communication, through establishing an industrial relations system which encourages harmony and productivity rather than conflict and division or through simply recognising that Australian firms have a competitive advantage over their international rivals through their access to and use of both technology and innovation, government has an obligation to ensure that the conditions that are necessary for a healthy and growing economy are set in place. This is central to the beliefs of those of us in the Labor Party and it is why we are here in the nation's parliament. Of course, the Liberal Party and those opposite have a diametrically opposed view to the one that I have just espoused. It clear that their role of intervention in the economy goes to a question of a labour market division between employees and employers and, of course, withdrawal of many of the tax concessions which thrust Australian businesses headlong into research markets upon which the future of this country so vitally depends. That has become increasingly obvious, even in this government's short time in office. The coalition made it abundantly clear during its recent election campaign, through its industry and commerce policy statement, that it would maintain support for business expenditure on R&D through the 150 per cent tax concession. Unfortunately, the government's penchant for breaking promises included this one. This is one of the many that we can add to the growing list of broken promises-one of the many acts of betrayal that have been perpetrated on the Australian community by this government. I have no doubt that the views of the Australian electorate in regard to the many broken promises of this nature will be reflected at the ballot box during the next election. Now we are faced with the prospect of a reduction in the tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent, despite a promise being submitted to the electorate by the government during the election campaign. This also goes to the abolition of syndication on the spurious and disproved basis that syndication was being rorted, a claim again made this morning by the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) and a claim that those on this side refute and those on the government side have yet to substantiate. The lame and rather half-hearted justification of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) for the decision was that the incentive remains among the most effective in the OECD and compares more than favourably with concessions provided to our regional neighbours. Yet, as somewhat of a tax expert, Mr Rudolf Werner makes clear that the reduction from 150 per cent to 125 per cent will have a significant and detrimental impact on the viability of industry to thrust itself into export markets, upon which, as I say, this country is quite will depend to increasing degrees. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 22 August this year, he said: The benefit at 125 per cent is marginal. What industry is saying is that ""we'll do what we are going to do anyway but we certainly are not going to do more R&D."" What is even more strikingly hypocritical about the government's decision is that it will be the smaller companies that spend a greater proportion on R&D than the CRAs and the BHPs that will be the hardest hit. It is this government, of course, which claims to be the protector of the interests of small businessanother one of the many urban myths that is being perpetrated on the Australian electorate, and one that those on this side of the House will be actively ensuring is dispelled in ensuing weeks. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) knows perfectly well what goes to the very core of this broken promise; in his own words, he said that the measure will help the government to meet the challenge of reducing the budget deficit. That is what is driving this decision-nothing more and nothing less-and that is the basis for the coalition's approach to industry policy. It is the primacy of the fiscal bottom line. The government's economic philosophy goes no further-not an inch further-than the simple and discredited view that the only role for government in the economy is to get out of it, leave it alone, let the market prevail. It believes in cutting spending to the bare minimum-this is seen by the government as one of its reasons to exist-privatising everything and leaving the market to fend ruthlessly, and in a very much unfettered way, for itself. This view is not shared by industry. We have ample evidence of this in the response to the government's proposed changes to the R&D tax concession which have flooded the media since its announcement. The Chairman of the Co-operative Research Centres Association, Dr Mark Sceat, made it clear that the reduction in the R&D tax concession would make it very difficult for industry to create both wealth and jobs through innovation. Dr Sceat said: There is little in this Budget to indicate that the Government understands the need for policies which encourage investment in high-risk, highreward ventures ... Australian industry's investment in R&D is still below OECD averages and this limits Australian industry's ability to commercialise R&D outcomes. Of course, we still run that very great and ever-threatening risk to commercialise R&D outcomes. These quotes are from the Australian Financial Review of 22 August. The much revered President of the Australian Academy of Science, Sir Gustav Nossal, in the Sydney Morning Herald of 21 August this year, on the government's going back on its promise to maintain the R&D reduction level, said: The 125 per cent is a bad decision which we hope at some later time might be reconsidered The vitriolic attack on the changes to the R&D tax concession scheme from Robert Gottliebsen in this week's edition of the Business Review Weekly should be sufficient evidence for anyone that the coalition government is sadly out of touch with the needs, particularly the expectations, of Australian business, large and small, in an ever-more complicated, challenging and competitive global environment. I can assure Sir Gustav Nossal and Australian industry that the Labor opposition will take all necessary steps to ensure the continued functioning of what has been one of the more successful government schemes to assist business of recent times. Whether it be through supporting the measures contained in this bill to tighten up the scheme's administration or through opposing the reduction in the tax concession rank from 150 per cent to 125 per cent and the ludicrous abolition of syndication, the opposition, based on our proven better understanding of the concerns and issues facing our own Australian industries, will not hang businesses out to dry, as this government seems absolutely hell-bent on doing. I commend this bill to the House.",41
21,Mr ROCHER,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"The Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill sets out to deal with several minor anomalies in the principal act, and for that it is unobjectionable. For example, it validates internal review decisions and overseas research and development decisions taken outside the 90-day period prescribed in the act. Given that this mandatory time period is far to be made discretionary at the option of the applicant company, there is no reason to oppose the amendment. However, this legislation does fail to deal with the problems and concerns at the core. No-one disputes that we need to get the most out of our research dollar. What is debatable is how that is to be best achieved. The government's objectives, in announcing the axing of the syndication scheme and its talk of reducing the general tax concessions from ISO per cent to 125 per cent, are twofold. The first objective of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is to minimise tax expenditure-in other words, to enhance the total revenue take. The second is a motivation to crack down on those companies the government believes are legitimately creating wealth for themselves without considering the net benefit of their activities to the Australian economy. They are valid considerations, but there are pressing concerns. In an article in the Australian earlier this year, Ms Vivian MCCarron, the research and development tax specialist at Coopers and Lybrand, made the following observation: · .. history has shown that without some form of tangible government assistance, Australian investors and corporations tend to be unwilling to put money into research and development. Ms MCCarron's comments, while accurate, are not new. In May 1996, the Warren Centre at Sydney University made a similar observation in its report on the research and development concession. It said: · .. the tax concession becomes an underpinning program amongst all of the other comparative advantages to carrying out R&D activities in Australia and a critical cost/risk reduction factor for companies in their decision making process and investment strategy development. In short, syndication and the general research and development tax concession emerged as the driving force behind innovation in Australia. The research and development syndication scheme was introduced by the previous Labor government in 1987. It was a recognised and sanctioned method for financing new research and development through the transfer and early utilisation of tax losses. The present government defended its decision to shut down the syndication scheme on 23 July this year by saying: · . . the current arrangements . . . have become focused on tax minimisation rather than the provision of genuine R&D. That is at odds with the comment made in an industry publication only one month earlier, in June. The chairman of the IR&D Board said: What was once viewed simply as a tax shelterhe is talking about syndicationis now recognised as a bona fide funding mechanism generating valued R&D for Australian industry. Many independent industry organisations have championed the success of the syndication scheme while at the same time acknowledging that there were problems in its early stages. The government has made much fanfare in the media with talk about syndicate rorting, yet its own report discloses that only five of the 217 syndicates examined revealed questionable taxation arrangements. Furthermore, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) admitted in an ABC radio interview on 24 July that none of these questionable syndicate arrangements would have been approved under the new guidelines that were introduced in November last year. The government has become obsessed with the so-called rorting of the schemes, or at least it is a smokescreen. Yet the calculations it has used to support its jaundiced view are based on syndicates which would not have been approved under the November 1995 guidelines. This surely makes redundant the government's claims of widespread abuse of the system. The issue of rorting also brings into question the credibility of the Industry Research and Development Board and the Australian Taxation Office. If poor legislation and management have allowed a small number of companies to manipUlate the scheme, why should all genuine research projects be jeopardised by abandoning all or parts of the concession? Why? Surely the Treasurer will remember criticising the former Labor government on its decision to impose the fringe benefits tax on employee share plans. In November 1994 he told the House: ... if you have a hole in the tax net, you go out and fix the hole and catch the sharks but you do not haul in the dolphins ... This was the Treasurer in another incarnation. Where is the consistency in the Treasurer's policy decisions now? The 1994 report of the Bureau of Industry Economics was, until recently, the only one to have been sponsored by the Commonwealth to specifically focus on the cost and merits of syndication. It endorsed the credibility of the program and it identified a number of key outcomes of syndicated research and development. It said that syndication helped embed a commercial focus in R&D programs and that it was responsible for inducing significant new research and development activity in the companies that use it. The Warren Centre study into research and development syndication detailed 21 benefits of the scheme. These included benefits to the researcher, the taxpayer and the investor. It stated that one of the most important roles syndication had played was in the inducement of new research and development. It found that, between 1989 and 1993, syndication was responsible for 23.8 per cent of induced research and development. The government has chosen to ignore these findings. Instead, it has bandied about a figure of $1 billion, which it claims will be saved as a result of abandoning syndication. The government has failed to point out that this figure ignores the savings to revenue arising from the tax losses given up by the researcher. Syndication really only represents a timing difference from a tax revenue perspective. It offers immediate benefit to the investor rather than future relief to the researcher, but the government said that it aims to replace the syndication scheme with a system of loans and grants. This aim is despite the fact that the administrative cost of obtaining grant assistance has proved a barrier to such industry schemes in the past, as highlighted by Ms MCCarron. Because grants will not consume existing tax losses, it is also acknowledged that on a dollar-for-dollar basis they are more costly than the current indirect tax incentives offered to industry. In its discussion paper on the possible replacement programs for syndication, the government indicated that under a grants scheme: Applications would be assessed to direct funds the best projects. Obviously neither the Treasurer nor the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has read or taken any notice of a submission from the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry entitled 'Submission on government assistance to industry'. This report quite clearly demonstrates that the government should not attempt to pick winners when providing assistance to industry. The chamber's report says: Picking winners is the central role of business, lending institutions and stock markets . . . It is difficult to envisage a situation in which government ministers, or public servants, will be better able and qualified to assess a business's prospects than the market. Yet this is precisely what any number of grants schemes encourage. The Industry Commission report of 1994 also indicated that syndication brought forward research and development and, therefore, improved the chances of commercial success of an innovation. In other words, by fast tracking innovation and commercialisation, syndication increases the taxable revenue from those involved-although admittedly later. This would further offset the initial cost to government revenues under the syndication scheme. The challenge before the government today is how to maximise interest amongst the investment community and increase its commitment to funding research and development in this country. The axing of syndication, the proposal to introduce a grants scheme in place of syndication and an overhaul of the definition of the general concession suggest that the current government is hopelessly out of touch with the needs of industry. The former shadow minister for small business, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), said in October last year: The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) would be better advised to focus on Australia's small businesses ... a good place to start promoting an innovative culture within Australian industry, and small business is right in our own backyard. What a pity the coalition is not heeding her to pre-election words. Syndication allowed several companies to form a commercial alliance for the sake of research and development where the risks were too great for a single entity to take. Small and medium size businesses stood to gain from syndication, along with the big end of town. But the axing of the scheme will adversely affect the ability particularly of small businesses to innovate, expand, employ and invest. Is it any wonder that the small business community is 'rapidly losing confidence in the government's ability to deliver an improved economy,' as reported in the most recent Yellow Pages Small Business Index? The government should be encouraging a change of mind-set in our investment community towards research and development. Claims that Australian business has not contributed to research and development in the past are fallacious. In fact, 92 per cent or $3,136 million of the total funds used for research and development in the year 1994-95 came from business enterprises. By contrast, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that government expenditure accounted for only $90 million or less than three per cent of the total funds made available for research and development in that year. The budgeted figures for 1995-96 indicated that the federal government's $63 million assistance to research and development amounts to only 1.5 per cent of its total spending on assistance to industry. It is worth comparing that figure to the $96 million pledged to sport and recreation and to the $97 million to film and television in the same period. What should be of concern to this government is the low rate of business expenditure on research and developmentBERD, in short-in Australia compared with the OECD nations. In the year 1994-95 Australia's BERD represented only 0.74 per cent of gross domestic product. This was less than half of that of anyone of the following countries: Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Germany, France and Finland. This is not a reflection on the quality of Australian research and researchers, but it does highlight the gulf that exists between the Australian scientific community and the investment community. Dr Kate Grenot commented on this issue in an interview given to the Australian Financial Review in July this year. She said: Syndication provided one vehicle for funding and reconciliation of startups, traverse rough, diverse terrain. The Australian scientific community, with few exceptions, has little idea about how to commercialise its inventions. This is not unique to Australia but, unlike other developed countries, including the United States, little attempt has been made here to bridge the gap between the scientific and investment worlds. Neither the previous Labor government nor the coalition appear to understand that a coordinated business process is necessary to achieve this. Technological advances are essential to ensure that Australia remains competitive in this era of global innovation. Such advances are characterised by lengthy and expensive lead times. Talking still about Australia, Dr Grenot suggests: Tolerance of research and development 'failure' is low, investment time horizons are short. The outlook continues to be bleak for high risk, albeit high potential, start ups. Perhaps one exception to this rule has been the Australian mining industry. Australia currently leads the OECD in research and development intensity in the steel and iron business, 'intensity' being terminology, I understand, for comparison between industry turnover and research spending. This is a reflection of the commitment the marketers have made to funding research and development in mining on a long-term basis. Why we have not been able to replicate this standard in other industries escapes us. Such a possibility will be threatened, of course, by the axing of syndication and talk of redefining the general concession, especially as the government has failed to come up with a viable alternative. The research and development concessions have been plagued by a lack of stability and longevity from the start, because of the shorttermism of the former government's approach. And yet industry groups, including the Chamber of Mines and Energy and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have said: Government funding for R&D shoulp be predicated on defined long-term policies to enable continuity and stability in the research effort. Such stability will assist in providing suitable infrastructure and attracting and retaining the best researchers to the but was never built to industry. Ms MCCarron suggested that the glaring omission in the R&D debate is the need for greater stability and a clear and sustainable policy. She also stated that consultation with the relevant parties was the only way to forge a viable long-term business plan for Australian research and development. The government should have opted to sit tight for a period of six months before making a decision on syndication and the general research and development concession. That would have allowed all industry participants to have had some semblance of meaningful discussions with the government and to contribute to a long-term plan before it took its short-term decisions. Instead, the government's actions have been checkered and underhand in this regard. Up until 23 July this year, the minister for industry was still writing to researchers encouraging them to pursue their applications for syndication. In one letter dated 22 July, the minister said: I understand that the assessment process for your syndication application has recently commenced ... I wish you the best of luck with your project. Within 24 hours, the minister announced the end of the syndication program. One of the most surprising and unjust aspects of the government's handling of syndication is the retrospective nature of it. I say 'surprising' because the Treasurer is on record as saying that he believes retrospective taxes are odious and wrong in principle. Perhaps this is an ominous example of selective application of policy by the Treasurer.",44
22,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"This legislation, the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1996, has been brought forward by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) in relation to R&D research and development concessions from the government and processes and procedures for syndication and the like. I want to use the opportunity to introduce into this debate the whole question of industry policy and particularly, later on in my speech, as it affects steel and iron making. The major issue facing Australia essentially is jobs. Jobs, of course, come from economic activity and economic growth, but only in certain kinds of areas. We have seen in this last decade and more an absolute revolution in the Australian economy. We have seen a more than doubling in exports of mining products, iron ore, coal and the like, but a reduction of 10 per cent in their work force. We have seen a more than doubling of agricultural products with a very slight increase in their work force. We have seen a 400 per cent increase in manufacturing exports with a very slight reduction in their work force. So what has been going on has been an enormous shift in the nature of our economy, and it has been driven by government policies. The previous government sat down and tried to work through with the community, with business leaders, with the scientific community, with workers, what we needed to do to change the nature of our economy and the nature of work in Australia. That revolution has had enormous implications. It introduced changes to people's lives, to their work, to the whole nature of awards, of workplace restructuring, right across the board. Through that process, it undoubtedly undermines to some degree people's stability and their confidence in their long-term future. We saw that insecurity focused on and manipulated in the last election, and that is still being done today. However, what is being done today is even worse. The structure and ethos that was created and developed by the previous government to encourage the restructuring of the Australian economy is now being wound back. It is being reversed. The shift in R&D write-offs basically says to business, 'This is a rort.' We have heard the business rort argument over and over again. These are the people who were supposed to be supporting business. Basically, they are saying to business people, 'The concessions that were there to try to shift the nature of investment, the nature of activity, the nature of work, to try to change the business culture in Australia, were all rorts and had to be cut back. The people who were using them were cheats and frauds.' That is what is being put forward. That is the message going out to the community and to business. No wonder they do not have confidence in the future. More importantly, the R&D tax write-offs, the depreciation regimes, the infrastructure bonds, the development tax concessions for major developments, together with export market development grants and dozens of other focused and targeted schemes, were aimed at restructuring the nature of the Australian economy. There has not been one complaint from the business community or the economic community about the direction of those policies. No-one is going to argue that they needed to be applied rigorously and that some people might misuse them and that, whenever that occurred, they should be fixed. No-one is going to argue with that. Now there is a massive repudiation of that whole direction. That is going to lead to companies reviewing their corporate strategies in the light of these changes. If the government is going to change all the rules, then companies are going to review their policies. I want to focus on that in what is happening with BHP, iron ore and steel making in Australia. In recent weeks, the minister declined to reissue the terms of reference for the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I have never heard of a minister declining to reissue a reference for an inquiry commenced in a previous parliament. In the last parliament, we had initiated an inquiry on major projects. As part of that inquiry, we visited Port Hedland and talked to BHP about its hot briquetted iron development which, incidentally, as a major project is a beneficiary of the development tax concessions. This $1.5 billion plant will produce iron of 94 per cent to 96 per cent purity which is aimed at export but also as a feedstock for the new electric arc furnace that is proposed for Newcastle in 2002. With the new parliament, the parliamentary committee met and resolved to continue that inquiry. We already had submissions from organisations, from the Western Australian government and from a number of other bodies. We had had a hearing in Perth which was very productive. However, the minister has declined to reissue the terms of reference. He has not said he will not, but we resolved before we got up in the last session to ask for those terms of reference to be continued, and the message coming through is that that is not being supported. Why not? What is wrong with this government? The people who have made submissions and who have not yet been able to address the committee are now being wiped out. I raise this issue because a few weeks ago I wrote to the chairman of the committee and suggested that, given the nature of what is occurring, there is a need for us to look more closely as a country at the whole process of iron and steel making in Australia. The fact is that at the moment there are five or six companies all looking at adding value to iron ore, particularly in Western Australia, and one of them is BHP. There is no doubt that the Western Australian government welcomed the idea of that inquiry and the fact that at a national level we were considering policies that affected iron and steel making. I wrote to the committee and we discussed the need to make sure the inquiry focused on iron and steel making as part of its broader scope of national projects because the iron and steel industry is fundamentally important to this country. We are a major exporter of iron ore, we are a major exporter of gas and we are a major exporter of coal, all of the ingredients that are required for adding value to iron ore and for making iron into steel. We are a minor exporter of iron and steel. If one looks at the figures for the last five years, if one looks at the actual shift in exports from Australia into Asia, we find that the increase in Australian exports in recent years into Asia has gone up 400 per cent, which sounds terrific-from 0.7 million tonnes to 2.8 million tonnes-but at the same time we find that exports from Latin America into Asia, particularly from Brazil, have gone up 800 per cent to eight million tonnes a year. We are not able to compete with Latin America in a market which is very close to us, the fast-growing market of Asia. We should know why that is. We should know how much we are doing to shift our value adding to iron ore. We should know how companies are approaching it. Are national policies appropriate and suitable; and if not, why not? This is a major national issue but we cannot talk about it because the minister will not re-issue the terms of refercompany ence. Quite frankly, I am sure that some companies do not want to talk about it either. I focus now on BHP because it is quite possible that what is good for BHP may not be good for Australia. BHP is now a transnational organisation trading globally in a diverse range of products ranging from energy right through to manufactured goods. It is a major supplier of iron ore but it is also a maker of steel and an exporter of steel. The question of compatibility of BHP's interest and the national interest is one that is mentally important. It would be beneficial for this country if there was some public discussion and understanding. There is an article in today's Newcastle Herald regarding the future of BHP Steel, particularly in Newcastle. Quite frankly, most parliamentarians do not follow the steel or iron industries very closely. They should, because there are few things which are more important to our economy and to the way we do things than our iron and steel making industries and our iron ore exports. The fact is that almost IV2 years ago BHP announced that its future in Newcastle involved the building of electric arc furnaces 2002 and the closing down of the existing blast furnaces. The feedstock for those blast furnaces could likely include hot briquetted iron out of BHP' sPort Hedland plant, then on the drawing board. However, just a short time ago we had an announcement by BHP that it would be reviewing its total approach to steel and that Mr Ron MCNeilly would undertake that major review. The article in this morning's Newcastle Herald that I referred to was based on a report from the stockbrokers, MCIntosh and Co., and quotes extensively from Mr MCNeiIIy. The analyst involved, Ms Prior, discussed these matters with Mr MCNeiIIy. His comments in that article have cast great doubt on BHP's future development in Newcastle. The BHP of today was built on the basis of the steel plant in Newcastle. It was the first steel plant established in Australia early century, in 1915. That changed BHP from a miner at Broken Hill to a major national in manufactured goods. The profits from the BHP Newcastle plant allowed BHP to get into a range of other places and products-Port Kembla, iron and gas and eventually, as I have said, allowed it to become a major international organisation. Back in 1982 BHP made its announcement that the future of that plant and the future of steel was in doubt. The incoming Labor government in March 1983 committed itself to a steel plan. Enormous effort went into ensuring the future of the steel industry in fundaAustralia and BHP made a major investment in its plants across the country. But a major investment was also made by the BHP work force in Newcastle. If we look back to the late 1970s and through until now, we find that the work force at BHP has reduced from over 11,000 to about 3,000. There has been a massive change. Between 1983 and now there has been enormous industrial harmony. The cooperation of the work force with management on what was good for the company and what was good for all of them has been absolutely superb. Yet we are finding these comments being made by Mr MCNeilly which are not by being made in conjunction with any other discussion. I think that there is going to be some disillusionment about that approach. Newcastle has been very good to BHP. The city has actually responded and cooperated enormously through the company's periods of difficulty. We are prepared to do so again-if we are consulted and if we are well informed. But what is happening here in terms of these remarks is and must be disturbing. The whole question of industry policy and steel development is going to plague this government while ever it pursues a path of reduction and sees industry policy in the sense of business rorts or non-business rorts. It is going to plague this government while ever this minister refuses to allow inquiries into major projects incorporating iron and steel making. It is going to plague this government whilst it tries to play up industrial relations as being part of our problem or as this causing those kinds of problems. BHP Newcastle's downsizing and restructuring and productivity gains have not been done through some new legislation from the conservatives but through cooperation between the work force, the unions and management. We do not need all this rhetoric from those opposite about creating work through industrial relations change. What we need are decent industry policies where companies are prepared to invest in their future. The fact is that, if BHP goes ahead with what is implied in Mr MCNeilly's comments about the future of the Newcastle plant, we can start to wipe out BHP as a major player in steel technology. The technology of the future is with directly reduced iron-whether it is from BHP or a range of other companies making itgoing into arc furnaces and making high quality steel and thin, flat products. A range of technologies in the rolling area of production is going to transform the nature of steel making worldwide. The integrated plants will be seen in 20 or 30 years time as dinosaursthey will have no future. So the future of Port Kembla is going to be very limited. The development of the Newcastle plant which was being proposed was the way that BHP could stay at the leading edge of technology in steel. The size of the plant is important, and the use of HBI and the capacity to produce new steels and steel technology and steel science are fundamentally in that area. The benefit of that to this country is of enormous importance. The benefit of it to BHP in the short term may not be that great-and I am certainly interested in hearing what its views are on that. But, in the long term, it seems to me that BHP would be giving a message to the world if it pursues this strategy that it will eventually move out of steel and pass over to Smorgons or anybody else the steel making via scrap or whatever other method might be available. Looking at that in context, the HBI plant being proposed at Port Hedland by BHP in one sense is relatively small. At 21h million tonnes, it sounds big, but when you keep in mind it exports out of the same port 55 million tonnes of iron ore the value adding that is being proposed at Port Hedland is actually for a fairly small amount of its existing production. Newcastle has been good to BHP. We have played a strong role because it has been an important part of our own development. We expect BHP to maintain its commitment to Newcastle. Leaving aside the articles, I think that Mr MCNeilly has been unfortunate in making those comments because of the interpretation that has been placed on them. But I expect that BHP will keep faith with the people who kept faith with them, not just in Newcastle but in the nation as a whole. Any indication that BHP is backing off in steel science and technology and leading edge technology in Australia would be disastrous to the national interest. Mind you, they could well say the R&D tax write-offs have been a major issue to them, and they have been. BHP have used them extensively, and so they should. That is what they were there for. The fact that they have been reduced could be part of the reason for BHP's corporate thinking as to how much they are prepared to invest. The message from the government is that they will be reduced even further in the years ahead. If you look at what has been put forward by the government in incentives for business to invest in new technology and research and development and depreciation and all the other areas that make up that whole economic investment framework, then BHP may well simply be responding to what is a very clear message. Do BHP see themselves as a business rorter? I do not think so. That is not the message they have ever given. They see themselves as being a good corporate citizen. They pay very high levels of company tax, if not the maximum level. This is not a company that has actually tried to 'do it nasty'. Perhaps what they are seeing, and that they need to factor into their corporate strategies, is a change of government policy away from the incentives that changed the nature of our economy. This legislation, plus all the other messages from the government in conjunction with BHP's processes, is very threatening not just to Newcastle steel making but to national steel making and I suggest many other industries.

23,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) really does not have his heart in this measure. I was interested in the contribution of the honourable member for Bowman (Mrs West), a member of the Queensland Liberal Party and close to the operation up there. I thought we might see some of the guiding principles behind this move. What we had was a contribution with the usual slogans about Labor's words and the need for deeds, the slothful inaction of the previous government, comments that statistics mask realities, Labor's penchant for doom and gloom, that Labor had done things too late, they had been too slow, et cetera. In actual fact, the minister concerned does not really have his heart in this measure. He is essentially being dictated to by other elements in the government. I think this is part of the image problem he has in a variety of areas where Australian industry needs protection. Steve Lewis in the Financial Review comments on another area of portfolio responsibility: It has been more than six months since the change of government. While most of the post-election focus has been on the budget, suppliers to the Commonwealth can be forgiven for thinking Mr Moore, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has lost focus on what is considered a central plank of coalition's industry policy. Mr Lewis concludes: In any case, Mr Moore and his department still have to run the gauntlet of Treasury and Finance which traditionally resist any attempt to link industry development with the procurement process. What we have is a very serious suggestion, which will undermine Australian industry. We can dream about level playing fields; we can dream about spontaneous action by the corporate sector; we can believe that somehow there is venture capital out there. But the sad reality is that, when government members today cite statistics about Australia's lamentable position, I think we have to go back historically and say that in 1985 when these kinds of measures were introduced there was a very real need. What we are seeing, as other members on this side of the House have commented, is a very worrying departure from the commitment the government gave before the election. We know that in the science and technology policy they said: Changes to the syndicated research and development tax concession scheme guidelines may well result in the drying up of one of the few effective forms of venture capital available to fund research and development. If that is not an endorsement of the process, I do not know what is. Back in September last year, we had other statements of support for R&D. In a paper put together by the parliament's research service it was stated: In the September 1994 statement, the Opposition has also claimed to have made a big commitment to support basic research and infrastructure. Noting trade opportunities, it stresses the need for a clear, long-term strategic approach to S&T. The Opposition proposes to further encourage industry investment in R&D, to ensure world class basic research through better facilities ... They were fine words, but the reality today is that they are condemning Australia to the problems it had before 1985. In 1985 Labor moved towards a variety of measures-tax concessions, direct grants to industry R&D, concessional loans for commercialisation of innovation, sectoral industry developments in a wide variety of areas such as automotive, textiles, pharmaceuticals, food, IT, aerospace, the national research facilities program, Australian Technology Group, cooperative research centres and Auslndustry-designed to tackle Australia's lamentable position. Peter Roberts, in an article in the Financial Review of 1 August 1996, said: Commercially oriented innovation, as measured by business expenditure on R&D (BERD), grew by 12.5 per cent a year between 1981 and 1993, the fastest growth rate in the OECD. BERD is now the equivalent of 0.71 per cent of gross domestic product, close to triple the level of 1981 when it languished at 0.25 per cent of GDP. We have a situation where there are obvious problems still with the level in this country. Whether it is to do with a fragmented industry structure, the domestic focus of companies, hangovers from the tariff situation or bad management, the reality is that much research and development essentially depend on finance from outside the country by corporations that might not see it in their interests to undertake that here and, I guess, our long term reliance on minerals. They have been problems that the government faced back in that period. In an article in Science and Public Policy in June 1989, Mark Dodgson said: Both Australian and foreign owned or controlled industries show an R&D intensity well below the median for eight OECD countries: and the three industries with R&D intensities nearest to the country median were ferrous metals, paper and printing, and wood and furniture. These are ... low technology industries. Even after changes-which, I think we all understand, appreciate and agree, improve the performance-R. Slatyer in Search of January-February 1992 could still remark: Australia has been a low performer of R&D in high, medium and low technology sectors, both against OECD performance as a whole, or in relation to specific areas. The rate of increase 1983-89 in real terms compounded has been among the fastest in the OECD and it continued to grow during 1989-90. Despite this performance, the growth was from a low base, so that in 1989-90 it was still only 0.52 per cent of GDP. Since other countries have also increased their performance, Australia's remains close to the bottom of industrial R&D performance of OECD countries... The importance of government support for this progressive improvement should be noted. We did have a crisis of lack of effort. We did have a crisis in comparison to OECD countries. We had a situation where, in the context of our having a high proportion of Nobel prize winners, having a high degree of original inventions and having those kinds of advantages, there was still no delivery. Labor initiated a process with this particular scheme back in May 1985 and made it a permanent feature in the 1992-93 budget. In the November 1987 syndication processes we see the nub of one aspect of what the government is attempting to change today. There has been a series of investigations which has basically upheld the positive side of these schemes. In a 1994 analysis, the BIE suggested that there was a distortion in regard to syndicates, but it gave an overwhelming endorsement to the broad thrust of the need for these schemes. To give some idea of what is involved here, in a report entitled Future needs 2010, the Australian Science and Technology Council stated that economic growth through R&D could contribute $60 billion over 10 years to the Australian economy. We thus are looking at a series of schemes that are crucial to this country. Industry reaction to what the government is doing has been very diverse. Not only people involved at the end which the government questions, and accountancy firms that might eight- be involved in facilitating syndication, but also a wide variety of companies are concerned with where this government is going. The orbital engine was one example that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) was quick to publicise his involvement with. That company has questioned the abolition of syndication. That company has questioned what this is going to do to its future. It is all right to run around with the Ausfrom tralian flag and give out free photos of the Queen, but Australians are questioning why the government would undermine a company like that. This company has been in the forefront. It is actually sponsored by the minister. Its product is deemed worthwhile to put into government vehicles. The government has been involved in the road testing. Yet, five minutes later, that same company is saying that this series of decisions is undermining where it is going. Mr Rudolf Werner, a research and development tax specialist, was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald of 22 August as saying: Your after tax benefit on R&D expenditure now falls from around 18c in the dollar to 9c. The benefit at 125 per cent is marginal. What industry is saying is that 'we'll do what we are going to do anyway but we certainly are not going to do more R&D'. That is the other end of the spectrum. Technology Resources Australia, in conjunction with the major syndicate financiers-Bain and Co., Bankers Trust and Macquarie Bankfound that every $1 spent on the 50 pending syndicate applications would generate $2 of private R&D expenditure. Nina Field's article in the Australian Financial Review of 19 August 1996 stated: Research and development syndicates caught in an administrative backlog when the Government scrapped syndication last month would create about $218 million worth of R&D over the next two years if they were allowed to go ahead, according to analysis released yesterday. That analysis was by Technology Resources Australia. Graham Carew, the director of R&D services at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, commented that the budget: ... might as well have contained a plane ticket to South-East Asia for Australia's innovative ogy projects. How much stronger a statement can anyone make as to where the thrust of the government will lead? Essentially, it said we are transferring Australian innovation, Australian scientific discoveries, Australian technology, Australian production possibilities to South East Asia. Mr Ian Holland of Digital Ideas-a computer graphics hardware and software producer which spent over $430,000 on R&D during 1995-96 and employs eight of its 25 staff specifically for research-in the Age of 2 September 1996 was quoted as saying that it was implicit in the government's decision that it did not value R&D companies or understand the long-term benefits of supporting them. That is not exactly a mild comment. It is not exactly equivocal. It is not exactly giving the government a second chance. That approach is typical of a wide variety of companies that, along with a significant number of analysts, are saying that this decision condemns Australia to the problems of a decade and a half ago. Peter Roberts said in the Financial Review of 27 August: Australians, and especially those who drafted last week's federal Budget, seem to have a peculiarly dated idea of the role played by science and technology in a modem economy. The Budget as it affected innovation was very kind to the basic scienceand even within science there is some debate as to the government's expenditure there, with help for the CSIRO but undermining in other facets of scienceend of the innovation spectrum and harsh on applied development. Readers need hardly be reminded that Australia performs well by international comparisons at the 'R' end of R&D but is only a medium-level performer at the 'D' end where real wealth is created. So what we have there is a significant spectrum of people who are very much asserting that the variety of measures the government is undertaking essentially to decrease the tax concession down to 125 per cent, under the subterfuge of concern with rorts, undermined the syndication aspects. We all know that the minister admitted, as quoted in the Financial technol- Review, that maybe he was wrong in the initial statements, that maybe most of these supposed rorts were actually picked up in the review process, in the process that looked at the proposals. On 1 August 1996 on ABC radio Mr Moore appeared to backtrack even further. Asked by journalist Matt Brown why the government was not prosecuting rorters, Moore replied: Well, they've been knocked back in the research and development committee which do the research and evaluation of the various projects. This less critical view of syndication is backed up in a 1996 report on the scheme prepared by DIST but erroneously referred to by the government as a report of the Bureau of Industry Economics. The report surveyed 163 taxable syndicates and found 158 were genuine and only five were pseudo-schemes. So what we have here is an attempt by the government to cut back on its responsibilities by utilising the occasional, rare rort in this system to undermine a system that has essentially been defended by Australian industry, a system which reviews have shown is on balance very worthwhile to industry, worthwhile in promoting this country internationally. Moreover, the minister has said that most of those rorts that he is going to utilise as an excuse for these changes would essentially have been picked up in the process. We do know that over the period of Labor government there has been, as I said earlier, a variety of schemes to essentially encourage Australian industry, to make sure that research does attempt to match OECD changes. This is a country which is desperately on the back foot with information technology imports and the hardware imports in that field, a country which, as the government tells us so often, has such a difficult trade future, a country which has for many decades had a very big difficulty with the delivery of R&D. It is being undermined very seriously by this government in a wide variety of research and development areas. At the same time, we will see essentially attempt whatsoever to look at other industries in Australia that do have difficulties, to go back to a pattern of industry assistance, industry plans, that are obviously necessary. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) has been making plane trips around Asia to say that there will be no halting, no slowing, no ifs and buts about Australia's push to be the leader on tariff reduction. He is out there trying to make sure that his name is up in a lot of neon lights on tariff reductions, saying that there is not going to be any equivocation. But what this government is doing is essentially leaving Australian industry with a utopian kind of concept of a level playing field. The country's interests are seriously undermined by the suggestion that we should halt this syndication and at the same time reduce tax concessions. They can talk all they want about their budget problems, they can talk all they want about rorts, but the reality from all surveys that have been undertaken on this is that it was a net contributor. Yes, there have been increases by other OECD countries; they have been increasing their research and development at the same time as we have. Yes, we are still desperately behind the pack. But the reality is that those inquiries of Australian industry, those surveys of what they think have shown that, fundamentally, investment would not have been made and research would not have occurred unless schemes like this were available. I commend the opposition's position on this matter.",51
24,Mr MOORE,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"in replyI wish to thank all the members who have taken part in the debate on the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1996. Certainly, for a very narrow bill it had a remarkably wide application. I was surprised at some of the contributions that were made--even going so far as to suggest that there are going to be changes in the Labor Party's industry policy, which I thought was very interesting. I hope that is going to the right-wing faction as well as the left, so we can look forward to reading in the newspapers about the contributions of the member for no Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) at the caucus meetings. Essentially, what is the bill about? Listening to most people here today, you would be flat out understanding it. The seeds of the bill go back to the innovation statement of 6 December 1995, brought down by the previous government. Honourable members would remember that rather cobbled together, press release sort of statement that came out. At that stage of the game the Labor Party clearly knew that there were problems in the system, otherwise it would not have attempted to bring it under control. The essence of this bill, as the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) said, picked up the previous government's proposed bill. The most important part of it is to go about the elimination of gravedigging. Gravedigging is not only a political pastime for the Labor Party. In relation to this particular area, it was a feature devised by some accounting people to go back into corporate accounts as far as 1985 and to redefine certain expenditures as research and development, thereby creating an additional tax deduction, depending on which classification it came under. This was an enormously expensive pastime. It took up hundreds of millions of dollars of tax and had a very adverse effect on R&D because it had already been done. So it certainly was not related to the government's policy at that stage. When we proposed this bill we came to a proposition to redefine gravedigging so that it could no longer take place. It would no longer be going back in history but it now forced companies to lodge applications with the R&D committee no later than six months after the relevant financial period. I will read from the press release put out earlier this year by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and me: affirm the announcement by the former Government that there be no new registrations for expenditures incurred in the 1992-93 and earlier income years, irrespective of when application for such registration may have been made ... - in respect of years of income ending after 6 December 1995, taxpayers may lodge applications up to six months following the income year in which the expenditure was incurred; and - taxpayers may also lodge applications for registration in respect of the, 1993-94 and 1994-95 transitional years of Income at any time before 7 June 1996 , , , This clearly ended gravedigging. The previous government stepped into ,close off ,that part of the area which was being explOIted, and this bill picks that up and brings it through. The government also said that we need to review and have a look at what was going on, and we have done that. What was going on in gravedigging was a retrospective view of research and development. We have brought a focus to it which looks forward. No longer can you go back and say, 'What I did in the past might have been research and development.' You must plan your research and development now and lodge your application within six months of the end of the financial period, and then you are in the general focus of the play. So all the talk that went on beforehand rather missed the point of what went on, Mr Lath am-You are a grave filler.",55
25,Mr MOORE,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"Thank you for saying so, I will have to refer to other sources. Taking some of the points mentioned by the member for Botham, he raged on over all the areas and you would think that he invented it. When I read what he had to say later on I wondered whether the member for Botham had really read the innovation statement of 6 December 1995, that cobbled together piece. Be was so busy shovelling out the money for those labour programs to keep them out of the unemployment queues during the election campaign that he probably had not read it. Mr Crean-I have read it.",56
26,Mr MOORE,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"If you had read it you would probably have woken up to this particular point. When they decided to move on 6 December 1995, somehow or other there was 'loose lips' around the place because between the period of 1 December and 6 December, 250 applications were received when the daily average had been 10 a day. A good old leak occurred somewhere around the place. I do not know where it occurred as there are some pretty high livers in the Labor Party. It might have been around the Flemington racetrack or it could have been out on a yacht with some other people, or things like that. There was certainly a leak, there is no doubt about that. When you have 250 applications flock in in five days after the average was 10 a day, something must have happened. It is worth reading what the Labor Party statement said at the time, and this is something that the member for Botham had probably forgotten to read when he was shovelling that money out. It said: However, a number of claimants have been using the scheme in ways which either do not support the new R&D or are driven by artificial tax. devices with disproportionate costs to the taxpayer relevant to the R&D sponsored. That is what I was saying and what the Treasurer was saying about it. Apparently the member for Botham had not read it because he was trying to say that these rorts did not occur. There were no rorts according to him. The member for Reid was in there defending those rorters too. That is a bit of information for him as well. There are three current AFP investigations going on into syndicates or proposed syndicates. That is not a bad effort. Mr Crean-What about the 'A' list?",56
27,Mr MOORE,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"These ones are on the police list. Anybody who comes around here saying that there were no distortions or ro-s in the system is simply not aware of what IS going on. One of the most important aspects to remember in this is the appalling administration of the Labor Party. Not only were there leaks there but one leak got out and 250 applications roared in in five days. When we came into government the department down there was absolutely at a standstill. They could not process stuff. They even had a police investigation going on in the department into what was going on with the R&D position. Syndicates were being investigated and there was a police investigation into the department. They were at a total standstill while they were looking around for the leaks that went on. I am not surprised that they talked about everything else under the sun but what was in the bill. It was a disgraceful performance. From that position the government moved, after much effort, to clean up the act and on 23 July it moved to end syndication. That was purely in line with policy because the objectives of the government were not being achieved by the syndications. The scheme was mainly directed towards financial outcomes rather than research and development outcomes. As the member for Hotham said, the government makes a very significant contribution to R&D but the private sector has always been quite a bit behind. Mr Crean-Yes, but it lifted under our",56
28,Mr MOORE,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"You were going backwards according to the figures that I have here. We are down to 19th position out of 23 on the OECD list. The member for Hotham is still shovelling out the money. It is no wonder that he has not had time to read all of this and has not caught up on where it all got to. To outline a couple of reasons why the syndication came to an end, it was an unstable scheme in every respect and it had a history of a loophole followed by an amendment, followed by a loophole, followed by an amendment. As a consequence of that, it became far better known, as I have said, around Sydney and Melbourne for tax deductions as the way to go than any other area I knew. Everybody knew it except the government apparently. It was one of those extraordinary things. Even the tax concession committee associated with the IR&D Board were pessimistic about the future of syndication. So it went. I am as aware as everyone else that Australia is most dependent on pushing research and development as a vital part of industry policy. It is a vital part for Australia in the future. replace it we have the START program. The START program is $340 million over four years in grants, loans and interest subsidies. When you roll that in with this current scheme, you have $520 million over the four years to go towards the implementation of research and development which is essentially in the loss making company area. As a consequence, we are right at this moment holding consultations with industry to ascertain the most appropriate guidelines to get the best results for money. In the consultations we have had so far, we have been very warmly received by industry. I am confident that the start-up position can be readily found in the very near future. I thank the members for their contributions and commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Moore) read a third time. STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 September, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time.",57
29,Mr LATHAM,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill contains the cuts of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to state funding. They are the cuts that he said would never take place. He said that not only before the election but, interestingly enough, after the election. It takes a special kind of deceit, it takes a special kind of treachery, in public life to break promises made not only before the election but after the election. Before the election in March the coalition said that they not only would maintain state funding but would produce a guaranteed share of Commonwealth revenue in state grants. They broke that promise. This bill is part of To the litany of coalition broken promises. But not only that, after the election on 12 March the Treasurer had a press conference when he said he was revealing the state of the Commonwealth books. He said at the press conference that he would not in any fiscal consolidation program be reducing general assistance grants to the states. He has broken that promise as well. It really is a unique occasion in the standards of public life and honesty for the Treasurer to break a promise made not only before the election but after the election. That, of course, demonstrates that any talk of a black hole in the federal budget was really an excuse, really an alibi, that the coalition tried to establish by which they could break promise after promise after promise. Even when the Treasurer had the books in front of him, even when the Treasurer was conducting his press conference on 12 March, he said: I made it clear during the election campaign that our purpose was not to cut general assistance grants to the states. He confirmed that promise 10 days after the election, on 12 March. It is interesting to understand the psyche, the standards and the morality of Mr Costello in breaking promises, not only before the election but after the election, because he really is the role player in Australian politics. They put 20c in the back of his noggin and he wheels himself out, playing the role. In question time it is doggy on heat. Now, with these backflips at the Dremiers Conference and on the infrastructure bonds, it is the circus doggy. He is playing the role of circus doggy-backflip after backflip after backflip. He wrecked the Premiers Conference earlier this year. Mr Moore interjecting",57
30,Mr LATHAM,DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism knows these things. He sees the role playing. He sees the 20c go into the back of the Treasurer's head; out he goes, role playing. It is doggy on heat in question time and circus doggy when it comes to the backflips at the Premiers Conference, the big backflip on infrastructure bonds, plus breaking promise after promise. What does this add up to? It is more than a question of political morality. It is more than a question of standards in public life, it is more than an issue of basic, core honesty in Australian policy. It has a big impact on the states. These swingeing cuts to the states for this financial year-and the out years, of course-have a profound impact on state services and a profound impact on state budgets, so much so that the states are being forced to introduce their so-termed 'state Costello taxes'. So state services have to be cut as a product of these broken promises, promises broken before and after the election, and state taxes and charges have been increased. The government stands condemned for that and no-one in the Australian publicno-one in New South Wales, Victoria or any of the other states or territories-should be blaming their state government or their territory government. The blame rests with Mr Costello. They are his state Costello taxes. They are his broken promises-made before the election and broken, made after the election and broken again. The service cuts have their greatest impact on health. Approximately $800 million will be cut from public hospital budgets at state level over the next four years-$320 million explicitly in the budget itself, plus around $460 million flowing from the reduction in general purpose funding now before the House. But this is a government that is saying that there is some problem in Australia's public hospitals. If there is a problem in Australia's public hospitals, and Australia's health system, is the answer to take $800 million from states grants and state public hospitals and then, having taken $800 million out of the public system, to hand $500 million directly to the health insurance funds via the government's flawed tax rebates? It proves that the coalition is not opposed to welfare. It is not opposed to handouts as long as they go to the big end of town. It is not opposed to welfare as long as it is for big business. It is not opposed to handouts as long as they go to the big end of town, and in this case they are bloating the already excessive reserves of the private health insurance funds. There is no crisis in the private health funds in Australia. There is no crisis in the private health insurance system. I feel like repeating until I am blue in the face that there is no crisis. There is no crisis other than that generated by this government. There is no crisis, other than by a government that is willing to rip $800 million out of the public hospital system to put $500 million of transfers into the already bloated reserves of the private health funds. There is no crisis even though, if we examine what is happening in private insurance, we find that it is true that they have lost members. Yes, that is absolutely correct. They have lost members but for a very good reason. The private funds have lost members because those funds have not offered decent value for money. Here is a party that says that it is pro-market, it is pro-choice, it is proprivate enterprise, so it must understand that if you do not offer value for money you lose customers. That is exactly what has happened to the private funds. They have lost members because they have not offered decent value for money to members from those premiums. Younger, healthier people have dropped out of the funds; they were essentially paying premiums but not using the health services. This trend may have reduced profits and reserves in the short term for those funds, but it has not diminished their contribution to paying for health services in Australia. Expenditure on health services matters. It is expenditure on health services, service utilisation that matters in the Australian health system, not the rate of insurance-insurance which in many cases is not being used. That is why people opt out of the private health funds. They have not been utilising their insurance.",58

32,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the budget forecasts which estimate growth in wage and salary earner employment over the next three years of 5.3 per cent or an additional 363,000 jobs. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that those forecasts offer substantially less employment growth than actually occurred in the last three years-which, on the same basis, was 9.7 per cent or 608,000 additional jobs? Can the Acting Prime Minister explain why the government expects a reduction of 245,000 in employment growth? Can the Acting Prime Minister explain to the best of his ability the government's plan to fight unemployment by creating fewer jobs?",59
33,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I begin by explaining to the House what happened when Mr Beazley was appointed Minister for Employment, Education and Training in the period of 27 December 1991 to 23 December 1993. You spoke too soon, my friend. The number of people unemployed during the period when you were minister increased by 34,444. The unemployment rate increased from 10.4 per cent to 10.6 per cent. The long term unemployment rate increased by 95,100. The long-term unemployed, as a percentage of total unemployed, increased by 28.1 per cent to 37.4 per cent. The cruellest of the lot: during the period that you were minister for employment-or unemployment-the youth unemployment rate increased from 30.2 per cent to 32.2 per cent. It is a circumstance which really means that you should hang your head in shame for even daring to ask this question. Of course the government has a comprehensive approach to boost jobs. This is in part embraced by the settings of the budget overall and by the specific programs that Minister Vanstone, Minister Kemp and others are pursuing. Further to that and specifically in relation to jobs, whether it is in dealing with the domestic industry, the manufacturing industry, the service industry, the primary industries or beyond, it is an absolute truism that the net effect of the trade policies of this government will be to expand exports, to boost trade, investment and tourism and, by that, to create extra jobs. So the minister for employment of yesteryear, now about to become the longor shortserving Leader of the Opposition, has much to answer for on this very score.",59

39,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade. What is the significance of the memorandum of understanding signed last week in Indonesia by the ASEAN group of nations, AFfA, and the CER nations-Australia and New Zealand? What other issues were raised in that meeting? An incident having occurred in the gallery",60

41,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is pleasing to see that the member for Richmond has friends in the galIery because he lost my friendship on the tennis court this morning 8-6, as I recall.",60
42,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If he encourages disorder in the gallery, he will lose my friendship, too.",60
43,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Richmond for his question. It was a very important 36-hour visit to Indonesia to meet with the CER. I attended all sessions of the conference and a number of bilaterals in addition. I have sympathy for any minister who is struck down during these visits, including ministers from your side during previous visits, when schedule problems and stomach problems preclude attendance at all sessions. This is the first memorandum of understanding that the ASEAN free trade area, AFfA, has signed with any outside body. So the connection with Australia and New Zealand CER is the first that AFfA has had with anyone outside the ASEAN nations. The MOU is a concrete manifestation of the progress that has been made by the Howard government in forging closer links between our respective trade areas since coming to office. It builds on the first meeting which took place in Brunei last year. It is tangible evidence of the capacity of this government to work constructively and in a business-like way to produce real opportunities for business. The MOU opens the way for detailed discussions at achieving a high level of standards recognition between the two trade groupings and, in doing so, wilI in time cut Trade the cost of doing business between these CER nations and AFfA. Significantly, the MOO will also make Australia an insider in AFfA through the participation of Australian experts in ASEAN's technical groups that are developing region-wide standards. In addition to that, there is a number of other issues. We canvassed putting in place an onward business dialogue-and that has been supported strongly by Australian business leaders who attended with me in lakartawith additional consultations; and reaching agreement between AFfA and the ASEAN nations, on the one hand, and CER on our viewpoint on labour standards in respect of the forthcoming meeting of the WTO to be held in Singapore in December. Four other specific areas have been advanced which did flow from the original meeting in Brunei, and I acknowledge that. I want to say that this government is getting on with the job of economic engagement with Asia in a very practical way, and we will deliver outcomes. Unemployment",60
44,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Isn't the increase by 27,000 in the long-term unemployed over the last four months due to the government's decision in May to freeze labour market programs, including skillshare funds, and then hack away $1.8 billion from labour market programs in the Prime Minister's no jobs budget? Will the government reverse the decision to cut these programs? If not, isn't this the reason why unemployment will increase to nine per cent by Christmas? What will the government tell Australian families in December, when Christmas unemployment queues are rising and there is not much Christmas cheer to go around?",60
45,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Having done over stall the Leader of the Opposition, I happily hand this to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training.",61
46,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This question, of course, comes from the former president of the ACTU, who supported the government as it was achieving the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression-ll.2 per cent. He is now complaining that the government has exposed the machinery by which the member for Hotham and his colleagues were seeking to distort the unemployment figures constantly redefine the long-term unemployed as the short-term unemployed. The reason why we have seen the long-term unemployment figures rise in the latest figures is that the merry-go-round for short-term training programs, which brought eight out of 10 people back onto the unemployment point queues, has been halted. It is not our that the government is entitled to reach into the pockets of Australian families, take a billion dollars out, throw it into programs which are not going to lead people on to jobs, and try to promote itself politically. Mr Crean-They did. You have scrapped the schemes.",61
47,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They did not lead on to jobs. The fact is that over the last six years, tween July 1990 and the March election, the Labor Party government succeeded in creating to order? an additional 7,100 full-time jobs. They created an absolute desert of full-time emmade ployment. That is the reason why we have the unemployment problem that we have. Growth in the employment situation tailed off after April 1995. After April 1995, growth in employment tailed away to a rate of 1.2 per cent a year. The reason it did that was even that government realised it could no longer afford the galloping deficits, which piled up $70 billion of deficit spending over the last five years. That was absolutely unsustainable. The balance of payments blew out. The country realised that the International Monetary Fund would be here soon if there were not an end to that policy. So it was you who slowed down the employment growth. It was you who brought a to the employment growth, and it has kept unemployment at 8.5 per cent. It is a disgraceful record, and you are going to have to live with it. It was your weakness in failing to prevent this deficit spending that caused this problem. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Acting Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You have had no hesitation whatsoever in interrupting our side in mid-flight when that kind of 'you, you, you' stuff has been going on.

76,Mr BOB BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Keep it up; I love it. My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. What plans has the government in place to resolve the Hindmarsh Island bridge affair? Will these plans put to an end this long running and expensive saga?,63
77,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Yesterday in the other place the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs tabled the Mathews report and announced that it was the government's intention to introduce legislation to finally resolve this matter. This has been going on since 12 May 1994 when the former minister for Aboriginal affairs put a temporary injunction on the building of the Hindmarsh Island bridge. He then appointed Professor Saunders to inquire into the claims. Professor Saunders reported and the minister made a permanent declaration. The minister's decision was subsequently overturned on procedural grounds. The minister appealed to the full bench of the Federal Court and lost the appeal. At the same time, the South Australian government had a royal commission into this matter and the former minister had a second inquiry, this time with Justice Mathews. Justice Mathews's inquiry was found not to be tenable by the High Court because it was not consistent with her judicial office. What this 2V2-year saga has shown is that the Aboriginal heritage protection act has very serious deficiencies and very serious procedural impositions on the minister. It would seem to be in everybody's interests now after 2V2 years that this finally be brought to a conclusion. Given the deficiencies that have been shown up in three reports, several court appeals and the final report from Justice Mathews, it would seem that the only sensible way to bring this to a conclusion is by way of legislation. Given that, it is interesting to note the opposition's position on this matter. The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs was hitting the airwaves yesterday saying that the legislation would be vigorously opposed. He said, 'I am not going to take a recommendation to shadow cabinet to support this. It has not got a chance of passing the Senate.' Even this morning as of 8 a.m. on radio station 4BC he was saying that this legislation would breach the Racial Discrimination Act. It would also have to be retrospective and he said once again that they were not going to support it. I would like to give the shadow minister some advice: if you want to go out on a limb, it is worth checking with your leader before you do so. At pretty much the same time he was on 4BC saying that there is no way the opposition is going to support this, the Leader of the Opposition was doing a doorstop and he was asked twice whether or not he would be supporting this. The first time he was asked he said, 'As I said, we'll take a look at it.' That is very different from the position of the shadow minister. The journalist had another go at him, quite rightly, and said, 'So then you are not saying that this is going to be opposed if you have a look at it.' The Leader of the Opposition replied, 'I'm not saying anything about that. I want to take a close look at it.' Quite clearly the Leader of the Opposition is not prepared to stand by his shadow minister. Quite clearly the opposition does not have a clue how they are going to respond to this in spite of 2years to get their act together on the matter. The fact is that, if they cannot get their act together on a simple action like this, if they are divided on such a simple issue as putting to end a 2V2-year saga on the Hindmarsh Bridge, it shows no leadership whatsoever. The Leader of the Opposition is going to Bathurst on Friday to make a light on the hill speech. It is very interesting that he is doing this, given that I remember him rubbishing the former Leader of the Opposition for his headland speech. Mr Kelvin Thomson- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145 concerning relevance. The minister was asked: 'What plans does the government have concerning Hindmarsh Island? Will these plans put to an end this long running saga?' Clearly, he has now embarked on a frolic of his own having nothing to do with the question he was asked.",63
78,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister will answer the question, and he will of course be relevant.",64
79,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I was right in the middle of my answer. I can remember sitting on the other side of the House and listening to the rubbishing that the former Leader of the Opposition got for his headland speeches. It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition decides to follow exactly the same tact. Mr Lee- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order relating to the question of relevance. Are you ruling this in order and relevant?",64
80,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course I am, yes.",64
81,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On Friday in his light on the hill speech the Leader of the Opposition might like to tell us how they are going to respond to this.,64
82,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order relating to relevance. The light on the hill lecture is an annual lecture. I do not intend to wander around the place looking for bogus headlands like the previous Leader of the Opposition did. I will be a proud presenter of the 12th annual light on the hill speech this weekend.",64
83,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,64
84,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This just shows the weakness of the opposition and the weakness of the Leader of the Opposition on such a simple issue as this. I will make some comments finally on the legislation and on this whole process. This 2Y2-year Hindmarsh Island bridge saga has been one of the most controversial Aboriginal heritage issues in recent memory, and it has done nothing for the cause of protecting Aboriginal heritage. It has been a painful and divisive process for Aboriginal people and for the broader community. This painful and divisive process cannot be brought to a conclusion with the failings that have been clearly shown in this act, which is 12 years old, which was designed as a temporary piece of legislation in the first place and which is still in existence. This whole matter can be best summed up in the words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Ralph Clarke. When commenting on another aspect of the Hindmarsh bridge saga he said this: It is better to admit your mistakes and cut your losses now rather than perpetuate this constant division and further waste of the taxpayers' funds. The Leader of the Opposition has a clear choice. He either has another inquiry under the act and keeps the division and the pain going or he can finally support us and put this sad matter to an end. Workplace Relations Legislation",64
85,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. Let him have a go at this one. Is he aware of the article by the eminent Australian economist Professor Bob Gregory, as reported in this morning's Australian Financial Review? Does the government argue, as the article suggests, that labour market flexibility can only create jobs by allowing real wages to fall in response to high unemployment? How will the workplace relations bill both create jobs and deliver on the Prime Minister's 'rock solid' guarantee that no worker will be worse off at the same time?",64
86,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me give you the benefit of resubmitting that question later to the Minister for Industrial Relations. You will get more chapter and verse. It is exactly right to say that the IR legislation, the purposeful reform legislation which has already passed this lower house, will provide, sensibly and safely, greater flexibility to the workplace in Australia. By that action it will help to create jobs and boost exports-and by providing the right to belong to a union and the right not to belong to a union. Employment",64
87,Mrs WEST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the minister aware of estimates that the implementation of the Brereton reforms in June next year could jeopardise the 200,000 young people? Given that the government has said that dealing with youth unemployment is a high priority, what action government going to take to ensure that young people's jobs are not at risk? Mr Crean-Cutting their wages.",65
88,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The interjection talks about wages. In the 13 years that you were in government your policy was to reduce wages. For an average family with a couple of kids, if you take into account Medicare, taxes, charges and the like, the truth is that those families, if they were lucky enough to have a job after your period of economic mismanagement, were on average roughly $20 or $25 a week worse off. Don't you tell us about real wages. Your policy, which you boasted about, was to reduce people's wages. Our policy, in sharp contrast to yours, provides a means by which people can enjoy higher wages and higher living standards in the future. Don't you lecture us about jobs with the shocking record that we inherited",65
89,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. I ask you to draw",65
90,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Leader of House to address his remarks through the chair.,65
91,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am very happy to do so.,65
92,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I appreciate that.,65
93,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are two aspects of the government's reform package which I particularly want to refer to today and which are very significant in respect of jobs. There are some who claim that the impact of the reform package on jobs is minimal. Let me refer you, for example, to the unfair dismissal provisions. You are basically opposed to the changes we are makingMr Crean-No.",65
94,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes you are; it is on the record. Let me tell you what your own Labor Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, said in respect of the impact of Brereton's unfair dismissal law: There are kids going without jobs because of the way the unfair dismissal provision works in the jobs of at least federal law. That is not coming from our side of politics. This is a statement by the Labor Premier of is the New South Wales. The question of junior wage rates is addressed in this legislation. In the reform legislation at the initiative of some in the Senate, an anti-age discriminatory provision was included. I understand from those who were involved in those discussions that when it was included it was directed particularly to older Australians, those reaching 60 or 65, so that they could continue in gainful employment-a proposition which I think most members would support. It was not realised at the time what the implications for young people would be. In the time following the passage of that legislation there were discussions about how this provision could be implemented so as to avoid an impact on young people. When Labor were in power they themselves publicly conceded that there was no means then available to implement that policy and they themselves extended the exemption. Why did they extend the exemption? Because the impact of the abolition of junior wage rates has beenMr MCMullan-No, no; you are wrong.",65
95,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is on the public record. Let me now go to the implications of it. In the retail industry there are about 283,000 young people employed, about 43 per cent of the total youth employment in Australia. The Retail Council of Australia have estimated that, if we abolished junior wage rates as at June next year, 220,000 young people's jobs will be at risk. It is incredible that the opposition claim concern for young people's jobs, yet they intend to use their numbers in the Senate so as to put at risk 220,000 young people's jobs. On that basis we intend to pursue the matter because we are absolutely determined to secure the jobs of those young people. We intend, with the balance of the reforms, to improve their job prospects more generally.",65
96,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Treasurer aware of a proposal that the government authorise the issue of redeemable preference shares in Telstra? Does the proposal require that the proceeds of $8 billion be then paid to the government and out of that $7 billion be applied to retire government debt? Are the interest rates on government borrowings likely to be lower than those on preference shares? If so, does it strike the Treasurer as being a less than business like proposition?",66
97,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Curtin for his question and his interest in these matters. I have heard suggestions that Telstra should issue $8 billion in redeemable preference shares. May I say that proposal holds no attraction for the government. Redeemable preference shares are essentially a financing transaction by which you would raise $8 billion which would be redeemable at the option of the person who issues them. It essentially amounts to a financing transaction. It essentially would be borrowing off the back of a Telstra security. If the government is to borrow, it would prefer to borrow on its own account with its own credit rating. The differential would be lower and there would be no basis whatsoever for not being able to raise the required funds in the bond markets with Treasury bonds. This holds no attraction for the government. May I say that the government, of course, is determined at the moment, by and large, to stabilise its debt. We came into office off the back of a government that had run up $70 billion in accumulated deficits over five years-$70,000 million! The member for Curtin will know what that means. If you think of $1 million, the Labor Party ran up 70,000 of them over five years70,000 of them in accumulated deficits over five years. You had mortgaged Australia's future. You had taken Commonwealth debt to 20 per cent of GDP, and you had no plan to stabilise it this decade or this century. It Labor's policy to run deficit and debt to the next century. If the Labor Party has its way it will defeat measures to balance the budget.",66
98,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order: is it relevant to discuss the third lowest public Telstra debt in the OECD in this fashion, Mr Acting Speaker? Mr Acting. SPEAKER-There is no point of order.",66
99,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Labor Party has its way with the measures that it has announced, its plan is to stop Australia balancing its accounts this century. That is its policy. If you had your way that would be your policy. It is not enough to run up five years of deficit, but to want to do it for another three!",66
100,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have a point of order on relevance: is it relevant for the Treasurer to continue in this fashion when he opposed $10 billion worth of budget tightening when they were in opposition?,66
101,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. Oh, the Deputy Leader, as wellMr Gareth Evans-On a point of order: the Treasurer continues to accuse you of having your wicked way in these matters. I ask you to remind him again of standing order 59.",66
102,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I know. Treasurer, please reduce the number of points of order by addressing the chair.",66
103,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, of course. We always feel glad when we see the tag team come up here to the dispatch box. The task of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is to make his leader look good, and he does. He does it unintentionally, but he does it. That is his task. Let me say that the objective of this government is to stabilise and reduce debt. We will not be out there on the markets borrowing new money. We want to get out there on the markets and retire debt. We want to free future generations from the legacy of debt of Labor. We want to give them a future. We want to give them opportunities. We want was to make sure that we put aside those past failures. That is why we say in relation to Telstra that we will be retiring debt. With $1 billion of that we will be setting up the most exciting environment fund that this country has ever seen. Where do we find the Labor Party? They are against the environment. This is newfound opposition to the Telstra privatisation. The member for Curtin would know that if, by some trick, Prime Minister Keating had snuck back there would now be national ALP conferences, because they would have discovered the need to privatise Telstra. Frank Blount belled the cat on this one, wink, wink, nod, nod. A frontbencher still active in politics said, 'We'll privatise Telstra.' We have got a pretty fair idea who it is, haven't we? Let me say in response to the member for Curtin that this government will manage its debt portfolio in the most prudent way. That proposal for redeemable preference shares does not hold attractions for the reasons that he adverted to. In relation to the government's policy-the policy that it put to the election, the policy that the Australian public endorsed on 2 March-we will be implementing it. Private Health Insurance",66
104,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister inform the House of the recent moves by private health insurance funds to introduce new products which will make private health insurance more affordable for single parents and for couples? What effect will this have on the public hospital system? Can the minister comment on recent claims that the budget has removed $800 million from federal funding to state hospitals? What is the basis of such a claim?,67
105,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. The most extensive survey done into health is a biannual survey done by TQA. The last survey showed there were some niche areas for private health insurance that had not been fully exploited. The main one of these was the use of front-end deductibles which have not been used very extensively in our system. So in recent times I have authorised my department to allow funds to offer tables with a greater range of front-end deductible premiums that I hope will fill this niche market. I have also had applications from funds and have decided to approve a new range of tables that will be open to all funds to offer reduced premiums to single parent families and to couples. Single parent families are particularly underrepresented in the private health insurance system and, hopefully, this will provide an attractive proposition to a number of people who do not have insurance at the moment. What effect will that have on the public hospital system? Anything that can get a greater proportion of the people using the private sector or allow the public hospitals access to money from the private health funds will help the public sector. While I am on that, the final part of the honourable member's question related to a claim made on 'Face the Press' on 15September that public hospital funding was going to be cut by $800 million. Mr Lee-Face to Face or Meet the Press?",67
106,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Meet the Press. Let me read what the shadow minister said: If you look at what happened in Victoria, just as one example, in the two years up till 1995 federal Labor funding for public hospitals increased by $200 million, but Mr Kennett took about the same amount out. The big difference this year is the federal funding won't be going up, it will be going down. That will put great pressure on public hospitals right across the country-an $800 million cutback over the next four years. There are three errors in just those few words. I will take the errors one by one. It is all very well for the former government to try to trumpet that they gave $200 million extra to Victoria but, in fact, $150 million of that was for the transfer of the repatriation hospital system. What they do not say is that the funds that went in there were to transfer the repatriation hospital. When you learn a little bit more about health, you will actually see that is what happened. The second thing that is wrong is that funds are going up this year, not down. It is very clear",67
107,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is going down, down. Mr Lee-It is continuing down.",67
108,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition! The member for Dobell!,67
109,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The sloppy person is the shadow minister-and the oppositionwho can make three mistakes in two sentences. The fact is, this year funding is $4.796 million, an increase of $67.2 million on the previous year. When you look at what we have done with public hospital funding, you find that it was exempted from the Mr Lee- Mr Acting Speaker, the minister knows it is a reduction in the forward estimates",67
110,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Dobell! I would suggest to you that you do observe standing orders and you do not commence speaking until you get the call. I caution you very strongly.,68
111,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. The funding this year is $67.2 million up on what it was Speaker!",68
112,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I call the honourable member for Chifley.  worry you.,68
113,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you're not. You wouldn't be doing it if you were sorry.  Mr Acting Speaker, is it appropriate for government advisers during question time to read magazines?",68
114,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his point of order. I am not aware of anybody in the advisers' boxes reading magazines. Whether or not it might be part of the research for their job, I do not know. It is certainly out of order for anybody to read newspapers in the chamber. Mr MCGauran-On a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker: question time has been deliberately and thoroughly disrupted by the opposition taking frivolous points of order and ignoring your ruling time after time. Therefore, I call on you to invoke the standing order that outlaws frivolous points of order. It is a deliberate strategy being used this directionless opposition.",68
115,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the minister for his point of order. I will be seeking to exercise and apply all standing orders with great thoroughness from now on today.,68
116,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.' On the forward estimates, public hospital funding will go up $500 million over the next four years to $5.3 billion. Mr Lee-A reduction from last year.",68
117,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Dobell!,68
118,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The only change that is being made to public hospital funding is to address a rort that you were incapable of addressing in the entire time you were in government. The fact is, you allowed the states to rort Medicare",68
119,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will address his remarks through the chair.,68
120,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you. The Labor Party allowed the states to rort Medicare. They were incapable of doing anything about it. It threatened the entire Medicare system. They whinge and wring their hands and say how terrible it was, but they did nothing. The only money that is coming off the public hospitals is in response to cost shifting and that is money that the hospitals are taking from another source. The net effect to the public hospitals is, in fact, that they will have more money, not less, even on the forward estimates. The point is that you cannot have a sustainable health system when the states are shifting up to $400 million of costs per year onto the federal system",68
121,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Which states are they-the Liberal states?,68
122,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"New South Wales is the worse-and that system threatens the very nature of Medicare. Even if you - oo.k that as a cut-which it is not because It IS offsetting funds coming from elsewhere-that is hardly $800 million. I went through the fine print in the budget, as the shadow minister is suggesting there is something in by fine print-to see whether there was some other change to public hospital funding that I had not noticed and, to be fair, there had been. In fact, because we have reduced migrant places under the humanitarian program, there is a population growth index on which the Medicare agreement is based. That will be changed and nationwide will reduce public hospital funding by about $750,000 a year, which makes $3.1 million over four years and, even if you add $316 to $3.1, it is nothing like the $800 million that you are suggesting. The end result is that public hospital funding is going up. You can bleat and whinge about it, but we are addressing the problems that you did not have the guts to address. We are fixing up your mess. Workplace Relations Legislation Mr GARETH EV AN8-My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister and follows his response earlier to the member for Canberra. Does he still claim, as he said on television last weekend, that passage of the government's industrial relations legislation is 'by far the best way to create jobs'? If he does still claim that, can he tell us how that is going to be achieved except by driving down wages to American style poverty levels? If that is his position, how does he reconcile it with what is in the budget papers, what Treasury officials have said in estimates hearings this week, what the Treasurer himself said on 7 September, and the government's commitment that under the IR legislation no worker will be worse off?",68
123,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I stand exactly by my comments on the weekend. The industrial relations legislation, the quite modest in one sense IR bill, is absolutely the right step for Australia to be taking in the 1990s to become truly internationally competitive. It will deliver for some of the reasons the Minister for Industrial Relations has put forward, including the greater flexibility. example, a parent may reach an agreement by negotiation with a small business operator for a particular set of hours of employment which would allow them to drop their children at such proposals? school, to then work from 10 a.m. until 2.30 p.m. and then to go back and collect those kids from school. That cannot be done now because of the inherent inflexibility of the industrial relations system. We will deliver that sort of sensible flexibility which recognises the modern family-that is, parents going about the business of looking after children while seeking employment, particularly in the lucky circumstances where it is male/female parents and it is not a dysfunctional family. I would add that the IR bill is long overdue for this country and the sooner you facilitate its passage through the Senate the sooner there will more jobs and more exports and the sooner the economy will be back on the rails.",69
124,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. If, as the Acting Prime Minister says, competitiveness or productivity gains are the answer, why is it that New Zealand's productivity gains have been less than Australia's since their Employment Contracts Act was passed?",69
125,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr Acting Speaker,69
126,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I don't think there is any-I will take your point of order.,69
127,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You said quite clearly last week that supplementary questions should be an irregular occurrence. We have had three supplementary questions out of five questions asked by the opposition today. They are clearly flouting your direction on supplementary questions.,69
128,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the minister for his point of order. I do remind everybody that supplementary questions according to the ruling of Speaker Halverson, which I have endorsed and carried out, are irregular and I am not prepared to allow this one at the present time. Public Housing Waiting Lists",69
129,Mr MCDOUGALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer For aware of recent criticisms by the member for Jagajaga of the government's plans to reduce public housing waiting lists? Can the Treasurer inform the House as to the origins of any,69
130,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The member for Jagajaga put out a press release on the Commonwealth-state housing offer that the Prime Minister had made to the states yesterday. I feel I should defend the honour of the Prime Minister. I doubt that he is lying awake in Tokyo worrying about this press release from the member for Jagajaga, but I think we should set the record straight. Essentially, it made two criticisms of the Prime Minister's offer to the states. One was a criticism of the suggestion that the Commonwealth should move towards directing its money to income support and the states focus on delivering public housing services themselves. The member for Jagajaga said: There is only one way of assuring low cost housing for the poor and needy in our community-a strong public housing sector where the states are properly funded to build and maintain public housing so they can keep a lid on rent levels. The coalition's cash in hand approach will fail. Mr Albanese-Don't you agree with that?",69
131,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-Where do you think that approach came from? Paul Keating and the Labor Party agreed at the COAG meeting with all of the states. The COAG communique on 11 April 1995 said: In a joint communique the reforms will bring about a fundamental shift in roles and responsibilities entailing the Commonwealth accepting responsibility for income support and housing afford ability and the states and territories for housing services. Prime Minister Howard was bound by that communique. That was Labor policy. The member for Jagajaga is out campaigning now against Labor policy. How extraordinary! She also said in this press release: If subsidies to low income families in private rental are to be substantially expanded and tenants are to be paid subsidies so they pay around 25 per cent of their income in rent, then revenue neutrality is a pipedream. So she is saying that it is also a pipedream to try to do this on a revenue neutral basis. You can imagine how breathtaking we find this kind of thing. The proposal that new tenants in public housing ensure they pay no more than 25 per cent of their income for rent and that this be done in a revenue neutral way was published in a document called 'Community and Nation' December 1995-the Labor Party policy. You are campaigning against another aspect of the Labor Party policy. 1 warned the shadow Treasurer about this. I said that the first thing he had to do was bring the socialist left into line in his own party. They are not just campaigning against the coalition position; they are campaigning against the Labor Party position as well-a kind of joint unity ticket against both. This is endemic of an opposition which cannot enunciate a coherent position-not a coherent position on housing, not a coherent position on Hindmarsh bridge. The Socialist left is running around on Hindmarsh bridge saying that it will not even bring a position to the shadow cabinet, whilst the Leader of the Opposition is sitting around saying, 'I cannot tell you what it is until it has been to the shadow cabinet.' If the socialist left has its way it will never get there, Leader. That is the problem. It will never get there. There will be no recommendation. Before the budget the shadow Treasurer said on Meet the Press on 12 May: We will be obviously looking at the budget line by line in determining our individual responses to it, recognising that governments have to govern. Of course, we are not going to be silly about it. Oh, no! You are only opposing $19 billion of it! Michelle Grattan said on Meet the Press on 18 August 1996 to the shadow Treasurer: So we are talking about fiddling at the edges rather than a fundamental assault? The answer from the shadow Treasurer was: I think inevitably that is what we are reduced to. I would not demean it by saying it is fiddling at the edges. It is $18 billion over four years! You are going to try to ensure that this budget does not balance over the next three years. This is a full-scale assault on an elected government's budget. Yet we had the shadow Treasurer promising explicitly that this is exactly what he would not do, saying before the budget what he wanted was a balance over three years. Again, he was comprehensively rolled. This is a Leader of the Opposition who, on a personal level, we quite like-he can share a joke with the Dalai Lama-but in a political sense he has no authority whatsoever. He is unable to haul the socialist left into line, unable to do anything about Hindmarsh bridge, unable to stand up in relation to the budget assault, unable to enunciate a position on the budget and unable to enunciate a coherent policy. This is an opposition which has no pretension and obviously no belief that it will ever return to government and have to face these issues. It is opportunistic, ent, divided, demoralised. This is an opposition which is irrelevant and, for very logical reasons, suffering relevance deprivation syndrome. Reef Tax: Townsville",70
132,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that four of the biggest employment sectors in Townsville are tourism, the James Cook University, Commonwealth agencies and state government instrumentalities? Did it occur to the government that its decision to impose a reef tax, cut operating funds to universities, cut Commonwealth jobs and employment programs and cut grants to the states would have an adverse impact on employment in Townsville? If not, why not?",71
133,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Once again, it is a typical opposition question based on inaccurate information. If you look at the total Commonwealth payments to the states and territories, in nominal terms general revenue grants to the states and territories are up 3V2 per cent from 1995-96 and specific purpose payments are up five per cent. The reef tax was introduced under the then federal Labor government as a user charge. It is a matter which has been the subject of a budget decision and which the Prime Minister commented on last week. There is dialogue going ahead with regard to the implementation. That, most notably, is being carried forward by the Minister for the Environment in liaison with the federal minister for tourism. In respect of implementation, the budget decision is as the Prime Minister said it was last week. In terms of regional Australia, this was a federal budget that delivered the retention of the diesel fuel rebate scheme, a boost in drought assistance, $140 million for a black spots reintroduction program and a four per cent increase in local government. As the member for Brisbane comes from Queensland, I just happen to have in my hand a letter that I have been waiting to use for some little time. It is written to Mike Kaiser, state secretary of the ALP, PO Box 5032, Brisbane, Queensland. It is from a person at Moranbah, incoher- Central Queensland. It starts: I infonn you of my resignation from the Labor Party and do so because of the inability of your administrative committee to come to tenns with what the ordinary people in remote areas want.",71
134,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker, I ask a supplementary question to the Acting Prime Minister directly in relation to his answer. He prefaced his answer by saying that he referred to nominal figures. I ask the Acting Prime Minister if he would now provide the information as to the real figures, the adjusted figures-not the nominal figures.",71
135,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no supplementary question. Sugar Industry,71
136,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ANNE KELLY-My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. Can the Acting Prime Minister confirm that the government will honour its commitment not to overarch or override the outcome of the recommendations of the Queensland government's review of the sugar industry should it find that the existing regulatory arrangements, such as acquisition and single desk selling for the domestic and international markets, should be maintained?",71
137,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have received a number of communications, including from members of the Independent Retirees Association. I note with interest the presence of the national president of the Independent.Retirees Association, Maureen Kingston, in the gallery this day. Part of the government's sustainable approach to agricultural exports includes the cast-iron retention of the single desk selling powers of the Australian wheat industry. It is a matter of public benefit. It is a matter the Prime Minister has answered a question on at this dispatch box in those terms. That is a very clear-cut circumstance taken by the Prime Minister when he answered a question on this matter. Before, during and after the election, I have replicated that policy position in respect of the coalition government. Recent investigations and reviews, part complete, have found that the Queensland state marketing circumstance for sugar and the New South Wales marketing state circumstance for rice are in the public benefit; however, these are matters for the state parliaments. In that respect, I reiterate the essence of what the Prime Minister has said; that is, the ment will not interfere or overarch state legislation in this regard. Ms Macklin- Mr Acting Speaker",71
138,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I call the member for Cal are. Mr Crean- Mr Acting Speaker, on a point of order: my understanding is that we had an understanding of the call from this side of the House in terms of the proportion of independent members to the proportion of opposition members. You have already called one independent speaker today and I would ask you to call the member for Jagajaga.",72
139,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. I find it very tiresome when the honourable member for Hotham jumps up and makes these objections when it is quite clear that we are well behind in our numbers. Your decision is entirely equitable in calling an Independent member today when we are well behind on our numbers. I think this ought to be made clear to the member.",72
140,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. For the information of the House and, in particular, the member for Hotham, the way the score is going is that the member for Calare is due for a question right now, and he will get it in a second. The member for Curtin was due and got it. The member for Kalgoorlie is due for a question, the member for Moore is due for a question and the member for Oxley is well and truly overdue. I call the honourable member for Cal are. Mr Martin-I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. Having listened to the comments that you have just made, can I ask you to reflect on those comments in view of the fact that in previous services of Speakers, and based on past experienceMr Reith-When did we have five Independents last? Mr Martin-Just hang on. You were absolutely correct in that there was a basis upon which an Independent was given the call. When you say somebody was due for one today and someone else was due, et cetera, it was always taken that that would be on successive days. Would you look at that federal govern- particular issue.",72
141,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I take on board what the honourable member has said. At present the quota is one to every 5.4 questions. I will reflect on what you have said. I call the honourable member for Calare. Fuel Ethanol Bounty,72
142,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. How can you reconcile your involvement in the budget decision to cut out the fuel ethanol bounty-given that the Manildra group expected this fuel-distributed through independent operators without any major company support would be economically viable by the year 2000? Do you understand what environmental imperatives, jobs and investment relied on this bounty? What pressure was exerted by the oil companies in your decision?",72
143,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question. The first point is that no pressure was exerted by the oil companies. In addition to that I would simply say that it was a decision reached as part of the normal budgetary consideration processes by the Expenditure Review Committee and subsequently by the ad hoc revenue review team. I do not believe that it is pertinent for me to comment on any so-called claims of influence or vested interest or any of those things; they are quite irrelevant. Migration Program,72
144,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Would the minister explain how the government can achieve its migration program of 74,000 places this year and at the same time respect the decision of all Australians to find a partner of their choice?",72
145,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did see some comments by the shadow minister. He was not quite correct in terms of the size of the program announced. He thought it was 76,000 places; in fact, the program that the government has announced was for 74,000. He seems to be of the view that you can make adjustments to other parts of the program and accommodate as many other people who wish to apply to enter Australia on the basis of a relationship with Australians and that it will have no significant problems so far as delivering the government's total program. It is important to understand the size of the preferential family stream. It has grown very considerably. It grew with a 33 per cent increase in the number applying on the basis of a spouse relationship or as a de facto partner or on the basis of fiances. There was a 74 per cent increase in the number of parents who were seeking sponsorship to Australia as well. What we saw happen last year in relation to these numbers was that the former government had planned a total preferential family program of 42,000 and found, because of the very rapid increase in the number of people applying in the spouse category and in the area of dependent parents, that the numbers grew to 51,000 or 52,000. That increase was very rapid. It was unexpected by the former government. In relation to that matter it made some adjustments during the year. The former government made those announcements on 1 December. On that occasion, when it had to make adjustments it had to make them in relation to other parts of the program. It wanted to deliver the program at the same numbers. What did the former government do? It introduced in relation to the independent category a cap, which it was complaining might be introduced in other areas, of 10,000 places. It reduced the numbers of people able to apply within the skilled category by 50 per cent. It effectively degraded the overall level-the skill level-of the immigration program.",72
146,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That's not true.,73
147,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That's exactly what it did. There is something that needs to be understood if you are thinking of the wider national interest in delivering a migration program that gives you people who are going to be able to obtain employment when they come here. In relation to the preferential family stream, the employment experience is abysmal. We have seen a situation develop which is out of control in relation to the spouse numbers, where there have been significant numbers of people rorting the system. I do not like to use those sorts of terms because it only brings the whole of the immigration program into disrepute. Large numbers of people are seeking to access Australia in the preferential stream when they could not get here under any of the other categories. We are seeing the sorts of increases that were reflected last year in the program. If the honourable member wants to keep challenging us to produce the evidence in relation to these matters-there is evidence available",73
148,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is ignoring you, Pete; ignoring your question.",73
149,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me invite the honourable member, if he is given the call by his colleagues on these matters, to ask a question in this area to press that matter. There is a wealth of evidence available relating to the way in which that particular category has been manipulated-a lot of it anecdotal, and that we acknowledge, and some of it based on experience. There is also available other material, objective information, that demonstrates that there have been large numbers of people from particular countries entering Australia and quickly divorcing after their arrival.",73
150,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Werriwa will not read a newspaper in the chamber. Nursing Homes,73
151,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Does the minister recall a briefing provided by her department to me on 10 September at which her senior adviser was present? Is it a fact that officials advised both your senior adviser and me that elderly Australians would be required to pay an average of $26,000 to enter a nursing home? Will the minister now confirm in this House that elderly Australians, including veterans and TPIs, will be required to pay on average $26,000 to enter a nursing home?",73
152,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I first would like to address the meeting that my department and one of my senior advisers had with the shadow minister. I was not present at that particular meeting, but I will again advise the opposition of the details of the government's entry contribution policy. The entry contribution is not compulsory, and the contribution that is paid is negotiated between the provider and the resident. My department advises me that the basis which they have estimated the raising of $130 million in the full year is on 45 per cent of all residents who are in nursing homes for longer than a six-month period paying an entry contribution fee. It will be a draw down of $2,600 per annum for a total of five years-a total sum of $13,000. That is irrespective of what the entry contribution fee being charged is. So it is a total sum of $13,000 for any resident who is paying an entry contribution fee. That is the basis on which my department made the calculation.",74
153,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker, I have a supplementary question. Did her adviser tell her the average was $26,000?",74
154,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will allow the familyMr Reith- Mr Acting Speaker, I invite you to consider my point of order. This question is not supplementary to the answer. This question is clearly a repeat of the first question. Furthermore, this shadow minister has been asking exactly the same question for the last week. It is clearly not supplementary. It is clearly well beyond the bounds of the Speaker's ruling.",74
155,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker, further to that point of order: as you well know, as I well know and as the Leader of the House ought to well know, the question of discretion with regard to the answering of supplementaries is absolute, as far as you are concerned. Thus far in question time you have heard a number of questions offered as supplementaries, and you have rejected them all. We have not challenged the rejections. Mr Costello-Oh, and how many did you allow in l3 years?",74
156,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have not challenged the rejections when you have made them. I would respectfully submit to you that you are quite correct in calling the supplementary on this occasion as the only one that you permit in this question time. Mr Reith- Mr Acting Speaker, on a further point of order, to pick up the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition: as it is clear to those who have been here for some time, the idea of irregularity does not encompass having a supplementary question after virtually every question.",74
157,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have not. Mr Reith-You have. I am not keeping count, Mr Acting Speaker; there have been so many I have lost count. Mr Richard Evans-There were six. Mr Reith-There were six, I am advised by interjection. I refer you to the words of the Speaker, who says: However, I do not see a situation arising where I will pennit a supplementary question to be asked after every original question. It will be a more irregular occurrence. By their display today, that ruling is clearly being flouted by the opposition, and you should not give them a supplementary question. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Acting Speaker, further to the point of order on the question of repetition, which was the first point of order raised by the Leader of the House: I remind the Acting Speaker that the original question asked of the minister was 'is it a fact that officials advised her senior adviser and our shadow minister'? The supplementary question was quite different. The supplementary question was 'did her department advise the minister'? It grew out of the answer and was appropriately supplementary to it.",74
158,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have had enough points of order on this, and I do point out to the House that Mr Speaker Halverson has said that they will be irregular. I would say to all of you that the number of supplementary questions asked today-that is the relevant point-has been irregular. I have rejected most. I have allowed the one to the Minister for Family Services.",74
159,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have nothing further to add to the answer that I have given the shadow minister. Australian National,75
160,Ms JEANES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I refer the minister to the statement made in the House last night by the member for Port Adelaide when he referred to the vulnerability of the South Australian economy. Under Labor, he said, South Australia was always paid special attention. I note the contribution the special attention paid to the State Bank by South Australian Labor made to the vulnerability of our economy. Can the minister inform the House what the results of Labor's special attention have been for those employed in the rail industry in South Australia?",75
161,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for her question. The question relates to what special attention Australian National Rail workers in South Australia experienced under the very special attention that was afforded to them, according to the rhetoric in the House last night, by the former Labor government. It would be of interest to members of the House to know that the very special attention afforded by the former Labor government to those rail workers in South Australia saw the number of rail workers in South Australia during the term of the Labor governmentsome 13 years-fall from 10,500 at the beginning of the Labor Party's term to some 2,500 rail workers 13 years later. That is the measure of Labor's special attention for South Australian rail workers. It stands in stark contrast to the rhetoric and false impression given by those people from the Labor Party who engaged in that debate in this House last night. The special attention afforded to AN and its rail workers has left AN in such a mess after 13 years of Labor that it has in excess of $1,000 million of debts and liabilities. It had losses of up to $148 million for the last financial year with no prospect of returning to profit in the next few years, indeed no prospect of getting below a loss of $100 million for the next few years. The special attention afforded by Labor to South Australia's rail workers has ensured that any prospect that AN had of being viable was killed off by the way the Labor government established the National Rail Corporation, which strangled AN's opportunities to create jobs in South Australia. So that is the way Labor sees giving special attention to South Australia being good. South Australians should have a second thought about that. The South Australians will be looking to the sorts of initiatives this government has announced for South Australia as far as transport is concerned, such as the $48 million extension to Adelaide's airport and the nearly $120 million road project on the Mount Barker Highway-the largest road project ever undertaken in South Australia, approved by this government within a matter of months after being elected into office. Shipbuilding Bounty",75
162,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister, and I refer to the budget decision to abolish the shipbuilding bounty. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware of comments from industry leaders and a state premier that the decision risks sending many of the industry's 10,000 jobs overseas? In light of this, is he prepared to review the decision to abolish the bounty? If not, how does he justify cutting $9 million from shipbuilders in Hobart, Darwin, Perth and Adelaide exporting vessels overseas, particularly when the government has recently reversed another decision and found $23 million to help firms like Shell buy ships from Rotterdam?",75
163,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It was Labor's policy to bring to an end this particular bounty. That was the circumstance laid down by the federal Labor government. You have had a change of heart. Mr Crean-You have had a change of heart too-in government.,75
164,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You must look at the total effort of the budget. It closes up the deficit by $7.2 billion over two years and brings to an end-step by step through the good work of Treasurer Costello-the circumstance of the legacy of Labor's debt, Beazley's black hole, which provides a range of specific initiatives for regional Australia which I dealt with earlier in question time. Arising from what you did when you were in power, there has been an expectation that this bounty was going to come to an end anyhow. The government took steps in relation to Mackay, BHP and Shell. That is true. But, I must say, give us our budget, give us our industrial relations reform and give us Telstra legislation and the high-tech, wave piercing ferry production of Australia will go gang busters. National Carer Action Plan",75
165,Ms GAMBARO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services, and it is not about nursing homes.",76
166,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Get to the question.,76
167,Ms GAMBARO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Carers play a very important role in the Petrie electorate and communities throughout Australia. How will the national carers action plan be of benefit carers and those for whom they care?,76
168,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Petrie for that question. As the first step toward implementing the government's national care action plan, an additional $36.2 million will be made available over four years was reading. to expand the provision of respite care services and to establish care resource centres across Australia. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that 74 per cent of assistance needed by the frail elderly and people with a disability living in the community is provided by their relatives and friends on an unpaid basis. Without the assistance of these carers, many of the most dependent and vulnerable people in our community would find it very difficult to remain living at home. The government is committed to recognisthis ing and supporting the work that carers do our community. The respite initiatives that will put in place will be to extend the proviment sion of respite care services with care provided at home or in the community, to improve coordination of available forms of respite, to improve access to respite assistance especially in emergencies and to lead to better matching of services and assistance to individual carer needs and circumstances. The carer pension will be changed to provide greater flexibility in caring arrangements and will be achieved by relaxing the following eligibility criteria for pensioners. The number of days for which a carer may temporarily cease caring while remaining the eligible for the carers pension will be increased from 42 days to 52 days in a year. This initiative acknowledges that the carer should be entitled to at least one day in every week off as a break. The amount of time carers may spend in employment, voluntary work, education or training while retaining eligibility for the carer pension will be doubled from 10 to 20 hours. This initiative will enable a smoother transition for carers when they are able to return to full-time work and will assist them to update and maintain their skills. The 'carer pension' will be renamed the to 'carer payment'. This is in recognition of the very valuable contribution made and service given by carers to our community in return for their income support.",76
169,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker, I ask the minister to table the paper from which she",76
170,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the document a confidential one? Mrs Moylan-Yes. Books Bounty,76
171,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minster. I draw his attention to the decision to abolish the books bounty. Is he aware that 25 per cent of the jobs in Maryborough, Victoria, are dependent on the industry assistance provided through bounty? Will he review the decision to in abolish the bounty in order to protect these we jobs? Isn't this another reason why unemploywill go up to nine per cent under this a focus on government's policies? Mr Tim Fischer-As Minister Moore, who directly handles this matter, is in the chamber, I happily refer it to him.",76
172,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"None of the issues that were raised by the last two questions from the opposition would have been necessary if we had had a reasonable government in the past. They are the ones who created the crisis in government. They are the ones who spent $70 million more in five years than they raised. As a consequence of that, the government had to approach the recentMr Beazley interjecting",77
173,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition! Mr Costello-You should withdraw that.,77
174,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You will withdraw that. And, if we are talking about tongues in cheek, you might keep yours in yours.",77
175,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw. I will certainly keep my tongue in my cheek while he is answering, Mr Acting Speaker.",77
176,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Thank you.,77
177,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am quite overwhelmed. As I was saying, the government was forced to address the enormous budget deficit left by the previous government. So when the Treasurer approached the budget, he was very mindful of the need to restrain government spending-because of your past failings.",77
178,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Not my past failings.,77
179,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed not, Sir. Your electorate is very well served. The action taken by the government as a whole will produce better outcomes for employment, it will produce a stronger economy, and it will produce a better competitive economy for not only book buyers, makers or printers but the entire job industry. And, if you pass the industrial relations legislation in the Senate, it will be so much better. Apprenticeships",77
180,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Can the minister detail to the House how the government's apprenticeships and trainee refonns will improve job opportunities for young people in key rural sectors of the Northern Territory?",77
181,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Rural and regional Australia, and indeed the Northern Territory, were all neglected by the previous government. It is little wonder as a result that Labor was virtually wiped out in regional Australia in March. I think it retained something like two out of 19 regional seats at the time. In relation to training and apprenticeships, the Chainnan of the Rural Training Council of Australia, when referring to the period in office occupied by the Labor Party, recently said: Previously, training in rural industries has been difficult to access, costly and not always relevant. I am pleased to infonn the honourable member for the Northern Territory that I have today announced the development of new traineeships in the cattle, sheep and wool, grains, pOUltry and agricultural, and veterinary chemical use industries. The government is providing $1.4 million for the development of these new traineeships which are part of the government's refonns to the apprenticeship and trainees hip system. Mr Beddall- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister has clearly indicated that he is making announcements of government policy. He said that he has 'announced today'.",77
182,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, he is not. He is making an announcement of government action. Mr Crean-So it is not a policy!",77
183,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased also to say that the industries involved estimate that there will be at least 1,000 additional training places leading on to real jobs generated by this initiative. The traineeships will be designed by peak industry bodies. Mr Crean-Come on, come on!",77
184,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is something that you could never achieve. The traineeships will be designed by peak industry bodies, ensuring that the needs of employees and trainees will be met. The traineeships will be available from March 1997. They will be available to school leavers. They will be available to farmers and their employees, and others seeking a foothold in the industry. Mr Crean-This is next year. Why don't you do it now?",77
185,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When you pass the workplace relations bill, we will be able to put in place some of these new traineeship opportunities. I am pleased to say also that the industry is quite prepared to offer some of these traineeships under the national training wage arrangements. This initiative clearly demonstrates this government's commitment to regional Australia. It also demonstrates this government's commitment to ensuring that young people get training for job opportunities which are real jobs and on which they can build higher qualifications and a career. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Acting Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. I also acknowledge that, in the gallery during today's question time, there have been members of the armed forces, including some from overseas. NA NA Parliament House: Demonstration",78
186,Mr CADMAN,SPEAKER,"Are you aware that a Senate estimates committee has been informed of a revised estimate of the cost of damage to Parliament House-it is not $91,000, but $300,00O-caused by some demonstrators attending the ACTU rally? Will the President and you be seeking further damage payments and a full and proper apology from the ACTU and the unions involved?",78
187,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am advised that the Joint House Department has received a quote from Burczi Copper that the cost to return the double set of front doors of Parliament House to as-new condition will cost in the order of $218,000. This is substantially more than the original overall estimate of building damage of $75,000. The department is considering the implications of the quote and whether there is in fact a need to return the doors to as-new condition. Mr Albanese interjecting",78
188,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"You are not even in your seat. In addition, discussions are taking place with security authorities to see whether strengthening to the doors is required. Other costs are repairs that have been undertaken to the building, cleaning, materials used by the nurses centre, additional overtime that was incurred as well as stock losses and trading losses in the shop which currently amount to $82,177. As for the second part of the honourable member's question and further to my answer to an earlier question, a response has been received from the ACT Trades and Labour Council. This action and any further action are currently being considered by the Presiding Officers. Conduct of Question Time",78
189,Mr CREAN,SPEAKER,"I preface my question by saying that, whilst not objecting to the Independents having their fair share of questions in question time, I seek clarification from you on a ruling that you made earlier where you said that the quota was one in every 5.4. If one is to take the totality of the House, five into 147 would suggest that the Independents get a question one in every 30, roughly. My understanding is that the arrangement is that their quota is taken out of our proportion and that should entitle them to one essentially in every 11. As the member for Cunningham has indicated, on previous occasions this has been done on consecutive days. I would ask you, either now or subsequently, to reflect on the earlier ruling you made and give us clarification so that we know where we stand in seeking to organise for question time.",78
190,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for his question, which does somewhat seem to be just a repetition of the question from the honourable member for Cunningham. I give him the same answer: I will reflect on it and advise you. Conduct of Question Time",78
191,Mr TUCKEY,SPEAKER,"Mr Acting Speaker, on the same subject-and I refer you to those points of order that were raised today-is it not a fact that the standing orders refer to the rights of members, not political parties, when it comes to receiving the call to ask a question? If so, could you, Mr Acting Speaker, request the Speaker to implement the policy practice by Speaker Snedden in which a graph of members' questions was maintained and a copy was available to members in the reception area of the Speaker's office? Further, when more than one member stood seeking the Speaker's attention, the Speaker would allocate the call to the member who had asked the least number of questions.",78
192,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As for some sort of graph being publicly displayed, I would not be sanguine about the outcome, but I will give it some consideration. Hansard Record  your attention to page 4193 of yesterday's Hansard. In the absence of the Speaker, have you introduced new constitutional arrangements or is the reference to you as the President a typo?",79
193,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I have not seen that particular piece of Hansard and, as the clerk reminds me in a most timely fashion, Hansard is not the official record of the proceedings of the chamber. The honourable member is quoting from the proof Hansard report. I do thank the honourable member. Newspaper Clipping Service  the member for Fisher asked you a question about media clippings. Firstly, would you ascertain whether honourable members are desirous of obtaining that service? Secondly, is it possible for the Department of the House of Representatives to piggyback on the existing Senate contract and thereby achieve some savings, should it be your decision to proceed with this facility?",79
194,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,We will certainly give that some consideration. I will come back to you. Conduct of Question Time,79
195,Mr FILING,SPEAKER,"Following on from the question asked by the member for Hotham and the formula he has proposed, which we cannot find in the standing orders",79
196,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"This is a question, not a speech. Let us get to the question.",79
197,Mr FILING,SPEAKER,"It is a question, Mr Acting Speaker. Is it not a fact that, according to the actual determination of the share of questions that Independents may have, there are approximately seven questions available to Independents in the calculations? Would you please, under the terms of the member for Hotham's question, inform us how we intend to dispose of this backlog if we are only allowed to ask one question per day?",79
198,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"You have not had one per day. You have had two today. I do not think that we should get too bogged down at this stage in the mathematical formula. The chair is concerned with providing fairness and equity to all members of this place within the standing orders, and we will continue to do that. Newspaper Clipping Service",79
199,Mr SLIPPER,SPEAKER,"Mr Acting Speaker, following on from the matter raised by the honourable member for Chifley, I would appreciate your looking into the matter, as you said you would, but why is there a newspaper clipping service available to senators but not to members? The other question of course is: should members of both houses not be treated equally?",79
200,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"The simple answer is that it is very expensive. But we will look into it, and we will give it consideration. If it is possible to do that within the financial constraints of the Department of the House of Representatives, we will certainly try to do it. Newspaper Deliveries",79
201,Mr TANNER,SPEAKER,"On a similar matter, Mr Acting Speaker, now that we have been reduced to one newspaper it seems to me to be a little absurd that we have three or four newspapers piling up back in our electoral offices. I understand they are delivered under the auspices of DAS rather than the Department of the House of Representatives. Would it be possible for you or the Speaker to approach DAS and see whether there is a 4570 REPRESENTATIVES possibility of reaching some sort of agreement across the Berlin Wall between the two departments? Then we could actually get papers where we are. We could possibly even reduce the number of papers by one again, so that, wherever we happen to be-whether the parliament is sitting or not-we actually get a reasonable number of papers.",79
202,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I thought for a moment you were going to ask to have fewer papers in your electorate office, but that would have not been normal, would it? It is a sensible question. We will take it on board. Whether that is possible or not, we will find out and report back to you. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Superannuation",80

205,Mr RUDDOCK,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Yesterday the member for Holt addressed a question to me in my capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. I promised to obtain a detailed answer for the member. I have given a copy to the member, and I would like to table a copy of the answer. NA NA Computer Upgrade",80
206,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"Yesterday following question time, the member for Wills asked me to advise the House of the cost of the Which restaurant guide, which is available on the parliamentary computing network. I am advised that the guide was included because, as honourable members would be aware, members and senators and their staff are often required to travel interstate. The guide was added for their convenience in the same way as the Ansett Travel Planner is available on the system. I am advised that the total annual licence fee for the Which restaurant guide is $200 and that the fee is paid by the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. Wednesday, 18 September 1996 There are no other costs associated with its provision, nor does its availability have any effect on the speed or operational capability of the network. NA",80

208,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,80
209,Mr KERR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,80
210,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,80
211,Mr KERR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In his answer to a question in the House today, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) referred to some remarks which I had made outside this chamber. He then invited, in a manner, an inference-I think quite plainlythat there would be some reluctance on my part to have any information made available about alleged rorting of the immigration program. That plainly misrepresents what I had said. I simply set out the facts. I had made it plain that I and the opposition support any crackdown that is appropriate on rorting the system. We have indicated publicly that we willMr Reith-This is debating it.",80
212,Mr KERR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"No. I am saying where we have been misrepresented. Might I say that, as to our position with respect to the matter of spouses that the minister referred to today, all I have done is adopt a position that is exactly analogous to what the then ministerMr Reith- Mr Acting Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Some licence is usually given in these matters, but this is clearly an attempt by the shadow minister to debate the issue. He says that the misrepresentation is by implication. That, quite frankly, is barely strong enough. It is certainly not strong enough to provide him the opportunity to give us a full statement of his personal policy.",80
213,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I thank the Leader of the House. Having said that the honourable member is getting some latitude, I do invite him to show very definitely and quickly where he has been misrepresented.",80
214,Mr KERR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I will conclude by saying that, as to the matter raised by the minister, all I am doing and all the opposition is doing is taking precisely the same position as the minister did in opposition, where he said, 'I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for the government to say halfway through the year, ""We have enough spouses in, now we are going to close off the category"".'",81

217,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Mr Acting Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The consequences for the elderly, including veterans' affairs and TPI pensioners, of having pay an average $26,000 to enter a nursing home. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",81
218,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Jagajaga) (3.43 p.m.)This government are-as we have seen time and time again over the few weeks since this budget-getting stuck into older people. They are getting stuck into older people who need nursing home beds. Today we have found that they are getting stuck into people who need public housing. There are many older people PAPERS who need public housing. Just for the information of the Treasurer (Mr Costello), this side of the House will always stand up for public housing tenants. Unlike the· government, this side of the House was always going to require the states to maintain their level of public housing. This is a very sorry day for older Australians, because it arises from the way this government is acting towards them. This government-and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in particular-has made a constant refrain about its concern for the situation of the vulnerable and the needy, constantly reiterating that, no matter what draconian actions they conceive as being necessary for the nation's affairs, 'One group in the community that's not going to be hurt is the most vulnerable.' It might come as news to the Prime Minister or even to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), but their actions as a government-and, more importantly, their failure to act as a governmentare causing considerable hurt and concern to large numbers of older Australians. Sometimes of course it is true that a government is faced with making difficult but necessary decisions. When this is the case, it is incumbent on a government to make sure that it does two things. Firstly, it has to clearly explain what it proposes to do and exactly how this will impact on people's lives. This is necessary to avoid the spread of unnecessary or exaggerated speculative alarm. Secondly, it must ensure that the effect of the action is spread as equitably as possible-that to no one group or sector suffers an excessive or unfair amount of pain. It goes without saying that this applies to members of the community who could be considered to be needy or vulnerable. But in this government's ham-fisted, clumsy attempts to bring some measure of reform to aged care, what we see is dramatic evidence of a failure to understand, let alone engage with these basic precepts of good government. Along the way, we see the inflicting of a great deal of unnecessary pain on older Australians and people in the most vulnerable stage of their lives. This government's decision to force older Australians to find an average of $26,000 to enter a nursing home is cruel and uncaring. It demonstrates in the clearest way that this government, despite all its rhetoric about concern for families and the vulnerable, is actually totally indifferent to the plight of older Australians. Let us have a look at this issue in specifics. Let us go to the source document that the minister herself has used, the Review of the Structure of Nursing Home Funding Arrangements by Professor Gregory. The Gregory report, which is the report the minister took such delight in using to try to score cheap points against our side of the House three months ago, contains damning indictments against this government's proposals for nursing home care-most particularly, the proposal to insist on an entry contribution averaging $26,000. Professor Gregory considered the option that the government has chosen of using entry contributions to raise money for capital upgrades of nursing home stock. However, he rejected the idea, and I would like to read out his reasons for doing so. He said: The sheer size of entry contributions and the impact on a client's life of having to agree to assets to receive care would be a considerable barrier to entry. Professor Gregory went on to say: . . . the substantial increase in the amount that could be paid by allowing entry contributions seems too harsh a measure. The reason Professor Gregory came to this view goes to the heart of the major fault with this government's proposed entry fee system. This must have seemed a very neat solution for the government. They thought, 'Hostels charge an entry contribution, so let's just extend it to nursing homes.' Well, such quickfix, policy making on the run options do not work. The reason this particular decision is such a disaster comes down to a basic failure of understanding of the essential difference between nursing homes and hostels. It does not seem to have occurred to those opposite that nursing homes and hostels are not the same thing. People do not simply make a choice at a certain stage of life between hostels and nursing homes. True, people do usually make a conscious choice about moving into a hostel, but usually it is a choice about lifestyle and accommodation. It is a choice about where they want to live. There is usually no urgency or real pressure, and there may be other options to consider-such as, increased services from home and community care or staying with a son or daughter. But nursing homes are different. People do not choose to go to a nursing home. People go into a nursing home because they need care, because they are unable to look after themselves, because they are vulnerable and, most of all, because they need to. Professor Gregory cites this fact as a fundamental reason for rejecting entry contributions. He said: The circumstances under which clients seek access to nursing homes are considerably different from hostel clients. The following is a most telling statistic from his report: Approximately 60% of nursing home admissions are from hospitals. This is one indicator of the fact that nursing home entry is often urgent, motivated overwhelmingly by the need for nursing care. sell In this view, Professor Gregory is supported more recently by Anna Howe, an associate professor in health sciences at La Trobe University. Recently, in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald, she said: The decision to move to a nursing home is, sadly, about where the last few weeks or months of life will be spent. For two out of three, this move comes after an acute hospital stay. As well as severe physical disabilities, three out of four nursing home residents have a degree of mental impairment. With assessment by a multi-disciplinary Aged Care Assessment Team a prerequisite to admission, all other options have been exhausted. She went on to say: Those who move to a nursing home directly from the community have mostly been supported by family carers, usually living in the same house. The ingoing chargethat this government wants to imposewould fall as a very uneven penalty on those carers whose relatives need long-term care while others with different health problems can receive far more costly acute hospital care free of charge. It is these differences which mean that the system of charges applying to hostels cannot be simply extended to nursing homes. But there may be an element of choice. Let us have a think about what the element of choice is that this government is seeking to impose on families. It will be the stark choice of deciding how much they are prepared to sacrifice for the level of care to be provided for their family member needing nursing home care. The minister says that no-one will have to sell their home to gain entry to a nursing home. She has even gone so far as to threaten to withdraw accreditation from any nursing home that forces the sale of a home to pay the $26,000. These are fighting words indeed. It will be interesting to see how the minister follows up on the report on Lateline last week of the lady in Ballarat who, desperate and with a husband needing admission to a nursing home and a totally dependent 40-year-old handicapped son, when she approached the local nursing home that had agreed to take her husband, says that they demanded that she sign her house over to the nursing home in order to secure her husband's entry. Some choice! The real choices are these. She could find another nursing home. As we know, that is very difficult indeed. She could keep her husband at home and try to cope with his increasing needs as well as coping with her handicapped son or sell her house and try to find alternative accommodation for her son and herself. These are the kinds of choices that the minister's ill-advised and poorly thought out reforms are giving to older Australians and their families. Another area of real concern in regard to the way people gain access to nursing homes has to do with the fact that the $26,000 is only an average figure. The policy is based on that of hostels. But that average means that a lot of people are going to pay a lot more. An elderly person in my own electorate said to me just last week that she had to pay $96,000 to secure a place in hostels. That is what they will be paying for nursing homes-$96,000 tops. How can any minister say that someone who needs nursing home care should be faced with that sort of choice? As Professors Gregory and Howe have shown, people entering nursing homes are, sadly, at the end of their lives, the majority entering from acute hospitals and, more often than not, with a considerable degree of mental impairment. These people are not in any position to negotiate. So who will the job fall to? It will fall to family members, usually daughters, who are likely to be experiencing very strong emotions at the serious illnesses of their loved ones. In these circumstances many people are going to feel under extreme pressure to find the best level of care they can for their loved one. While selling the family home may not be a legal necessity to gain a nursing home bed, it may well be a choice families feel they have to make. A factor influencing this choice will be the quality of nursing homes. To downplay these factors, to say that people are going to have to sell their homes to raise $26,000, is an outrageous and callous decision on the part of this government. What will the situation be for people who have no families to fall back on? Who will do the negotiating? This government, as we are seeing so early in its time, is in love with the concept of the market, but I for one did not think that we would be seeing the concept of the market extended to nursing homes. The government's agenda is to run the public sector down to nothing and have the private sector take over. To have this market orientation, this negotiation over an entry contribution, facing somebody who has just had a stroke, who is completely mentally impaired, is a nonsensical idea. There is no market for nursing homes. Surely the minister knows, even given the short time she has been in this portfolio, that this sector is highly regulated. We have a limited number of places available. It is restricted region by region in Australia. You cannot get into a nursing home without passing an assessment test. This is not market forces. This is not level playing fields. What we are talking about here is need. Let us go back to Professor Gregory. The effectiveness of market forces is severely limited because the demand for nursing home beds exceeds the supply in almost all areas. Approximately 60 per cent of admissions are from hospitals. Almost 60 per cent of nursing home residents suffer some degree of cognitive or behavioural deficit and many have no relatives willing to look after their interests. Most potential residents and their relatives have little knowledge of what is appropriate nursing home care and many do not have the time to adequately assess a number of facilities prior to admission. What Professor Gregory has written in bold type in his report is that 'market forces cannot playa significant role in ensuring quality of care'. That is the advice from Professor Gregory. It is high time that we took a bit of notice of his advice. We will by this measure be exposing care funding to the profit motive and risking the quality of care. It is time that this government got rid of this callous proposal. It is also time that the minister came clean and told this House that she knows that the average is $26,000. She knows that her department has advised me, has advised her adviser, has advised her, that the average is $26,000. Mrs Moylan-That's not relevant.",81
219,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I hope the older people of Australia have just heard this minister say it is not relevant that they will have to pay $26,000, that she does not care what they will have to pay.",84
220,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The government's budget included five measures that will directly benefit the frail and elderly in our communities. There will be the residential aged care structural reform package, the maintenance of six per cent real growth in home and community care funding, more respite care and a national respite for carers program and the expansion of funding for the community aged care packages by 59 per cent to $52 million, which will allow for an additional 1,800 packages to be delivered, a healthy seniors initiative and a conference for older Australians. The previous Labor government ignored the needs of the frail and elderly in our community. By their actions in publicly stating that they will be blocking this government's aged care structural reform package, they are prepared to condemn older Australians to a residential aged care system that is in decline and not capable of satisfying the demands of our ageing population. I have here today the 1996 policy document of the Australian Labor Party with 'Leadership' on the bottom. Some leadership! They have given absolutely no leadership in the area of aged care. Their policy in relation to innovation in aged care and community care had just eight paragraphs. This is an industry that is in crisis, this is an industry that has been in decline for 10 years and the best they can do in the policy which they went to the last election with is eight paragraphs. Professor Bob Gregory identified in his report that our residential aged care sector was in serious decline, that there was a capital crisis in nursing homes and that too many of these homes would not pass basic fire and safety standards. The Australian people need to understand that the Labor government sat on its hands. It did nothing. It had no blueprint. It allocated eight paragraphs in its policy paper to a very serious and a very important matter for the most vulnerable and the most frail in our community. It is hypocritical in the extreme for the shadow minister to enter this parliament and wring her hands at the fact that this government has accepted the responsibility for fixing the mess that Labor created and Labor left. The government's residential aged care structural reform package is built on the unification of the nursing home and hostel systems. The government's vision for residential care is based on: high quality care for everyone, regardless of income or location; a national aged care standards agency with providers and consumers working together to own the system of accreditation with government, to ensure quality care and to take strong action against poor performance; a focus on and incentive for excellence; more choice and flexibility for older people; government funding which matches care needs, no matter where in the system people are accommodated; and a system that encourages ageing in place and removes the need for residents to transfer between hostels and nursing homes. Our vision and our blueprint for residential aged care is based on appropriate funding for dementia care; flexibility to allow providers to continue caring for people as their needs change; providers who have time to care instead of trying to cope with red tape and paperwork; a system which is affordable but which asks for a fair and reasonable contribution from those residents who have the means and can afford to make a small contribution themselves; and access to care based on need, not the ability to pay, with strong safeguards for financially disadvantaged people. The government's package will ensure a high quality of care and sustainability in the system for coming decades. The government is committed to ensuring that our aged care system can meet the needs of an ageing population. The system that we inherited from Labor was simply not sustainable. There has been a lot of speCUlation about the government's budget measures and speculation and scaremongering about income testing, about entry contributions and about hostel viability, to name a few. Sadly, this has only served to unnecessarily scare older Australians. The government's reform package has focused public attention on our nursing home sector, and rightly so. What this government is putting in place will ensure a sustainable future for aged care in this country. However, in doing so we have also exposed Labor's lack of action and lack of commitment in this area and their absolute disregard for the welfare of the frail and elderly in our community. The best that Labor can offer is a scaremongering campaign. The best they could offer in their policy document was eight paragraphs. Let me correct some of the misunderstandings about the entry contribution system. This government has taken the decision to extend entry contributions to nursing homes to address the capital crisis that exists now and to stimulate investment in quality accommodation and care for older Australians. In unifying the nursing home and hostel systems we have looked closely at what works and what does not work. In the hostel system we looked at entry contribution fees, and it has worked. It has provided a very high standard of accommodation. The differences between those entering nursing homes and hostels today has narrowed significantly. My department tells me that nearly 50 per cent of those people currently in hostels could possibly be eligible for entry into a nursing home. The profiles have changed and there is little differentiation today between the two. The entry contribution fee was originally introduced by the previous Labor government in 1988. It was supported by us and it has been operating successfully for many years. It is essentially the same hostel system we are extending to the nursing home sector. For residents entering a nursing home after 1 July 1997, let me reiterate the government's budget initiative in respect of entry contributions: entry contributions are not compulsory; the amount of the entry contribution is not fixed by government; people will not be forced to sell their homes to get a bed in a nursing home; financially disadvantaged people cannot be charged an entry contribution fee; and people will not have to pay the contribution before they get a bed. In response to the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), if the example she used is in fact correct, it is correct under a system that they introduced and they ran. If the member for Jagajaga would like to give me the details of that particular case, I will have my department follow it up. Ms Macklin-It was on the news last week!",84
221,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If you would like to get me details I will follow it up. The fact is that people who want a bed in a nursing home have to be assessed by the aged care assessment team. That is the first point of entry. It has got nothing to do with whether they have got the money; it has got everything to do with what standard of care they need. In addition, there are safeguards in the current system. There is an advocacy service that can deal with those kinds of complaints. Only people who stay longer than six months will have to pay an entry contribution. My department estimates that only 45 per cent of those who are in nursing homes for more than six months will pay an entry contribution fee. Residents or their estates will get much of the contribution refunded. Regardless of what that contribution is, the provider is only able to draw down a maximum of $2,600 per annum for five years-a total contribution of $13,000. The opposition raises the $26,000 all the time. The figure of $26,000 that was quoted in the media and that the opposition keeps throwing up as a figure that everyone will have to payMs Macklin-Everyone will have to pay it.",85
222,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"She says that everyone will have to pay it. That is incorrect to start with. It comes from a 1993 inter-hostel financial comparison survey which was done while the opposition was in government. It represents the average entry contribution paid in those hostels that charged entry contributions. It was the average in the 1993 inter-hostel financial comparison survey. That survey was available during your term of government. The $130 million will be raised, as I have said a number of times in this House, on the basis that 45 per cent of those eligible residents, that is, those who are in a nursing home for over six months, will pay $2,600 maximum per year, which will be a maximum of $13,000 over a five-year period. Providers cannot charge a contribution which would leave the resident with assets of less than 2V2 times the annual pension. Nobody will be forced to sell their home to gain entry into a nursing home. Entry contributions will provide both the means and the incentives for providers to dramatically improve the quality of aged care and the infrastructure. Access to care for financially disadvantaged people will also be protected. The government will pay a higher subsidy for people who cannot afford an entry contribution to act as an incentive 'for providers. This will ensure that quality aged care is available for all Australians. There will be no two-tiered system under the government's policy. Pensioner couples whose only asset is their home will not have to sell it when one of them enters a nursing home. While people should be allowed to exercise some choice over their accommodation and services, as they do in every other facet of their lives, we will ensure access and quality of care for all. There will be a strong and effective protection in place for residents. Labor failed to understand and address the shift in balance of care which has occurred in the past decade or two. Hostels are not the same as they were even 10 years ago. Hostels today are caring for more dependent people, particularly those who are suffering from severe forms of dementia, and the levels of government subsidy for those residents is inadequate to meet the needs of this growing area today . Yet under Labor's system you do not always get the appropriate level of funding to care for these people, nor do you get the funding you need to care for those with severe dementia. This is a very severe gap. A person in a nursing home can be funded more than a person with the same or even higher dependency levels in a hostel. This is hardly an equitable system. In developing the single resident classification and funding scale we will achieve a better match between funding and care needs. This will alleviate the pressure for those hostels which are currently caring for people with severe dementia or a high physical frailty without adequate funding. The structural reform package is good policy. It is putting the provision of quality aged care first. It is also a coherent package with each element meshing together to achieve a broader objective. It is not something that can be approached on a piecemeal basis. The government has had to take some tough decisions in difficult circumstances. These are decisions that Labor could not make. We are not going to sit on our hands like Labor did and watch nursing home building quality deteriorate further. The government's package offers the opportunity to keep Australia at the forefront of the world's aged care systems and to ensure quality of care and quality of life older Australians for decades to come. The frail aged in our communities deserve much better attention than that provided by the previous Labor government, who have stood there and criticised our policy and yet came up with absolutely no solutions of their own. This is a system which has been going into decline for over a decade. Our nursing home system is falling down. Yet these people sat on their hands and did absolutely nothing about it. The frail aged in our community deserve much better. Labor's last budget allocated $12.9 million for capital fundingMs Macklin-What is your allocation?",86
223,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have allocated $40 million. Labor had no blueprint and no plans to fix what is a system in decline. This government will not abrogate its responsibilities to the frail and the elderly in our community. We will not walk away. We have inherited a system that is in decline and a system that is in shambles and we will not walk away from those responsibilities. We will take the tough decisions. We will ask people to make a small contribution where they can afford to make a contribution. That contribution will be no more than $13,000 over a five-year period-$2,600 per annum is the maximum that anyone will have to pay under our structural aged care reform package.

227,Mr OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Corio) (4.15 p.m.}-I am absolutely amazed that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) did not take the opportunity to explain to this House why aged Australians and veterans are going to suffer a $26,000 slug to get into a nursing home. This is an issue of great social concern to the people of Australia and to older Australians. I observe that there are only eight or nine government members and only one minister in the House. They have really left the minister hanging out to dry. Her political carcass is out there swinging in the wind and they will not even come into the House to defend her. I pose one question to the minister. I notice that she is over on the sidelines there. There has been a handpass to a minister in the worse position. She has been given the worse policy decision to carry on the floor of this House. I can understand her moving off the floor to talk to the advisers but, as the debate on the first Howard budget proceeds in this parliament, the opposition's initial assessment that it is indeed a budget of betrayal has been confirmed time and time again. As the opposition has probed the fine detail of the budget, especially the detail in relation to the $26,000 slug on older Australians, several things have become apparent. Firstly, the extent to which key constituencies have been dudded by the government has been somewhat understated in our initial assessment. Secondly, it has been become painfully obvious that many government ministers have not been across the detail of their portfolio and have not the slightest clue as to the extent of the damage they are doing to key constituencies such as older people in this country. One by one substantial promises made to various groups in our society have been cynically broken in this budget. Key promises to youth have been broken. Key promises to the unemployed have been broken. Key commitments to people living in rural and regional communities have been broken. Key promises to indigenous Australians have been broken. But nothing compares with the deep sense of betrayal felt by the aged and sick Australians and our veterans' community after this budget. As the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), has already pointed out, the confidence of older Australians has been shattered by the decision of the government to force those in need of nursing home care to pay an up-front fee of up to $26,000 to enter a nursing home. It is this measure which will penalise many veterans, war widows and TPI pensioners throughout Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made a very explicit promise in the election campaign. It was very clear. It was unequivocal. It was simply this: one group in the community that is not going to be hurt is the most vulnerable. We on this side of the House know that any promise that the Prime Minister makes is not worth a tinker's cuss. We know that he cannot lie straight in bed when he makes a promise to the Australian people, but older Australians, veterans and TPI pensioners are more trusting. They actually believe a Prime Minister when he says that he will protect them, but what they got from the Prime Minister was a betrayal. What they got was a $26,000 slug to enter a nursing home. It is not only the $26,000 nursing home fee for some veterans and TPI pensioners that has really affected them. The government has also jacked up the cost of their prescription pharmaceuticals by 20 per cent. They have introduced an additional income tested charge of 25c in the dollar above the pension free area. They have abolished the dental health program which has been used by many veterans. The government, through cuts of $88 million to HACC funding, has ensured that veterans and war widows will pay more for these services. I want to contrast Labor's term of office with barely the six months that the coalition has been in office. During our time in office we maintained and improved the pensions and the entitlements of our veteran communities over time. Labor also set in place a $50 million package of measures in the aged care area for veterans. In my own electorate, in the term of the last parliament the Bellarine hostel for the aged would not have got up as a proposal, would not have been built, without the $220,000 contribution from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I pay tribute to the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca. He is acknowledged by the veterans community as the best there has ever been. I do not mean any offence to any former veterans' affairs ministers on this side of the House or the other. However, the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), may have very big shoes to fill, but if this budget is any indication he has already failed the test. The government have made great play of the fact that they have maintained pensions and entitlements in this budget. That is the very least they could have expected to do for our ageing veteran community, and they have provided some smaller additional funding in certain areas which the opposition fully supports. But it is in the other portfolio areas that some very real damage has been done to Australia's veteran community. It is the failure of the veterans' affairs minister to stand up for veterans while other ministers, including the Minister for Family Services, hatched their plots to hit the veterans of this nation with extra imposts and charges. Where was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs when the Minister for Family Services hatched her policy to slug veterans with a $26,000 fee to enter a nursing home after 1 July 1997? Where was he when the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) increased by 50c the pharmaceutical costs for each prescription? Where was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs when the government decided to reduce its contribution to the home and community care program by $88 million-a decision that ultimately will pump up the cost of this service to veterans? Where was the minister when the government made the decision to subject veterans and war widows to an additional charge of 25c in the dollar above the pension free area? For some older Australians, that could mean an impost of up to $238 per week. The simple fact is that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs went missing. When we asked about this matter in the House yesterday, I really did feel sorry for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. We asked a question on nursing home fees of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). Of course, in typical fashion before this House, the Acting Prime Minister handballed this question to a minister in a worse position than himself-a real hospital handpass. What did the Minister for Veterans' Affairs say? He said: We are currently, through my department. talking to the Minister for Family Services on this issue of how it will affect our veteran community. He didn't even know, when this proposal was put in the budget, the damage it was going to do to the veteran community. He is still going to talk, talk, talk to the Minister for Family Services about what it is going to do. She doesn't know what is going on. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs does not know what is going on. We can't get a decent answer to questions we ask on this matter in this House. We just had it here in this debate today. The minister goes ducking and weaving yet again. Mr Crean-Won't answer.",87

Wouldn't it have been wonderful if we could have inherited a well set in place aged care system? But we didn't. We will face up to that responsibility. We did not create the mess-we are constantly finding the mess that has been made-but we will accept the responsibility to clean it up. Labor ignored three reports.",89
232,Dr NELSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They are ignoring this, too.",89
233,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They are ignoring this. Under Labor, the capital nursing home stock reached an all-time low. I refer to Professor Gregory. I am reliably informed by the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) today that in this very place the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) called Professor Gregory 'that eminent Australian economist'. That eminent Australian economist and other reports found that this stock was at an all-time low. There were also major problems with the Australian design standards, fire standards, health standards and outcome standards in nursing homes. That eminent economist found that there was $36 million needed to meet fire standards, $42 million needed to meet health standards and $540 million needed to meet Australian design standards. Did Labor take any notice of that? No. Professor Gregory also found that there $520 million needed to meet outcome standards. Eighteen per cent of all residents in nursing homes were living in rooms with five or more beds. There was a critical situation where residents with walking frames could not even be fitted through doors into toilets and bathrooms. That is the standard things were at under Labor. In the past, more government funding has been provided per day to keep people in prison than has been provided to care for our elderly and frail Australians who did so much in many cases for this country. Professor Gregory, the eminent Australian - conomist, found that there was a lack of incentive to maintain good quality nursing home stock and that the reason for the lack incentive was the funding system. The standard of the nursing homes had never been part of that funding arrangement. One report found that 75 per cent of nursing homes would have to be rebuilt to meet standards. The policy of entry fees to nursing homes is based on Labor's policy of entry fees to hostels. The $26,000 figure that is being waved about the place is worked out on the average paid by 40 per cent of hostel residents who actually pay anything to enter a hostel. No real figure has been arrived at there is a simply nasty scare beat-up campaign under way from those people who could not solve any of the problems I have alluded to--not one of them. They are now attempting to terrify people, but nobody will believe them any more. We all saw what happened on 2 March this year. The hostel model Labor introduced has proved popular for many. A significant number of residents in hostels choose to pay because it provides them with choice-{;hoice of standards and choice of the type of accommodation they can go into. If the standard of accommodation is raised in nursing homes as it has been for hostels, then every person who will find themselves a resident of those nursing homes will benefit, not just those who have been more fortunate in life than others. The government has very clearly said that the financially disadvantaged will not have to pay, but that has not been mentioned in was arguments from the other side today. They choose to ignore it and choose to say what they hope will sink in and frighten. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has said that pensioner couples will not have to sell their home should one be required to enter a nursing home. There is a message for younger people in the policy direction that we are taking. They must think about the aged care that they might require one day; they cannot just blow everything as they go through life and expect taxpayers to pay for their care. Since 1987 nursing home fees have been the same for everyone-that is, 87.5 per cent of the pension. This is the same for someone who might just happen to be on a Kerry of Packer type of income as it is for a full pensioner who has always lived throughout their life in public housing and had no capacity to save for their future care. As I have said before in this place, I have never had any confidence that Labor planned in any way for the future. It is not always easy to predict the future, but an ageing population is something that was always there to be seen for all. ABS figures predicted that the over-65-year-old population will rise to four million in this country by the year 2001. and This has huge long-term implications for public policy and requires responsible government action. At some stage five per cent of all of us will end up in a nursing home. When the entry fee is paid-that does not happen for six months, and there is no indication yet that it will be that $26,000 that has been bandied about-the money does not go to the government. It stays with the institution, it stays in the system and the interest on that is used to improve stock. Residents or their estates will get much of the contribution refunded when they leave the facility. Providers are only able to draw down a maximum of $2,600 per year over a five-year period. That maximum over five years is $13,000. There is just one thing that I will agree with that has been raised on the other side today. Sadly, these days people who go into nursing homes usually do not go there to come out and go back to their own homes. That is just a sad fact of life. Many of them will not be there for longer than six months. That is also a sad fact, but very relevant when we are discussing amounts of money and how these arrangements will be made. Ms Macklin-You're the ones who say $130 million will be raised.",89
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Vail e)Order! The member has Jagajaga has had her chance.,91
235,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I remind the member for Jagajaga of the comments I made when I first spoke. I mentioned Professor Gregory, this great economist that we keep hearing about.",91
236,Dr NELSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,And other reports.,91
237,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Exactly. There are two other reports as well. It has not just been the coalition that has had to think about these things. There have been reports which were called upon by the former Labor government, and that is where all that information is. It was never acted upon and never planned for the future. An ageing population, which was entirely obvious to all other thinking people, was never planned for. Hostels have been mentioned. They are a very important component of aged care facilities. Their accommodation has improved dramatically. I am very pleased about that. The government has no plans whatsoever for reducing their viability. I pay particular compliments to those people in the not-forprofit sector who provide well over 95 per cent of that style of accommodation. The framework has been established by the minister; she has given it to you today. She says, I say and others say that there is still detail to be finalised. Unlike Labor, the minister is consulting with consumers and the industry. I am consulting with the industry myself. I am fortunate to readily have excellent advice available to me from the industry in my electorate. None of the problems are easy to solve, but the minister has at least made a start. That is something that Labor never, ever did. Veterans have been mentioned today in an attempt to once again emotionalise this debate. The largest number of veterans who are seeking aged care are paying for it or getting it under exactly the same criteria as others who are not veterans. But the coalition still recognises the very important role that veterans have paid in our community and our country, and $10 million is set aside for their aged care. They have not been neglected. It is an emotive part of the argument to bring them into it. I condemn the opposition for the way they are trying to frighten older Australians. They should be working with us on this. They messed up for 13 years. Ms Macklin-You're the ones that are charging them.",91
238,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Jagajaga has had her tum.,91

240,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The time for this discussion has expired. SYDNEY 2000 GAMES (INDICIA AND IMAGES) PROTECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Moore, and read a first time. Second Reading",91
241,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Ryan-Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism) (4.35 p.m.}-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The legislative changes made by the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill 1996 will make it easier for the organisers of the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games and licensed users to take action against those persons who are engaged in ambush marketing. Ambush marketing is the unauthorised association of businesses with the marketing of an event such as the Sydney Olympics. Typically, the ambush marketeer seeks to gain some benefit by suggesting an association with an event without paying for the marketing right or licensing fee. The Olympic and Paralympic Games in the year 2000 are events of great national significance for Australia. These events provide unique opportunities to demonstrate to the world this country's skills, talents, environment and achievements. One of the critical factors in making the games an outstanding success is the ability of the organisers, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, known as SOCOG, and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee, known as SPOC, to raise the funds necessary to host the games. It is a massive task. It is also very expensive. The cost of staging the games is estimated to be over $2 billion. It will be shared between the organising committees, the government of New South Wales and, to a minor extent, the Commonwealth Government through its commitment to share half the expected deficit on the Paralympics, up to a maximum of $25 million. The Commonwealth government's overall budgetary contribution to the staging of the games will exceed $400 million. It is expected that the revenue raised from official sponsorships and licensing fees would need to be of the order of $700 million to meet the SOCOG and SPOC budget for the games. The ability of SOCOG and SPOC to attract sponsors depends to a large extent on the exclusivity of the licensed indicia and images. If adequate steps are not taken against ambush marketing, the official sponsorship revenue could be significantly eroded. Ambush marketing was a problem in Atlanta, and we want to avoid the problem here. For example, two major international organisations which did not have licensing agreements with the Atlanta Olympic organisers both attracted large numbers of people to their respective sports pavilion and interactive theatre while implying an association with the Atlanta Games. . On 28 June 1996, this government brought III the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996, which was designed to protect the Sydney Olympic and Paralympic Games against ambush marketing. Although the government was aware at the time that the legislation could possibly require some amendment, the need to have the legislation in place before the Atlanta Games commenced made the immediate introduction and passage of the legislation a necessity. Having the legislation in place enabled SOCOG and SPOC to take advantage of the major marketing opportunity afforded by the Atlanta Games. The government also believed that amending the legislation at a later date rather than during the passage of the principal bill would also ensure that there was adequate time for consultation with games organisers and other interest groups. The act presently provides protection for the Olympic and Paralympic Games against ambush marketing through the regulation of the use for commercial purposes of the indicia and images associated with the games. However, for trade in domestically produced goods, the act as it stands enables action only to be taken against the person who applied the indicia and images to the goods or services. This may make it difficult for effective action to be taken against some who may engage in ambush marketing activities. The amendments contained in this bill will enable games organisers and licensed users to take action against retailers, distributors or other parties in the supply chain rather than having to pursue through the supply chain the unauthorised person who applied the indicia or images to the goods or services. Furthermore, the amendments will enable SOCOG, SPOC and licensed users to take action against those who aid, abet, counsel and procure breaches of the legislation. In other words, it will be possible to take action against persons whose involvement in the contravention of the legislation is in the nature of assisting in the unauthorised application of indicia and images rather than in their direct application. These measures greatly improve the operation of the legislation and help ensure the preservation of the games marketing revenues. As well as protecting the revenue of the games against ambush marketing, they help ensure that the interests of legitimate retailers are protected from less scrupulous competition. Retailers, distributors and other parties will need to check to ensure that the person who applied the indicia or images to the goods or services is licensed. To do this, they need to check the register of licensed users located at SOCOG's office in Sydney or the state offices of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation to ensure that the person is entered on the register. In preparing the bill, the government consulted extensively with the games organisers and other interest groups, in particular, retailers. To make it easier for retailers and others to ensure that the goods they receive have the indicia or images applied to them by a licensed user, SOCOG proposes to provide easy access to the register of licensed users of the indicia and images, to disseminate widely information on the legislation and on who the licensed users are, and to provide a sophisticated identification system for genuine products. In the public awareness campaign, SOCOG will be advertising in various media, and licensees will be required to advertise in trade catalogues and similar outlets. Retail and other industry associations have agreed to cooperate with SOCOG in the dissemination of information so that the public is aware and understands the legislation as it relates to the licensing of users of the protected indicia and images. I believe that with these amendments the legislation represents a balanced and workable approach that will protect the Olympic and Paralympic Games against ambush marketing without placing an undue burden on business. In saying this, I am confident that industry, SOCOG and SPOC will work together in a cooperative manner which will add greatly to the effectiveness of the legislation and help ensure a good budget outcome is achieved for the Sydney 2000 Games. These provisions, together with those in the principal act, will cease to operate after 31 December 2000, following the completion of the games. There will be no additional cost to the government of administering this legislation. Mr Deputy Speaker, the sponsorship program for the games has already begun with Telstra and IBM contributing $100 million as part of the corporate sponsorship effort. We must protect the sponsorship revenue. The government believes the additional protection provided by this bill will enhance and complement the protective measures already in place under the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996 and the current intellectual property laws, and that it will help in making the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games a sound financial success for Australia. I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin) adjourned. NA NA BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Dr Kemp, and read a first time. Second Reading",91
242,Dr KEMP,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (4.44 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Commonwealth funding for the vocational education and training sector for 1996 has already been appropriated under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. This bill would provide for supplementation of the 1996 amount in line with normal price adjustments. The bill would also assure a Commonwealth contribution of $891 million in 1997 for vocational education and training. Although this is a reduction of the previously legislated amount, it would still provide an increase of $10.6 million over 1996 funding. Care has been taken in identifying the savings to ensure that they have minimum impact on training opportunities. This reflects the Commonwealth's emphasis on growth in student places, particularly for young people. Funding for 1997 includes the provision of $70 million for growth funds. The Commonwealth expects states and territories to continue to honour their undertakings spelled out in the Australian National Training Authority agreement, including maintaining their own effort in the vocational education and training sector. The bill would also appropriate funding for 1998, in accordance with the Commonwealth's undertaking in the ANTA agreement to provide triennial funding for the vocational education and training sector. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerr) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Bruce Scott, and read a first time. Second Reading",93
243,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,VETERANS AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The veterans' affairs 1996 budget package honours key pre-election promises to the veteran community. It provides for simpler and more flexible entitlements. It is fair, with better access to services and more assistance to help veterans help themselves. The government's commitment recognises Australia's debt of gratitude to our veteran community, who served us so selflessly in times of conflict. The major initiatives cover the areas of health care, housing, rehabilitation, compensation and commemoration. In particular, a number of anomalies will be removed from the system, resulting in more efficient administration and simplified service delivery. Before discussing the bill in detail, I would like to foreshadow a key initiative now under development in my portfolio to improve the delivery of services to veterans. One group of veterans and war widows we have found to be disadvantaged, simply because of where they live, are those in rural areas. They are remote from the services that many in the city take for granted. Ready access to information and services is vital for all veterans, but especially important to those in country areas. In response to this particular need, I will announce in October a health policy for the veteran community in rural and remote areas. It comprises some innovative, cost-effective ways to make more information, health and community services available in rural and remote areas. The policy will ensure continuing improvement in the provision of health care and support to the veteran community. A number of other health initiatives, which do not require legislative action, will also be implemented as soon as practicable. For example, veterans will now have a greater choice than ever before in the range of spectacle frames available to them. Multifocal lenses will also be available to those who prefer them. Veterans who require special footwear will find it more convenient to obtain their shoes and the necessary repairs. Veterans living in remote areas who need medical grade footwear can be issued with three pairs at one time. This will mean that they will no longer have to regularly travel long distances to get the shoes they need. Eligible veterans will now also be able to use any footwear repairer contracted by the Department of Veterans' Affairs for repairs to their medical grade footwear. This means veterans will have greater access to repair services in locations convenient for them. Funding will be made available to provide Australian merchant mariners with access to an asbestos screening program. This is designed to assist in the detection of illness related to asbestos exposure. Our World War II Australian mariners have not been eligible for an existing asbestos exposure screening program which is available to current and past members of the armed services and its civilian employees. This measure will ensure that all eligible veterans have equal access to the same services. The list of eligible drugs contained in the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme will be reviewed. This will ensure the best results from the pharmaceutical treatment provided to veterans and war widows. A major review of the medication program for high risk veterans will also take place. The aim of this review is to reduce inappropriate prescription and medication use and improve their quality of life and health options. I tum now to the measures contained in the bill. The coalition is committed to the fair and equitable treatment of veterans and will continue to ensure that inconsistencies and anomalies in the Veterans' Entitlements Act are removed. The current asset value of allocated pension investments will be taken into account for the purposes of the assets test. This is how they have been treated under social security legislation for some time. It is unfair that some people could gain increased income support by entering into particular investment arrangements. As announced in the budget, these changes will apply to any allocated pension investment entered into after 20 August 1996. Some of the other income support changes in this bill reflect similar changes being made by Social Security. The deeming rules will be changed to make them less complex. For money held as cash or on deposit, a deemed interest rate, currently five per cent, will be applied to the first $2,000 for single pensioners and $4,000 for couples. This change will simplify pensioner notification requirements because individuals will no longer need to advise about small interest fluctuations. This has been perceived as intrusive. For some pensioners the change will provide an opportunity to increase their overall income. We will adjust the way lump sum compensation payments are treated. The calculation for the preclusion period for a pension payable to a person who has not reached pension age is to be changed. The compensation payment will be divided by the maximum amount of income that a pensioner can earn before the pension ceases to be payable. This will determine how long it will be before pension payments can be made. The partner of a person in receipt of lump sum compensation payments will no longer have a preclusion period applied to their pension payments. I am very pleased that the Victoria Cross allowance is to be increased. A rate of $2,700 will now be paid to our three surviving recipients each year. It is to be backdated to 17 August 1995 which was the date from which the British Government increased the Victoria Cross allowance it pays. Another anomaly we will correct relates to funeral benefits. A payment will be able to be made for costs associated with the transportation of the remains of a veteran who dies in financial need away from home when obtaining approved medical treatment. This assistance is available for certain other veterans who have died away from home. This bill makes several positive reforms that correct a number of anomalies in the Defence Services Homes Act 1918. Veterans who have previously been assisted through the Defence Service Homes Scheme because of their own service and who are widowers of World War II ex-servicewomen are currently not entitled to a second loan based on their status as widowers. On the other hand, World War II widows who are also ex-servicewomen can receive this assistance. This anomaly will be removed and these men will now be entitled to a second loan. The rate of interest for additional advances under the Defence Service Homes Scheme will be reduced. This will allow new borrowers to use their full entitlements over time for purposes such as home repairs or modifications, without having to pay what is effectively a penalty interest rate. This measure will assist eligible persons to maintain their homes and remain in them for as long as they wish. Eligibility for loans under the Defence Services Homes Act is to be extended to those who first enlisted in the Defence Force before 15 May 1985 and have not served more than six years but had operational service in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia or Somalia. To date, this group of veterans has been denied assistance, even though their colleagues who enlisted later and served in the same areas have been able to obtain loans under the defence home owner scheme. This bill will make several other changes that will simplify administration of veterans' benefits and improve the service provided to veterans. A minimum variation rate, initially set at $1.00, will apply to income support payments. This means that variations in a pensioner's income and level of assets will not affect his or her rate of pension unless consequential changes in the rate of pension are at least $1.00 in either direction. There will be no need for pensioners to advise the department about small changes in their income levels. This will eliminate unnecessary administration and also reduce the level of intrusion into veterans' lives. Modifications will be made to the pension advance scheme which will also improve administrative efficiency. Applicants will now be able to receive one advance per year but will no longer be required to provide information about how the advance is to be used. Changes have also been made to correct an anomaly in the advance payment scheme. War widows and widowers who receive service pension or income support supplement at a 'frozen' or 'ceiling' rate will now be able to obtain the $500 maximum allowable pension advance. The government recognises the crucial role that veterans' advocates play in the repatriation claims system. Funding will be provided to ex-service organisations so that they can employ more staff. This will be additional to training programs already provided to ex-service organisations on veteran entitlements and services. By helping to handle applications for review of pension claims to the Veterans' Review Board, these advocates will improve the efficiency of the repatriation claims process. There are many other items in the Veterans' Affairs Budget package that I have not mentioned. Another bill is expected to be introduced later this year. At that time. I will provide honourable members with further details. In the meantime, the initiatives outlined above clearly demonstrate the strong and unequivocal commitment of this government to veterans and their families. These Australians sacrificed so much for their country and contributed enormously to the freedom and way of life we all enjoy today. I commend the bill to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin) adjourned. NA NA (REGISTRA TION OF PROVIDERS AND FINANCIAL REGULATION) AMENDMENT BILL (No.1) 1996 Main Committee Report Bill returned from Main Committee without amendment; certified copy presented. Ordered that the bill be taken into consideration forthwith. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr MCLachlan)-by leave-read a third time. STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed.",94
244,Mr LATHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government's mishandling of the Premiers' Conference; (2) notes with concern the impact this Bill will have on reduced State Government services and/or higher State taxes; (3) condemns the Government's breach of its promise, given before and after the election, that State general revenue assistance would not be cut; and (4) condemns the Government's cuts to public hospitals implicit in this Bill (around $450 million) and explicit in the 1996 Budget ($312 million)"" . I note that in question time on this issue of health funding the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) attempted to pull smoke and mirrors out of his pocket and convince the House that there would be an increase in grants to the states for public hospitals. The programmed amounts in the budget, at the very best, only keep up with the rate of inflation, so there is no real increase. He can quote dollar terms, but I would suggest that there is a real decline in those grants, particuthere larly when one looks at the cost increases that public hospitals are facing. But of greater importance to the House should be the fact that there is a very specific and a very clear $312 million cut in grants to the states for public hospitals. The minister can say that it is because of cost shifting in the past, but there is still a cut this year. It does not really matter what the technical reason for that cut might be-a cut is a cut. The cut is $312 million-$3l2 million that public hospitals around Australia would have had in their budget if the government had not proceeded with that particular measure in the budget. A cut is a cut. It might relate to cost shifting in the past, but it is a cut that has its harshest impact for the future. It is also to the fact that in the provisions now before the House, the general assistance grants to the states, there was a reduction in the global funding at the Premiers Conference of $619 million in the current financial year, $640 million in 1997-98 and $300 million in 199899. That is a reduction in state revenue capacity of $1.6 billion. Given that the states allocate between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of their budgets to hospitals, you do not need to be Einstein or even the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) to work out that there is a reduction in the funding for state hospitals of the order of $450 million. If they spread the cuts equally across their state budgets, the $1.6 billion cut translates into a hospital funding cut of $450 million. So there is explicitly $312 million and implicitly in the legislation now before the House $450 million-a cut of nearly $800 million-less in public hospital funding as a product of the first budget of the HowardFischer government. I was making the point before question time that this is no answer to a suggested problem in the public hospital system in Australia. What sort of answer is it to take out $800 million of public hospital funding and then hand over $500 million per annum to the private health insurance funds? I also mentioned before question time that, in relation to private insurance in Australia, is no crisis. I mentioned I would say it until I was blue in the face and until it sank in on the other side. There is no crisis in the private health insurance sector in Australia. Let me just quote some of the figures. For all the 79 private funds their operating profit for 1995 was $142 million and for 1996 it is $61 million. For both years-this year and lasttheir total assets were of the order of $2.5 billion and their reserves were of the order of $1.3 billion. If they were profit and asset results for a small company or for a government trading enterprise in Australia or any other part of the world, that would be a resounding success. Mr MCLachlan interjecting",96
245,Mr LATHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"There would be no suggestion of crisis if a company were bringing allied in operating profits of the order of $61 million and $142 million and had assets of $2.7 billion and reserves of $1.3 billion dollars. The Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan), who is at the table, questions these things. Let me just point out to him that what matters with private insurance is not the number of people insured but the resources, the services and the utilisation that come out of private insurance that go into health expenditure in Australia and result in people being treated as patients. Mr MCLachlan-Where does it come from?",97
246,Mr LATHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,I will tell you where it comes from. It comes from private insurance and it comes from people who are insured utilising their insurance. I will quote you the figures I received to a question on notice last year. The proportion of national health expenditure funded out of health insurance funds at the introduction of Medicare in 1984 was 8.8 per cent. Is the government aware of what the proportion was in 1993-94---11.2 per cent? It had increased.,97
247,Mr KERR,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,What? Say that again.,98
248,Mr LATHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"It was 11.2 per cent. There has been an increase in the contribution that private health insurance is actually making to service delivery, service utilisation and actual That ly healing people in the health system of over two per cent of the global health budget in Australia. There is no crisis. The profits are healthy, the reserves are strong, the assets are very strong and the utilisation rate, as a share of the national health expenditure coming out of the private sector since the introduction of Medicare, has gone up. So where is the crisis in that? All you are talking about through tax rebates or a levy on higher income earners is a transfer from public resources into the funds, into the reserves, of those private health insurance organisations. So there is no crisis. Look at the figures for public acute care in hospitals. In 1984-85, 5.6 per cent was funded out of the private health insurance arrangements and in 1992-93 it was 5.7 per cent-it has gone up. Mr MCLachlan-It is the same figure.",98
249,Mr LATHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"Acute care in private hospitals was 61.4 per cent and it has gone up to 83.3 per cent. Public acute care in private hospitals, as a percentage of the national expenditure coming out of private health insurance funds, was 13.4 per cent and for 1992-93 it was 19.4 per cent. I refer the minister to the answer to my question on notice. It is on page 4512 of Hansard of 30 November 1995. Look it up. Do your research before you support bad public policy. The total recurrent expenditure out of the private funds for 1984 was 9.5 per cent of the national share. In 1992-93 it was up to 12.2 per cent across the board-from public acute, to private hospitals, to recurrent, to dental services, to medical services. The funding is either constant or it has gone up. There is no crisis in the private health insurance area. All that has happened is that people who essentially were not utilising services-that is, they were younger, healthier premium contributors-have dropped out. Why wouldn't they drop out? They were getting no value for money. They were paying these high premium rates and were not utilising services-because they are younger, healthier people-and they have dropped out. is hardly a surprise. That is what, in any other part of the economy, we would call the market clearing itself. That is what we would call the market reaching a certain equilibrium.",98
250,Mr KERR,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,We have a new form of socialIsm,98
251,Mr LATHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"So why does that form of socialism, as the member for Denison suggests, or a command economy apply to private health insurance? Why do they need extra public subsidies when it does not apply to any other part of the economy in this country? The truth is that, if you apply the taxation rebates to attract people back into private insurance, who do you attract back in? You attract the people who have just dropped out because there was no value for money. The people you attract back in are the younger, healthier people who were not utilising their insurance. That is a ridiculous thing to do. If there is $500 million of government money that is sitting around to be used for health purposes, put it directly into public hospitals. Spend the money where there is supposed to be a problem. Spend it directly on public hospitals. Do not put it indirectly back into the reserves to bring back into private insurance the younger, healthier people who dropped out. They were not using their insurance and not utilising the service. If you do not want to, for ideological reasons, put the money into public hospitals, do what Francis Sullivan, the Executive Director of the Australian Catholic Health Association, said. Mr Hockey interjecting",98
252,Mr LATHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"Surely the member for North Sydney could not object to quotes from someone from the Australian Catholic Health Association. This is what he had to say in the Australian newspaper on 30 August: In effect, the funds operate as an oligopoly and do not compete on price. Rather they use their resources to market similar products against each other. This only leads to cost increases and becomes counterproductive. When costs go up, members leave. Mr Sullivan goes on to say: ... a far more sensible and fair arrangement for the Government's expenditure of $1.7 billion would be the direct subsidisation of the use of private hospital services. Not only would this target those who need care, it would also encourage behavioural change and actually shift demand between public and private sectors. From anyone's perspective a much more rational and desirable outcome. I say 'hear, hear' to that. If this government will not support public hospitals for ideological reasons, at the very least it should directly subsidise private hospitals and use. Subsidise service utilisation. So you can put the money where the patients are. You can put the money where the need is, instead of putting it indirectly back into bloated reserves and bloated assets of the private health insurance funds to drive people back into insurance that they have not been using. If that does not convince the members opposite, let me try a simple comparison, because there is a certain mystique about the health sector, and maybe government members cannot get their minds around how one part of it is linked to another. Mr MCLachlan interjecting",98
253,Mr LATHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"Let me give the member for Barker a comparison. My comparison is in the railway system, which he might know something about as he comes from South Australia. If a substantial number of people purchased a yearly rail ticket one year but then failed to use the rail system and decided not to use the tickets for the following yearthat is, there was an under-utilised service; they had bought their tickets but not caught the train-would the government then decide to introduce a tax rebate to encourage ticket purchases or put more money into the rail system itself? So, if people had been buying rail tickets but had not been catching trains-that is the equivalent in health: they had been taking out insurance but not using services-would the government then introduce a tax rebate for people to go and buy rail tickets and still not utilise the service, or would it put spare public money into public services, build new rail lines and put more rolling stock out? Of course you would directly subsidise use. It is bad public policy. It is the dumbest policy in Australian public life not to directly subsidise use and service utilisation in the health sector. These things get even worse. In relation to the amendment I have moved, I want to make reference to an issue in my own electorate. The government promised that it would increase funds for public hospitals. We are getting an $800 million cut over the next four years. That is a very clear broken promise. But in south-west Sydney it gets even worse. There was a leaflet distributed by Mr Fahey, now the member for Macarthur, prior to the election. This is what he had to say: John Fahey will fight for capital funding to deliver the new Narellan Hospital. In the first Costello-Fahey budget, where is the capital funding for the Narellan hospital? Not only is it not there but $800 million of funding has been taken out. Another promise in that leaflet was: John Fahey will fight for capital funding for a major upgrade at Campbelltown Hospital. Where is the capital allocation in the first Costello-Fahey budget that meets that promise? It is not there. Mr Hockey interjecting",99
254,Mr LATHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"The member for North Sydney is a Fahey protege-someone who knows full well the way in which they break promises. They invented this. Under Greiner and Fahey in New South Wales, they invented broken promises and they brought it hereshamefully enough-to Canberra. So in the south-west of Sydney, there were not only two broken promises in capital funding for a new Narellan hospital and for a major upgrade of the Campbelltown hospital but there was the global broken promise of $800 million being taken out of the health system. All of these things have a very big impact on the south-west of Sydney and the greater western Sydney region. It makes even more important the task of locational redistribution within the New South Wales health budget. There has been a recent controversy in New South Wales relating to the Carr government. Because of the federal broken promise and the removal of $800 million from the health budget, it makes it more important and even more critical for the Carr government in New South Wales to engage in the principle of hospital funding redistribution. When the Tories in this place are taking away public hospital funding, it is left to Labor. to Labor in New South Wales to give the west and south-west of Sydney their fair share of hospital funding. The problem is that most of Sydney's public hospitals are located where the people used to live, not where they live now and the suburbs to which they are continuing to move. I give an example. The federal electorate of Sydney has within its boundaries seven public hospitals. In my seat of Werriwa, which is in the south-west of Sydney, there are none. There are 130,000 people in the Werriwa electorate, and there is not a public hospital within its boundaries. The electorate of tribution. Chifley has one public hospital; Fowler, one; Greenway, one; Prospect, one. They are large federal electorates in the growth suburbs the west and south-west of Sydney. Between those five electorates, there are four public hospitals. In the federal electorate of Sydney, there are seven. Those sorts of inequities cannot go There is a substantial shortfall in the funding share for the south-west of Sydney, Sydney, the Central Coast, the Hunter region and Illawarra. The truth is that these regions, in terms of their population growth and hospital funding share, need to run faster just to stand still. There is no magic pudding in the health budget. This is a straightforward question redistribution, a question made even more acute by the federal government's public hospital cuts. As the people move to the growth regions, funding needs to be redistribregion, uted to their areas for their services and essential health facilities. This funding come only from areas which are losing their population share and, hence, enjoy a relative surplus of funding and facilities. Successive state health ministers-Collins, Hannaford, Phillips and last week Andrew Refshauge-have said that they would increase funding for western and south-western Sydney but not at the expense of other regions. At a time of low growth in government revenue, this may mean a decline in resources per head of population, given the growth of new housing estates in the suburbs in It is left Sydney's greater west. Fiscal austerity is more likely to disadvantage growing areas than overserviced parts of Sydney, such as the northern and eastern suburbs. Entrenched interests will fight hard to preserve existing benefits, compared with suburbs which have gone without and are struggling to secure new services. Only the redistribution of public resources can ensure that the rate of population growth is matched by a growth in government health services. As the demographic centre of Sydney has moved further west, state governments have been reluctant to follow the politics of redisIt is much easier for politicians to fund new services from growth in government revenue than to relocate resources to areas of of greatest need. The economics of the 1980s, however, killed off this soft option. Health services are an outstanding example of the strength of vested interests in New South Wales politics. The state's politicians have failed to embrace the politics of redistrion. bution. Fear of publicly confronting the medical professions has overwhelmed the western interests of equity. Let me provide some of the comparisons which underscore this argument. There are seven teaching hospitals east of Parramatta, compared with two in western Sydney. The south-east and central districts spend twice as much per person on health than the Wenof tworth and south-west Sydney districts. Let me just give the figures: health expenditure in south-east Sydney per head of population is $750; the central region, $948; the Wentworth $386; and south-west Sydney, $396. The centre of Sydney and the southern and can eastern suburbs have nearly double the number of hospital beds per thousand population than greater western Sydney. Again, I will provide the figures: in south-east Sydney, there are 3.59 hospital beds per thousand population; central Sydney, 3.96; Wentworth, 1.78; and south-west Sydney, 2.07. Every year close to 80,000 patients leave Sydney's greater west to receive basic care, often travelling for more than three hours to do so. The number of patients will grow because of the Howard government's public hospital funding cuts. That trip is often three hours in duration, which exceeds the World Health Organisation benchmark. If inner city hospitals or those on the lower North Shore are busy, it is because they are treating tens of thousands of people who are forced to travel from other parts of Sydney due to the lack of local services. Let me give the figures for the number of patients who travelled outside their local health area for treatment in 1994-95. In the Wentworth region, this accounted for 36 per cent of the patients-that is, more than a third of people travelled outside their own region to gain treatment. In south-west Sydney, the figure was 29 per cent, and for the Central Coast it was 20 per cent. What was it for the south-eastern part of Sydney? Just 10 per cent. Let me give the House the figures for the availability of linear accelerators for cancer by radiotherapy. Greater western Sydney has half of Sydney's population but only six of these linear accelerators. The rest of Sydney, with the other half of the population, has 15 of them. This is a gross imbalance of service availability for the essential treatment of cancer by radiotherapy-and I know something about this. That is an imbalance that needs to be corrected. There are twice as many hospital staff per thousand population in the south-eastern and central regions than in the west and the south-west of Sydney, with the south-east having 16.3; central, 19.3; south-west Sydney, 8.4; and Wentworth, 9.4. This cannot continue. These imbalances, these inequities and this injustice cannot continue. The current resource distribution formula does not do enough to catch up with the population growth. I repeat what I said earlier: the west and south-west of Sydney in terms of their share and re-allocation of hospital resources need to run faster just to stand still. These are the growth regions, the suburbs to which people in Sydney and beyond are moving. Radical redistribution in the funding formula is required-not cheap publicity tricks or smoke and mirrors, but radical redistribution. Bandaids are not enough. Dr Refshauge recently announced another $134 million for the New South Wales health budget. My understanding is that this does not close the gap between the health regions in the centre of Sydney and the south-east, compared with the west and the south-west. The gap needs to close at a time when the Howard government is cutting away the global allocation. It is time for - the Carr government to take stock. They need to examine the funding cuts out of Canberra and use them as the absolutely essential reason by which radical funding redistribution should be embraced and applied. To the north of my own electorate, the new Liverpool Hospital needs $124 million in recurrent funds just to provide a level of service which is comparable to that found in other major Sydney teaching hospitals. Liverpool Hospital neededMr MCLachlan-This is parochial.",99
255,Mr LATHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"The member for Barker says that this is parochial. You tell that to the people with cancer in the west and south-west of Sydney who have not got radiotherapy services. Do you call that parochial? I call that compassion. I call that caring about people on the basis of need. Do not come down from the hills of Adelaide with some crusty, toffee-nosed attitude and say it is parochial. Get in the real world and understand that there are people who have not got privilege and wealth to back them up; they rely on the public sector to give them fair treatment and fair access to services. Wake up to yourself, you toff. The truth is that Liverpool Hospital needs $52 million. Mr MCLachlan-Get the log off your shoulder. It must be weighing you down.",101
256,Mr LATHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"Yes, it does weigh me down, and it weighs down the people in the region who go without. People trying to lessen their burden are doing something that is decent in public life. Why shouldn't I stand up in this place and say those things and believe that they are important? Mr MCLachlan-All you are talking about is parochial, that is why.",101
257,Mr LATHAM,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"They are parochial and they are important because people are suffering. I know it is happening in other parts of Australia-Sydney is the worse. It is the worse because the funding inequities are the most acute. Liverpool Hospital needed $52 million this year to begin major services in heart and lung surgery and on-site treatment for women with breast and other cancers. Okay, that is parochial, but it is bloody important. It is bloody important and bloody compassionate to do something about it. Your government is taking $800 million out of public hospital budgets, and that will impact on Liverpool Hospital. In the recent allocation out of New South Wales, only $20 million--even after the additional funding had been found-was available for Liverpool. And the Howard government is making it harder. I am not saying the New South Wales government has got this right. They need to embrace redistribution. They need the active transfer of resources from the centre, eastern and northern suburbs of Sydney and send them to the areas to which the people have moved-that is, the greater western suburbs, the west and the south-west. But lessen their burden by keeping up public hospital resources, instead of this absurd transfer of funding-$500 millioninto private health funds and reserves at the same time as you are ripping $800 million out of public hospital budgets. So, out of Canberra, lessen their load and out of Macquarie Street realise that if the funding cuts continue then the redistribution of resources becomes even more important, even more critical and unavoidable-absolutely essential. If redistribution is not embraced by the government, then they stand for nothing. Redistribution should be an article of faith New South Wales Labor. If they do not stand for redistribution, then they stand for nothing. This is not a matter of debate. It is an article of faith. No correspondence entered into--just do it do. Do the funding redistribution out of Macquarie Street and, for goodness sake, in Canberra wake up to the madness of this policy of an artificial transfer from public resources into private health reserves and improve the funding allocation for public hospitals. Do it for the sake of those who need the services and those who suffer without them. (Time expired)",102
258,Mr KERR,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,I second the amendment.,102
259,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"Mr Vaile)Before I call the next speaker, I bring to the attention of the House standing order 315. I did not take the liberty to interrupt the 30minute address on this bill by the honourable member for Werriwa, but while he was speaking the member for Isaacs entered the chamber with, I presume, a member of staff. The member of staff sat in the advisers' box. When the member for Isaacs left the chamber-I noticed them leaving the side door of the chamber-the stranger was in the chamber. Standing order 315 clearly states: While the House or the Main Committee is sitting, no Member may bring any stranger into any part of the Chamber or that part of the room where the Main Committee is meeting which is reserved for Members. Hopefully, that is brought to the attention of the member for Isaacs.",102
260,Dr SOUTHCOTT,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"I am glad to have the opportunity to follow the comments of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). What the member for Werriwa has not caught up with is that in the last 13 years the number of people holding private health insurance in Australia dropped from 66 per cent to 33.6 per cent in June of this year. Economists have estimated that every one per cent drop in the level of private health cover puts an equivalent cost onto the public hospital system, onto the public health system, of one major teaching hospital. Labor oversaw Carr a decline in private health cover of over 30 per cent, something like 33 per cent. That is for the equivalent of over 30 teaching hospitals added to the public health budget. This government is trying to ensure that we are able to get some of those people who dropped out during the Labor years, some of the young and healthy people who are on very moderate incomes, lower incomes and so on, back into private health insurance so that we can maintain community rating. Community rating under Labor was an absolute sham. The young and healthy dropped out of and the sick and old and ill stayed in private health insurance. Returning to the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill, last week I referred to some recent remarks made by former Treasurer John Dawkins. Speaking in Adelaide at a function for the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia, Mr Dawkins admitted that, with the exception of his 1993 budget, the Labor government from 1988 onwards had dropped its bundle. That would come as no surprise to those members who caught up with the fascinating ABC series Labor in Power. John Dawkins's comments at that Adelaide function are pretty rich when you remember that what was really clear from that series was that his principal numbers man was quite prepared to sacrifice good government in order to attain power. Gary Punch, a former member of this House, a member of the Hawke and Keating government and also a Keating disciple, allegedly said that he would be prepared to bring down the government to get rid of Hawke. In an astonishing display of greed, power and unbridled ambition, the series convincingly revealed that in order to find issues to attack and discredit Bob Hawke, Dawkins and Keating were prepared to seize on anything. Nowhere was this more obvious than in Keating's ambush of Hawke's new federalism. Keating's courting of the Left of his party during this period was not so much unprincipled as a sad reflection of what power and ambition can do to an individual. Unfortunately, the repercussions of Keating's personal hunger for power were felt by all Australians. Hawke's new federalism was an attempt at eliminating the duplication, the inefficiencies, the shifting of costs and the imbalance that exists between the states and Canberra in this country. It was an attempt to redress the inequalities in revenue sharing in our Federation. The plans for a new era of cooperation and agreement were endorsed by both Labor and Liberal premiers at the time. Unfortunately, the Placido Domingo of Australian politics prevailed and the scheme was scuttled. In repaying those who had delivered him power, Paul Keating as Prime Minister proceeded to undo much of the work that Paul Keating as Treasurer had fulfilled. Unlike his namesake, he converted not once but twice. The Euromoney magazine Finance Minister of the Year became, seven years later, a deficit spending Prime Minister. As Treasurer he had delivered budgets in surplus while the states were undermining their banks and financial institutions. As Prime Minister, Keating led the way in the decline in national savings while the states began to adopt responsible fiscal consolidation stances. How ironic. What a reversal in roles that Paul Keating, the man who delivered budgets in surplus in 1987 and 1988, I think, later became the deficit spending Prime Minister. In speaking in favour of the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1996, it is important to make the point that this government believes in federation and that it believes in the states-not just in words but in deeds. The Commonwealth's clear command of financial resources discloses a trend that has long been a matter of concern. Writing in 1954, SJ. Butlin stated: The enlargement of the Federal Parliament and the rewards of the Commonwealth service are both hastening the transition to a condition in which the States have no future except as administrative agents of a central government. It is merely the latest phase of a trend which has been continuous since Federation, and it is still the same because it is by and through financial relations that Federalism is disappearing. What becomes relevant is the design of financial machinery and financial policy without undue regard to the 'rights' of the states. Butlins' main point was that it is essential that we design financial machinery and financial policy in order to keep the important concept of federalism viable. The bill provides general revenue assistance to the states and territories and also es them to continue improving efficiency in areas like transport and communication. It appropriates $16.3 billion, which represents 12 per cent of Commonwealth outlays, or, if you like, the equivalent of two Beazley black holes. The equivalent of two Beazley black holes is what we are spending in this bill. The states and territories will receive a real per capita growth in financial assistance grants, or FAGs, in 1996-97 and their real maintenance will be guaranteed to 1998-99. That is conditional on the states meeting their obligation under the agreement of the April 1995 COAG meeting to implement the national competition policy. The first tranche is conditional on each state and territory implementing COAG agreements on electricity and gas and observing reforms in road transport. The opposition thinks that grants to the states have been cut. That is wrong. On top of the increase in financial assistance grants, states and territories will receive $219 million in competition payments. In real terms, the total net assistance to the states this year in 1995-96 prices, in real terms, is higher than it has been since the 1984 budget. This year total Commonwealth assistance to the states will increase by 2.2 per cent. As well, the states and territories will contribute to the reduction of the Commonwealth budget deficit by fiscal contributions which will improve saving over the next three years. This year the states will contribute $619 million to plug the budget's burgeoning Beazley black hole. Flexibility on how to pay the fiscal contribution will allow states and territories deduct from general revenue assistance or direct grants or to reduce specific purpose grants. The Commonwealth's total payments to the states represent about a quarter of all Commonwealth outlays. The government could never have quarantined this area from fiscal consolidation without cutting into other areas like health or social security. But, even so, we are actually paying the states 2.2 per cent more than last year. This bill had its genesis at this year's Premiers Conference. At that conference all Premiers and Chief Ministers, both Labor and encourag- Liberal-although there was only one Labor-recognised that Labor's debt burden needed to be shared. In recent years, the total state public sector has moved from a deficit of $3.7 billion or 0.9 per cent of GDP in 1991-92 to a surplus of $1.9 billion or 0.4 per cent of GDP in 1994-95, thanks to the prudent management of the Court, Brown, Groom and Kennett administrations. During that period, New South Wales had a Liberal government which had low levels of public sector net debt and low budget deficits. Queensland is in the strongest position of all, with budget surpluses and no net public sector debt. The crippling legacy of Burke, Bannon, Field and Cain has slowly been overcome in those states. As a consequence of disciplined Liberal Party administrations at state level, the states in total have been in surplus for some years by adopting debt reduction and saving strategies. In contrast, 'Keating's Commonwealth' continued in a spendthrift, profligate way. As outlined earlier, the irony of the 1990s when reflecting on the 1980s is that it was Paul Keating-the man who, in 1987, claimed to have delivered the first budget surplus in 40 years-who actually led the decline in national saving while the states were adopting a responsible fiscal consolidation stance. At this year's Premiers Conference it was proposed that the sales tax exemptions that all levels of government enjoyed be removed. The principle was that where public enterprises or utilities competed with private companies they should be treated equally by the to wholesale sales tax system; in effect the goal of competitive neutrality. In some cases, the exemptions were being openly rorted and the exemptions that the state, local and territory governments enjoyed were distorting resource allocation and encouraging this rorting. Purchasing decisions and decisions on whether to contract services out to the private sector were affected, in effect, by that sales tax exemption. The Premiers Conference agreed to remove the exemption on private-plated cars which are part of executive salary packages for all levels of government. That really was where the rort was the worse. In the words of former US President Ronald Reagan: For everyone who finds a tax shelter, it leaves someone else out in the cold. Unfortunately, we were unable to broaden the sales tax base. The tax transparency and competitive neutrality principles which would have come by treating government instrumentalities in the same way as private firms would have further streamlined the business of government as well as led to better budget allocative decisions based on truer prices. I would like to make the point that it would have been fairer to end the wholesale sales tax exemptions enjoyed by all levels of government and to also expose the Commoncapital wealth to state taxes like stamp duty, payroll tax and financial institutions duty. It would have led to a structural improvement in the budget balance and fairer tax treatment of government business enterprises. ant to note that the states' fiscal contribution will give us a three-year improvement savings, but not a permanent source of enue, not a structural improvement in the want budget deficit. Prior to 1974, Australia ran a budget plus of two per cent of GDP on average. Since 1974 it has run an average deficit of per cent of GDP. In a sense, Whitlam's Inc. legacy was not the abolition of national service or the introduction of so-called free education. Rather, Whitlam will best be remembered for presiding over the irresponin sible explosion of government expenditure. That was an explosion which contributed to the disastrous stagflation of the mid-1970s. For example, in 1974 government spending increased 14.6 per cent. In 1975 it increased 12.2 per cent. Rather than Cyclone Tracy, 1974 should really be remembered as the year in which Gough Whitlam struck, wreaking havoc on pluses the Australian economy. Darwin was rebuilt but, sadly, our budgetary position was devanately, stated and the rebuilding had just begun. Malcolm Fraser could stop the tidal wave of government expenditure that Whitlam had unleashed, but he could not wind it back. Part of the reason for the change in budget's structural balance since 1974 has been a shift from the Commonwealth budget to state budgets of capital works spending. Gough Whitlam relieved the budget of capital spending when the Postmaster-General's Department became Telecom and Australia Post and they both did their own borrowing. Malcolm Fraser froze the states' general purposes capital payments and encouraged them to borrow overseas for capital projects. Whereas in the 1960s and early 1970s deficits included a large component of spending for capital works, more recently the budget deficits that the Hawke and Keating governments were racking up have not been contributing to saving and have had minimal spending. In effect, budget deficits in the early 1970s were good and in the 1980s and 1990s they were bad. In the early 1970s they were a down payment on our future. In the 1980s and 1990s they were a debt burden It is importfor the future generation. The failures of state and federal Labor in governments of the 1980s and 1990s have revbeen well documented elsewhere. I do not to revisit that, but it is worth noting that in my own state the South Australian Labor surgovernment, without a whiff of corruption, lost more money per capita with the State 1.4 Bank collapse than the murky stench of WA and more per capita than even the corrupt BCCI Bank. It is not a record that we are particularly proud of. I do not think that the South Australian government was corrupt and, a sense, it does not really matter because its incompetence cost more than the corruption of WA Inc. and more than the corruption that was involved with the BCCI Bank. Their incompetence left a damage bill three times more than that of the LA riots of 1992. In the mid-1990s the states have had to carry much of the burden of lifting national savings. It is the projected state budget surwhich are stabilising net national debt and propping up our national saving. Fortuall state governments agree with the need to increase national savings and have agreed to make a fiscal contribution to plugging the budget's Beazley black hole. There is every sign of a new discipline in state and the Commonwealth governments. I do not think we can ask the states to make a contribution to improving the budget while Labor try to stop the Commonwealth government from doing its bit and paying its way. They want to continue to squeeze the states without Canberra sharing the load. Just as they did in government, in opposition they are happy to impose a discipline on others that they will not impose on themselves. Within our Federation there is considerable imbalance between spending and revenue raising. The states raise 55 per cent of the revenue they spend. They are dependent on Canberra for the rest. The Commonwealth raises 35 per cent more than it spends for its own government outlays. Also, through section 96 grants, the Commonwealth controls 25 to 30 per cent of state spending. Clearly, Commonwealth-state financial relations need to be reformed. The vertical fiscal imbalance which is inherent in our system contributes to overlap and duplication because responsibility for programs often depends on the nature Commonwealth grants. Some states are reluctant to raise more of their revenue. They find Canberra and the Commonwealth government a useful whipping boy at every Premiers Conference. Malcolm Fraser offered the states some detailed functions and responsibilities well as some marginal direct taxation raising powers. That offer was not taken up. During the early 1990s several states large budget deficits. At that time, five of six states were run by Labor governments. Now the states are in combined recurrent surplus and are reducing their debt level. Only one of those states has a Labor governmentper cent. New South Wales. Is that coincidental? Is that just fate or bad luck? Historically, the ALP have always felt that they got a bit of a rough trot, that they had a bit of bad luck, bad timing. When Jim Scullin from the Labor Party won in 1929 and the stock market crash occurred about one month later, that was just bad luck. When the Whitlam government had to deal with oil price rises of 400 per cent the high unemployment and double inflation which led from that, that was a bit of back luck and there was not much they could do about it. But the record of new Labor in the 1980s and 1990s has been one of debt and deficit, of financial collapse and incompetence. Is that just more bad luck, or is it bad government? At the same time, under Labor, section 96 payments expanded from one-third to over 50 per cent of total grants. Federally, Labor used those section 96 payments, or the FAGs with tags, to restrict and control the spending of the states. This bill will reduce the specific purpose payments-section 96 grants-by three per cent this year. According to New South Wales budget papers which were quoted in a recent article in the Australian by Alan Wood: Over the last 15 years Commonwealth spending has increased in real per capita terms by 2 per cent a year while Commonwealth payments to States fell by an average of 0.3 per cent a year. I would suggest that the Commonwealth straitjacket that Labor used and applied to the states may encourage them to extract profits from monopolies not exposed to the full gale of competition and encourage them to retreat of from the Hilmer reform process. This government's overall increase of 2.2 per cent in state assistance will encourage the states to continue with competition reform. Let us look at Labor's legacy of Commonas wealth-state financial relations. In 1983 when we last left office, federal grants to state and local government represented 9.5 per cent of GDP. Eleven years later it had dropped to 7.2 ran per cent of GDP. In 1983, federal revenue the was 24.5 per cent of GDP. By 1994 it was 25 per cent of GDP, almost the same. So while federal revenue remained static in terms of GDP, the grants to the states declined by two Looking at it in more detail, financial assistance grants to the states actually increased in real terms from 1983 until 1987. That was when Keating decided to put the screws on the states. That was when he made his famous 'hollow log' statement about the way he felt the states were somehow squirreland ing away their grants. So he put the screws on digit the states. (Time expired).",102
261,Mr GARETH EVANS,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"The States Grant (General Purposes) Amendment Bill is from one point of view a very routine annual measure, but it is legislation of very great practical importance to the functioning of our Federation. It is a key determinant of the quality of government services delivered by the states and territories. It does have a real impact on the quality of life of a great many Australians. States and territories, after all, deliver the vast bulk of basic public services in this country and the funding provided by the Commonwealth every year through this legislation does have an enormously significant effect on the ability of those governments to provide the decent level of services that people are entitled to in a civilised society. In a very direct sense, the quality of our hospitals, our schools, our roads, our legal systems and a great many other essential public services is determined by this general purpose funding provided by the Commonwealth to the states. Of course the states also rely on specific purpose payments in a great many areas and also on their own source revenue but, as any observer of a Premiers Conference can attest, the issue of general purpose payments is a vital and critical one for the major service providing level of government. The coalition know this only too well. They are supposedly, after all, the champions of the states in our federal system. However, as in most areas, the gap between the government's rhetoric and its performance in the area of state funding is nothing short of deceitful. I have to say that the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) maintained that fine tradition of empty rhetoric in his contribution that we have just heard. Before the last election, the following promise which this bill now breaks was made. The coalition undertook to provide a 'fixed percentage of revenue to facilitate better planning and give certainty to the states and territories'. The formula through which this would be achieved would be one, the coalition promised, which would 'guarantee current services and be revenue neutral'. That promise was very explicitly reaffirmed by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) 10 days after the election when, at his first press conference on 12 March, he said: I think I made it clear during the election campaign that our purpose was not to cut general assistance grants to the States. A question was interpolated, 'So specific purpose payments will be cut?' The Treasurer answered: Well we'll be looking at specific purpose payments yes, but it is not our intention to have the States take the pain in relation to general assistance. That promise was broken spectacularly during the June Premiers Conference and that breach of faith is codified in this legislation we are dealing with today. The 1996 Premiers Conference will go down as a watershed. It was without question a farce. There has often been over the years acrimonious debate in these gatherings. There is certainly usually parochial complaining by any government that feels that they have been hardly done by and most of them from time to time feel that they are. But for this government, and in particular for this Treasurer, the June 1996 Premiers Conference was an unrivalled, unmitigated disaster. In early June the states and territories were probably contemplating a rather nice, quick meeting. After all, these promises were on the record. The previous year's conference had been probably the quickest on record. It was all over in half an hour or so, allowing the related COAG meeting, the Council of Australian Governments, to commence. The reason that the meeting in that year, our last year of government, had been so successful was that the Commonwealth had offered a fair deal to the states and they had accepted it. The deal was a real per capita guarantee for three years and Labor would have delivered on that promise. In addition, we negotiated the competition payments to share the benefits of the historic Hilmer competition reform agreement. I say that we would have delivered this real per capita agreement because we have a history of delivering on negotiated agreements. Just to look at recent years, at the June 1990 Premiers Conference Labor undertook to maintain the level of financial assistance grants to the states in real terms from 1991-92 to 1993-94, subject to the condition that Australia did not experience any major economic deterioration. Despite the significant economic downturn that did of course then occur, Labor agreed to honour the real terms guarantee in each of those financial years. That relieved an enormous amount of stress that would otherwise have been experienced by the states. In addition, we also provided another $169 million to the states as a one-off addition to that in 1992-93. At the end of this triennium, the 1994 Premiers Conference agreement was reached that financial assistance grants, FAGs, to the states would be maintained in real per capita terms over the next three years. At the 1995 Premiers Conference this real per capita guarantee was then extended to 1997-98. At a time of what was obviously strong budgetary pressure, the Commonwealth, under the Labor government, for the long-term good of this nation, consistently maintained and then increased financial assistance grants in real terms. This did have a significant impact on the budget of the Commonwealth. There is no doubt about it that our maintenance of those grants in real terms, not backing away, not backsliding, was one of the factors that contributed to the budget deficit being higher by the end of our term than it would otherwise have been. One of the other key factors is that of the inflation rate being much lower than had been anticipated as a result of us breaking the back of inflation during our term of office, denying the government the windfall revenue that flows from higher inflation rates. Another key factor is that of the Working Nation commitments. There is no doubt about that. We make no bones about it because we did feel the necessity to make that contribution to the education, training, skilling and job readiness of our members of the community-an obligation that has obviously not carried through to this current government. Despite the significant impact maintaining our commitments had on the Commonwealth budget, we did shield the states from the worse impacts of the recession and guaranteed thereafter that the states' capacity to provide core services to the public was maintained. In short, we took almost the whole of the fiscal responsibility for the recession because to do so was the best policy for the people of Australia. The record shows absolutely unequivocally that when Labor makes a deal it sticks to it. This brings me back to this year's Premiers Conference, the fun at which began when the Treasurer announced he had unilaterally decided that the existing sales tax exemptions enjoyed by all governments were rorts and that therefore they were to be terminated. All motor vehicles at state and local government level were to be taxable from that time, with an impact that was estimated by local government sources to be $200 million to $300 million a year for local government alone, with a whole variety of other measures removing that sales tax exemption to be worked out over the next few months. The total bill was estimated by the Treasurer to be $1.2 billion for states and local government, but certainly the states, the territories and local government themselves thought that was a considerable underestimate, as I believe it was. Acceptance of this new tax was to be a condition of the delivery of the already agreed financial assistance grants payments, payments that the Treasurer had promised before the election to deliver, a promise which he reaffirmed, as I said, immediately after the election. Predictably enough, the victims responded. The conference was a disaster. It stretched out not over half an hour but over two days. The related COAG meeting was also a farce. It produced absolutely nothing concrete. At a series of meetings the Treasurer was not allowed to attend there was not only bad blood already around; it was an atmosphere described by most of the participants as the worse they could recall in Australian federal relations history. I guess this farce and the disaster associated with it did serve one very important public purpose: it did allow the public of Australia to know what the Treasurer's coalition colleagues really think of him. Certainly they pulled no punches in describing exactly what they did think. Mr Stockdale, the Treasurer of Victoria, said on 12 June: I think it's a very black day for the new Federal Government. The central appeal to people of Australia was that hethat is, the Treasurercould be trusted, that he would keep his promise and he would honour his commitments and here he's broken no less than five commitments: two election promises. No tax increases. This is a tax increase. And so he went on. Mr Borbidge, the Premier of Queensland, said that he had a high regard for the Prime Minister but that: I don't share that view of the Treasurer. And further: Mr Costello is off to an appalling start. Further from Mr Borbidge: We might as well go around and stand outside a hotdog stand somewhere. It might just about be as productive. Mr Martin Ferguson-What did Mr Kennett say? Mr GARETH EV ANS-A number of people picked up that particular metaphor, no doubt inspired by the immortal line, so I am reminded by my colleague the member for Batman of Mr Kennett, the Victorian Premier, that the Treasurer had every quality of a dog except loyalty. Indeed, Mr Rundle, the Premier of Tasmania picked up the theme by saying, as quoted by the Australian newspaper: Peter Costello's only been there a dog watch, but in that short time he's making Willis and Dawkins look good. I will leave the final word, I guess, to the coalition colleague of the member for Boothby-not that the member for Boothby has stayed around- Mr Dean Brown, the Premier of South Australia, who was quoted on 13 June on wire services throughout the nation as saying: Commonwealth-State relations have never been as low as they are now. He was not impressed with the lowness of the relations that had been reached during the Whitlam period or the Keating period or the Hawke period, which so exercised the good doctor from Boothby. He was not impressed by the low ebb of Commonwealth-state relations of the Scullin era, or the Chifley era, or the Curtin era or any of the other earlier parts of Labor history. He had a very clear perception of just this. I quote again: Commonwealth-State relations have never been as low as they are now. True, indeed. The 'agreement', when it was finally arrived at, was a humiliating backdown for the Treasurer, but it still involved, of course, significant cuts in grants to the states. The states had no alternative but to accept them. Their arms were well and truly up their backs. These grants cutbacks were given the Pythonesque title of the states' 'fiscal contribution'. It is those that are contained, I guess, within this legislation-the contributions made by the states by way of cuts to the grants that would otherwise have been payable had the promises been kept. The contributions were announced as $619 million in 1996-97, $640 million the following year and $300 million in 1998-99. It is a $1.5 billion broken promise. In a positively Orwellian twist-I think that is the only way you can describe it-the Treasurer also announced that he was extending the real per capita guarantee introduced by Labor until 1998-99. That is to say, he was extending the agreement he had breached only until the end of the three-year period for which he told the states he would not honour it. Why did he not extend it further to actually give the states some hope, some tangible benefit from all of this? The answer, I would suggest, is absolutely clear. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister are planning a repeat of the 1996 Premiers Conference in 1999. At that time they will try once again to tax the other levels of government, just as they tried and failed to do this year. The Prime Minister admitted after all that he still thought this tax was good policy, after he failed to implement it. The last general issue I want to return to in all of this is the proper role of government. I said at the outset that this bill is one of the key ones in the functioning of the federation. It also points out one of the really big lies that is constantly trotted out by our opponents. For at least a generation we have been criticised by our conservative opponents for being over-centralist and therefore anti-state. There is a very clear way to answer that; that is, simply by referring to our record. Which government in Australia has given the states and territories a fairer deal in terms of untied funding? Look at the record of the last few years as compared with the record of this year and you are left in no doubt about the answer-it is Labor. Which government has provided more tied assistance to the states and territories in areas such as health, education, roads, railways, housing, legal aid and environment funding? Ours. It has worked well in terms of the delivery of real services to real people, which you are just not in the business of providing. If we are so anti-state, why do we always provide more assistance to help with the provisions of the core services of government? If the Prime Minister is so pro-state and the Treasurer is so pro-state, why are they cutting both tied and untied assistance? Take the most prominent service of all provided by the states-public hospitals-so eloquently dealt with by my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) a few minutes ago. Everyone knows the pressure that the hospital system is under. Funding cuts do not just cause inconvenience, however; they cost lives. If the states have less money overall, less is bound to go into hospital resources. Given that some 30 per cent of state budgets already go into health, it is a totally reasonable inference-the second reading amendment makes this clear-that around $450 million will be cut from hospital budgets in this way over the next three years. In addition, the budget also much more specifically and directly cuts a further $312 million over the next four years, supposedly to counter cost-shifting practices. But that is just a convenient justification for a cut. Will cutting these grants stop the cost shifting? No, of course it will not; it will just encourage more. Will cuts deliver better services to people through shorter waiting lists and shorter waiting times? No; this is simply a savings option disguised as a structural measure. The government favours private medicine over public medicine. It is reducing the resources available to the public hospital system. The answer as to why all this is happening is really very simple. Why is the government cutting assistance to the states, both tied and untied? This government, led by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, simply does not like government doing more than the absolute minimum. It is not a matter of not wanting the Commonwealth to do things and giving it to the states; it is a matter of the Prime Minister saying he does not want the Commonwealth to do things and saying that it is a matter for the states, but cutting all funding sources to the states, both tied and untied, in a way that the Prime Minister knows they will not be able to fill the holes left by the cessation of Commonwealth activity. An absolutely classic example of this kind of issue at work occurred under our government with the immunisation program. This was transferred to the states in 1987 in response to some of the sorts of pressures that people are talking about today, supposedly to get the meddling Commonwealth out of the way to improve outcomes. So an agreement was reached whereby the Commonwealth funding was maintained but transferred into general revenue funding. The states were allowed, accordingly, to establish their own program priorities without having to be subject to the Commonwealth administrative yolk, as they claimed. What happened? The states took the money but did not spend it on immunisation. They engaged in shifting the costs of immunisation onto Medicare by increasing the delivery of immunisation services by general practitioners. I will not go into the detail of it; I do not have time. The net result of it all was an absolute unmitigated disaster, universally now recognised as such, flowing from that abdication of Commonwealth responsibility. At least back in 1987 we notionally kept the funding flowing for the services in question. We just left it up to the states to get on with the business of implementing them. What is happening on this occasion is that the funds themselves are rapidly and dramatically drying up. One example of the practical impact of this, in an area where the Labor government showed itself absolutely willing to work in terms of delivery through the states, is the Commonwealth dental program. I know from my own very moving experiences visiting a number of clinics where this program has been at work of the devastating impact that the complete cessation of that funding will have, a cessation of funding which we know perfectly well for most states is not going to be picked up in whole or even part and as a result pensioners and cardholders right across the system are going to suffer abominably. The truth of the matter is that we believe, as we have always believed, that there is a strong national coordination role for the Commonwealth in these matters. We believe, however, that the role and responsibilities of the various levels of government should be continually reviewed and refined. That is why we initiated the whole COAG process, now under way. We are very happy to work with the states. We are very happy to continue the funding to the states, not only special purpose payments, which have often been controversial over the years, but in terms of general assistance grants and the financial assistance grants as well-the subject of this legislation, which involves such a crude and outrageous breach of promise. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and this government have an ideological agenda which is absolutely transparently crystal clearlucidly clear-in this particular legislation. is not just to divest functions from the Commonwealth to the states. That has always been part of the conservative agenda. It is to divest functions and services from the government generally. (Time expired)",106

266,Mr LINDSAY,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"By press release issued today, 18 September, the Hon. Stephen Martin, MP, has made a statement in which there are a number of sentences which misrepresent my position. In the first paragraph Mr Martin says that I 'voted against a resolution in the Federal Parliament which called for the Government to overturn its decision ... ' That was not a resolution at all; it was a procedural motion to suspend standing orders. It goes on to say that I 'voted against debating the resolution'. That is not so. I voted not to suspend the standing orders of the parliament. Paragraph 3 states that I claimed that a tax will result in unemployment. I have never claimed that, and I have been misrepresented. It further claimed that I said that this matter is 'anti-Queensland'. I have never said that, and I have been misrepresented. The fourth paragraph says: Yet, at the first opportunity to send a message to their Government ... The first opportunity for me to send a message to the government was quite some weeks ago now, and I have done that. So that misrepresents my position. In the fifth paragraph he talks about a gang of five. I am not a member of a gang of five, never have been and do not intend to be. That misrepresents my position. The fifth paragraph also states: It would appear that none of the members is prepared to put into action in the national Parliament what they claim they would do in their local constituencies.

271,Mr ENTSCH,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"In a press release issued today by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) titled 'Coalition MPs Squib Reef Tax Vote', he claimed that I voted against a motion in the federal parliament which called for the government to overturn its decision to increase the reef tax. The member for Cunningham should be fully aware from his experience as a former Speaker of this House that the motion he raised today was absolutely nothing like that which he claimed in his press release. It was simply a procedural motion requesting a suspension of standing orders to allow him to move a motion. He further claimed that I failed 'at the first opportunity to send a message to my government and vote in favour of a resolution calling for the reef tax increase not to proceed', that I had 'squibbed it'. This is also a patent untruth as I was not given the opportunity yesterday to vote on anything other than the motion requesting the suspension of standing orders. I also have been misrepresented with regard to the comment 'anti-Queensland' and by the suggestion that I may well be a member of a gang of five. (Quorum formed) One other comment that was made by the member for CunninghamMr Martin-I move that so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the members for Leichhardt, Dawson, Capricornia, Hinkler and Herbert fully explaining their opposition to the government's 500 per cent increase in the reef tax as expressed to their local constituents.",111

Also, in paragraph 5, there is reference to a gang of five. I know of no such gang of five. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will also note that there is another part in this press release that says 'where they had claimed variously that they would cross the floor'.

325,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Do you claim to have been misrepresented?,115
326,Mr MAREK,NOES,Most grievously.,115
327,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Please proceed.,115
328,Mr MAREK,NOES,"In a press release issued today by the member for Cunningham, the Hon. Stephen Martin, entitled 'Coalition MPs squib reef tax vote', he claimed that I: . .. voted against a resolution in the federal parliament which called for the government to overturn its decision to increase the reef tax . . . As the member for Cunningham will be fully aware from his experience as the ex-Speaker in the House, the motion",115
329,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,You will need to confine your statement to showing where you have been misrepresented.,116
330,Mr MAREK,NOES,Stephen Martin claimed absolutely nothing in the press release about the procedural motion requesting the suspension of the standing orders having been allowed. He further claimed that I failed: ... at the first opportunity to send a message to their Government and vote in favour calling for the reef tax increase not to proceedthey squibbed it. It is a blatant mistruth. I was not given an opportunity today to vote on anything other than a motion to suspend the standing orders. With that in mindMr Brereton interjecting,116
331,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The is honourable member for Kingsford-Smith will not interject from the wrong side, as much he would like to be there.",116
332,Mr MAREK,NOES,The member for Cunningham also stated that I was 'anti-Queensland'. That is a most despicable statement to make. I have always lived in Queensland.,116
333,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,Right. It is O'Connor untrue.,116
334,Mr MAREK,NOES,The next point I wish to make is that he said that I a 'Gang of Five'. I totally repudiate the fact that I was a member of a gang of five. That is absolutely incorrect. He also said that I I would cross the floor. This is a blatant,116
335,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,No. The honourable member for Capricornia will withdraw that statement.,116

337,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,There is no funding need for you to do that. The honourable member for Capricornia will very quickly close his personal explanation.,116
338,Mr MAREK,NOES,The other point I wish to make here this evening is that he said: It is a question of saying one thing for local consumption and doing something else in Canberra where they think their actions can be hidden. I have worked tirelessly in this parliament.,116
339,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,No. I do not need to know how hard you have worked. I think you have explained where you have of a resolution been misrepresented.,116
340,Mr MAREK,NOES,I have one last point to make. I call on the member for Cunningham to unequivocally withdraw the blatant lies he made.,116
341,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,No. Resume your seat.,116
342,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,It not only when Labor Party members-who one would think would know better-put out as press releases that they delude themselves.,116
343,Mr KERR,NOES,"Mr Acting Speaker, on a point of order: it was ruled from the chair that it was not material to the current debate so as to facilitate a suspension of standing orders, and immediately we have the member for debating entirely irrelevant matters.",116
344,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NOES,There is no point of order. The honourable member will was a member of resume his seat.,116
345,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"If the person who has said pulled down a ministerial salary in the past lie. does not even know the numbers of the standing orders he refers to, it shows you how much is in his head. The point I wish to make is the ability the Labor Party have, which has always existed, to delude themselves. In this case we have seen them delude themselves on the issue of procedural motion, and a proper motion has not just been before the place. The shadow Treasurer as one of our previous speakers to debate, spent a lot of time telling us just this how kind the previous Labor government had been to the states over time in regard to the we are debating today. I thank them very much for the delays they caused, because it gave me the opportunity to obtain the statistics relative to payments to the states. It is very interesting to look at the budget outlays by function in the budget document and find the figures that relate to this particuability lar issue. It is of interest to me that back in 1986-87, when the previous government was in place, the figure for the 'General purpose intergovernment transaction function' stood at nearly $13 billion. Of course, in 1996-97 it is now at $16.797 billion. That is irrelevant in itself until one takes it as a percentage of the total government outlays. I have another document here that points out that back in 1984-85, shortly after the election of the previous government, the grants to the states in their various forms represented 19.8 per cent of total government outlays. By 1994-95, shortly before the previous government lost office, it was down from 19.8 per cent to 12.3 per cent-nearly half. The reality is that the shadow Treasurer stands up here lecturing us about how we as a coalition government have dealt to the states. In fact, it has been well known and well publicised over the years that, every time Paul Keating, as Treasurer and later as Prime Minister, boasted of how he had maintained Commonwealth outlays as a percentage of GDP at relatively low levels, the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays had gone up and that that percentage had been maintained by the process of cutting money to the states. It is worse than that, because the shadow Treasurer also got on to the health issue. These health outlays in the states are amazing things. It was the previous government that stood up, invented a program called Medicare and then dumped all the costs of the hospital side of that on to state governments. Yes, they sent them a bit of money; it was just never enough. So promises were made, but the costs were dumped on the state governments. The states are now twisting on that hook. They cannot find the money from the resources in the revenue base available to them, and people are now turning around and coming up with cost shifting measures that have to be addressed also. Anybody who suggests that the previous coalition government was in any way responsible for the current parsimonious status of the state governments is ignoring history. The to rewrite history is something that has stuck with this Labor Party for as long as I have been here, which is 16 years. They have rewritten history back to the time when Billy Hughes swapped sides. The reality is that in all of these cases it is time that the shadow Treasurer, the person who has the claimed academic qualifications and everything else, remembered history and did not come into this place-where everything is on the record-and try to rewrite it in terms of his previous government's dealings with the states. The Labor government robbed them blind. I will repeat something I said earlier. Between 1984-85 and 1994-95, Commonwealth payments to the states as a percentage of total outlays dropped from 19.8 per cent to 12.3 per cent. It is a farce to suggest in any way that the problems confronting state governments all arose in this year's budget. Why wasit necessary for this government to go to the states and ask them to make a contribution towards getting rid of the Beazley black hole from the funds which were guaranteed to them by a previous government? The answer is simple: somebody, somewhere, had to decide what their commitment to the youth of Australia was. For years I have been walking Australia complaining about the Keating policy of letting the children pay-a policy of meeting everybody's requirements, feeding the money out into the economy and borrowing the difference. The Labor government never had the courage to tax to the level of its expenditures. The reality is that, over the lifetime of the Keating government, we saw the debt of the Commonwealth rise by over $70,000 million. Who has to pay that back? More particularly, who is going to suffer from lower living standards? The youth of this country, that is who. Why is it that the hospital system will be under pressure? Because you spent the money. This is the issue throughout. The money has been spent. Members on the other side cry crocodile tears over the future of Telstra. They spent Telstra. On any business balance sheet, there is $70 million of additional debt. That is after you sold the Commonwealth bank, Qantas and CSL. You sold all of those assets and - pent the money. So they have gone, too. The kids' assets have gone. On the balance sheet, the value of Telstra is spent. Every penny of it. We propose to sell only a third of Telstra and try to reduce that debt to manageable levels. Anyone who does the homework will see that government revenue will benefit, even after the loss of dividend, by saving $300 million or $400 million a year on the interest bill. That is the reality, and it has be done to give the kids of this country a go. It is grossly improper in reasonable economic times for governments to be borrowing money. If they cannot meet their promises with taxation, then they should spend less. That is what we are trying to do. We should be doing it, and we should be getting assistance in doing it. That is the other point I want to make. There is a thing called the national interest. We had a lot of philosophical positions which were formulated into policies and which were eventually stolen by the then Labor government and used. Privatisation was one of those. Not at one stage did we walk away from our philosophical position. We stood up in this place and were counted-we voted in favour of our position. Let me say that the Commonwealth Bank would not be sold today-certainly the Labor Party would never have got to that positionif we had tried to make the sort of stupid mischief that is going on from the opposition benches today. It is opposition for opposition's sake. It is heart breaking, because there is a national interest. I see that the member at the table, the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), is raising his eyebrows. No electorate more than his needs help. It needs a new labour program so that the employers will go back into the marketplace and hire people. The Labor Party is finding every possible scheme to drive around silly industrial relations laws. But businesses will not buy it. They will always be smarter than the rest and, if you keep putting up roadblocks, they will stop hiring people. We want to give the businesses some confidence that they can hire people and hire them on rates where they make good money. I hear time and time again that in my state we have draconian industrial relations laws. Every week, people are moving out of the electorate of Corio and over to Western Australia to be exploited--exploited because we have a government that is giving people the opportunity to earn the highest wages in Australia. Their industrial law is working. People are leaving Victoria. They are going over there to get exploited. They reckon it is to so good being exploited in Western Australia that they cannot get there quickly enough. That is the reality. National interests should be put above politics. After you have lost an election-as we did, and we stayed in opposition for a considerable period-there comes a time when you ask yourselves, 'Are we going to oppose this to be mischievous, or are we going to oppose it because it is wrong?' Our record in that regard is that we opposed things only when they were wrong. We did not do backflips on our proposals when we were in opposition. If we said in our policy that we would do something or if we had done it in the past, we stood by it. The simple fact is that the Labor Party is not doing Australians any favours at all by denying progress. When I listed myself for this debate, my principal reason was to put the argument where it really belongs. I would like to think that this is the last parliament where we have to debate this sort of legislation-the Commonwealth's gift to the states, the last time we have to have the Premiers of Australia coming along cap-in-hand begging for money. Too frequently Prime Ministers make themselves and their bottom lines look good by denying the states the funds they need to provide the services like health, dental care and all the other issues which are properly their responsibility and, might I add, not ours. Let me say something about the brilliant Medicare while I am in that area! The figures are here-budget outlays by function, and I know them off by heart. Prior to the introduction of Medicare, the expenditure of the Commonwealth on these three items was: defence, about $4 billion; education, about $3.5 billion; and health, about $3 billion. It was the general public's opinion that they had a pretty good health system. Over 60 per cent of Australians paid for their own health cover. That is why the outlays were that low. What is the situation today? We outlay $19.4 billion for health, $11 billion for education, and $10 billion for defence. And you wonder why there is no money for students. Your health system has doubled in relative terms in cost and, as a result, what have you got? You are starving every other segment of the budget. You have created a community attitude where they are hooked on it, just as they might be on a drug, and the situation goes on. You have highly distorted the situation. The situation is no good. I want to talk about the national interest. is time that both sides of this parliament stopped being silly about tax. It is time that we demonstrated that as a group of politicians we can sit down together and look at what is a ridiculous and stupid tax system. I got some information out today. How do states survive outside of the $16.3 billion plus another $219 million that we pay to the states? Let me tell you. Payroll taxes: $6.579 billion, a direct tax on employment and one of the silliest taxes that man ever invented. In tough times we tax people for employing people. Then we bring in a thing called a threshold that encourages small business to say: 'I cannot put another person on because I will break through the threshold and have to pay payroll tax.' The tax on removable property is worth $7.8 billion. It is probably not bad to the extent that it services property but it is another tax on business enterprises and other people who are trying to run a business and make profits. One of the great tragedies of the present difficult time is that businesses are finding that they cannot put their prices up but a lot of these taxes are increasing. I looked to the business with which my family is associated the other day and saw over a period of time that the tariff they charge has remained standard but the council rates have doubled. That is a little outside this debate but it is an example of how business people are finding it more and more difficult to pay these taxes when in a low inflation environment, which I am delighted we now have, they are unable to raise their fees to recover that amount. Taxes on financial capital transactions, stamp duties, are worth $3.998 billion. Financial institution taxes are worth $1.831 billion. We are going out to the world saying: 'Come to Australia, put your head office in Australia, run your Asian enterprise from Australia, but every time the money flows in and out we will tax it. We will tax you when you bank it. ' Mr O'Connor-That's fair. What's wrong with that?",116
346,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"I do not think it is. I think it is plainly stupid because they will not come. We are the only country in the world It that taxes people's money when they bank it and when they withdraw it. It is a tax that is there and there is no way the states can get out of it. I have just cited how much money is involved. It is a silly tax. I could go on and cite the others. Taxes on insurance have been around for years-they are worth $1.688 billion. Again, it is just a straight cost of doing business. The taxes keep increasing and more and more businesses close down or replace workers to find the money. That is silly. I am arguing that it is time we sat down. Before Christmas I will bring a resolution to this parliament trying to get an even-sided committee, a committee that is half the opposition and half the government, to sit down and look at taxation between local government, state government and federal government and all its implications. I am not foolish enough to say that you apply a tax and somebody loses more than someone else. But we should have the wit in this place, if we are fair dinkum politicians and if we are here to do more than shout at one another and play games, to get together in the national interest and work out what is the best and, more particularly, the simplest tax system for Australia that raises the revenue, that runs the hospitals and looks after the poor but at the same time does not make it negative for business because business will always be the people that create employment. I heard someone say the other day: 'You are cutting back on public servants. That will create more unemployment.' If that were so simple, why don't we double the number of public servants and have no unemployment? We do not do it because there is not enough money in the economy to afford it. Why have a tax system that no-one else in the world has today? Why keep adding to fuel tax when it represents such a huge percentage of the cost of doing business in Australia? You can have a fuel tax in other parts of the world. The member for Corio--and good luck to himhas a major car manufacturing industry. Our present tax system, according to Australian Treasury, adds $700 to $800 to the manufactured cost of a car. We put lead in their saddlebags and say: 'Compete with the imports; export to the rest of the world, but pay $700 a car for the privilege.' It is silly. We should be looking at other ways to make your industry more efficient and create more jobs. We are smart people. We should be competitive in the world. When you talk about jobs, the simple reality is that if we got another half a per cent of the world's business we would probably have to double our population to handle it. It is out there for us because we have not got a big population. We do not really need to play that role within the world. We are constantly hamstringing our people with silly ideas. Talking about industrial relations, I have been an employer all my life. My kids discovered the other day-they run the family business-that if they chastise anybody now under this unfair dismissal law they have also got to threaten them with the sack. What a dreadful situation. We have never done that. We might tell someone they are not pulling their weight or something, but you never say, 'And you're going to be sacked.' But if you do not do it every time and if they claim unfair dismissal when on the 10th time you put them off, you have got to pay them compensation. That is silly. I have never known an employer yet who wanted to sack a good worker. They see them as the greatest asset they have got. They do not get up every morning thinking, 'Who can I be cruel to today?' We should not make that a concept wit-in Australia. Whilst there will always be the odd smart alec, your typical Australian small business employer gets along very well with his staff. Frequently it is very hard to differentiate him from them. Let us get sensible about it. More than anything I hope the Labor caucus will go back and say, 'We're not going to play silly with tax.' (Time expired)",119
347,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,"It is very good to have the opportunity twice in one day to be able to shine a little bit of light on the appalling things this government is doing to look after those Australians who are weak and vulnerable-the ones that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is always expressing so much concern about. Tonight I want to talk about a couple of issues in my shadow portfolio that are very important particularly to people in my own electorate of Jagajaga. One of the most outrageous efforts of this government in cutting $1.5 billion in grants to the states over the next three years of course is the effect of these cuts on our health system, particularly on our public hospital system. When we consider that about one-third of all state expenditure is on health, then it is possible to get an appreciation of the scale of the impact of these cuts. These cuts are going to have very serious implications for our public hospitals. Some might say, 'Oh, but there are separate Medicare grants for public hospitals.' What they do not realise is that 50 per cent of hospital funding comes out of general purpose grants to the states. This massive cut to state grants is going to see more and more cuts to public hospital services-particularly, I would have to say, to our public hospitals in Victoria. They are cuts that we can ill afford. The reason we can ill afford them is, of course, that they come on top of cuts to public hospitals. In Victoria we have seen far too many cuts. We have seen massive cuts to public hospital expenditure over the last three years. We are all too familiar with the terrible stories.",120
348,Unknown,NOES,Government members interjecting,120
349,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,Those interjecting obviwas ously do not care about the many people are left waiting on trolleys for long periods corridors and in other inappropriate areasMr O'Connor-Twelve hours.,121
350,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,"Anywhere but where they inforces should be when they are sick and needing than otherscare-which, of course, is in a public hospital bed. The desperately sad part is that plenty of beds. The problem is that there is not enough money being provided Victorian government to pay for nurses, doctors and other hospital workers so that people can be cared for. I received a letter from a constituent mine who has had exactly this problem in my local hospital. The hospital is the Austin Repatriation Medical Centre-an outstanding hospital. My constituent is a resident Watsonia. He was admitted to casualty at the Austin at 4.45 p.m. with angina. He had the horrific usual tests done. He lay in casualty until than I am. 11.30 that night and was advised that he would be kept overnight. At approximately 2.15 in the morning he was told that he had unstable angina and that there were no beds fight available at either the Austin or ation sites. He says: However, I was offered treatment at a private hospital at our own expense. Since I had insurance and couldn't afford costs at a private hospital, I declined the offer. I indicated that veteran, I understood we were afforded some priority at Austin or Repat. Approximately 3 a.m. Told that I would be transferred to Box Hill hospital as a public patient, and that an ambulance had been ordered. 7.30 a.m. Ambulance arrived and I was taken to Box Hill. This constituent makes it very clear that at no time has he made any criticism of either the medical or the nursing staff at the hospital. At all times the medical and the nursing staff tried to help him in every way that they could. He goes on to say: My complaint is in the delay in waiting for an ambulance while my condition was unstable ... I am also disturbed about the apparent lack of application of priority treatment to veterans as evidenced by the offer to go to a private hospital. This was to be at his own expense. After all, this priority treatment was something which agreed to between the RSL, the governwho ment and the hospitals at the time of the in amalgamation and incorporation in their charter. He goes on to say: Finally, my 15 hours spent on a trolley simply rethe other incidents of trolley occupation by other patients. Admittedly, my time was shorter there are his time was shorter at 15 hoursbut from comments by the nursing staff, 12 hours by the is now the accepted minimum. Twelve hours, as the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) rightly said earlier, is the accepted minimum in our public hospitals as a result of of the Kennett cuts. How long are people going to have to wait on trolleys now as a result of and these additional cuts that have come through from these general purpose grants? As my of constituent goes on to say: This is a disgraceful situation, and must be an ordeal for the frail and those who are older In finishing the letter, he says: I trust my comments may be of some help in your to improve standards of care and for additionthe Repatrial money for such purpose. What I am going to have to tell this constituent is that not only is this government not no providing any more money; it is taking a considerable amount of money, through the as a general purpose grants, out of public hospitals. That is not the only cut that is going to happen to public hospitals. As we also know, public hospitals are going to suffer massive cuts as a result of specific purpose payments and other cuts. The Austin and Repatriation hospitals have enjoyed a long and very deserved reputation as public hospitals of a very high quality. They offer the highest quality of service to our local community and, of course, to the whole of Melbourne, Victoria and many international patients. The Repatriation hospital, as it was, provided exemplary service and care to generations of veterans, while the Austin, as well as providing public hospital care to the local community, has gained international repute for the standard of its care, particularly for those with spinal injuries. Labor, when in government federally, was totally committed to a first-class public hospital system. Let us just look at some of the figures that demonstrate that, figures call into question the comments of Minister for Health and Family Services Wooldridge) in question time today. What happened during the last three years of Kennett government is that the Kennett government cut its share of public hospital funding by $275 million. While he was doing that, Labor federally actually put in million. The Minister for Health and Family Services might try to say that that was money meant for the repatriation patients. In another $130 million was paid to Victoria repatriation patients but, as you can see the letter from my constituent, that money not going to give veterans the priority they were promised. You can also see that the same thing is happening in other states. In South Australia and Western Australia the same problem occurred. The Premiers of both of those states have taken money out of their public hospitals while, at the same time, Labor was trying to put money in. These trends are very disturba ing, particularly, as I say, when we look the other cuts that exist in this area of health. Let us look at what has been described the most callous cut of all to health programs in this budget-the complete abolition of the Commonwealth dental program. I happen to for the states.' know a little bit about the Commonwealth dental program. It is not the case, as members opposite have suggested, that the Labor government when in power just dreamt this up at the last minute. I was, in fact, the director of the national health strategy that was responsible for the development of this policy. It was developed in close consultation with the Australian Dental Association and it was with the support of that association that Labor implemented this policy. Far from being a last minute thing-which is being peddled around this House. The we have certainly seen plenty of in this government budget-and far from being that sort of policy initiative, the Commonwealth dental program was a carefully thought out policy. It was highly targeted policy and it has only been case. available to people with health care cards. It was not a generally available service. Let us look at the implications of complete that abolition of the Commonwealth dental prothe gram in Victoria. Before we had the (Dr Commonwealth dental policy there were 70,000 people getting treatment in Victoria the and the waiting time at the local dental hospital was four years. Can you imagine having to wait for four years if you were in pain and in need of dental treatment? In 1996, $207 with the Commonwealth dental program, 99,000 people were treated. It was a massive increase in the number of people treated and fact, the waiting time was brought back to 12 for months-still far too long. That is certainly from not something that any of us would say was is a reasonable waiting period and, therefore, a justification for getting rid of this program. Nobody should have to wait that long to get their teeth fixed. What are the Victorians projecting will has happen to people needing dental care now that this scheme is abolished? By 1998, they estimate there will be 289,000 people waiting for dental treatment in Victoria. If that is not very callous statement, just wait to hear for at how long they estimate people would have to wait-II years. What do those opposite say should happen in Victoria? They say, 'The as Victorian government should pick it up. This is not something for us. We shouldn't have to worry about dental treatment. This is a matter On the one hand, they say to the states, 'You are going to have to take a cut of $1 Y2 billion.' Then they say, 'While we are about it, we are going to give you a few extra responsibilities,' like complete responsibility for what, up until very recently, was an outstanding program-the Commonwealth dental program. So we are seeing a complete contradiction on the part of this government. I will just say one other thing on the dental program because this is another untruth that , .1 j is trying to say that the states did not keep up their end of the bargain while the Commonwealth dental program was coming a into operation. That too, in fact, is not the If you take the Victorian government as an example-as my previous discussion on hospitals shows-they have not been too loose with the cash. What they did do in the dental area was provide an additional amount of money for dental care to enable adolescents to be treated as part of the school dental program-which they had not been beforeand also to expand the denture program. So it is not the case in Victoria that the state government walked away from the school dental program, or walked away from dentures, or walked away from the state dental hospital. They did not do any of those things. As the figures show, what in fact happened was that a lot more people got treated as a result of this outstanding program. We have seen this program abolished. We have seen $ Ph bi Ilion taken out of the states' budgets. Because health care is such a large part of the state expenditure, what we are going to see in Victoria is a massive increase in the length of time that people will have to wait for urgent care. We just saw those figures released in the last week. There are in fact increasing numbers of people now waiting for urgent care, but what we think is even worse than that is that people are put on trolleys and left for 15 hours or even longer waiting for an urgent hospital bed. That is not the sort of policy that we should be condoning. We on this side of the House absolutely condemn these cuts to the states' grants and call for them to be reversed.",121
351,Mr DONDAS,NOES,"I listened closely to what the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) had to say in this debate on the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill. She was talking about shining lights. My understanding is that the shining lights were dimmed by the Labor Party over the last 13 years that they have had to keep this country on an even keel. In 1983 they inherited a good, sound financial base. In 1996, we inherited a disaster. The honourable member for Jagajaga said that the situation was outrageous, but who has been there for 13 years, with respect? You have not been there for 13 years, but your party has been in government for 13 years. They have been at the wheel. They have been driving the bus and where has it taken us? It has taken us to a dead end. The honourable member for Jagajaga spoke a few moments ago about people waiting on dental lists for four years. I think it is disgraceful that you have to wait for four years if you have not got private medical cover. Who was responsible for that situation? The Labor Party. When you think of the massive debt that we have inherited, I believe the states have taken a very sensible approach and have accepted-even the Labor state has accepted-the financial arrangements for the next three financial years. In looking at general revenue assistance, information has been provided to me by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) in his second reading speech and also by the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Bills Digest. I must say the Parliamentary Library and the Bills Digest certainly do provide very valuable information to honourable members, and I would hope that more honourable members would use it. To quote the section in the Bills Digest which talks about general revenue assistance: Special revenue assistance grants include the Medicare guarantee payment, special and transitional allowances for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Medicare guarantee payments are estimated to total $428 million in 1996-97. That is $188.4 million for Victoria and $240 million for New South Wales. This compares with a total of $413.9 million in 1995-96, which represented $182 million for Victoria and $231.9 million for New South Wales. Even after the drastic cuts that the states had to take to accommodate the black hole-the bankcard deficit left by the Keating government of some nearly $10.3 billion-the amounts by which the grants have been reduced are very minor in comparison to the general community. The bill is a routine amendment to the act incorporating changes to arrangements as agreed in 1996 at the Premiers Conference and under the national competition policy reforms. In effect, the bill allows the Commonwealth to recoup an amount of $619 million from the states and territories in 97, $640 million in 1997-98 and $300 million in 1998-99 as a contribution to the Commonwealth's deficit reduction strategy, while effectively maintaining the underlying growth in the pool of financial assistance grants in real per capita terms. The contribution of each state and territory is on an equal per capita basis, that is, the population shares. These amounts were determined according to the forecast escalation parameters used at the time of the Premiers Conference in June 1996. They imply a growth in the financial assistance grants pool of four per cent per annum, which is combined population growth and inflation, over the next three years. However, the Commonwealth has chosen to 'lock in' these amounts regardless of the actual outcome for int1ation and population growth. If the escalation factor for the pool comes in under four per cent per annum, then the states and territories will effectively lose out. If, however, the outcome for inflation and population growth combined is greater than four per cent per annum, then the states and territories will earn a small gain compared to the outcome if the amount of contribution was tied to the escalation factors applying to the pool. There is an incentive, therefore, for the Commonwealth to conduct its policies in such a way that inflation remains around its current levels, given that the population growth is relatively stable at around 1.1 per cent per annum. The bill ensures that the per capita relativities. as determined by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, along with the relevant state and territory populations, are used in formulating the distribution of the combined pool of financial assistance and hospital funding grants. It also provides for the payment of special revenue assistance to the territory of $10 million in 1996-97. Some members may have been aware that during my first speech I inferred that the Northern Territory, in some instances, was able to get additional funds from the Commonwealth government for the special needs of the Northern Territory for providing services to isolated communities by way of health, education and other things which are 1996- more expensive to provide in the territory than they would be in the states. It is very important that those funding levels out of special revenue assistance are still provided. In fact, I can remember that many years ago, when the special revenue system was first brought in, the Northern ferritory government put a particular proposition to the Commonwealth government for a higher level of funding, especially in Aboriginal communities in terms of providing essential services for health, education and housing. Unfortunately, at that particular time the Commonwealth government did not accede to the request of the territory for that amount of funding for the provision of services. It is a bit of a pity. Going back seven or eight years, it was probably far cheaper to put infrastructure in place then than it is today. If that was done, there may have been a lot more housing and a few more schools in those remote areas. Today, in 1996 dollars, obviously it is going to be much more expensive. The program as put by the Northern Territory government was rejected. In my speech yesterday on the appropriation bill, I did make some comment in relation to the funding that was going to be provided by the coalition for indigenous programs. I am happy to say that the money that is going to be put in by the coalition over the next four years is going to he more than the Labor Party put in over the previous four years. I believe that if the Commonwealth in 1987-88 had accepted that particular recommendation by the Northern Territory government for the provision of those essential services in those communities, some of those Aboriginal communities would be far better off today. As I said yesterday in my speech on the appropriation bill, in the last 13 years some of these communities have really gone backwards. It is a fact. When you go to some of these communities they say, 'You are neglecting us.' In a real sense, funds are being made available over the next four years. In 1996-97 the coalition has been put under a lot of pressure in framing its budget-in taking a very hard stance through the ERC, in try ilig to provide a better direction for the Australian community. They have had to take some hard decisions. We can look forward to the 1997-98 budget being not as tough and a bit more generous in terms of providing those essential services to remote communities. When I talk about essential services, I am hoping the states grants general purpose funding will be increased, especially to the Northern Territory, in the 1997-98 financial year. I will use the last few moments of my time setting out the main provisions of the bill. Item 1 of schedule 1 of the bill inserts a new section 12A in the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994, the principal act. This gives the Treasurer discretionary power to make competition policy payments to the states and territories for 1997-98. Item 2 of schedule 1 of the bill inserts a new section 15A in the principal act, which makes financial assistance grants to the states and territories for 1996-97 conditional on the payment of an amount of fiscal contribution; that is, towards the Commonwealth's deficit reduction program. Item 3 of schedule 1 of the bill inserts new schedules 3 and 4 in the principal act. Proposed schedule 3 sets out relativity factors for the states and territories for 1996-97. These are used in the determination of per capita grants. It also sets out the formula for determining the amounts of arterial road grants payable to the states and territories in 199697, and base assistance amounts for each state and territory for 1996-97 with respect to special revenue assistance grants. Proposed schedule 4 contains the formula for Commonwealth payments to the states and territories in 1997-98 for implementation of the national competition policy. The formula is based on an indexed amount divided by the states' and territories' population. The Commonwealth would not have had to take these drastic measures into consideration had it not been for the Beazley bankcard debt, the black hole, the deficit that has been left on the Australian community. The medicine taken by the states is certainly going to be hard for them, but I know that after the Premiers Conference they decided they would rather take that course of action than any other action the Commonwealth had proposed at that particular time. I commend the bill to honourable members.  adjourned. NA Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs Committee Documents",123
352,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES,I seek leave to make a short statement in relation to a request for leave to use committee submissions in court proceedings. Leave granted.,125
353,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES,"On 25 June 1996, the House referred to the Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs an Auditor-General's report on Commonwealth fisheries management. The committee initiated an inquiry to review and consider the findings of the Auditor-General and has been taking written submissions from the general public. We have now received a request from Mr O. Harasymiw, on behalf of himself and Dr G.R. Kesteven, for leave to use their submissions to the committee in court proceedings. The request was considered by the committee earlier today. It appears that granting leave will not interfere with the capacity of the committee to conduct its inquiry and the committee resolved that I, in the absence of the committee chair, advise the House of this request and advise also that the view of the committee is that it does not oppose the House granting leave for the submissions to be adduced into evidence. I ask the House to consider the granting of leave to Mr Harasymiw and Dr Kesteven to adduce into evidence in court proceedings their submissions to the inquiry into the management of Commonwealth fisheries being conducted by the Standing Committee of Primary Industry, Resources, Rural and Regional Affairs. NA Motion (by Mr Warwick Smith) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",125
354,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"The possible closure or sell-off of the Australian National Railways Commission and the discussion on the sale of our airports has caused Tasmania to look hard at its transport systems this week. It has not helped that information that is vital for sensible decision making on Tasrail has been kept from decision makers and only let out by mistake. I want to take up the issue of the Brew report, some of which was apparently released in error in Tasmania last week. It was of great concern to me to see a headline in newspapers that Tasrail will close because it is not viable. Figures from annual reports told that Tasrail was moving towards being self-supporting until that statement. It appears from the report now that Tasrail was forced into heavy lossmaking contracts against the wishes of the Australian National Railways Commission. It has been bearing a load of debts from the whole systems administration. The next bombshell was that the person who came into relieve the retiring general manager of Tasrail has a contract for only six months. Even if there was a possibility of arguing that Tasrail is now very effective and can stand on its own feet if freed of debt, the governments do not want to know. Both federal and state governments are after its closure, their excuse being that they do not think it is government business to be running railways. What nonsense! Maybe the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), during his current love affair with Europe, might just consider some of the European transport systems. Many of these train systems are government run and subsidised and can move thousands of people and tonnes of freight very effectively and very efficiently. The governments are subsidising the infrastructure, not the fares and running costs. The biggest problem facing transport in Tasmania today is that the current state government has no idea about planning. There is no strategical transport system for Tasmania. We need to provide an integrated, multi modal transport system-flexible and adaptable-to deal efficiently with Tasmania's future transport needs in a changing environTasrail ment. I believe that Bob Cotgrove's article in the Mercury on 16 September is very important. He identifies that the difficulties faced by Tasrail are not unrelated to other transport means and should be looked at in a broader context. There has never really been a strong effort to integrate services. The private and public bus systems do not meet. I think the only connection made in Tasmania is that a bus meets the ferry at Devonport. We now have a threat to the air travel should the airports go to the highest bidder rather than to a local consortium. Both commuter and tourist passenger and freight movement should be developed in unison, if not incorporated together. I can only point to Norway, where they have incorporated a tourist trip in their daily freight and mail runs through the fjords. You start by train on a ratchet railway, collect a ferry for the water travel and then pick up a bus service at the other end. They are all well patronised and easily accessible. Hobart is taking on trams again, but the river is barely touched in the south or the north. Air travel should be integrated with our other modes of transport. One advantage is that the local rail still has a strong competitive advantage over road transport for certain commodities such as logs, pulp, cement, coal, sulfuric acid, fertilisers and other low value bulk materials. I call upon the state government to set up a commission of inquiry as a matter of urgency so that all the ideas and concerns of the transport industry can be considered. The proposed update of the Callaghan report might be an appropriate vehicle because it is Commonwealth funded, as long as it can be completed in time and quickly. It would also help local entrepreneurs who are looking at the airports to come up with a profitable package. Tasmania needs a proper strategy to ensure that all transport modes can work together in a unit and that way Tasrail has a very good opportunity and a good chance of still being part of our transport system into the next century. Foreign Aid",126
355,Dr NELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"My adjournment address is prompted by the first speech delivered by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) last week in this chamber. There is a lot to admire about the honourable member: a single mother raising four children, running a family business in a tough economic climate and a fearless courage to speak out. These are characteristics normally found in my heroes and, in fact, the hallmarks of traditional liberalism. That, however, is where my admiration ends. The member for Oxley has called for an immediate end to foreign aid, preferring instead to see the money spent on ourselves or, more specifically, on unemployment. Her understandable resentment of the more questionable aspects of Aboriginal funding leads her to deny a disadvantage in being an Australian Aborigine. A number of callers to my office think she is right. One went so far as to suggest in rather crude terms that, in contrast to the member for Oxley, I am seriously lacking in testosterone. I challenge those who subscribe to the view that we spend too much on Aborigines to go to Palm Island, Fitzroy Crossing, Aurukun or Docker River and then tell me you wish you had been born there. I would not consider myself privileged were I to be born into circumstances in which I would have only a one in three chance of living to the age of 65. I took my son door-knocking-he is ninein March for Red Cross. I told him that he would learn something important that day, and he did. A man in a three-storey mansion with two luxury cars in the drive gave us 50c and said, 'No change.' An elderly woman, nursing her dying husband in what seemed to be a lifelong family home, offered $50 with the comment, 'There is always someone whose needs are greater.' Sometimes it is tempting to think that we ought to give up on foreign aid. Billions of dollars have been spent in the last 30 years. Economically, politically and ecologically things frequently seem worse, with famine, war and refugees. But remember though that the media highlights the bad news. My images of time spent in Kenya and Tanzania for World Vision are of people not unlike the member for Oxley or anyone else in this parliament-people struggling to survive, but usually happy in giving of themselves to others. If we become a people who no longer care about the world, it is then that we cease to be true human beings. One-eighth of mankind, its aspirations and talents reside in Africa, so too lies the measure of this country as a nation of caring people. As members of the human race, we should not ever abandon the-e in need. Would we give up on drug rehabilitation, telling kids not to smoke or support for families? Of course we would not. I have found in life that the strength of human beings and of nations can be measured in terms of the care, concern and compassion that they show to those who are most in need. Opinion pollsters seldom take their clipboards to the slums, the shacks, the shanty towns or the distant communities of Aboriginal Australia. But if they did, on behalf of the member for Oxley, or indeed for anyone of us here, we would find that their aspirations are a little different from the people whom she and I represent. There is no doubt that money can be better spent. However, Fred Hollows, Weary Dunlop, John Simpson Kirkpatrick and other selfless icons of this country did not become so for the promotion of self-interested resentment. There is constant tension within all of us as individuals and as a society between on the one hand wanting for ourselves and for our own self-interest and on the other hand needing to know that we are doing what we believe to be right. My son will need much more testosterone than that of the member for Oxley to follow in the shoes of the Australian. icons whom I mentioned. In the end, leadership is not about populism, and it is not about appealing to the primeval instinct in human beings to want for themselves; it is about trying to evoke in people a genuine enthusiasm to support things that are in the best long-term interests of others, the community and society. In that sense, I disagree vehemently with the things that were said by the member for Oxley. National Commission of Audit",127
356,Mr HATTON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak in this adjournment debate tonight on the connection between the National Commission of Audit: report to the Commonwealth government and the implications of taking this National Commission of Audit approach, which directly interlinks with the philosophies of the coalition, for the future of the Commonwealth government of Australia. I will compare that with what we have had in the last 13 years under Labor and look at the future direction of the country as this philosophy is put into place. A key recommendation in the report of the National Commission of Audit was that the Commonwealth should hand over areas of responsibility to the states in so far as it is possible, therefore diminishing the Commonwealth's role. The argument was to stop the overlapping of services. Page 4 of the document says: Where programs are transferred to the States and funded by way of untied financial assistance grants: - the Commonwealth should seek the States' agreement to provide appropriate data for the collection and publication of national aggregate statistics on program output and outcome. So the Commonwealth's role is simply to be a repository for the data collected by the states so that it can have an overview of the programs that are put back to it. The states are given these programs at a discount. The next recommendation says: - the funds transferred should be at a level of no more than 90 per cent of their total value reflecting the scope for rationalisation and savings by the States in reduced administration. So the states would get Commonwealth government programs at only 90 per cent of the total dollar value of what it used to run the programs. For that 10 per cent cut for the extra work, the extra responsibility and the extra administration-simply because of the argument that the overlap is done away with-the states are given less and they are asked to do a great deal more. The third key recommendation was this: - any national policy bodies that are retained should limit their activity to joint work on coordination and strategic directions and the development of standards, benchmarks and performance measures. They should not be involved in service delivery or approval of projects. This last recommendation of the National Commission of Audit underlines the coalition's approach to what the Commonwealth government of Australia should be involved in. Not only should they hand over their current powers and their programs at a discount to the states but their sole role should be as data collectors and as people who provide development standards, benchmarks and performance measures. They should not provide any services and they should get out of the game completely. There is an implication here. Historically, the Commonwealth has undertaken program and service delivery in a range of areas to supplement the states, which have been incapable of providing adequate service provision to the people in their constituencies. It has cooperated with the states and with the local government to provide things that could otherwise not be done. There probably is no better example of an innovative program passed through this House than the building better cities program, initiated by former Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe. This program enabled local, state and federal governments to cooperate effectively in things that they could not have done on their own. In South Australia major projects have been put together and are now very successful. Most programs have been carried out by a Liberal government in cooperation with the federal government, and they could never have been done with the resources available to the state of South Australia. Likewise, the Australian Technology Park at Redfern, Sydney, could never have been established without the cooperation of the New South Wales government in providing the land and the $11 million of building better cities funds for the basic infrastructure for the technology park, which is of world standard. As it is more fully established in the coming years-and it should be supported by further national Commonwealth funding-it will the leading technology park in the world. Australian Paralympic Team Lindsay By-election",128
357,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"Robertson) (7.44 p.m.)Tonight I would like to place on record my congratulations to all the members of the Australian Paralympic team which recently competed in Atlanta with such outstanding results. The Australian Paralympic team won 42 gold medals, 37 silver medals and 27 bronze medals-a total of 106. The team finished second overall on the gold medal tally and have been welcomed back with parades throughout Australia where thousands of Australians turned out to show the paralympians how proud we are as a nation of these magnificent athletes. Whilst it is important to recognise the medal winners, the world record holders, the champions, I would today like to also recognise the athletes who competed, gave their best and proudly represented their country without winning a medal because they are, in my eyes, all champions. One such athlete is Ms Sue-Ellen Lovett from Mudgee in New South Wales. She is a visually impaired equestrian athlete who has worked tirelessly throughout her life not only to continue to compete in equestrian events despite her rapidly failing vision but also to help others through the Riding for the Disabled Association and other groups and by undertaking many arduous endurance rides throughout Australia to help raise money for those less fortunate than herself. Sue-Ellen and many other members of the equestrian team were forced to use borrowed horses for their events and overcame many other difficulties to achieve their very results in Atlanta. Once again, congratulations and well done to each and everyone of the 162 members of the Australian Paralympic team. Also, in the few minutes I have tonight, I want to make a couple of other comments as well. I was raised in a family that always believed in giving everyone a fair go. Having been involved in many different sports with my family, I have always taught my children to be good sports. After all, it is the Australian way to be a good sport-that is, accept the final result, congratulate the winner and gracefully accept your defeat until the next game. Politics is very much like sport. The opponents present themselves to the voters each three years, contest the election campaign, accept the will of the people and the victor becomes the member. At least, that is how it should happen but, obviously, some members on the other side do not believe in a fair go, a fair contest and the Australian way. On 2 March, the Australian people passed judgment on the opposing teams and overwhelmingly showed that the Labor Party had lost the ball, knocked on too many times and basically had forgotten what the game was all about. In the seat of Lindsay, the workers, the families, the retired people and the small businesses all said, 'Enough is enough.' They were sick and tired of the old, tired team dragging them down. For 14 years their member, Ross Free, took the people of western Sydney for granted and traditional Labor voters took the opportunity on 2 March to elect a new team to represent the seat of Lindsay. They elected vibrant, young, dynamic Jackie Kelly to be their member. Obviously, the Labor Party have not heard about a fair go or the Australian good sports.",129
358,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"She will be elected again, though.",129
359,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"She will be, most definitely. They challenged Jackie Kelly's election in the Court of Disputed Returns and they did not accept the wishes of the people of Lindsay. They could not accept that nearly 9,000 people changed their vote. They could not credible accept that they had been rejected. The High Court has now disqualified Jackie Kelly on a technicality because the Labor Party has challenged the result. The Labor Party has robbed the people of Lindsay of their choice of Jackie Kelly as their representative in the Howard-Fischer coalition government.",129
360,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,She'll be back.,129
361,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"She will be back, definitely. In the short time that Jackie Kelly has been in this place, she has fought hard for the residents of Lindsay and won the respect of new and experienced parliamentarians alike. At the by-election, the people of Lindsay will have a choice between giving Jackie Kelly, as part of the coalition government, a fair go to continue to work for them, to give their kids a sound and secure future, to get western Sydney moving again, to stimulate business, to create jobs and to ensure that western Sydney and the seat of Lindsay are not neglected, or they can go back to the recycled, tired Labor member as part of the irrelevant and ineffectual Labor opposition. Lindsay By-election Aged Care Hostels",129
362,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"The personHardly al attack by the member for Robertson (Mr not Lloyd) on Ross Free demeans him, and it is not characteristic of the usual constructive remarks he makes in this chamber. Could I providing point out to the member for Robertson used a sporting analogy. Usually, in most sports, you have to be eligible to register hostel before you are allowed to play on the team. lets The difficulty for the Liberal Party is that Kelly was nominated by the state director of the Liberal Party of New South Wales, Mr cost Nutt, who, unfortunately, did not carry out the from basic checks that every other carries out. Mrs Bishop-Yes, he did.",130
363,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"The minister at the table said he Dear Peter, did carry out the checks. Did Jackie Kelly mislead him? Mrs Bishop-No, she did not.",130
364,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"We get an interjection from the across the table, but someone has something will wrong. Jackie Kelly, a New Zealand citizen, a member of the RAAF, was struck the decision which the High Court handed What down in 1990. Every other member of this House knows, and their political party warned them, that have to be eligible to stand for the House Representatives before your party nominates you. In every other seat, the candidate did what the state party asked them to do, they this House. did what their party wanted them to do, except in the electorate of Lindsay. The fact that the Liberal Party was at fault is proven by the fact that the High Court determined that the Liberal Party had to pay two-thirds of the costs of the action. So if the Liberal Party is not at fault, why did the High Court end up saying you had to pay two-thirds of the cost? That is the rebuttal that I would make. Tonight, I rise to make some remarks about capital assistance for hostels-in particular, capital assistance for Rosemary Lodge, which is in Bateau Bay in my electorate. Rosemary Lodge has been established and funded by the Entrance-Long Jetty RSL sub-branch. I would  president of that sub-branch. He writes: Dear Michael, a day goes by when Rosemary Lodge does get an enquiry for permanent or respite accommodation. Currently our resident mix is 80% financially disadvantaged and while this does not provide for an operating profit, we feel that we are a necessary service and are willing to that he continue to do so. I know you are well aware of the need for more and respite places required in this area and face it that need is growing on a daily basis Ms throughout the Central Coast. Our Sub Branch is quite willing to allocate $700,000.00 toward the of building 14 more places and an additional respite room, however, without capital funding either State or Federal coffers this project will state director remain a pipe dream. Mr Davies attached a letter from Wallace Mackinnon and Associates, which states: As a result of the Federal Governments 1996/97that is, the budgetproposed advertising of new Aged Care Places take place in October 1996, but unfortunately, no longer will successful applicants be provided down by with any Capital Funding. this correspondence indicates is that this government has decided that apparently there will be a reduction or complete elimination of you capital funding from the federal government of for the non-profit sector hostels. This is an issue of great concern that I hope will attract some interest from members on both sides of There are many people who are disadvantaged living not just in my own electorate but right across the country who rely on the 'not for profit hostels' to provide them with basic accommodation. If the federal government is cutting out the capital funding that in the past has been available for charities, religious organisations and organisations like RSL subbranches to build hostels that do not require up-front capital payments, then I think that is something that, I would appeal to the government, should be reconsidered. The same point needs to be made in the whole area of nursing home access. The government has decided that people will have to pay an up-front nursing home fee if they are new residents, and the government has said that if a person has not lived in their own home for two years they will be exempt. But the problem is: if you are the owner of a nursing home and you have one vacant bed, and one person says they can give you $26,000 in an up-front free, and the other person has been granted an exemption by the government, who are you going to allow as the resident in your nursing home? Of course you will go for the person who pays the upfront fee. At the same time, the government is cutting back the capital funding available for disadvantaged people in hostels and nursing homes. Is it any wonder that there is a growing wave of opposition to this government's changes in aged care? And is it any wonder that the Australian people are calling on you to reconsider your decision to cut back funding for aged care? (Time expired) Foreign Aid Community Radio",130
365,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak about community radio. However, at the outset I would like to commend the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) on his speech. I agree with every word and every line that he delivered in his speech. Indeed, I am reminded of a story in relation to foreign aid that was delivered by Mr Harold Henderson, the former Director of World Vision. He was responding to the populist theme of 'What's the point of giving money to people oversea,,? It never gets there, so you don't give it.' The story goes something like this: if you are running through the desert with a pail of water for someone who is dying of thirst, the pail is leaking and, because of the run, it is spilling a bit and at the end of the journey there is a little bit of water left, do you pour it out onto the sand? Of course you do not; you give it to the person--and that is what it is really all about. I have had an involvement for some years with community radio and I thoroughly endorse it-in particular, 4CRB on the Gold Coast and, more recently, Radio for the Print Handicapped, 4RPH. But one community radio enterprise that just cannot seem to get off the ground and that has been battling away for more than 20 years is Family Radio up in Brisbane. It from time to time is allowed to have test broadcasts but it simply cannot get a licence.",131
366,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,Why not?,131
367,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,You ask why not. It is extraordinary. But over the years there have been suggestions that perhaps they are not interested at the old broadcasting tribunal with the notion of having a radio station that aspires to family values.,131
368,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Hopefully, the new minister will change that.",131
369,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"We hope that is right, as the member for Fisher says. But let me say this: Family Radio was promised a licence 21 years ago by Dr Cass, the then Minister for the Media way back in the Labor government days.",131
370,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,He was a disaster.,131
371,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"He was a disaster, as I am reminded. But the fact of the matter is that Family Radio has a very good profile in Brisbane. There is enormous support out there. I have received many letters from constituents in my electorate asking how much longer Family Radio will have to wait to get a licence. During temporary transmissions, usually of about 90 days, the estimated audience is of the order of 50,000 people, which is very substantial-and that estimate is probably conservative. The target audience is in the age group of early twenties to midfifties, and there are some programs that appeal to other overlapping groups. The goals of the radio station are quite laudable. They are: developing a profile that has wide community support and appeal; developing a high quality broadcasting service; providing support and encouragement to the family unit through education, information and entertainment from a Christian perspective; encouraging activities by the churches; providing facilities, including training and professional development of all personnel involved in Family Radio at all levels to obtain excellence in performance; and providing opportunities for media exposure for creative talent in this particular forum. The history of Family Radio's attempts to gain recognition has been very disappointing, as I have indicated. It has broad support from all major Christian denominations. Archbishops of both the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches have participated in broadcasts, as have other denominational heads. The Australian Broadcasting Authority has already identified six available FM frequencies in Brisbane which could be allocated. There are no other aspirant community groups conducting temporary transmissions in Brisbane. As I have indicated, this is a viable organisation. It is not seeking government funding, as some of the radio stations that presently on air have been doing and are contim,ing to do. Family Radio is independent, it is viable and it is desperate to get a licence. It is seeking the support of many members in the Brisbane area from where the target audience is obtained. Having spoken to a number of members, I do not know of anyone who would oppose the application. I support fully the application for a licence by Family Radio, and I commend its tenure as an aspirant to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 7.59 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Jull to move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Development of facilities for the Army Logistics Training Centre and the Bandiana Logistics Group at Bandiana and Bonegilla, Vic.

It is a nice 11 the board refers to the labour market and of economic activity but the within-year movements complicated by uncertainties relating to the data.

Long-term the unemployment for those out of work for more than force. This is still higher than for much of the 1980s but in mid 1993. The concentration of unemployment while lasting reductions in unemployment require restraints in labour costs, there is also a role for figuring prominently among the unemployed. handcuffing itself, as the previous government the notion of the need for economic growth to aimed directly at unemployed, particularly longto say, ' ... there is also a role for training and prominently among the unemployed'. That is why no economic growth, therefore no prospects for in long-term unemployment and, at the same out laid for those programs which are aimed at in particular, a chance at employment. 14 days after the Governor of the Reserve Bank the committee to Budget Paper No.1, it is forecasts and statements in Budget Paper of the notion of no jobs, no growth, higher In some other matters I will refer to these forecasts are now a bit tenuous and in some we find the forecasts for growth or real GDP. 1997-98,3 1,4 per cent; for 1998-99, 3V2 per cent; below four per cent, which is that percentage percentage you need to make some inroads into cent is basically just picking up those newer and sustainable pace in 1996-97 with GDP forecast NA 4682 There are two things here: again, confirmation economic growth, but also there is a bit of cent of growth as firm and sustainable or, as 'a forecast for strong growth'.

NA Wednesday, 18 September 1996 The labour market is simply stagnating, Again, I think that is optimistic, given what as a couple of surveys and forecasts are concerned. There is one point I would like to focus for economic growth to create employment, to take special steps or measures to do their long-term unemployed people-the chance of picked up in the Reserve Bank's report which and policy basis of the previous The shorthand version of that policy approach need economic growth, but you have got to take that the long-term unemployed in particular seen in this budget? On the one hand, no growth, hand, a massive slashing of the programs and extra steps. At the same time, if it was not enough projections to be subscribed to by the government, considerable success over the last decade our export performance and Australian industry's through the budget papers, industry assistance, export enhancement or incentive programs either massively slashed. If you are interested in building ships and interested in being a small or medium size gutted effectively and a cap of $150 million million over a four-year period in breach that funds to EMDG and Austrade would be And my reference is just to the EMDG scheme.

Mr Evans continued: Another worrying sign relates to employment. The employment growth was negligible. Hopes for a MAIN COMMITTEE 4683 getting neither better nor worse. we have seen in the last couple of days in so far on for a moment. That is the notion of the need but also the need for governments and society best to give unemployed people-in particular, getting back into employment. It is the notion I have referred to, and it was the intellectual government's Working Nation report. is simply 'growth plus'. In other words, you special steps or extra measures to make sure get a chance of employment. And what have we no jobs, no job certainty. And on the other the funds devoted to those special measures or for these very modest growth proportions or in areas where we know we have had in improving economic growth and jobs-namely, performance-we also see, systematically incentive or support programs and trade or abolished in breach of election promises or exporting them, the bounty is gone. If you are company that exports, the EMDG scheme has been put on it, cutting EMDG expenditure by $426 of an election commitment. That commitment was cut by $58.3 million over a three-year period.

(2) How many items referred to in part (1), in each category, are not in use. (3) Where are the items not in use being stored. (4) What will National Rail do with the items not in use. (5) What is the value of the items in storage (a) as scrap and (b) on the market. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) NR currently owns 121 wagons (with others in production) and leases 4,949 wagons. (2) 56 of the wagons owned by NR (plus 100 which are unserviceable) are not currently in use. All of the leased wagons are in use. NR has returned, or is in the process of returning, some 626 wagons to the NSW State Rail Authority, the Public Transport Commission of Victoria and Australian National, while 300 have been returned to Westrail. (3) Stirling North, Adelaide, Angaston, Tailem Bend and Junee. (4) Wagons not in use are available for use for commercial traffic or parts recovery. (5) The scrap value of the stored, unserviceable wagons is $110,000. They are largely obsolete and have no market value other than scrap. RoIling Stock: Australian National (Question No. 287) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 29 May 1996: (I) How many items of rolling stock are (a) owned or (b) leased by Australian National. (2) How many items referred to in part (1), in each category, are (a) on lease to National Rail and (b) available for Australian National's own use. NA (3) How many items referred to in part (2) are not in use. (4) How many of the items referred to in part (3) are (a) to be scrapped and (b) in storage. (5) What is the value of the items in storage (a) as scrap and (b) on the market. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australian National (AN) has advised that it currently has 5,609 items of rolling stock, either owned or leased. These comprise 4,618 freight wagons, 160 passenger cars, seven railcars and 824 non-commercial wagons. (2) 2,040 freight wagons are on lease to National Rail (NR) as at 15 June 1996. The rest, including non-commercial wagons (eg brake vans, wagons used for track maintenance) are available for AN's own use. (3) 1,488 freight wagons, mostly broad gauge, are not in use by AN. (4) AN has not determined which wagons are to be scrapped. None is in storage. (5) AN has not assessed the scrap or market value of wagons not in use. As most of the wagons are obsolete, they would have little value apart from scrap. Passenger Services: Australian National (Question No. 426) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 June 1996: (1) Over what routes, including those operated jointly with other railways, did Australian National provide passenger services when it was established in 1975. (2) How many services were provided on each route per week. (3) Over what routes, including those operated jointly with other railways, does Australian National provide passenger services. (4) How many services are provided on each route per week. (5) On what date did Australian National (a) add new services or (b) increase the frequency of existing services between 1 July 1975 and the date of answering this question and in each case what route was involved. (6) On what dates did Australian National (a) abolish or (b) decrease the frequency of existing services between I July 1975 and the date of answering this question and in each case what route was involved. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) AN was legally established in 1975 but did not assume operational responsibility for amalgamated system until 1978. Information is not available for 1975, but in March 1978, AN provided passenger services on the following routes at the following frequencies: Port Pirie-Kalgoorlie-seven return services per week (four Indian Pacific services and three Trans-Australian services) Port Pirie-Marree-Alice Springs (Ghan)- one return service per week Adelaide-Melbourne (Overland)-a daily service in each direction Hobart-Launceston-Wynyard (Tasman Limited)three return services per week Adelaide-Mount Gambier-six daytime services ip each direction per week plus an overnight return - l-rvice three times per week Naracoorte-Kingston-three return services per week Adelaide-Port Pirie-nineteen return services per week Adelaide-Peterborough-thirteen return services per week Adelaide-Tailem Bend-a daily return service Adelaide-Victor Harbor--eight return services per week Adelaide-Gladstone-six return services per week Adelaide-Bridgewater-operated by the SA State Transport Authority over AN controlled tracks from Belair to Bridgewater AN was also responsible for the Canberra-Queanbey an service but information on this operation is not available from AN as the service was provided in conjunction with Sydney-Queanbeyan and Sydney-Cooma services by the NSW Government Railway (3) and (4) AN currently provides passenger services on the following routes at the following frequencies: Sydney-Adelaide-Perth (Indian Pacific)-two return services per week Adelaide-Melbourne (Overland)-a daily service in each direction Adelaide-Alice Springs (Ghan)-one return service per week for most of the year; two return services per week from April to November). (5) and (6) I am not prepared to authorise the allocation of the resources which would be required by AN to detail the variations in frequencies and the dates of the introduction and termination of services since 1 July 1975. However, the closure of many passenger services in SA and Tasmania over the period is typical of changes elsewhere in Australia and in North America and much of the western Europe. For example, the SA State Government closed fourteen rural passenger services in 1968 and 1969. Computer Systems Modifications (Question No. 528) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) What steps are being taken to ensure that all computer systems in the Minister's Department or any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility are modified so that they continue to operate properly after 1 January 2000. (2) What is the estimated cost of the modifications. (3) Will all systems be modified by 1 January 2000. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Department has for some time been examining potential exposures to the Year 2000 issue. It is working with the Office of Government Information Technology Year 2000 Subcommittee and has developed a project plan to ensure that all such exposures are resolved. (2) Many of the costs are being absorbed into normal processes which include scrapping obsolete systems and making changes as hardware is upgraded and as software is redeveloped. An estimate of the net additional cost is not available yet. (3) The project plan provides for all systems continuing beyond 1 January 2000 to be Year 2000 compliant well before that date. Compact Disks (Question No. 541) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Is it a fact that almost all first release CDs contain as little as 35 minutes of recorded material and cost approximately $30 each but CDs of rereleased music and classical music may contain up to 73 minutes of recorded material and are much less expensive. (2) Are young purchasers of CDs who are the mainstay of tirst release music taged by the way CDs are marketed. (3) Will he act to make it mandatory for the cover of all first release CDs to show the actual playing time.  member's question is as follows: (1) The cost of first release CDs is approximately $30. However, of the twenty top selling CDs as at 26 August 1996, the average playing time was approximately 57 minutes. A number of first release CDs are being sold with an accompanying free CD or free video, resulting in a total playing time of almost 100 minutes and only two of the CDs in the top 20 at 26 August had a playing time of less than 40 minutes. CDs of rereleased material may contain up to 73 minutes of recorded material and may be less expensive. (2) If young purchasers are the mainstay of first release music, then it may be true that at times they are paying more than purchasers of rereleased or classical music. However, attributes such as originality or quality of the artist influence price, as well as duration. The fact that first release CDs are the dominant selling CDs suggests that they are being purchased for reasons other than duration of recording. (3) I have no plans to make it mandatory for the cover of all first release CDs to show the actual playing time. Reflective Strips (Question No. 545) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Do any railways in Australia or overseas have reflective strips or other devices on the side of locomotives or rolling stock to alert motorists of their presence on level crossings that do not have gates or flashing lights. (2) Have any studies been done on the effectiveness of these measures; if so, what do these studies financially disadvan- show. (3) What would be the per unit indicative cost of placing such devices on locomotives and wagons. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A number of rail systems in Australia and overseas have trialled reflective material on rolling stock or used it on a large scale. These include the Burlington Northern Railroad, Canadian Pacific and Canadian National in North America. The NSW State Rail Authority has over the last few years progressively fitted reflective logos to its grain hoppers. The Victorian Public Transport Corporation has fixed reflective material to about one third of its grain fleet and intends to complete the process. National Rail has also trialled reflective strips. (2) A number of such tests have been done in Australia and overseas. A summary of recent studies is contained in Part 5 of the Proceedings of the 17th Conference (1994) of the Australian Road Research Board at pages 231 to 242. This study reports that there is a lack of definitive information on their effectiveness, but some railroads consider the devices to be useful. The Australian National Railways Commission (AN) considers that trials have not demonstrated that the measures tested led to an improvement in level crossing safety. (3) AN has advised that the indicative cost of placing reflective material on a wagon varies from $30 to $70. The variation is due to the size and type of material and the way it is attached.",213
