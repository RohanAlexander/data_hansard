2,Mr BLUNDELL,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation whether any arrangement has yet been made between the Commonwealth and the Government, of South Australia for the resumption of the building of War Service Homes in that State? .AUSTRALIA. VMT. HEOTOR LAMOND - There beenno further development. - Later",13
3,Mr BLUNDELL,Unknown,"In reply to a question which I addressed to the honourable gentleman last week, he stated that there was no agreement between the Commonwealth and the Government of South Australia as to the building of War Service Homes in that State. I direct his attention to the fact that on the day that' he made that statement the Minister for Repatriation laid on the table of the Senate two agreements. Will he now lay those agreements oh the table of this House? .",14
4,Mr HEOTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"The agreements to which the honourable member alludes have already been laid ou the table - of this House, and have no relation to the Government of South Australia. FLOUR-MILLING TRADE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA. PRICE OF WHEAT.",14
5,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"In view of the serious position of the flour-milling trade in South Australia, as a result of the preferential price charged for the wheat sold by the Wheat Pool to ""Western Australia and_ Victoria, will the Prime Minister, .having regard to the fact that these Pools are guaranteed by the Govornuient, endeavour immediately to secure the charge of a uniform price throughout the Commonwealth for wheat supplied to millers in the various States?",14
6,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I received a deputation of representatives of wheat-growers on Friday last, and the position of the miller? was then mentioned. The matter to which the honourable member refers will'be one of those discussed with the representative of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Bank. So far as I know, the wheat-growers are prepared to give such reasonable assurances as may be necessary in this matter. . LEAGUE OF NATIONS. AUSTBALIAN DELEGATION : REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN.  ister yet in a position to give an answer to the request of the deputation of the Nat'onal Council of Women, Perth, who asked that the Government include in the has Australian delegation to the League of Nations, at least, one woman delegate? Mr HUGHES,-We have communicated with the High Commissioner in regard to this matter, and have also considered it here. ' Difficulty arises, quite apart from the question of the representation of the women of Australia, owing to the number of organizations of women, each of which might fairly claim that its representatives should have preference. There is considerable difficulty, and I am in communication with the High Commissioner on the subject. NA LIGHTHOUSE SERVICES.",14
7,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTATION OF SHIPS FOR,"When in Adelaide, last week,.I hoard that the Department of Trade and Customs was short of lightships, and that it was intended to import somo vessels for the purpose. I desire to ask the Minister if the report is correct, aud whether it would not be better, in his opinion, to build such vessels at Williamstown 1",14
8,Mr RODGERS,IMPORTATION OF SHIPS FOR,"There is absolutely no truth in the report that it is intended to import such vessels. As a matter of fact I have had, only today, a conference with the Director of Lighthouses and Mr. Farquhar, the Government Director of Shipbuilding, and have also been looking into the financial aspect of the question. If funds can be provided, proposals .will be submitted for the provision cf additional ships for lighthouse services, such vessels ta^be built in Australia. PRESENTATION OF ADDRESS-INREPLY.",14
9,Mr HUGHES,IMPORTATION OF SHIPS FOR,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.5] - In reference .toa statement by my colleague the' Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) in regard to the presentation to His Excellency the .Governor General of the Address-in-Reply agreed to by this House, I have to announce that His Excellency is on an official visit to Queensland,' and that it will meet his convenience to receive the Address-in-Reply on his return to Melbourne next month. UNEMPLOYMENT . PROPOSED GRANT FOB PUBLIC WOBKS.",14
10,Mr FOWLER,IMPORTATION OF SHIPS FOR,"In connection with the proposed Commonwealth .grant of £250,000 to.the various States, for road making purposes, in order to assist unemployed returned soldiers, I desire to ask the Treasurer whether the grant will be made on a per capita basis of population or on a per capita basis of returned soldiers? It will mean a considerable difference to some of the States.",14
11,Mr BRUCE,IMPORTATION OF SHIPS FOR,"I think this question, since it involves a matter of policy, should have been addressed to the Prime Minister. The position is, however, that the proposed grant is to provide, not for unemployed returned soldiers alone, but for . unemployed generally. The distribution will be on the basis of the whole population of each State.",15
12,Mr HIGGS,IMPORTATION OF SHIPS FOR,"Will the Prime Minister lay upon the table of the House a statement showing the allocations to the different States of the amount of £250,000 to be advanced by the Federal Government for road-making purposes?",15
13,Mr HUGHES,IMPORTATION OF SHIPS FOR,I shall do so. SHIPBUILDIN G TRIBUNAL.,15
14,Mr MAHONY,IMPORTATION OF SHIPS FOR,Is the Prime Minister yet in a position to state why the award of the Shipbuilding Tribunal has not been applied to the mechanics and* their assistants at Cockatoo Island Dockyard ?,15
15,Mr HUGHES,IMPORTATION OF SHIPS FOR,"I am afraid that I have to plead guilty to not being possessed of the information desired by the honourable member. I regret that I cannot supply it, but I shall endeavour to inform the House as soon as possible. FRENCH .DECORATIONS AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS.",15
16,Mr MARR,IMPORTATION OF SHIPS FOR,"I desire to ask the Minister for Defence whether he has seen in the press a report to the effect that the French people were .conferring decorations upon some of the British Units who participated in actions in France during the great war, ancl were desirous of conferring the Croix de Guerre on two Australian Units-the 13th and 15th Brigades-bu t that the authorities in Australia had prevented them from doing so ? Can the honourable gentleman state why Australian Units have been precluded from having these honours conferred on them? Mr MASSYGREENE:- I do not think it iscorrect that the authorities in Australia have prevented the conferring of these decorations' on Australian Units, but I shall have inquiries made, and let the honourable member know. NA WITH NEW ZEALAND.",15
17,Mr WATT,RECIPROCAL TRADE AGREEMENT,Will the Minister for Trade and Customs lay on the table of the House all correspondence between the Governments of the Dominion of New Zealand and the Commonwealth in relation to the reciprocal trade agreement?,15
18,Mr RODGERS,RECIPROCAL TRADE AGREEMENT,I do not think there is'any objection to that course.,15
19,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL TRADE AGREEMENT,"Has the Minister for Trade and Customs yet received any protests against the ratification of the reciprocal trade agreement between the Commonwealth and New Zealand? If so, will he lay upon the table such protests, together with auy that may yet be received, so that the House may discuss the proposed agreement in the light of those objections?",15
20,Mr RODGERS,RECIPROCAL TRADE AGREEMENT,"So far, I have received no such protests. I have received some communications on the subject, and-this .applies also to the question asked by the honourable member for Balaclava- I will examine carefully all correspondence on the subject; but I do not propose tb place on the table anypapers which, in my judgment, wilT jeopardize the agreement. NA STATES . FOR Mr MAKIN - Will the Treasurer informthe House whether it is a fact that,, upon the money advanced by the Commonwealth to the State of South Australia for the repatriation of returned soldiers,- the Commonwealth is charging interest at the rate of 7 i per cent.?",15
21,Mr BRUCE,REPATRIATIO N LOAN S TO,"That percentage is not quite correct; but, when the conversion costs are taken into consideration, the money advanced to the States out of the Diggers' Loan has cost nearly the price which the honourable member mentioned. . DEFENCE DEPARTMENT RETIREMENTS.",15
22,Mr WATKINS,REPATRIATIO N LOAN S TO,"Will j the Minister for Defence state the reason for discharging, or causing to be retired, members of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery before the completion of their twenty years' - term of service without making any proportionate payment in lieu of long-service leave?",15
23,Mr MASSYGREENE,REPATRIATIO N LOAN S TO,"If the honourable member is referring to non-commissioned, officers and men who are not being allowed to re-engage on the expiration of their term of service, a Bill 'to be submitted Parliament shortly will make provision for such men to bo included in the scheme of compensation.

26,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,REPATRIATIO N LOAN S TO,"On 27th July, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) asked some questions about the Government medical officer at Darwin (Dr Leighton Jones). A reply has now been received stating that the dentistry work performed by Dr Jones is negligible, and is limited to occasional amalgam fillings and extractions. The optical work consists of testing and procuring glasses from the south. In both matters Dr Jones is merely following the custom instituted by previous medical officers. It is stated that his fees are similar to those in rural districts in New South Wales, and are as stipulated in an agreement made by him with Dr Gilruth, a former Administrator. UNEMPLOYED IN NEWCASTLE. ISSUE OF MILITARY BLANKETS.",16
27,Mr MASSYGREENE,REPATRIATIO N LOAN S TO,"On the 27th July, the ""things, honourable member for Newcastle (Mr the Minister stateWHtkins) referred to the question of the is3ufi of military blankets to some hundreds of unemployed in the Newcastle district who are in necessitous circumstances. I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that, some little time ago, on the ' representations ef the Minister for Labour, New South Wales, I approved of the issue of several hundred blankets for the use of distressed returned soldiers in that State. This issue was made subject to the condition that the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia became to responsible for the blankets. An application was subsequently received from the Warriors' Friend Campaign, Sydney, for the issue of 100 blankets for use at Newcastle, but in view of the issue which had already been approved under the auspices of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, Sydney, the Base iGommandant in Sydney was instructed to inform the Warriors' Friend Campaign Committee of what had been done in the matter of making blankets available through the Returned Sailors and Soldiers. Imperial League of Australia. If an application is made for the loan of blankets for distressed soldiers at Newcastle, and the Returned Sailors and Sold'ers Imperial League of Australia will agree to the same arrangement as was made in connection with previous issues, I shall see .whether it is possible for the Department to make some blankets available. NA SUPERPHOSPHATES. TREATMENT OF SULPHUR ORES.",16
28,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon noticeIn connection with the remarks of the then Minister 'for Trade and Customs, on Oth November last (Hansard, pages12538-9) that a definite basis of agreement for the erection of furnaces and the treatment of sulphur ores between the Electrolytic Zinc Company and the Yarraville manufacturers of superphosphates had .been arrived at, and that his authority for stating this was the assurance of certain nanied directors of the.various companies whose word he accepted, respecting which he assured the House, amongst other that the agreement*was to - provide safeguards for users against war-time prices, will (1) Is it correct that no such agreement has been entered into, and that the matter has been abandoned as between the Yarraville manufacturers and, the Electrolytic Zinc Company? (2.) If so what steps did the previous ; ' Minister take to insure the observance of the undertaking given to him, and through him to the House, or what .steps did the present Minister takef",16
29,Mr RODGERS,MANUFACTURE OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The Electrolytic Zinc Company is, and always has been, quite open and willin g to comply with the terms of the letter written to the Minister of Customs and quoted by him ou 9th November last (Hansard, page 12530). 2. The previous Minister was not given-an opportunity to take any action owing to his transfer to another Department shortly after the agreement was made. The present Minister, in Apri l last, called a conference of all interested parties to discuss whether the agreement made in Parliament was being faithfull y carried out. As - a result of such conference it was decided to appoint a committee representing all interested to report to the Minister. . The representatives elected by each interest were:- Mr T. J. MCGalliard, President of the Chamber of Agriculture, and Mr W. G. Gibson, M.H.R., representing the agricultural interests; Messrs. W. F . Cuming andBurns Cuming, representing superphosphate manufacturers; Messrs. Colin Fraser and Thos. Haynes, representing sulphur producers; and Mr Ambrose Pratt, secretary. The function of the Committee, as expressed in a letter t d the secretary, was "" to inquire into the disputes that have arisen between certain parties as to the interpretation and carrying out of the undertaking given through the Minister of Trade and Customs to the House at the time the Tariff was passed, and also by reason of later developments in connection with supplies of pyritic ores by the Mount Lyell Company, with a view to arriving at a satisfactory arrangement for the use of pyriteB and other sulphide ores in the production of sulphuric acid for the manu- ' facture of superphosphates. The following report from the Committee was received:415 Collins-street, Melbourne"", The Hon. Arthur S. Rodgers, Minister for Trade and Customs, Department of Trade and Customs, Melbourne, Sir, lie Sulphur Duty. I beg to advise you that meetings Committee appointed by the conference on the 21st Apri l last, were held at 415 Gollins-street, on the 23rd, 24th, nnd 25th May. Present:- Mr T. J. MCGalliard (in chair), and Mr W. G. Gibson, M.H.R., representing the agricultural interests; Messrs. W. F. Cuming and Burns Cuming, representing superphosphate manufacturers; Messrs. Colin Fraser and Thos. Haynes, representing sulphur producers; and Mr Ambrose Pratt, secretary. The attached letter re functions of Committee was read by the secretary. It was decided:(a) No dispute exists between sulphurproducing interests and manufacturers of superphosphates. It was ascertained that, on the contrary, negotiations arc now in progress between the sulphur-producing interests and the superphosphate' manufacturers with the object of utilizing zinc concentrates and/or pyrites to replace imported sulphur for the production of the sulphuric acid used , in manufacturing superphosphate. (6) Satisfactory arrangements are being made to remove the misunderstanding ibetween the sulphur producers and a superphosphate company which proposes to establish works in Melbourne. It was decided to inquire what the increased cost of superphosphate would be to the farmer as a result of the duty of £2 10s. per ton on . 3ulphur. It was agreed that, on the basis of utilizing imported sulphur, this would be equal to 5s. per ton. Providing, however, that the arrangements (now in progress) for the supply of locally-produced sulphur are completed satisfactorily, the increased cost, while remaining at 5s. per ton in Western Australia, would be only from 2s. to 3s. a ton in the other States;. . It was further agreed that a substantial reduction in the price of superphosphate would take place, owing to the lower cost of phosphate rock, wages, &c. Consideration was' given to the insurance benefits Australia would receive by the establishment of sulphur production in the Commonwealth in time of war, and representatives of the mining companies gave an assurance that co advantage would be taken of war conditions should they arise. I have the honour to be, Sir, Yours faithfully , (Sgd.) T. J. MOGALLIABD, Chairman. Notwithstanding the fact that all members of the Committee were unanimous in approving the presentation of the foregoing report, two ' members of the Committee, Messrs. MCGalliard 25th May, 1922. and Gibson, presented a minority report to the Minister, in which the opinion was expressed that the whole community, and not the farmer, should bear the cost of establishing the industry of sulphur production. In this minority report, no reference whatever was made to the question of the agreement now of the under consideration. PAPEES.

30,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF," I have received the following letter from Mrs Tudor:263 Stawell-street. Burnley, DEAR MIL SPEAKER, I desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter conveying copy of resolutions passed in the House appreciative of my late husband's public services, together with a kind expressionof sympathy to us all.

WASHINGTON CONFERENCE: TREATIES. Debate resumed from 26th July (vide page 793), on motion by Mr HUGHESThat this House approves the Treaty between the United States of America, the British Empire, France, and Japan, relating to their insular Possessions and insular Dominions in the Pacific Ocean, signed at Washington, on 13th December, 1921, the declaration signed on that date accompanying that Treaty, and the Treaty between those Powers supplementary to that Treaty, signed at Washington on the 6th February, 1922.",18
31,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"Hunter) [3.20] Tho proposals which have emanated from the Washington Conference will, I feel .sure, meet with the approval of honourable members, because, first of all, they provide for such a limitation of naval armaments as will considerably lessen the Load of taxation carried by the Commonwealth, and also by other nations. However, before dealing with the results which have accrued from that Conference, I wish to make a few preliminary remarks concerning the events which led to the holding of the Conference. It will be remembered that it was claimed here and in other parts of the world that, in consequence of Great Britain and Japan having notified that they had become signatories to the League of Nations, the Anglo-Japanese Treaty no longer existed; and consequently there was a disposition on the part of public men in Australia, in America, and elsewhere, to create an atmosphere which, had it been permitted to continue, must have led to further wars. It was constantly contended that since the Anglo-Japanese Treaty no longer existed TUDOR.",18
32,Mr HUGHES,MANUFACTURE OF,Japa n always contended that the Treaty did exist.,18
33,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"I am aware of that, and I shall put that view a little later. It was contended by those to whom 28th July, 1922. I have just referred that, as the Treaty no longer existed, Japan, in view of her population of about 50,000,000 people and her limited area, would be compelled to look elsewhere to settle her people, and that as her natural line of expansion, would be in the Pacific, where Australia had possessions and had been given a mandate by the League of Nations, there Yours, very sincerely, was a danger that the Commonwealth FANNY J. TUDOR. might be involved in further complications. This atmosphere, which, as I have said, was created by certain statements of public men, had a tendency to cause the nations bordering on the Pacific to prepare for further hostilities. The Commonwealth was preparing to spend more money on defence than it could possibly afford, in view of the great load of taxation it was obliged to carry in consequence of the recent war.",18
34,Mr HUGHES,MANUFACTURE OF,"Of course, the honourable member is aware that before the Imperial Conference disbanded that point was set at rest, and it was agreed by both parties, Great Britain and Japan, that the Treaty had not been terminated.",18
35,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"The right honourable gentleman is merely forestalling what I was about to say. I am giving a brief history of the position which existed prior to the holding of the Washington Conference. The outcome of the happenings I have described was the holding of an I m perial Conference. Prior to the departure of our Prime Minister to represent Australia at that Conference, he gave us to understand that in view of the AngloJapanese Treaty having lapsed he would use his utmost endeavours to have a Treaty drawn up between Great Britain , America, Japan, and the Dominions. The I m perial Conference was held, and it was found that Japan maintained the Anglo-Japanese Treaty had not oeased to exist. She contended that the step taken by Great Britain and herself in becoming signatories to the League of Nations had in no sense infringed Article 6 of the Treaty. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Birkenhead, to whom the matter, was referred, gave it as his opinion that the Anglo-Japanese Treaty was still in existence, thus removing any danger that might have existed in regard to the Pacifio problem, and showing that we were not justified in spending additional money on defence on the ground that Japan might be an aggresson in these waters. Honourable members thereupon endeavoured in this Chamber to have the expenditure upon defence cut down by a considerable amount. We said that we did not consider there was any danger in doing so, that if publio men propounded the theory of the likelihood of danger, it must lead to futur e war, and that, in view of the devastation caused by the previous world-wide war, all should be using their greatest efforts to maintain peace. It was pleasing to us to realise that the spirit which had been engendered in Australia no justification, and that the AngloJapanese Treaty was still in existence. However, at the Imperial Conference, the proposal for which our Prime Minister was sponsor was put forward, that prior to the Conference which the President of the United States of America had called, there should be another Conference between representatives of the Powers concerned for the purr pose of drawing up ' a further Treaty, which would embrace America, as well as Great Britain and Japan. The President of the United States of America d id not accede to this proposal. From that time on until the matter was debated in this House, and prominence was given to the question of representation at the Washington .Conference by action taken by honourable members of the Opposition in conjunction with other honourable members, together with assistance from the public press, there was very little disposition on the part of the Commonwealth to bother about the proposed Conference, sinoe the Government did not think it would count for much, and were prepared to continue to live in an atmosphere of war. However, very soon, after the debate in this House, we were pleased to hear that that the door stood wide open for the representation of Australia at the Washington Conference. The Prime Minister has said that the outcome of the Conference exceeded the most sanguine expectations of those who were in favour of it . I think that the Conference could have gone much further. It has certainly rendered good service to the world, and achieved something which will be of considerable assistance, not only to Australia, but also to the other nations. I refer to the limitation of naval armaments. This was agreed to under what is known as the Quadruple Treaty, which sets out exactly the number of capital ships each nation is permitted « to have. Great Britain is to have fifteen capital ships, with a limitation of 525,000 tons; America fifteen capital ships, with a limitation of 525,000 tons; Japan, nine capital ships, with a. limitation of 315,000' tons; Italy , five capital ships, with a limitation of 175,000 tons; and France, five capital ships, with a limitation of 175,000 tons. This has enabled us to reduce our defence expenditure to a very large' extent. Not only have our costs been reduced in conhad sequence of the general reduction of armaments, but we have also the advan- tage of feeling that during the next ten years at least we shall be safe from aggression on the part of any Pacific power. There is, therefore, noi need for us to spend vast sums upon military services. I am very pleased that the Washington Conference was held, if only for the reason that it has put an end to mad - competition in preparation for further wars. But there were certain problems dealt with which cannot be said to have been successfully solved. I appreciate the difficulties which beset the representatives of the nations at such a gathering, and can understand the disappointment of the many over the stubbornness of a few upon a subject of world-wide interest. I have in ' mind the proposal for the abolition of submarines. During the war the world waa aghast at the dreadful deeds of submarines. Germany was solely responsible. Innocent women and children were sent to uheir doom without warnsing. War is always barbarous, but Germany's submarine warfare was the most dreadful of all . Though the British delegates urged. the abolition of submarines, the Conference was unable to reach unanimity. But, while tihe us© of submarines is still permitted, conditions have been laid down which should prevent a repetition of the past barbarities of sea warfare. Submarine horrors involving non-combatants and innocent women and children will never again be inflicted if future belligerent powers will agree to observe the conditions drawn up at Washington. I have my doubts upon that matter, but, at any rate, it has been laid down that before a ship is torpedoed she must be called upon to stop, and examined for contraband and war-like material generally, and all on board must be removed to safety before the vessel is fired upon and sunk. All the people of the world are now against war.",18
36,Mr MAXWELL,MANUFACTURE OF,And yet they fight.,20
37,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"They will continue to fight unless their representative men want peace, and determine to keep it . It is not the mass of the people who precipitate and make war; almost, always a few individuals are responsible. I was surprised, as well as disappointed, that the Washington Conference should not have agreed upon the abolition of _ the submarine. It appears that provision is actually being made now by certain nations to extend the use of these underwater craft. It is a matter for some satisfaction that the British delegates stood out strongly for abolition.",20
38,Mr HUGHES,MANUFACTURE OF,And the American presentatives also.,20
39,Mr MAXWELL,MANUFACTURE OF,It was French who opposed the proposal.,20
40,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"I am disappointed also with respect to the limitation of the use of aircraft. A i r ships and aeroplanes played a very prominent part in the Great War; and, like the submarines, they were introduced for the first time as fighting units. We remember with what horror we read of the German airship »nd aeroplane raids on Great Britain , and learned how the lives of many defenceless people were destroyed by bombs from the air. It is almost unbelievable that the Conference should have disagreed upon the matter of the abolition of aircraft in warfare. The delegates could not come to any satisfactory conclusion. The excuse offered was that it . was not practicable to impose limitations upon military aviation, for the reason that such imposition might interfere with civil aerial progress. The subject-matter, generally, was referred to a furthe r Conference. I cannot appreciate the reasons advanced by the Conference in this respect, nor accept 'them as adequate. What has the making of war to do with the advancement of civil aviation? The great purpose of aircraft in war is the destruction of life and property. On the civil side, however, aviation is a tremendous factor for national development. I do not know exactly why the Conference should have failed to agree, but there is something very significant in the following cablegram published in today's press: Fokker, the Dutch designer of the German warplane, has arrived from America, where ho is organizing a great commercial aviation system. In an interview he declared that air attacks in future wars would bo on a stupendous scale of destructiveness, and he did. not think it possible for any defence to keep every air fleet away. The best defence would be the strongest air fleet capable of destroying enemy bombers' bases. He believed that aviation would ultimately replace artillery, and pointed out that the poison gas-carrying aerof ilanes which were likely to be used to attack arge cities, would develop awful powers. This great designer of the German fighting machines has been engaged in America, it appears, in organizing commercial aviation; but the disquieting feature is that he speaks of the linkin g up of such interests with 'aviation in time of war. I do not know whether we are not spending money unnecessarily upon our aerial services. The Treasurer (Mr . reBruce), in the course of his financial statement a month ago, pointed out that chiefly the the air services had. spent more than £52,000 over the estimated expenditure for the financial year. I have reason to believe that - the whole of the overexpenditure was upon the military side of aviation, and that, on the civil side, there has not been spent even the whole of the sum voted by Parliament. If that is so, it shows that we are expending large sums of money on aviation for defence purposes. I take no exception to improving aviation for the assistance of settlers and the development of the country-for % other than defence purposes. We cannot afford to go on spending large sums in the latter direction, and, therefore, I hope that this matter will be carefully considered by the responsible Minister. No one can take much exception to the destruction of the war-ships. It is said that the rights of property should be .preserved; but, in this instance, we lose nothing by the destruction of property, for it is of no use to the community.",20
41,Mr BRENNAN,MANUFACTURE OF,It cost the country a lot of money.,21
42,Mr OHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"Quite so; but it is 1 of no use to keep up property of a kind that will only result in costing us a great deal more money. If these ships could be used for. any other purpose, well and good; but I have nothing to say against the decision of the Conference to sink or destroy. Another matter that came up was the use of poisonous gases in warfare; and it is a good thing to know that the Conference agreed .that it should be prohibited in the future. There was nothing more diabolical in the war than the use of these poisonous gases, and at the present time there are thousands of men, not only in this country, but throughout the world, who from its effects are practically ruined for life. We meet men constantly who are suffering from the results of the use of those gases, and it is sad to think that they can never be efficient men to follow their usual employment. We have, therefore, much to be thankful for in the decision of the Conference to abolish the use of poisonous gases. As to land armaments, the Conference accomplished, we might say, nothing, - and so far as this question affects Australia, I do not intend to take up any time in discussing the facts. There is an effort being made to see that China has equitable treatment in her trade relations, and in that direction, I think, the Conference haa accomplished much. I am prepared to admit, with the Prime Minister, that the Conference has achieved good work, and _ will be the means, at least, of bringing about a more serene atmosphere during the next ten years in the Pacific. At the expiration of that ten years, any nation may give notice",21
43,Mr MAXWELL,MANUFACTURE OF,"The nations will, perhaps, have more sense by that time.",21
44,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"No penalty is incurred by a nation if it does break away from the agreement arrived at-w e have trV rely on the nations keeping faith. As the Prime Minister has said, the observance of these Treaties is a matter of .moral force; but although the arrangement, as far as it goes, meets with my approval, I do not wish the matter to rest there. I have urged from time to time since the war, and shall continue to do so, that we ought to do everything we possibly can to maintain peace. I am told, of course, that we cannot change the human race; but if we never make an effort we shall never accomplish anything. What we ought to do is to galvanize the League of Nations into life-ever y effort should be made to breathe the breath of life into that skeleton.",21
45,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURE OF,"It is not a skeleton. ; Mr Charlton - But it ean be improved. Many people say that we cannot end war, that wars are capitalistic enterprises, and so forth, and our only method of procedure is on the lines of the League of Nations Covenant. I have not /seen the report which the Prime Minister laid on the table today; but my own opinion is that if the working men threshed these questions out, so as to be better able to undei'stand them, we should accomplish something. ,",21
46,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURE OF,I wish to see the women take the question up.,21
47,Mr OHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"Quite so; I mean women as well as men, and public men, particularly, ought to direct their attention to the question. Unfortunately, the League is not getting that attention from some of our public men that it should. The influence of every public man should be directed to galvanizing the League of Nations into life. The Prime Minister told us that the Washington Conference had accomplished more than the League of Nations. Bnt that is not to say that the League of Nations cannot accomplish more than the Washington Conference. Unless we use every ounce of influence we have in the direction of disarmar ment, we cannot hope to achieve much; and even if we cannot bring about total disarmament, we may be able to greatly limit the cost of defence. These are the directions in which, T think, we ought to move. It was the ex-Presideht of the United States of America who proposed the formation of the League of Nations, and, unfortunately, the present President, is not following in his footsteps. If , however, the American President and the people of that country could see their way to link up with the other powerful nations in the League, we might see some great results. We cannot refuse Germany or .any other country permission to come into the League if that League is to be a success. If we are bent on peace, we must have sufficient sincerity to permit every nation to come in and be represented; and unles-s, through the League of Nations, we can arrange for the punishment of any nation which breaks faith, we shall fail to prevent war. A union of the four nations of America, Great Britain, Japan, and France will not, of itself, prevent future wars; all nations must be linked up. Any one of these four nations might have a quarrel with any one of the nations outside that League, with war as the result. There must be a thorough understanding amongst all peoples throughout the\ world. If thore is a breach of the League of Nations agreement the offending nation must be penalized by the otlier nations. Mr FOWLER, - That is the stumbling block.",21
48,Mr OHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"Exactly. No nation would set the League at defiance when it knew that all the other nations were prepared to penalize it . Our chief hope, as I have said before, lies in the galvanizing of the League of Nations into life. Some good has already been done, and it has relieved us considerably; and we can be further relieved if we use all our influence in the direction of making the League of Nations what it ought to be- a real entity. I think we have spent up to now something like £80,000 in this direction; but it will be money well spent if every nation will show a real desire to bring about not only the limitation of armaments, but disarmament. As to the proposals made, I have nothing but words of eulogy for them.",22
49,Dr EARIE PAGE,MANUFACTURE OF,"iCowper) [3.59]. This series of resolutions moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in connection with the Treaties agreed to at Washington are matters of very much more significance than they appear. The motions which place these Treaties before us for ratification indicate to me the permanency of the change in the internal relations in the British Commonwealth of Nations. That change has come for good or ill , and it seems to me that possibly it may be for ill . If it is necessary to have ratification of all Treaties in every independent Dominion, we may create a force which may ultimately lead to disruption within the Empire. There are some who think that this , sense of responsibility is merely a new toy; but we are now making ourselves responsible for Treaties, and that fact of itself shows our willingness to bear our share of the burden of defence, and that we must cease henceforth to "" sponge,"" as it seems to me we are now doing to a large degree, on the Mother Country, for the defence of the continent. We henceforth take our full Share in the defence of the Empire. At the Imperial Conference the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) said that he believed that the Britisli Navy was essentially the first line of defence, and that our contribution to that first line of defence must take the form of a Dominion Navy. Last year we budgeted to spend £2,340,000 on naval defence, whereas Great Britain budgeted for £S2,000,000 in respect of her full share. When I hear others boast about our taxation being less per head than that of the Old Country I feel rather ashamed of the fact that while we pay only £13 per head by way of taxation, as against £24 per head paid in Great Britain, we leave the people there to carry a burden something like forty times as great as our own in respect of this matter of naval defence.",22
50,Mr RILEY,MANUFACTURE OF,"Does the honourable member think that our taxation should be increased to meet naval requirements? Dr EARLE PAGE.^Our contribution to the naval defence of the Empireshould be commensurate with our weight and influence as one of the Dominions - of the Empire. If we are to continue to take part in the foreign affairs of the Empire, we need some machinery very much better than we have to inform ourselves of what is actually taking place. The best course to follow, it seems to me, would be to secure the establishment of a Committee of this Parliament- a Committee of External or Imperial Relations-consistin g of members of all parties, which would be enabled to keep itself fully informed of what is happening in the Old Country, as well as in the other Dominions. It would thus be in a position to make public pronouncements, and so keep public opinion in the Commonwealth practically the same as it is in all the other Dominions. Last year I made a suggestion with regard to onr external representation. There certainly must be tiome better method than we have at present of keeping ourselves fully informed of what is going on. This motion deals with the Quadruple Treaty, which is the first practical result of the Washington Conference, and may be taken to be practically the sura of its achievements. Without this Quadruple Treaty there could have been no Five Power Treaty in regard to the limitation of armaments, nor would it have been likely that any agreement could have been arrived at in regard to the Far Eastern problem. But for it there could have been no Five Power Treaty regarding the limitation of armaments, no Far Eastern Treaty, nor any Nine .Power Treaty regarding China. As the Prime Minister has said, the Conference marks an epoch in the world's history. It was called at a timo when, the clouds looked black. There was in progress between the United States of America and Japan a-competitive race in respect to naval construction, the inevitable result of which must have been war. The Conference was completely successful in its immediate object. President Harding called it together toFind a satisfactory basis for an agreement as to limitation of armaments, and witli an earnest desire that an interchange of views at a Conference might find a solution of the Pacific and Far Eastern problems. I think that, a solution-no t a permanent, but a temporary solution-of these two problems has been found. A permanent solution of the Pacific problem, in my opinion, can never be found without taking Russia into account, nor can any lasting settlement of the Far Eastern question, and that relating to the position of China, be secured without the agreement and consent of Russia. Although, as was to be expected from its position, the Conference has failed to find a permanent solution of the Pacific and Far Eastern problems, it has found one that will be effective for ten years. converted a competitive rivalry in naval construction between the United States of America and Japan, which was fraught with big possibilities of war, into a Treaty, Article 2 of which provides for frank communication between the Powers in the event of the rights of any of them being threatened by the aggressive action of any other Power. That such a result was possible was due to the atmosphere created at the very beginning of the Conference by the memorable and striking pronouncement of Mr Charles E. Hughes, Secretary of State for the United States of America, and to the continuance of that' atmosphere as the result of the outstanding qualities of the leader of the British Delegation, at that time the Right - Hon. A. J. Balfour, and now Earl Balfour. Earl Balfour crowned a long life spent in the public service of the British Empire with this great service to humanity at large. The Empire was undoubtedly fortunate in having this great statesman available to take part in the mission to the United States of America. Earl Balfour has proved himself persona grata in many Continental countries, and in America no Englishman has created a better reputation or has been more favourably received. I was in the United States of America during part of the year 1917, when Earl Balfour was there, and can say that his reception was quite as good as that given to any members of the French Delegation, although at the time France was "" well in the boom."" Then, again, the expert assistance that the British Delegation had at hand was undoubtedly of a very high order. It seems to be the unanimous opinion of those qualified to judge that, as Senator Pearce mentions in his report, the Conference was very much indebted to that expert assistance for the accurate and reliable data that was always at hand. Although there is no element of doubt regarding the position of the British representatives at the Conference, I think that this House is entitled to a much clearer expression of opinion than it has yet had as to what was the exact status of the Dominion representatives. Senator Pearce, in his report, statesI was selected by the Government as the representative of the Commonwealth of Australia, and thereupon the Governor General, It has with the advice of the Federal Executive Council, prayed His Majesty to issue to me Letters Patent, nominating and appointing me as His representative in respect of the Commonwealth of Australia at the Conference. The King, on the 24th day of October, 1921, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom Great Britain and Ireland, issued to me a power, appointing me Commissioner, tor, and Plenipotentiary in respect of the Commonwealth of Australia. Except that i limited to the Commonwealth of Australia, is identical with the full powers issued to British representatives from the United dom. The full text of the Letters Patent is in Appendix A of the report furnished by Senator Pearce. If there was thus a grant of full power as the document, the face of it , seems to suggest, then Parliament has not received full inforby mation regarding the status and position of its representative When we abroad we find that very much more formation has been given in the other Dominion Parliaments than has ever been furnished to this House. On the return of the Prime Minister from Great B r it a in last year I pointed out that were not receiving that information to exact position. which we were entitled in regard to Imperial Conference. In Canada there saidhas been a publication not merely of the Prime Minister's speech, and of a White Book; but there has also been presented to the Canadian Parliament a verbatim presentatives report of the whole of the proceedings of 'happily, the last Imperial Conference. This, by the way, is said to differ very m at e r i a in many respects from the paper which was laid on the table of this House. So fa r as I can gather, the position, as before us by the Prime Minister in October last, wasI.'That the Dominions had not been directly invited by the United States of America. '2. That at the Imperial Conference arranged that the Imperial Government should represent the whole Empire-.at Washington. 3. That the Imperial Government would fer the British Delegation to include men - special knowledge of Canadian, Australasian, and Indian points df .view. This latter statement is borne out by a cablegram from Mr Lloyd George to Mr . Hughes, which the Prime Minister read in 'this House last sessionI am very anxious thfft 'the stand-point of Australia and New Zealand should be well represented on the British Empire - delegation the Washington Conference. Your personal presence is, in my opinion, .highly I urge you. to go if by any means possible .Failing this, a .single - delegate may serve presentative of - both Australia .and New land, as your .stand-points are identical. I should greatly prefer you going yourself, .if you cannot, please consult Massey, and Dr Earle Page. of me what you propose. We will, of course, also full welcome any officer whom you may wish to send Procurato serve on the secretariat. t is The Government, so far as I could gather it at the time, sent Senator Pearce to Washthe ington, not as a special representative of KingAustralia, with a seat in the Conference, but as part and parcel of the British Emgiven pire delegation, his duty being to represent the Australian view on that delegation. So far as I can ascertain, our in on formation ceases at this point. I have this carefully looked through the speech made Senator Pearce, in another place, with respect to the Washington Conference, (look and I find that he makes no reference to in - this phase of the subject. The Prime Minister, »when speaking in the House last week, made a very brief 'and cursory reference to the position. That reference as it 'stands is quite ambiguous, but I hope that, before the debate closes, he we will enlarge upon it , and let us know the The right honourable the gentleman, in submitting this motion, The Imperial Conference understood that the United States of America Government would not favour an invitation being extended to reof the overseas Dominions. But, as the result of diplomatic conversations, this difficulty was overcome, and the British Empire Delegation included represenl l y tatives of the overseas Dominions, who went to the Conference as representatives of His Majesty the King, and sat at .the Conference on a footing of absolute equality with the reput presentatives of the United Kingdom. I should like the right honourable gentleman to say whether that means that these delegates went to the Conference with the same right to discuss and vote it was as was enjoyed by any other member of the British delegation, or whether, as we preunderstood last year, there were simply to with be three delegates with voting and delegate powers, and that the representatives of the Dominions were simply to be consultative members of the delegation.",22
51,Mr HUGHES,MANUFACTURE OF,"They were the six representatives of one country, which country is made up .of many countries. Australia is one of those countries.",24
52,Dr EARLE PAGE,MANUFACTURE OF,"Was our position at finally at the Washington Conference exactly the same as it was at the Peace desirable, and negotiations in Paris ! - Mr HUGHES - Yes ; in each case we as rewere there as His Majesty's representaZeatives, and in each case we were there aa but His Majesty's representatives upon the tell recommendation of the Prime Minister of Great Britain , who submitted' to H i Majesty the names of the representatives early in May. of the British Empire. That was the constitutional procedure.",24
53,Dr EARLE PAGE,MANUFACTURE OF,"I take it that that was quite a different position from what was anticipated when the Prime Minister in this House, last October, dealt such as was ultimately obtained. with the representation of Australia at the Conference.",25
54,Mr HUGHES,MANUFACTURE OF,"It was anticipated that the representation of the Dominions would involve something more than resequence of eventspresentation of the Empire as a unit, and therefore the United States of America theOttawa. was disinclined to recognise anything more than the unit, that is to say, the Empire.",25
55,Dr EARLE PAGE,MANUFACTURE OF,"I should like to Conference be clear on this matter because, in its» issue of 13th July last, the Sydney Mornthe ing Herald, in a leading article^ prac tically denied that Australia had any independent representation as at .Paris.

In ' order to that, although this is not understood in status Australia, it is perfectly understood i Canada, I shall quote from a report a debate which took place in the Canadian s House of Commons late in A p r i l and The question was first raised during the debate on the Addressin-Reply, and a charge was brought against the Prime Minister of Canada, that he had not fought for the separate representation of Canada at Washington I wish to put this report on record in Hamsard, so that there may be no element of then doubt regarding' what took place in Canada, especially as it outlines the exact May 1 - Correspondenc e tabled' in House by Premier King this afternoon with regard to the appointment of Sir Robert Borden to attend the recent Disarmament in Washington goes far to clear up a _ controversy between the Premier and the Right Hon. Arthur Meigben, wbicb during present session has led to some decidedly heated passages. During the debate on tfae address. Mr Meighen vehemently denied that he was - a party to any arrangement at the Imperial Conference of Premiers, held in London last summer, that Canada should be represented at Washington merely by a delegation appointed by the British Government, and taking its directions from the British Government. "" Nor,"" said Mr Meighen, "" was such arrangement arrived at while I was a member of the Conference. Our negotiations took in this regard by correspondence, and the first I insisted,that we should have our delegate, and that 'that delegate should take his instructions from us."" Mr Meighen's denial was in reply to an alleged statement ofBritish Prime Minister to this effect: "" As * # »- # the Dominions and India, it was arat the recent Imperial Conference that His Majesty's Government should represent the whole of the Empire at Washington."" M It is well established' that ex-Premier and General Smuts left the Imperial Conference before the matter waa deand it is hinted that thereafter certainDominion delegates were induced to accept the principle that Great Britain, would. represent the Empire at the Washington Conference, but the correspondence does not clearly bear out the contention of Mr Meighen that,, in the correspondence which followed, he insisted from the first that Canada should elect her own delegate, and that delegate should take opinion his instructions "" from us."" » * * * * The outstanding fact contained in the correspondence brought down to.day is that toSmuts, of South Africa, Canada is ' for her representation and defined status at 'the Disarmament Conference. The the correspondence shows that General Smuts, who left at the same time as Premier Meighen, show did flatly and abruptly decline to accept the of the Dominion as at first laid down by the British Foreign Office. It .shows, n further, that he firmly advised Mr Meighen of that Canada should take a similar stand. - - * - Mr Meighen was contemplating a general election about that time; that is probably some excuse for the fact that he did rynt the advice of the South African Premier, instead concurred in the proposal to have Canadian viewpoint,"" looked after gate on the British panel, in the person of Sir Robert Borden. In the meantime, however, the British authorities, having also cabled to by General Smuts, decided that it of the cable reads: "" I am completelyPort were better to accede to the latter's request.

The consequence was, that Sir Robert went to Washington, not as a simple delegate on status the British panel, but as a "" Commissioner power and plenipotentiary in respect of the Dominion sign only of Canada, with ful l power and authority to minion, conclude treaties, conventions, and agreetablished in ataccordance ments."" The correspondence is highly interesting view of the almost incessant clashes which occur in the Commons with regard to varying views of Canada's status as a nation. - - » * On August 27 last, in. a private and pervernment."" sonal message to Lloyd George, Mr Meighen said he was "" most anxious to know the method by which it is proposed to provide for representation of Canada on the British Empire delegation."" A reply was received to this which was not illuminating, formal invitation from Washington invites "" the Government of Great Britain to participate in a conference on tation of armaments."" No mention was made follows : "" In view in this invitation of the overseas Dominions. On August 19, Lord Curzon, then Foreign Secretary, accepted the invitation "" on half of His Majesty's* Government,-"" and there was no mention of the Dominions. On desire."" , October 3, Lloyd George cabled Mr Meighen in p a r t : "" I am most anxious for standpoint of Canada to be well represented on British Empire delegation at approaching conference in Washington."" On the same day Mr Meigsure hen cabled : "" I desire to nominate Robert JBorden us member of the British Empire delegation."" No word of Canada. In a cabled explanation the same day Lloyd George told Mr Meighen: "" It arranged nt the recent Imperial Conference that His Majesty's Government should reprepowers sent the whole Empire at Washington. While quite prepared to represent the Dominions, His Majesty's Government would prefer the British delegation to send men with knowledge of Canadian, Australasian, and Indian points of view."" Then on October 19, General Smuts took King a hand. He cabled direct to Premier hen from Pretoria, his protest, which reads : torted that "" I notice from press that you are sending representative to Washington Conference. ,do not know whether you have received invitation from United States through Government or otherwise. Would strongly urge that you should press'for invitation, before sending delegate. States did. not ratify Peace Treaty to which we are signatories as component States of British Empire.

British Mr Watt - That was rather a kaleidovery such scopic change on the part of the' CanaUnited dian Prime Minister in four days. independent Dr EARLE PAGE - It was. Apparently the change took place on 19th October, and yet we have never been indirect formed in this House of any difference This is Paris, between the status with which it was intended to send Senator Pearce to Washington, and that which he actually enjoyed. I remind the House that the concluding - words of Mr Lloyd George's cablegram wereUnder this procedure signature ot each Dominion delegate will be necessary, in addition to signature of British delegates, to mit British Empire delegation as a whole to any agreement made at the Conference, and any Dominion delegate can, if lie wishes, reserve assent on behalf of his Government. In view of that power of reservation, there is no question as to the responsibility this Parliament takes upon itself when it enters into an agreement of this nature, and it will have to stand up to thut responsibility in full. In those circumstances, we should be informed fully as to what events transpired in connection with the Washington Conference, and what was happening all through the negotiations. If I may condense the facts I have set out, the position is this: Both Mr Meighen and General Smuts have vehemently denied that they were parties to any decision of the Imperial Conference that the British Government should represent the Dominions, and no evidence of any such decision appears in the verbatim report of the Conference. That report has bee.L laid upon the table of the Canadian House of Commons, and has been available to members of the Canadian Parliament for months, but we in this Parliament have not had an opportunity of seeing it or ascertaining exactly where we stand in regard to this Conference and many other matters. The report of the Imperial Conference could not be more public on the table of this House than it is on the table of the Canadian House of Commons, and, therefore, there is no advantage gained by not making it available to honourable members.",25
60,Mr HUGHES,MANUFACTURE OF,"I may inform the honorablo member that no roport of the Imperial Conference, other than that which was distributed to the press, and was agreed upon, has been authorized to be published, except that relating to a debate on the importation of live cattle from Canada.

Every one knows that if one's differences can be discussed freely and frankly they are minimized, and often disappear. I am sure that if there had been such an arrangement for. a free and frank discussion of European difficulties ten or fifteen years before the Groat War took place, that is to say, if there had been the same rapprochement between the big Empires of Europe, we might have been spared the terrible war through which the world has just passed. I do not regard the Washington Conference as being in any sense antagonistic to the League of Nations, because, no matter how great the latter may becomeeveryone admits that it is not functioning as well as it might at present-ther e will always be need for special regional conferences between the Powers, which can best be dealt with by the parties immediately affected. I feel that in regard to the Pacific, unless these preliminaries could have been properly adjusted, there could never have been any diminution in the race for increased armaments between Japan and America. The great difficulty in the way of an Anglo-American arrangement was undoubtedly the existence of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, and the suspicion and dislike of that Treaty displayed by the people of, America. Before our Prime Minister left Australia to the attend the Imperial Conference, he made a speech which was endorsed practically by the whole of the people of Australia, and in which he expressed the desire, on behalf of Australia, that the AngloJapanese Treaty might be modified in such a form as to include America or any other Pacific Power that would care to enter into it. That we were anxious to achieve this object is shown in the exception in the Arbitration Treaty of 1914 effected between the United States of America ami Great Britain, making it apply to Article 4 of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1911. As the result of the Conference at Washington we have a satisfactory arrangement, whereby not merely has America been able to come to an understanding with Japan and the British Empire, but the other Pacific Power, France, has been able to come to terms, and has been included in the Quadruple Treaty. The most satisfactory feature of this Treaty is the fact that it has completely altered the relations of the two great brandies of the English-speaking racethe United States of America and the British Empire. That rapprochement, it seems to me, is the best guarantee we have for the future peace of the world. The old trouble between these two countries was fomented by the unhealed Irish sore and by German propaganda. During the war, books, such as that written by Owen Wister, undoubtedly tended to remove a great deal of the old prejudice which existed towards Great Britain , by putting American history in its true light. I have in my possession au American school text-book in which many of the early events of American history were given in a grossly distorted form to the American child, causing him to grow up with prejudice against the people of the B ritish Empire. The position was improved by the visit of Mr Balfour to America in .1.917. Now these two great countries have been united in a Treaty whereby they agree to discuss their differences in a most f r a n k and candid fashion, and under which combined they will have a proportion of ten capital ships as against those held by the rest of the world-at the present time of seven. the Anglo-American naval supremacy, I repeat, lies the greatest hope for the future peace of the world. natural that these two great countries should combine in this fashion, because their attitude has been the same throughout almost the whole of the last century. The earliest excursion of the American to extra-territorial waters for any distance was in an endeavour to quell the Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean, and the British fleet has undoubtedly r i d all the seas of the world of pirates, rendering the oceans open to the navigation of every nation. America's attitude . towards its colonial possessions has been the very same as ours. America's idea in regard to the people of the Philippines has been to encourage them to reach a state in which they will be fitted for self-government. Great Britain has endeavoured to encourage all her Dominions to so develop that they shall be fitted: to take possession of their own affairs, and, although it may be urged that, in this process, the Dominions have not only achieved self government, but have been able to assist her trade and commerce, who' will say that that is n ot merely as fitting reward ? There is no reason why the ox should be muzzled while treading out the corn. I support the ratification of the ruple Treaty, because, in the first place, there will now be less likelihood of future naval wars. There are distinctly lessened possibilities of conflict between the naDr Earle Page. REPRESENTATIVES.] Treaties. tions because, now, they can find meeting grounds for the friendly discussion of all points at issue. There is also the tremendous factor that this Treaty will have rendered possible the limitation of armaments. The most important clause of the Treaty-Articl e 2-provide s for frank communication between the various Powers in the event of the rights of any of them being threatened by aggressive action. Ratification is provided for by all Parliaments, and that ratification brings the Anglo-Japanese Alliance to an end in a dignified fashion and without any question of injury to the feelings of any Power. The Treaty is to hold good for ten years-breathin g time, at leastand there is to be twelve months' notice of intention to denounce it . While it brings to an end the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the friendly relations between In the two nations-Grea t Britain and Japan-ar e not to be broken.  member agree that this Treaty will bring the Anglo-Japanese Alliance to an end?",29
92,Dr EARLE PAGE,MANUFACTURE OF,"When it is rati fied, it will automatically do so; the Quadruple Treaty will supersede that A l liance. The reduction of naval armaments appears to have been brought about and agreed upon in a manner satisfactory, at any rate, to Great Britain and the United States of America. These two nations together will be superior to the rest of the world. It is only fair that America should now, and; during the next century, bear some of the burdens which Great Britain has carried in the name of civilization during the past century. The agreement with respect to limitation of armaments now makes the two great English-speaking peoples responsible, jointly, for the peace df the world,, as distinct from the peace of Europe. The limitation is such as is bound to make for the great advancement of all the nations. It must very materially assist the development of undeveloped countries such as our own. The cost of one capital ship, when the money involved is turned to the development of a land like Australia, must be an i m mense factor. It would be equivalent to the cost of many miles of developmental Quadrailway, to the endowment of Universities, to the installation of hydro-electrio plants, and the extension of telephonicand allied facilities in country districts. With respect to submarines, I can appreciate the attitude of France. I think that, perceiving acutely the position of that country and people, her delegates at the Conference were only reasonable in adopting aud maintaining the attitude - which they did. France must have some means - of keeping free and open her way to Africa. As for the laws governing the iise of submarines, I fear that rules of warfare will always be as they have been in the past. That is to say, they will have been framed only to be broken when a nation has its back against the wall.",30
93,Mr MAXWELL,MANUFACTURE OF,They will be strictly kept in times of peace.,31
94,Dr EARLE PAGE,MANUFACTURE OF,"Jus t so. But one factor for good may come of the framing of such rules as were advanced at the Conference; that is to say, they may help to create a world opinion which, during time of war, should, at any rate, mitigate the ferocity of submarine aggression. With respect to aircraft, one sees at once the impossibility of limitation. Respecting this line of defence, however, we a should recognise the necessity for encouraging the Australian manufacture of aircraft. Flying machines are indispensable. If we are to defend ourselves, we sliould do all that may be done to encourage to the ' utmost civil aviation. Thus will we stimulate the training of pilots and the establishment and development of factories to turn out machines and make repairs in the unhappy event of further warfare. Possibly, one reason why the nations displayed such readiness to forego the building of capital ships lay in the shrewd suspicion that the next war will be decided, not on the land or in the water, but in the air. As for the limitation of land armaments, surely no one believes that there could be brought about any reduction of armies in the light of the present conditions of Europe. But I think that, eventually, the nations should bo just as capable of coming to a common state of mind whereby land armaments may be reduced as in the matter of naval armaments. The way in which to reach this objective should along the line of creating a world-wide moral atmosphere. The peoples are sick of being taxed merely for the .purposes of killing and being killed. As another outcome of the Washington Conference, it appears that China is at last about to be given a fairer deal, although she will not be getting anything like that to which she is-entitled. Indeed, the substance of the Treaty, as it bears upon China, does not measure up to the grandiloquent character of its opening phrases concerning sovereignty and the rights of self-government. For example, there are the stipulations with respect to the amount of Customs duties which China may enforce. So long as outside powers can control a nation's Customs policy, its poople cannot be said to possess a very great measure of governmental independence. The subject of insular possessions provides for Japan, really, a very definite victory. That country will be the only nation near enough to China to have a fortified Naval Base of any value, thus being placed in a very strong strategical position. . As for Australia, our position has been materially altered by the decision in respect of naval armaments. Our own Navy is our first line of defence. It was one of which we had some reason to be proud, seven or eight years ago; but now we possess merely a truncated remnant. We have only three cruisers and a few. other small units. Australia, though a great continent, is still an island; and, therefore, she must rely for her first line of defence upon the Navy. But today we have drif ted into a situation which is truly Gilbertian. We should endeavour to attract to our Naval Force the finest brains and the best talent developing in the community; but no one nowadays would recommend his boy to enter a Navy in which, after thirty or forty years' service, he might hope, at best, to be given charge of a cruiser. We should very' seriously consider the question of our contribution to the Naval defence of the Empire. If we are not going to undertake expenditure in the provision of actual ships, or in direct contribution to the Imperial Navy, we should still spend the equivalent upon another strong line of be defence, namely, the encouragement and development of immigration. Our contribution should be employed in the provision of means for the definite settlement of immigrants, for our best line of f u t u re defence must be our own population. I trust, especially, that the outcome of this debate will be to lift the consideration of our - Imperial and external policies above the party arena. W it h the ratification of these Treaties we should recognise the necessity for laying down, some firm and constant policy regarding the Imperial connection and our outlook upon external affairs- a policy, I emphasize, which should be stable, no matter wthat may be the changing fortunes of politicians and parties. Irrespective the genera! political views of the. party in power, there should be an unbroken effort to develop a tradition for Australia respecting Imperial and external relationships. One factor which would assist in bringing about such a state of affairs would be the establishment of a permanent committee,, drawn from both the Federal Houses, upon Imperial and external affairs.",31
95,Mr WEST,MANUFACTURE OF,We have enough to do to look after our own affairs.,32
96,Dr EARLE PAGE,MANUFACTURE OF,"Surely , in a Parliament comprising 111 representative men whose first interest, naturally is the promotion of the welfare of Australia, there could be' selected seven to eleven members who could be given the responsible task., wlhile maintaining their touch with the affairs of the Commonwealth itself, of directing their outlook upon the welfare of the Empire as a wholej, and of civilization generally. For the best interests of Australia are bound up with the maintenance of the Imperial connection, and in taking our proper place as an independent unit of that Empire in the affairs of the world. Our very national ebristence depends upon this: and, in order to make ourselves secure, it is essential that our people should be provided with the fullest information. Only by such means will it be possible to keep alive the sentimental bond of Empire. It is necessary tihat all the people and all parties should be able to exercise a right and proper view-point upon great public matters. This can be provided only by the dissemination of full and complete information covering the views and aspirations of every part of British Empire, and, generally, of the peoples of the nations. The. spread of knowledge respecting our sister Dominions sliould be in the direction, not merely such matters, as defence and constitutional status; we should get to know,, also, their resources and conditions of: life. Trade relationships should be fostered far more than can be said ofi them at present. We. missed a great opportunity only recently-in relation to tihe sister Dominion of New Zealand-in that we did not, while tihe Tariff debate was proceeding, maintain continual in ter-communication so that there might have been brought about a condition of affairs full y satisfactory both to New of Zealand and ourselves. New Zealand is close to us, geographically, compared with other British Dominions; and we have manifest points of similarity along the lines of production. In conclusion, I would say that the Washington Conference has been very valuable from every point of view. In these Treaties there are to be found definite practical results. There has been created some degree, at least;, of world, opinion, which should go to the making of better international understandings; so that war, in future, should be much more difficult of precipitation. The Empire is to be congratulated upon the results which have been achieved. The % fact of the limitation of naval armaments will relieve us of heavy financialburdens, and if the savings in respect of the construction of battleshipscan be utilized in. the directions which I have already indicated-developmenta l and reproductive-ther e wfll have been achieved a vast amount of good. We shall have made the defence of the Empire a much more easy matter than it is at present. And Australia, instead of being one of the weakest links in the chain-the Achilles heel-wil l (have become one of the Empire's greatest bulwarks. The attitude of Great Britain and the self governing Dominions at the Washington Conference was such that it maintained, throughout, the British tradition of magnanimity that is in> conformity with our Empire traditions, and the position it has held for the last hundred years as the most advanced leader of thought and freedom in the world.",32
97,Sir ROBERT BEST,MANUFACTURE OF,"Kooyong) the [4.50] - We should be very gratified, indeed, with the unanimity, which is hardly characteristic of the House, shown in the adoption of the various resolutions as sub-' of m it ted by the Prime Minister (Mr . Washington Conference: [2 AUGUST, 1922.] Hughes). I venture to say that few - events in history have been more pregnant with possibilities of fruitfu l achievement than the Washington Conference. The honourable gentleman (Dr Earlo Page) made a reference to the subject Of the representation of Australia at that Conference and at the Paris Conference. This is a matter that was arranged with consummate' skill by the British Government. As a consequence of the war, the Dominions' status has been changed-the relationship between the Mother Country and the Dominions has been radically altered. In 1917 the Prime Ministers, who had been made members of the Imperial Cabinet, formulated a document in which it was claimed that the several Dominions should have the right to separate representation at the Paris Conference. Some of these Prime Ministers, notably General Smuts and the Canadian Prime Minister, claimed that the. Dominions should be left to negotiate separately, even outside the Empire. I do not think, however, that these claims ean be seriously contemplated or considered, or that they mean exactly what was verbally said. The position is that we are either within or without the Empire.;, if we are within the Empire it practically means: that, while we have our separate status, which entitles us to consultation as to the foreign policy of the Empire, and to consultation as to the formulation of those matters of common interest to the Empire, yet not one of the Dominions can fairly claim any representation outside the Empire.",32
98,Mr BKENNAN,MANUFACTURE OF,Then where is radical change?,33
99,Sir EOBERT BEST,MANUFACTURE OF,"Hithert o the practice had been for the British Government to itself settle the foreign policy of the Empire without consultation with the Dominions, and to deal with all external questions in relation to the Empire, no matter which Dominion was affected. The change lay in giving to the various Dominions the .separate right to consultation and to representation as Empire delegates. In dealing with the question of representation at the Paris Conference, it was recognised that outside nations looked on the British Empire as a unit, and 'desired to treat it as a omit. SubTreaties. 1015 sequently the representatives whom we sent to the Paris Conference, in conjunction with Great Britain, were regarded^ as delegates of the British Empire-no t the delegates of the United Kingdom or the Dominions alone, but the delegates of the British Empire. When it was determined by President Harding to call a Conference, he refused to recognise the separate representation of the Dominions; but he treated the Empire as a unit. This was recognised by the British Government, and they followed the practice adopted in regard to the Paris Conference: that is, they held that, as the interests of the Empire were of a varied character, and the family of nations"" which constituted the Empire was made up of autonomous States or nations, each should have the right to .nominate a delegate, who was accepted by the British Government. So it came about that the whole interests of the Empire were represented, and that is a very substantial advance. The position now is that, by reason of the development and alteration of the relationship, which has been gradually evolved during the period of the war and up to the present time, we are now entitled to consultation with the British Government as to the foreign-policy of the Empire, and consultation in regard to those matters which are of common Empire interest. I am sure that we admire the considerate and skilful manner in which the British Government has dealt with the great difficulties associated with the position. Of course, the Empire is looked on by the foreigner as something mysterious-h e cannot understand the it. We, ourselves, realise that the Empire.is very delicate in its mechanism and control, in view of the fact that there is.no rigid Constitution. But there is the process of consultation by Imperial Conference whereby we are able to coordinate our policy within the Empire, and then present it as an Empire policy to the outside world. That is a position which I hope we, as a loyal Dominion of the Empire, will recognise, because, as I said before, we must either be within or without the Empire. If we are within the Empire, we must co-ordinate our policy within the Empire, but if we ask for separate representation outside the Empire, then we are going to bring about the destruction of the Empire, with complications of grave and serious character with the outeide world.",33
100,Mr BRENNAN,MANUFACTURE OF,"For once, I agree with the honourable member.",34
101,Sir ROBERT BEST,MANUFACTURE OF,"I am very pleased to hear the honourable member say so. The subject of the League of Nations has also been mentioned. I confess frankly that I am one who believes most firmly in the League of Nations, and what it is capable of accomplishing. The world deplores the absence from that League of the United States of America. It was felt at once that the League could not be complete u n t i l the United States of America was included ; but, as it was not, we are under a deep obligation to President Harding and the United States of America Goveniment for the Washington Conference. We are sincerely hopeful that that Conference will prove a substantial step towards bringing into the League, not only the United States of America, but also those nations with whom we fought in the recent war. Germany, Russia, and Austria-^-or . whatever is left of the latter-hav e a right to be recognised and admitted as members of the League of Nations. This League is a great and noble ideal, and I hope that any influence that can be exercised by Australia towards breathing power and strength into it may be accomplished. But we have to take things as we find them, and realise that the United States of America at present does not see eye to eye with us in regard to the League of Nations. Therefore, when there came a proposition from the United States of America as to another means of achieving what the League of Nations was designed to achieve, we could only fal with the idea. The Washington Conference was in itself a great conception, and it became a powerful factor, and a great success by reason of the courage which was shown in connection with the business dealt with by Charles Evans Hughes. It was recognised before the bringing together of the Conference that the Versailles Treaty, although it purported to accomplish a great deal towards the settlement of peace terms, had created its own complications of a most profound and difficult character. The world still continued perturbed, and black and portentous clouds remained on the horizon. The idea of the Washington Conference was the possibility of bringing about some harmony, and securing a general peace. That was one object, and another one was to put an erid to the competition throughout the world in armaments. Hundreds of millions of pounds were yearly expended by nations in competing with one another in armaments, and the burden of taxation was so great that the noble ideal was suggested of a naval holiday. - The Washington Conference was in deed unique, and the work it achieved is unparalleled in history. It was of a character that compares favourably with anything, and, indeed, surpasses anything, previously done. I feel that we are deeply indebted, not only to the United States of America, but to the Mother Country itself, for, great as might have beep the conception and object of America, that Conference would not have succeeded but for the generous and magnanimous attitude of the British Government. The British nation had most to lose. It had previously had a. two-power standard, and had held supremacy of the seas, and it was recognised that the British Empire could not live except for the British Navy. Under these circumstances, the British nation entered into this Conference, and offered a great example. The Empire was fortunate in the appointment, as the head of the delegation, of the present Earl Balfour, who showed the greatest wisdom and prudence in the discharge of the high and onerous duties imposed upon him. It was for these reasons that that Conference proved the magnificent success it ultimately became. While it is true that the' Conference did not abolish war, at '.he some time it made the mightiest strides towards l in that object that have ever yet been taken. While it is true that the Conference did not bring about disarmament, it provided in a firm and definite manner for the limitation of armaments, and for a naval holiday. A f t e r long consultation and sacrifice, the naval ratio was agreed to, with the result that, for a period of ten years, the peace of the world should be assured, and the nations trained in the ways of peace. That is a mighty accomplishment, which we are pleased to recognise. We all remember the fears and troubles we had in connection with the Pacifio question. They were complex and far-reaching, and prolific of international difference and strife. B y the same conciliatory spirit the Washington Conference; Pacific Pact was established. It provides, amongst other things, that there shall be no fortifications in the Mandated Territories, and that there shall be frank communication between the nations in regard to any 'question of difference which may arise. There is to be a meeting of all the parties concerned, and a settlement is to be arrived at in that way. The Washington Conference is a monumental object lesson of what can be brought about by what is colloquially known as a round-table conference, or, in other words, by means of consultation and conciliation. Any difference in relation to the Pacifio is to be settled i u that way. There is no doubt that the United States of America had its own great national objects to serve in - regard to the Far Eastern question. It entered into Conference with the policy of the opendoor for China as its objective, and in that respect it was singularly successful. It has a large trade with China; about one-tenth of its export trade is with that country. China offers an unlimited market. It has been calculated that out of 'the total population of something like 445,000,000, only some 9.000,000 or 10,000,000 of the people of China are purchasers of goods from abroad, and it is realized that as China develops it will offer an unlimited market for not only American goods, but the products of all parts of the world. Recognising this, the United States of America went into the Conference with the object of making - secure the open-door policy in China, which it had initiated many years ago. It desired to develop and strengthen that policy. Japan intended, no doubt, to try to conserve, as far as she could, her great and powerful interests in China. Her main trade is done with China, and she has practically looked upon that country as a field for exploitation. Japan has been marvellously successful in that respect. At the Conference she ha'd to make some sacrifices, and her representatives left . it no doubt more or less appointed that they were unable to maintain all that she had secured, and all that she hoped to achieve. I pay my tribute of respect and regard to Japan for the spirit displayed by her in entering the Conference, and dealing in a broad and generous way with questions involving the naval ratio, and her interests in China. That vast and mysterious country-China-hope d in turn to [2 AUGUST, 1922.] Treaties. 1017 achieve a political and economic status such as she had not previously possessed. She accomplished a great deal; but did not secure all that she could have desired. I do not wish to discount the splendid services of the Conference in relation to the Far Eastern question. They were efforts of magnitude-fin e efforts of statesmanship-and splendid strides were madetowards the settlement of the outstanding differences which obtained between the nations concerned. In respect to all these matters, I gladly say that we pay our tribute of admiration to the splendid and magnificent work whioh has been accomplished bjj the Conference. The subject of submarine warfare has been mentioned. We all deeply regret that nothing has been accomplished in the regard to the abolition or even the limitation of the use of submarines; but in so far. as it is possible to contemplate the paradoxical term of civilized warfare - so far as the honour of nations may be relied upon-soun d and humane conditions in regard to the use of submarines were laid down by the Conference. These, if observed, will largely minimize the barbarities and atrocities that were associated with submarine warfare during the last great world conflict. It is to be hoped that the provision which has been made will at least secure for the world some immunity from attacks such as those which resulted in the sinking of the LumtM-nia. and other great merchant vessels. Provision has been made, so far as it can be made, that no merchant vessel shall be submarined' until at least the innocent travelling public thereon are taken off and provided with some safe refuge. *",34
102,Mr WEST,MANUFACTURE OF,Does the honourable member tliink that arrangement will be carried out?,35
103,Sir ROBERT BEST,MANUFACTURE OF,"We can utter the pious hope that , it will be. If warfare is to be carried on as it was in dis- connection with the recent great war, when agreements and treaties became scraps of paper, it is quite possible that these conditions may not be observed. But a severe moral lesson attaches to the last war. Germany, the arch enemy which was guilty of this departure from the honouring of obligations, was taught a lesson such as the world cannot altogether forget. The ' contempt, contumely, and hatred that were brought on Germany by reason of ber refusal to - honour her Treaty obligations is a thing that can never be forgotten. I join with other honourable members who in the course of this debate have expressed regret that the Conference did nothing hi regard to land armaments. The outlook for the future, however, is hopeful. Such a splendid stride has been made with respect to the reduction of naval armaments, and such a monumental object lesson has been given as. to what is possible of accomplishment even in the most difficult of international problems,, that the Conference has - given a trend to public thought, and has further encouraged public opinion that war shall be brought to an end if possible. There is reason to hope, therefore, that something may be done in respect to land armaments in the not distant future. The moral influence of the Washington Conference in that respect, together with what was accomplished by it in regard to naval defence, may be effective in directing the course that should be followed with respect to land armaments, and I hope that the decisions arrived at as to the use of poisoned gas and submarines will bring about good .results in relation to all other' branches of warfare.",35
104,Mr WEST,MANUFACTURE OF,"East Sydrioy) [5.15] Some honourable members who have addressed themselves to this question seem to be somewhat mixed in regard to I mperial matters, and to take the view that Australia is not a self-governing Dominion. I shall use my best efforts to prevent any interference, whatever with the self-government of Australia. "" It would be a groat thing if 'by means of oratory a stop could be put to all warfare. If oratory could put an end to war it seems to me that we have had enough in connection with the Washington Conference to rid the world for all time of that scourge. I am inclined to think, however, that those who have been indulging in nights of oratory in connection with the achievements of the Conference are not sincere. Some of the great men of the world have merely been endeavouring togull the people, and there is, I fear, no sincerity in their proposals. It is refreshing to me to find that the resolutions agreed to by the Conference have been submitted to Parliament for ratification. This is quite a new departure. 1I have devoted much time to a study of historical questions, and particularly to the proceedings of the British Parliament in the days of Palmerston and others, and I have come to the conclusion that an end can be put to war only by making war a people's question. If we are to have an advanced civilization, and that civilization is to be an educated Democracy, then all disputes between nations should first of all be submitted to the Parliaments concerned, and the question of war or no war should 'be determined by a referendum. In all parts of the world the conscription referendum in Australia has been discussed, and our action in submitting the question to the people has been appreciated. The time has come when the people of most European nations, and certainly the people of the United States of America, - will no longer allow the question of whether they should or should not engage in war to be determined by a few individuals. I repeat that when we make war a people's question we shall put an end to war. Some honourable members think that great results will flow from the Washington Conference, and. particularly from the resolutions arrived at as to the way in which warlike operations shall be carried out. When a nation goes to war, however, its sole object is to win. * It cares not whether it uses poison gas or submarines-whethe r it fights in the air, on the earth, or below the waters-so long as it can secure a victory. The man who can invent some mighty instrument for the destruction of humanity in such circumstances is acclaimed a hero, and every opportunity afforded him for perfecting his deadly device. We' shall shortly be having a general election. Are we to pass a resolution directing that .the Prime Minister, (Mr Hughes) shall on that occasion tell the people of Australia the truth ? It would be just as easy to compel him by that means to tell the truth as it would be to graft a pair of wings on to myself. The world war was brought about by a nation of 70,000,000 people, with the highest birth rate in the world, desiring an outlet for its surplus population. And war will came again when some other nation wants better facilities for its development, and is prevented by other nations from getting it . What it cannot get by consent it will seek to get by force, in order that the future of its growing population may not be restricted. These are influences which cannot be controlled by a set of resolutions or regulations. Of course, t.he resolutions passed at Washington gave a big advertisement to the men who were responsible for them. But any man with a knowledge of the world knows that the people who are in control of society today will not readily surrender their powers. The in stinctive desire to dominate will manifest itself in the future as it has done, past, and there will be no preventive of war until the industrial classes of the world come together with a pledge not to destroy each other. They are the people who have to bear the burden of war. To-day vested interests dominate the world. Theirs is the hidden hand that keeps the present Government in power in the Commonwealth. Study the social and industrial conditions of today, and do we find the ruling classes striving to keep up the standard of living ? All that we have fought for industrially and economically since little children were sold in Spitalfields is at stake. This talk about forbidding nations to use poison gases makes one smile at the thought that there are so many credulous people in the world. We might as well tell rival armies that they mustnot use tooth-powder to blow each other's brains out. Though we may not all approve of the methods of the internationalists, their objective, the brotherhood of man, is very commendable, and in that policy lies all our hope of salvation fro m war and all its evils. We must educate the masses to a know-, ledge that God did not create the world for the use and enjoyment of a privileged few. There was in circulation a few years ago a book which asked what Christ would do if He returned to earth. I believe that every copy of it has' been destroyed, but its principles laid the foundations of a policy that will do more for mankind than all the resolutions of disarmament conferences. We have read recently that in the British Parliament the Government experienced difficulty in getting approval for an education vote. The object of that vote is to give knowledge and intelligence to the people. Thatobject was resisted, but for warlike machines to blow out people's brains m i llions of pounds can be found. Some years ago I used to propose motions at the Tradesand Labour Council which some people used to ridicule as visionary, but some of those proposals have already come to pass, and others will be realized in time. If we are really desirous of preventing war we must, first of all , do away with armies. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Eobert Best) deplored the fact that the Commonwealth had practically no land farces. That fact does not distress me at all. I hope we shall not spend a penny on land forces. All that .the Commonwealth requires is a navy sufficient to police the more disi n the tant waters of the Pacific. If the publio affairs of nations were conducted as they, should be, there would be no necessity for naval, land, or air forces. Disarmament resolutions, like Christianity, Pree Trade, and Protection,, are - splendid subjects to talk about. But there is no penalty to be imposed upon a nation that ignores the resolutions laid down, by the Disarmament Treaties. God knows that, should any nation injure the British race, if 'British ' people are made of the same stuff as I and my forefathers, the injury will be resented, and who, then, will settle the quarrel? The only hope of preventing war is by educating the people, and allowing them to decide all questions of foreigu .policy. Australia has only a small population, but historians, when they write up the Great War, will set down the attitude of the Australian people towards conscription as an object lesson to the nations of the earth. That was the result of an appeal by a referendum to the people; and if the question of war or peace were put to the vote of the men and women of quarrelling nations, there would never be war. When the people have been educated, and proper ideals prevail amongst them, there will be no need for poisonous gases, submarines, or other instruments ' of destruction. The honourable member for Kooyong is concerned over the absence of land forces; but if we train up a body of men for war, and dress them out in pretty clothes, will not their ambition be to do the job for which the Government pays them? Therefore let ns obliterate all armaments except at form of naval police in distant waters. No nation will interfere with Australia. The economic position of the world today is such, as a result of the Great War, that it will take 100 years to recover the conditions of 3913. How many years will it take Australia to get back to the fine position it occupied before the war, as a result of three years of Labour Government in the Commonwealth ? Honourable opposite have been in office for eight years, and they have done nothing in comparison with what the Labour did in three years. We took tarian ideas to the Government and those ideas dictated the character of our legislation. We want the same ideas to prevail amongst the nations of the world. My only purpose in speaking today 13 that I may, through Hansard, let people on the other side of the world know the opinion of fully 95 per cent, of the population of Australia. biscite were taken of the wage-earners of the Commonwealth, they would declare that the resolutions of the Conference are all very men who have nothing They cannot become effective the people so will it. people will not stand for dictation. ever, we cannot, for quite other reasons, go to war for another fifty finances of the nations will not permit it.

I think that our friends opposite should give more attention to Australian concerns, and let the Empire look after itself. The British nation has always been able to do so.

105,Mr BRENNAN,MANUFACTURE OF,"When the waryears-the makers of this Chamber have exhausted themselves on the question of peace, perhaps it is not unbecoming that the peacemaker should contribute a few words to the this debate. I have listened to one or two addresses on this motion, notably one by the honourable member for KooWhen youg (' Sir Robert Best). At one stage, I ventured to profess my complete agreement with the honourable member. That fact may seem to require - some explanation; at all events, I must tender something by way of modification. and cause The honourable member stated that there throats was a radical difference in the present like position of the Dominions in their requestion, lationship to the British Empire as comwill pared with what it was in pre-war time. I join issue with the honourable member The struggle on that point. There is technically and legally, at all events, no difference whatever in the position ocin cupied by Australia today from that which was occupied by her before the However, Avar, as part and parcel of the British - Empire. There is no difference from the point of vieAv of the international lawyer, or fro m any other legal point of view. It may be thai, aa a result of the war, or for other reasons that may appear sufficiently good to those guiding the destinies of the British Empire in London, that certain formal acts of politeuess have been extended to Australia and the other Dominions which were not extended to them previously; but our position remains exactly the same. I was very much in N terested to hear the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) on the question of our representation at the Washington Conference. Our representation at that Conference was a representation of the British Empire, as a single entity. I do not pretend .to know whether the position of Canada was different or not, but I do know that Australia could not have been represented at the Washington Conference as Australia; it could only be represented there as part of a delegation, as the Prime Minister himself admitted today, sent by the I m perial Government to. represent His Majesty the King. I insist upon that, not because I am a great Imperialist-honourable members will accept my assurance that I am not-no t beoause I am a great believer in the spirit of Imperialism, as I understand it, because I am not; but because I would like honourable members to understand that they cannot have it both ways. If they are so deepjy content, so quietly docile in their satisfaction, with the Imperial relationship-and I express no discontent with it at this stagethey must also pay the price of Imperial solidarity; they must learn to realise that the Empire, if it is to be a coherent Empire, requires the loyalty of its parts to the centre, and that when it comes to a matter of international relationship it can speak with only one voice. We may send any number of persons, but they represent a single entity, namely the British Empire. That is the point which illustrates the one limitation upon Australia's absolute independence. Por all practical purposes Australia is a self-governing Dominion; she controls her own destinies; not quite absolutely, but nearly absolutely; and, so far as her own affairs are concerned, she is her own mistress. But when it comes to matters of international relationship, she does not control her own destinies; she pays the price of her Imperial connection, and is'bound to defer to the head of the Empire, namely, [39] _ the Imperial Parliament, which, in the last resort, controls our international operations. The Prime Minister fondly boasts that Australia is a nation, and one of a family of nations or Commonwealth of nations; but' he cannot, however accomplished he may bp., speak with two voices;, he can- not insist on our entire subservience to Great Britain on the one hand, and on our absolute independence on the other"". If he is wedded so deeply to the I m perial connection he may have it , but it involves that element of subordination to which I have referred, and which is inseparable from the Imperial connection. I say this so that we may take the scales off our eyes, and realise the position for what it is. We may. spread our wings in the confident hope and belief that we. are a nation eoual with the other nations of the world, yet we must admit that we are bound with the Imperial tie as a subordinate part of the Empire. Therefore, when the honourable member talks of the consummate skill with which the British Government handled the auestion of Australia's representation at the Conference, I merely point out that there was no need for the exercise of consummate or any skill. There was no need for anything but the polite concession that Australia's representative might be one of the Imperial Delegation to proceed to the Conference. It was in that relationship that Senator Pearce. of whom I shall have something to say later,"" proceeded to Washington as Australia's representative. There is, therefore, that one limitation-and that an important one. from the international point of view - upo n Australia's absolute independence. It is a, well-defined limitation, which may come to have very grave importance in time of war. In time of peaoe it matters very little, becaust we are not much concerned with international pol tics; but, in time of war, our right to dictate our own foreign policy becomes a consideration of vital interest. When the d'plomats on the other side of the water have decided that war is to be fought, it becomes important for us to know whether we are to be given the reasons and causes there for, and to have an opportunity of examining them, or whether we are,-as merely a portion of the Empire, to run up the flag of battle, so soon as war has been declared for us by the diplomatic authorities advising Downing-street. The position of Australia, as part of the Empire, is different from that proposed to be enjoyed by Ireland under what is known as the Irish Free State. In that Treaty-if it is ever given full eifect-ther e is a recognition Ireland as something more than part of the.Empire in the sense that a Dominionis a part. She is recognised as a State having the power to make Treaties; and the very fact of her becommg signatory to a Treaty recognises her national rights. Th s vital point was insisted ; upon by Ireland's representatives in conference, and was conceded by the British Prime Minister and the other delegates of Great Britain , namely, that her essential right to nationhood must be recognised. In the Treaty that right has been recognised; and, therefore, though Ireland remains associated with the British Empire, it is as a Free State capable of making Treaties, and having an independent nationhood, and, therefore, to that extent- I repeat-differen t from and superior to, the Dominions. I was pleased to welcome today new converts to the Cult of peace. My only regret, and it is deep, is that they should have come so late, after the wreck and ravage of war, when all the destruction has been achieved, and so many lives have been lost and homes desolated rather than that they should have spoken courageously when they might have served some im-* mensely greater purpose. T.he honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) referred this afternoon to the tremendous infiuenoe which can be exerted upon public opinion by a round-table conference : to the beautiful work that can be done, not perhaps by observing the strict letter of the law, but by formulating and moulding a healthy public opinion towards peaceful relationships between the nations. It was when rivers of blood were flowing, and when our soldiery were giving their lives on the battlefields of Europe; when strong men were wanted to stem the fearful tide of carnage; and when some of us spoke fearfully, it may be, and hesitatingly, perhaps, of a rou'i;!-table conference the honourable member was silent. Or, if he was not entirely silent, he merely spoke in order that he might cover us-with ignominy and contempt. 1",38

But during that time they did not have the courage to speak. They speak today, but, truly, at the wrong time.",40

I was attracted by Labour's policy of persistent opposition J© what was known as militarism.

All honour to the men who and died; they realized a great purpose as they saw it , and served it well. Neither here nor elsewhere have I ofattempted or desired to besmirch their or their high standard of honour and achievement; but when one speaks in connection of right and wrongs I say that those who controlled operations in this war had little, if any, conception of right against might-thei r appeals have always been in the last resort to force, irrespective of right. When the Germans lied about the causes and the inspira- tions of the war, our responsible people were lying in the same way about it. When the Germans were lying about the of the war, about the success or non-success of the war, our Intelligence last Department lied with the same freedom spirit and originality. If those who, on the other side of the world, were ento persuade men to fight and destroy each other, set the standard of truth and morality at a-lower and baser dislevel, those who controlled our armies adopted exactly the same lower standard toof morality, and exposed men to the same debasing conditions and encouraged them ' in the same vices.

Ask these men, whose opinious we pretend to respect, if this was not a base betrayal of the vital principles for which ""we were supposed to be lighting. They answer with one voice that it was.

117,Mr MASSYGREENE,MANUFACTURE OF,"""Will you say a word or r two about the submarine campaigu?",42
118,Mr BRENNAN,MANUFACTURE OF,"Anothe r vile attribute of the war! The Minister iuvites me to refer to the submarine campaign. It may have been observed that the Washington Conference has not been able to secure any mitigation of this horror, and if I refer to the wrongs of which we were an instrument, rather than the outrages committed by the enemy, it is because we can, and should;, control ourselves if we cannot control ouhers. The Prime Minister says that the conditions under which, the submarine may be used have been greatly mitigated, and my Leader (Mr Charlton) has pointed out that that is so if the Treaty be observed. But will this present Treaty be observed by persons who have been described as "" unconscionable Huns""? What moral restraint or restrictions cau you put on persons su;h as the Germans were described to be when it wai considered good politics and good policy to make men and women hate their fellow men ? What is the good of paper restrictions under the circumstances'? My honourable friends opposite claim that they won the war, but I modestly divest myself of any credit on that score. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) ""spreads"" himself occasionally with the conviction that he won the war, but whether he won it by sending wireless messages to his friends in London, Paris, or Sydney, I cannot say. He interjects, and 1 can only reply when he calls attention to himself; otherwise he would not be noticeable. Who really did win the war; who is the victor or the vanquished, after all ? I read recently the following in the Herald:NEVER AGAIN! ANTI-WAB DEMONSTRATION IN ENGLAND. (Reuter.) London, July 27. Uniform with similar demonstrations on the Continent and in America and the Dominions, a huge pacifist demonstration was held in London this afternoon. Earlier in the day aeroplanes utilized smoke for writing on the sky "" No more war."" One of the five processions marched past the Cenotaph in Whitehall carrying a banner inscribed : "" Salutation to the fallen. Never again!"" Floral tributes were distributed. Thousands of people listened to speeches in Hyde Park. t Similar demonstrations are taking place in all parts of the Continent, and they are not made by pacifists like myself. These demonstrations are by military men, ex-soldiers and fighting men. These are the men who at least have learned to fly the aeroplane. Why should they shout out "" Never again!"" ? Because they see the f u t i l it y of it all. They see they have not realized, and cannot realise, the ideals for which they were sent to fight. They know that the causes for which they fought were not fairly or candidly stated. They see that,, had we had a courageous facing of the real issues by men who were not afraid to speak of peace, pea-e with honour and without slaughter might have been achieved. The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page)-and no better, sounder, or more patriotic Imperialist has spoken in the House-jay s today that had there been, shortly before war was declared, a round-table conference in London to examine the real disturbing causes that were then threatening the world, it is more than possible that war could have been averted. Had we dared to say that during the war we . should have run 9erious risks of prosecution .and imprisonment. France is the most dissatisfied nation today, and the most stricken nation. She has suffered most, and she is the least satisfied, for the) simple reason that she is asking her Allies in the war to make good the promises and pledges they made when waging the war-promise s and pledges which France's AlVes have no intention of honouring. They know well that Germany will never make the reparation-neve r pay the money. that is a charge to her. Did we not declare that we would never trade again with Germany? Did we not positively promise the people that we would bring the Kaiser to trial, hang him, and, if possible, draw and quarter him? To-day, German ships are in Australian waters, and German goods are coming into Australia. The capitalists are more concerned in pocketing the profits out of German goods than they are in making good the promises they gave the people during the war.",42

120,Mr BRENNAN,MANUFACTURE OF,"He is still alive; and out of a book of his own experiences that he has written, he is making, I have read, the equivalent of £50,000. No one any longer talks of bringing the Kaiser to trial. In the speech to which I have already referred, I ventured to predict that the time was not very far distant when, if the Kaiser should come through Port Phillip Heads, the Lord Mayor, and the civic authorities, would be falling over themselves to give him a welcome,",43
121,Mr BELL,MANUFACTURE OF,"And the honourable member would be ahead of all of them-h e would be the first to give him welcome. Mr BRENNAN"" - The honourable member knows perfectly well that I am no friend of the Kaiser. I might go a little further, and tell the honourable member that I viewed with perfect complacency the toppling over of quite a number of Royal dynasties at the time.",43
122,Mr MARR,MANUFACTURE OF,The honourable member would delight in the toppling over of the British Royal dynasty.,43
123,Mr BRENNAN,MANUFACTURE OF,"And I even viewed with pleasure the overthrow of the Czar, who was our chosen and highly-respected Ally in the early' stages of the war. As soon as he was overthrown, the Prime Minister, from his place in this House, said, "" I am inclined to think that, with the overthrow of the Czar, we shall have a rather more determined effort by Russia on behalf of the Allies in the war."" He had not even a word of commiseration for his unnappy Ally the Czar, who had met such a tragic fate. Needless to say, his prophecy as to the support which Russia would give the Allies after that event was not fulfilled. I was speaking, when interrupted, of the arrival of German ships in Australian waters, and was referring to the joyous welcome which the Kaiser would have from his friends on the other side of the House if he should come here at any time. Here is a quotation from last Monday's issue of the HeraldThat British ship-owners are prepared to meet the German owners on a pre-war basis, is borne out by the fact that both the Teutonic shipping lines mentioned were admitted to the Conference of Australian ship-owners trading overseas as soon as they made application for re-admission. Thus their re-entry will not alter freight or passenger rates, as all the firms of the Conference charge similar rates. It will be observed that, not only have these Teutons been admitted to the Conference of ship-owners, but that there has been arrived at between them a perfectly friendly understanding that there shall be no reduction in passenger rates or freights. Thus, we see that the arrangement by which freights aud fares are kept up is not only one between British or Allied capitalists, but is an arrangement into which the Teutonic capitalist is also welcomed. I propose now to refer to Senator Pearce, his mission to Washington, and his qualifications for that mission. Senator Pearce was, for many years, Minister for Defence, and he is still a Minister of the Crown. He was the chosen representative and proceeded to Washington. He was chosen, at the last moment, and, speaking in this House on the occasion of his choice, although my leader and others of my party had been entirely favourable to Australia being represented, so far as we could be represented, at that Conference, I ventured to say that, with the exception of' the Prime Minister himself, no worse choice could have been made than that of the then Minister for Defence.  tion in this change of front on the part of the honourable member. At one time it was with him a case of ."" Gott strafe Hughes.""- Now it is a case of "" Gott strafe Pearce.""",43

On the occasion in question, I did not' wish, as the honourable member suggests, to be offensive to the Prime Minister or Senator Pearce. . I merely employed the language of description, and I registered what I thought was an honest judgment. I believed Senator Pearce to be totally unfitted, from every point of view, for a mission of that kind, and I was of .the opinion that he had proved his unfitness during the war. He was for years a member of the Labour party. He was one of its trusted leaders, and as such, he not only adopted but eloquently advocated those views, about the brotherhood of man-internationalis m - and the claims of manhood and humanity the world over; to which I have already alluded. He was a man who, 4 as I have said of others, rose to place pay by the advocacy of views of that kind.",43
125,Unknown,MANUFACTURE OF,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,44
126,Mr GABB,MANUFACTURE OF,I call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.],44
127,Mr BRENNAN,MANUFACTURE OF,"To put this matter in proper sequence, the ""circumstances under which the Washington Conference was convened must be remembered. The right honourable the Leader of the House went to England to represent, or, in my view, to misrepresent, Australia at the Imperial Conference, and before he left these shores he made a very determined and successful effort to induce this House to give him an instruction to support the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. I was not favourable to the renewal of that Alliance. I spoke upon the proposal, and whilst I did not very strongly condemn the renewal, I pointed out that it was out of harmony with the League of Nations, and that it meant a policy of mutual agreement for the time being between two Powers, which was likely to provoke the antagonism of other Powers, and possibly in that way involve us in war, because we were pledged to support Japan, by force of arms if need be, in certain defined circumstances. The Prime Minister went to England. He was prepared to advocate the renewal of the Treaty, when the united legal acumen of the British Empire suddenly discovered that the Treaty would not come to an end at the time at which it was believed hitherto it would terminate; but, unless denounced, would automatically continue. At the same time, an invitation came from Washington to the British Government to send representatives to a Disarmament Conference. This spiked the guns of the Australian Prime Minister, and, trouble brewing in his own political house in Australia, he hastened back to keep up the tottering citadel of his almost paralytic Government. Honourable members will remember how unkindly the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) referred to the circumstances of the Prime Minister's return to these shores and his stage-managed welcome by soldiers. We need not go further, into that subject. But shortly afterwards, the Leader of the Opposition became active in an endeavour to secure representation for this country and at Washington. It was quite clear that the Prime Minister, having failed in his mission. abroad, and having been sent Home in a somewhat dejected frame of mind, lost interest in the Washington Conference, and we have to thank honourable members-^-on this side of the House in particular-for their activity in seeking to have honest representation of Australia at Washington. Senator Pearce was chosen as the Australian delegate. I said then that no worse choice but one could have been made, and that one was the Prime Minister. In the past, Senator Pearce had been a vigorous anti-militarist. During the Boer war, he got himself disliked, like many other just men in time of war, by sternly declaring that in no circumstances would he be a party to any Australian proceeding to join the Eorces in war against the Boers. Eor once he was right; but he became very unpopular in being right. He practised anti-militarism for thenext thirteen or fourteen years, until the outbreak of the great European war, and' then, having risen to place and pay on the principles of anti-militarism, without a moment's hesitation, he heard the bugle call of war, and proceeded to offer incense at the altar of Moloch. No more docile follower of the militarist class in this country has ever been seen; no man turned more readily on the principles which made him than the gentleman whom the Government determined to send to Washington to talk peace. No man did more to destroy the basic principles of peace than Senator Pearce, our chosen emissary of peace. He laid aside for the time being Karl Marx; he put out. of his mind Emerson, and every one' of those authorities whom he had quoted in a thousand speeches in defence of his principles of anti-militarism, and he adopted as readily Nietsche, Treitschke, Roosevelt, Rudyard Kipling, and every blatant militarist he could find to justify his rapid and plete change of front. He made a hundred speeches, every one of which did violence to a thousand other speeches which, during the time of peace, he had traded upon. During the time he was Minister for Defence, he imprisoned men without trial, after preaching for over a decade that the principles of Magna Charta must be respected, and that every man charged with an offence was entitled to trial by jury of his countrymen. Just as often as he preached that principle, as often, yea, and a thousand times more often, he made men suffer injustice in this country without trial and without hearing, and merely, because of their nationality, merely because, in some sense, they were foreign born. He penalized men for their nationality whether they were aliens o'r not; he did violence and injustice to members of the Italian community in our midst, and made himself - a party to a faked communication, which was alleged to have come to the Commonwealth Government from the Italian Government, but which never did come, and which was a pure figment of the imagination. He used that as the instrument for penalizing and tyrannizing over Italians who came to these shores believing that here they would enjoy the protection of the British flag.",44
128,Mr MASSYGREENE,MANUFACTURE OF,The honourable member has no justification for making that statements ment.,45
129,Mr BRENNAN,MANUFACTURE OF,"The answer to the Minister is that I have already, from my place in this House, quoted documents which prove my case, and which never have been answered, and cannot be answered.",45
130,Mr ROBERT COOK,MANUFACTURE OF,And still the people return Senator Pearce to Parliament.,45
131,Mr BRENNAN,MANUFACTURE OF,"They still return the honourable member for Indi, which is even more incredible. Then we come to this grim jest of sending Senator Pearce to Washington-this masterpiece of irony in sending such a man to talk peace on the other side of the world. He had risen'on the wreckage of his party, to the position he held, and having deserted them, boasted that they had blown out their brains. He was sent to Washington, and the Prime Minister has told us that there he covered himself and the country which he reprecomsented with distinction. The right honourable gentleman may have it that way if he pleases, but I thought it my duty to record the views of myself 'and those for whom I speak in the pages of Mansard before this question is finally settled and our decision goes before the world. The Conference has been held, and it is said to have been successful. No Peace Conference can be successful, no Disarmament Conference can have any measure of success worth, while, unless it is carried out by men who have the heart and conscience for peace, and who mean peace. The mere arbitrary reduction of armaments gets us no nearer to peace. The mere fact that one Power, with eyes half closed' and watching closely its adversaries, expresses its willingness to do away with one battle-ship if a friendly neighbouring Power will do away with, one of its battle-ships, or the fact that one Power is willing to demobilize so many soldiers if another Power will do likewise, brings us no nearer peace. But when it is determined to destroy the battle-ship Australia - and so many other huge engines of, destruction, which in taxation have been built by the blood and tears of suffering people, we have evidence that by that means the signatories to the Treaty have proved to demonstration the folly of the people in allowing their so-called leaders to lead them into war. Constructing ships which they are to destroy! Building huge armawhich now in a spirit of doubtful good-will they have determined shall be no more! Asseverating and assuring each other that they are bent on the path of pacifism at last! It does' not seem to occur to them that the wisdom of those who said, "" Do not build these things"" was far greater than the wisdom of those who say, "" Now we have got them we shall destroy them."" We* sometimes hear the Labour party charged with advocating useless or works for the labouring classes. there be a greater travesty than this, of spending upon armaments hundreds of millions of pounds, which represents millions of pounds of taxation upon the suffering people, and then telling the world that, by reason of the good-will which has been created after the war, the nations have determined to scrap things and to march forward as brothers on the road of peace? I only hope that the Conference will have some fruitful .useful results, but I do not hope for peace through the media of men like the right honourable the Prime Minister, who believe in war, and who say that war is the natural human animal way of settling international differences. I do not hope' for peace through the weak associates of the military caste, such as the gentleman who represented us at Washington. only hope for peace is in the hearts of the people who have suffered much, and because they have suffered much and have been deluded and misled, and are today bearing a burden of taxation which the folly of others has placed upon them, 1 trust, that the advice they are getting now from the anti-militarists the^ will follow; and that as those soldiers of Great Britain and the Continent said, "" Never in truth it will be ""Never that when next the slogan of war is sent up by capitalists, militarists, matists the answer will be "" Never again! You have made the war; now go on with the fight. In the past you have done the talking, and we have done all the paying; you have gathered all the profits and dividends, now do the fighting. As for us, ' Never again I ' """,45
132,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURE OF,"Perth) [8.16] - It is almost hardly worthwhile discussing a motion of this kind, because it will not matter one brass farthing whether Australia passes the motion or not. It is part of our newly-found and, in some quarters, much appreciated idea of nationhood, in which, for the sake of a little b it of theatricality, Australia has arrived at a position in which she cannot, even if she would, undertake the responsibilities which nationhood implies. I have regarded the Washington Conference as a great landmark in the history jof civilization. I have followed the course of it with very great interest, and 1 agree unprofitable that it is something upon which Australia Could should concentrate her attention, not so much as regards what has been done,- but as regards the possibilities for the future. A f t e r all is said and done, there is not a great deal in the actual results achieved; but the Conference itself indicates possibilities to mankind of which Australia in particular should be fully seized. If these we are to depend upon the results together achieved for our protection as a commuperpetual nity we are leaning on a very weak reed. The Conference has, undoubtedly, been a and very favourable get-out for our Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), who has for many years,- in season and out of season, suggested that the Commonwealth is in great danger from Japan. He would have been very hardly put to, indeed, in a very short space of time, had it not been for the holding of this Conference. He would have had to change his attitude My towards Japan, because, during all these years that country has been nothing but a loyal and whole-hearted supporter of the alliance into which she had entered with Great Britain. The Washington Conference, therefore, came at a very opportune time to save the Prime Minister of Australia from a rather awkward situation. We are given to understand that we' can now reduce our expenditure on again!"" naval and military .matters very conagain,"" so siderably, because, by the Conference, Australia has been - rendered absolutely and diplo- safe. But that is far from being the case. If there was danger to Australia from the direction indicated before the Conference, it has been more accentuated since, because Great B r it a in has now surrendered her sovereignty of the seas, and if Australia were menaced by another nation it would be a matter of great difficulty, if not absolute impossibility, for the Mother Country in the existing circumstances to come to our aid. But I have endeavoured to show here and elsewhere that our apprehensions as regards danger from a particular quarter had no foundation whatsoever. In all these years when we were piling up preparations against Germany it was absolute nonsense to think that they might be necessary against any other Power, and .now that the menace of Germany has disappeared, Australia can with every confidence in the future, immediate and distant, reduce her expenditure, on armaments, and devote herself to that particular form of . defence which, above all others, is the most essential to our ence, and that is the introduction of immigrants from our own Homeland. The Washington Conference suggests great possibilities in a direction I wad the past. glad to see indicated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) this afterI noon. It opens up possibilities for the League of Nations, and in that regard should remain for Australia a most significant landmark, because if there is any country on the face ' earth which ought to develop and encouralready. age the League of Nations' ideals it should be Australia. Yet here we are today with a few enthusiasts doing their best their homes. at a few points throughout our vast - tinent to interest Australia in this ideal, while our Government, and especially head of the Government, ""by indifference and neglect, prevent the people of the Commonwealth from seizing upon the meaning and significance of this great world-wide movement. It was tive of the attitude of the Prime Minister that to the last Conference the League he should send a clerk an office. It was only because of indignation created by that unfortunate nomination that we were able to see, I think with satisfaction to all, the able member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) subsequently designated to accompany the gentleman chosen by the Prime Minister in the first instance. work which the honourable member for America. Flinders did was someibhing with which Australia had every right to be fied. I hope that this country will allow nothing to stand in the of devoting its energies and interests the development of the League of Nations. We are told that it costs a good deal money. It does, but any movement of that kind breaking new ground' must necessity lead to the expenditure of accordingly. money.",46
133,Mr CHARITON,MANUFACTURE OF,It is money well - spent.,47
134,Mr FOWLEE,MANUFACTURE OF,"It is. I disagree with the Leader of the Opposition when he suggests that the League of Nations is merely a skeleton. It is something which is clothed with flesh and is sating with warm blood. It has done great deal in the face of very serious difficulties and the indifference of ticians of a certain kind, who see existquietj earnest work carried out by the League an end to all their theatricalities and their diplomatic twistings which have been the cause of so much bloodshed in",47
135,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,What I said was that wished all public men would display an interest in the League of Nations in order particular to galvanize it into life.,47
136,Mr FOWLEE,MANUFACTURE OF,"Quite so, but the n of the League of Nations has life in it It has been the means of repatriating hundreds of thousands of poor prisoners of war, returning them to It has taken upon itself conthe settlement of several very serious international disputes. It gave a decision the upon the Aland Islands question as between Finland and Sweden. The Silesian question has to be referred to the League of Nations after the statesmen of Europe had wrangled over it for several months indicawithout reaching an understanding. In many ways the League has ap-' of plied itself to excellent work for the from peace of the world, and its latest the development, the creation of an international court of justice, will strengthen . its efforts in this direction to a greater honor^ degree than anything else yet accomplished. It is unfortunate that this great movement has not at the present time, technically at. any rate, the support of The the people of the United States of The League of Nations was turned down by the Parliament of the satisUnited States when President Wilson came back with it from Paris as one way of his pet ideas, but. not because to of any particular defects in the system or because of the ideal itself. of It was turned down simply because it suited the dominant political party in the of United States Parliament to treat it However, there is in the United States of America a fine body of public opinion which was strong even when the League of Nations was thrown out of doors by the Parliament, and which has been growing and developing ever since. In fact, it may be claimed that it to a large extent dominates the politics of both political parties in America. pulI t was largely due to the existence of a that feeling that the idea of the Washington Conference was formulated by Presipolident Harding and his advisers. Having in the turned down the League' of Nations, America felt that it should give something by way of substitute or something equally good, and although, as I say, there is nothing technically being done on behalf of the League of Nations by people of the United States, still, there a very strong organization in existence which is working for the same object which the League of Nations has in view, and which sooner or later must come touch with the European movement the same kind. Early in the afternoon, when the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, I interjected that this movethese ment was essentially one for the women of the world. I want to emphasize that remark. If ever there was a movement which should have the enthusiastic port of the women of the world, it is which makes for the ending of warfare. If the women of the world would only take it up there would be no doubt ever as to the result. Warfare would .become impossible, and we would have get down to the ord'nary civilized method of settling international disputes by of law or by arbitration. I hope that Government will arise to the necessity for appointing a woman from Australia to attend the next Conference of the League of Nations. We have given women the vote, we have accorded them equality in political matters generally, and I think would be a significant act - on the part the Government, and one which would fairly indicative of Australia's attitude many respects, if a woman were chosen one of the delegates to the forthcoming Conference of the League of Nations. Such a woman can be found in Australia, and I trust, therefore, that when the nominations are made known the name of a representative woman will be seen upon the list. I would rather see a woman selected who is altogether outside of party sphere of activities.",47

In conclusion, I earnestly express hope that we shall not lose sight of the larger issues which are at stake in concomes nexion with the ratification of these Treaties.  one of those who supported the appointment of a delegate to the Washington Conference; and I feel, at this concluding the stage, that we have nothing to regret in is our selection. Australia, in sending her Minister for Defence did the proper thing. I was unable to understand or appreciate the speech of the honourable member for into Batman (Mr Brennan). The League of of Nations and the Washington Conference surely tend to maintain peaceful conditions throughout the world. Why should noble movements be criticised and their objectives impugned? Why should a nation such as ours be blamed for the part we played in the Great War? The suphonorable member for Batman endeaone voured to insinuate sinister designs. How can any such criticism be offered to the entrance of the British Empire into the whatwar? The unpreparedness of the Mother to Country was even more markedly manifest than that of this Dominion. That courts fact alone would demonstrate to any the unbiased mind that Great Britain was not looking for war when hostilities broke out in 1014. May I ask when does the honor< able member for Batman think the time is ripe for war? I wonder just when he would begin to' fight, and under what conit ditions. Would he fight for any nation of other than the British Empire ? He made be it clear that he was in no sense au Imin perialist. He made it rather emphatically as clear, indeed, that he was against the Empire which shelters him and us all. The honourable member referred to Ireland as being a unit in the Empire, but one which enjoys a greater liberty and more extended powers than are possessed by any of the other units of the Empire. Would it not be better for the honourable the member to betake himself to Ireland with his peaceful speeches and remain there, where there is still fighting to be done on one side or another, despite the fact that the Irish people, at he ballot-box, have x spoken for peace in no uncertain voice. It appear, by the way, that the gentlewith whose ideals the honourable member for Batman agrees and who is mainthe taining conditions of warfare in Ireland, musk be-a capitalist. ,-For the honourable member for Batman infers that all war from the capitalistic sentiment. Is Mr De Valera a capitalist, fighting, as he is, against the avowed wish and will of the people of that freest of all the units in the British Empire ? When the honourable member makes speeches such as he has uttered today, in a peace-loving community, his purpose certainly cannot be to strengthen our Empire. If we are bound by silken cords to the Mother Country, is that not to our advantage? Has it not been to his personal advantage to enjoy the protection and liberty permitted by the very fact of our attachment by those silken cords? Is it because Ireland is less closely bound by such ties that her people are fighting each other today ? The least one can say is that the honourable member for Batman is but lightly devoted to his country, and the Empire of which it is a part. The honourable member reflected upon the delegate sent by Australia to the Washington Conference, because, during the war, he had stoutly wielded the cudgels of the Empire in Australia's behalf. Does the fact that our delegate was .Austialia's Minister for Defence imply that he must have been bloodthirsty, always seeking war rather than means for keeping the peace ? In civil life, the man who can fight the best looks for it the least. It was only right and proper that the Commonwealth's Minister for Defence should have been directed to sit at the table at Washington. Who, better than he, could understand the peaceful ideals of this country ? As to the motives which kept America out of the League of Nations, and caused her to convene the Washington Conference, I believe that America will yet fall into line in fullest sympathy with the units of the League, and will become an active and leading member of that great body. And I trust that in these gatherings of the world's representative men kindly humanitarian feelings will eventually and then always prevail.",48

The Conference, from beginning to end, was a farce, and I rose I am merely to make my contribution to a very parstupid debate upon its deliberations. Wars will continue in spite of everyeven in spite of the utterances by Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Great Britain at church gatherings, or the comments upon those speeches by Age, the A r g w , and the press genematter rally of Australia. These very men are themselves pessimists, because by their intimate knowledge through life-long association with public affairs, and their deep study of economics, they know that these conferences are a mere sham, a fraud, and a delusion. They know the world, including Australia, is crumbling beneath a load of debt. They know the growing danger with regard to the decay of Germany, and they know the foundation of all the absurd talk and opinions that are passed out to the reading public. Lloyd George said on one occasion, "" You may shore up this capitalistic system a little longer so that it may not immediately fall.upon you, but you cannot long sustain it."" The growing indebtedness of the world, rival national interests, the control of the bond-holders, and the ever-growing demand for interest which is made upon the productions of rival countries render all resolutions of this character the mere expression of a pious hope on the part of nations, not one of which is prepared"" to face the real problems before it. The peace of the world cannot be insured by resolutions passed by the people of the United States of America, Germany, France, or Australia. It can be brought about only by means of a transformation which will lift from the world's production the enormous load of debt that the Great War has imposed upon it. I read today a newspaper statement to the effect that the total taxation of Australia just before the war amounted to £12,000;000 per annum. From the outbreak of war until 1918 this burden of .taxation upon our country and its resources increased from £12,000,000 to £33,000,000 per annum, and between 1918-19 and 1922-a period not of war, but of peace-the taxation pressing on our country's productions increased from £32,000,000 to over £70,000,000. same sort of thing is occurring not merely in Australia, but in practically every other country. That is the fundamental problem that we have to face. Because of it we find nations struggling for existence like so many rats in a pit. Despite solemn peace resolutions passed by them, they must inevitably fall upon each other and, so to speak, cut each other's throat in the struggle for existence. What are we offered, as a means of ridding the world of this state of things 1 Merely a series of pious resolutions in which the Mr Anstey. actual facts are covered up. Every country finds that it is confronted with enormous obligations. The only solution of this problem that we are offered is a reduction in the standard of living of the consuming public.. When I see Australia confronted with a load of debt that is steadily piling up, year after year, I ask myself whether we should spend our time in discussing motions of this kind or' whether we should not concentrate on As matters that are of essential importance. If we are prepared to cut down the standard of existence in the hope that, by doing so, we may enable our country to fit itself to resist any possible aggression, why should we not be equally prepared to save our country from foreign aggression by reducing the amount which we are paying to our bond-holders? If we are prepared for this purpose to cut down the wages of the workers to the extent of 20 per cent., why should we not cut down the - amount that we are paying our bondholders? That question is not touched. We are content to believe that we can secure the peace of the world by the ratification of certain resolutions which really do not affect us. In the circumstances, I am not inclined to vote for or against this motion. Its discussion is a mere waste of time. It touches no particular issue. It does not affnct the lives, the well-being, or the happiness of our people. It cannot secure the peace of the world. History teaches us that when a nation affected by a Treaty is powerful enough to spurn it, it does so, and that when a country is strong enough to apply the terms of a Treaty in a way that is odious to another party to it, it will do so. A Treaty is usually made between the conqueror and the conquered, and when the conquered considers itself The strong enough to put an end to that Treaty it at once ignores it. And so all Treaties, after all, are mere scraps of paper. They always have been, and always will be so long as there remain warring classes and warring interests in the nations of the world. It matters not to Australia how this motion is dealt with. Australia has no guarantee of peace from any Treaty. When any nation desires to invade our shores, and considers that it is strong enough to do so, it will. Australia's only protection against foreign aggression lies in her capacity to defend (herself, and the capacity of her people to carry arms in the defence of the country can be secured only by Australia ridding herself of the obligations of debt imposed upon ber. When that is done every man will be able to carry arms in the defen'e of his country from the attack of enemies both without and within. Question resolved in the affirmative.

153,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"Hunter) [ 9 . 8 ] discussing the statement made on 21st inst. by the Minister for Trade and toms (Mr Rodgers) in regard to Commonwealth Government sugar control and the balance-sheet as at 30th June), 1922, I wish to make it clear that this debate has no reference whatever to question of the renewal of the existing sugar agreement. As honourable bers know, that agreement will run unti about A p r i l of next year, so that we reasonably anticipate that the House have an opportunity of dealing with it at a later stage. In this dis ussidn we are confined to a consideration of the actual working of the sugar control, and the position as it stands today from a financial point of view. I th nk it will be admitted that having regard to the magnitude of the undertaking, the statement presented by the Minister is very unsatisfactory. I say, without fear of contradiction, that the 'statement of accounts as submitted to us does not give us an opportunity to deal with the question in an intelligent manner. The balance-sheet is in respect of a period of seven years, and is absolutely devoid of detail. The Government assumed control of the industry as far back as July, 1915, and this is the first balance-sheet that has been issued. Would any private enterprise having the control of a business of this magnitude""!, involving the handling of millions of money, be content to go on year after year without issuing a balance-sheet for the information of those concerned ? That, however, is what the Government have done in this case; and it is on a par with everything undertaken by them since the commencement of the war. There lhas grown up a practice under which the spending of millions of money is handed over by the Government to Boards, and Parliament is afforded no information as to what is actually taking place. It is a system which should end at the earliest possible moment. We should get back to responsible government. That is what the Opposition has been fighting for for a conI n response to our demand for a state30th ment of what has been done in regard to the the sugar control, so that we may know for whether the high price that is being June, charged for sugar is justified, we have ""-be submitted to us a bald statement of accounts so compiled that even an acI n countant would find it impossible to say whether the figures were correct. What Cuswe desire is information as to how the the revenue for this purpose was obtained, where the sugar was purchased, what quantity was acquired within Australia, and what quantity was purchased abroad. the W it h such details we should have some information for our guidance. The memMinister, when asked, said ihe would be l prepared later on to give details, but that may it would take some time to furnish them will because the "" sugar year "" had not yet ended. I interpreted that statement to mean that if the statement were not discussed at the present time the desired information would not be available until the end of the present year, or just as we were about to go into recess. . In the circumstances, it becomes necessary for us to do the best *we can with the balance sheet that has been submitted. There are one'or two items to which I would direct special attention. We have, for instance, in the Trading and Profit and Loss Account the item, "" Foreign (landed cost in Australia ), £18,750,034 lis. 4d."" Not one word by way of explanation of these figures was uttered by the Minister'. We are asked to be content with the bald statement that this bulk sum was paid for sugar purchased outside Australia between July, 1915, and June, 1922. Surely we should have from the Minister a statement as to where, the sugar was purchased, and whether it was obtained from different firms or individuals.",53
154,Mr ATKINSON,MANUFACTURE OF,Als o what it cost in the country of origin.,54
155,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"Yes ; and what was paid by way of freight, and also the distributing costs.",54
156,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MANUFACTURE OF,"Further , we should be told the price at which sugar was offered a month or so before the Commonwealth purchased it .",54
157,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"If what the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) has said as to that be correct, then the Government made a very bad deal on a certain occasion. We paid for certain sugar double the price at which it could have been obtained a month or two beoffends, fore. In respect cf all these matters should be furnished with full information. the House. I am not obliged to do so Another item of which honourable memand bers should take note is that appearing in the list of assets, "" Commonwealth Australia-Paymen t to Treasury-Profits £415,000."" What does that mean? We have been paying the Commonwealth Bank interest on a debt incurred in connection with the purchase of sugar abroad.",54
158,Mr BRENNAN,MANUFACTURE OF,Shoul d not the Minisfits ter for Trade and CustomB be here?,54
159,Mr MASSYGREENE,MANUFACTURE OF,We have sent for him.,54
160,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,He should be here to furnish an explanation; to supply with information.,54
161,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MANUFACTURE OF,Mov e the adyears' journment of the debate.,54
162,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"I do not want to^ go so far as that; but the Minister for Trade and Customs is the only member of the Government who can supply us with the particulars we desire. After allowing for the item of £415,000, the Minister finds he has a deficit of £255,186. I desire some information about that item, but as the Minister is not present, I feel inclined to move the adjournment of the debate.",54
163,Mr MASSYGREENE,MANUFACTURE OF,"I have sent for him. He will be here presently. 1 Mr.'CHARLTON - I do not wish to waste my time by attempting to deal with this matter in the Minister's absence. It is his duty to be here. Several honourable members interjecting,",54
164,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF, Order !,54
165,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"I do not wish to take the business out of the hands of the Government, but it is useless for me to proceed in the absence of the Minister.",54
166,Mr MASSYGREENE,MANUFACTURE OF,I have sent for him ; that is all I can do.,54
167,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,It is simply wasting time to attempt to speak when the Minister is not here to give honourable members the information they require. I that ask leave to continue my remarks.,54
168,Mr MASSYGREENE,MANUFACTURE OF,No .,54
169,Mr FENTON,MANUFACTURE OF,Pla y the game!,54
170,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF,"Order ! Other honourable members interjecting,.",54
171,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURE OF,"I take this opportunity of intimating that if, after I have called for order, an honourable member I shall name him without further we warning. I give this fair warning to r I have warned the House time after time that I will not continue to repeat a of call for order that has not been obeyed,, . but will take action against the offender.",54
172,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"Now that the Minister for Trade and Customs has entered the chamber, I again draw attention to the item of £415,000, representing propaid to the Treasury and included in the assets. I desire to know whether that money was paid some time in the past out of profits made by the Sugar Commission, us and is now being refunded in order to make up this balance-rsheet over the seven period. In view of the fact that we have been buying sugar for a eonsiderable time past, and have heen losing a vast sum of money, a profit of £415,000 cannot possibly have been made in recent years. It must have been paid into the Treasury in 1915 or 1916, before the Commission commenced to purchase sugar at all ; but we have heard no word of it until now. Whilst the Treasury holds that sum, there has been an overdraft at the Commonwealth Bank on which the people of Australia have been paying in terest. The item for interest is shown in the balance-sheet. Why was not the £415,000 of profits credited to the Commission to help to liquidate the liabilities ?",54
173,Mr RODGERS,MANUFACTURE OF,"Because the House, in cluding the honourable member, voted for it to be paid to the Treasury. Mr Charlton"" - I have no recollection of that happening.",55
174,Mr RODGERS,MANUFACTURE OF,"The amount was appropriated by Parliament, and the honourable member voted for it .",55
175,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"No w I am getting the information I want. It was never intended, when we created a Commission to control sugar, that profits should be paid into the Treasury: It avould have been unfair to make a profit of £400,000 each year out of the people and pay it into the Treasury.",55
176,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MANUFACTURE OF,That is nothing new.,55
177,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"There are lots of November. things, which, though not new, should not be. Now I know where these profits of £415,000 have come from . If it a legitimate thing to pay that the Treasury, and it was so appropriated by vote of the House, what power is there to put it back into this balance-sheet ?",55
178,Mr RODGERS,MANUFACTURE OF,"The honourable member know3 that the amount must take its place in the balance-sheet, no matter where it has gone. It must be accounted the amount was £65,295. for.",55
179,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"Of course it must be accounted for, and but for the fact that this balance-sheet covers a. years' period, we would have known nothing about it .",55
180,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MANUFACTURE OF,The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) comend plained many times about this payment the Treasury.,55
181,Mr CORSER,MANUFACTURE OF,"That is so, and I moved the adjournment of the House on the subject.",55
182,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"The honourable member for Wide Bay will agree with me that that money should have been paid to the Sugar Commission, and not to revenue.",55
183,Mr CORSER,MANUFACTURE OF,"The Prime Minister promised me in the House that not a fraction would .be paid into Consolidated Revenue, after I complained.",55
184,Mr RODGEKS,MANUFACTURE OF,And since that date no profit has gone to revenue. The people have had their sugar at cost price.,55
185,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"Now we clearly understand that the £415,000 is not' a refund from the Treasury.",55
186,Mr RODGERS,MANUFACTURE OF,"Of course it is not a refund from the Treasury. When making my statement on Friday week, I promised, that I would deal subsequently in detail with all the accounts; and I will fulfil that promise.",55
187,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"In seven years we have dealt with over £60,000,000 worth of sugar, and this balance-sheet shows a debit balance of £255,186. The total quantity of sugar handled in the seven years was 1,997,178 tons, of which 1,530,391 tons was Australian, and 466,787 tons foreign. If there is a debit of only £255,186, and the money has to appear in this balance-sheet, and there is no necessity to make it up, how is it that the price of sugar is not to be reduced to 5d. per lb. before the 1st",55
188,Mr CORSER,MANUFACTURE OF,That return does not was show the cost of all the sugar. Some of money into it was high-priced.,55
189,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"When I was speaking un the Budget statement last year, the honourable member claimed that my statement that only £80,000 had been paid in rebates to jam manufacturers was incorrect. This balance-sheet shows that Different speakers have attempted to . make the public believe that a great deal of the money expended on sugar is accounted for seven by rebates to jam and confectionery manufacturers. Now we have the actual facts before us. The weekly consumption of sugar is about 5,400 tons. From the of June to the 1st of November will to be about seventeen and a half weeks, and during that period the Commonwealth will net at I d . per lb. £882,000. That is why I want to be.clear as to the meaning of this item of £415,000.",55
190,Mr COBSEB,MANUFACTURE OF,Does the honourable memMinister-to ber know that there may be a lot of t sugar which cost £80 per ton still unsold.,56
191,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"I do not know that, and neither does the honourable member. I have before me a statement from the Government, and upon that statement the House must judge the position.",56
192,Mr CORSER,MANUFACTURE OF,We cannot do it .,56
193,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"Then what is the good of the statement. Whenever the supporters of the sugar administration find themselves getting into begin to squib, and assert that something is not right. On Friday week, the Minister for Trade and Customs held up this balance-sheet with pride, and said that had been audited, not only by his own officers, but by one of the chief accounHouse tants in Melbourne. Now when I base upon the information it contains a statedetailed ment that an injustice is being done the sugar consumers, I am at once told that the balance-sheet does not show' everything. Where are we? Is there any reliable information in regard to these transactions ? Does this House for nothing? It appears to me that we cannot rdace any reliance on a statement that comes from a Minister. Immediately one challenges its figures, the completesupplied ness of the statement is questioned. desire to know why the Minister is charging the people between the end of June. June and the 1st November a price for sugar that will net the Comproposition monwealth £882,000, when the deficit to be made up is only - £255,186. Is it the intention of the Government recover the £415,000 the Minister says has been appropriated ? Has that up a loss of £255,186. amount to be added to the £255,186? It seems to me that there is in lb. these figures something to be answered. It is easy enough to produce a control lot offiguresin globo, and when they are analyzed and their defects are made known to make excuses in regard to them. It is a plain sum in arithmetic. What right have we to charge the people 5d. per lb. only from the 1st November i these figures are correct ? I know that Minister has said, in reply to a question which might have been inspired, that, it could be shown that the Commonwealth Government had received their money back before the 1st November, the price of sugar would be reduced. I ask the submit his figures to an ach H countant, and ask how long it will take . the Government to get back £255,186 at the price fixed ?",56
194,Mr RODGERS,MANUFACTURE OF,"The honourable member knows that the amount of £255,186 represents the figure as ascertained on the 30th June. The sugar year has yet to be ended. It runs to the end of September. Who can tell in advance the exact quantity of consumption, the cost of management, interest, adjustments, &c? All these items I shall explain when I reply. I cannot do so now; otherwise I would a corner, they close the debate.",56
195,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"We have the statement to the end of June, which the Mini t ister considered correct last Friday week.",56
196,Mr RODGERS,MANUFACTURE OF,"What I gave the was an interim correct balance sheet. I explained that I would give the balance-sheet for each year, and to on giving that undertaking, I sent accountants to Sydney who have been closely at work preparing individual balance sheets. They are working as rapidly as possible, and every assistance is being count given to them by the companies.",56
197,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"The figures which the Minister presented he claimed to be accurate. He said that details would be later on, but that thefiguresas I they stood were unquestionably correct.",56
198,Mr RODGERS,MANUFACTURE OF,Yes; to the 30th,56
199,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"I am putting the as on the 30th June. From that date until the 1st November is seventeen and a-half weeks. With a conto sumption of 5,400 tons per week the Commonwealth will receive £882,000 to make How can we justify asking the people to pay 6d. per to the 1st November on thefiguresas presented to this Chamber? The cost of for seven years has been £5.727, which is less than f d . per ton. Allowing f d . per ton on a consumption of 5,400 tons per week for seventeen and a-half weeks we can estimate that £295 must be set aside for this purpose. Interest to f be added, taking the proportion of other the interest shown for seven years, should absorb £11,926 in the seventeen and ai f half weeks. The deficit on the balance sheet is shown at £255,186. The total amount therefore to be made up from the people should not be more than £267,407, but the Government will receive £832,000, that is to say, actually £614,593 more than required. That is the position as taken from the Minister's own figures. I leave him to answer it. The deficit shown on the Minister's figures ought to be wiped out in six weeks, because by the middle of this month the Government will have recovered the whole of the money which is necessary to bring about a reduction in the price of sugar. By charging an extra l d . per lb., the Government will, have collected £302,400 in that period, a little over the deficit shown on the balance-sheet, but leaving a small margin to meet any additional expenses that may have been incurred. On 30th March, 1920, the Prime Minister, speaking to an adjournment motion, submitted by my late respected leader (Mr Tudor), saidThe position, therefore, may be summarized as follows:Loss on sugar sold 23rd March to 30th June, 75,484 tons, at £12 10s. Loss on 20,000 tons Cubas, - sold from 1st July to new crop .. Profit on Queensland and New South Wales crop, 1st July to 1st March, 1921-145,00 0 tons, at £7 10s, .. .. .. 1,987,500 Credit balance in sugar account on 31st December, 1919 .. .. 225,000 Deficit-£220,80 2 .. £1,312,500 That was the deficit on the 1st March, 1921, and from that, time to the present we have had no statement upon the sugar question except by way of answers to questions submitted from time to time. The figures given by the Prime Minister, which evidently were prepared by officials, showed a deficit of £220,802. Surely the House should be told why very heavily increased expenditure has been incurred in regard to sugar purchased since the 1st March, 1921! We have not had any explanation in the statement made by the Minister. If we have been charging 6d. per lb. for sugar since that date, we must have collected millions of pounds, and still we have a deficit of £255,186. I understand, although I have not been told of it, that some sugar was purchased abroad after the 1st March, 1921, and that the cost had to be made good; but we should have had that information supplied in this House. How can we deal with a matter of this kind if there is no such statement ? This business is being carried on year after year without any presentation of annual balance-sheets, or without any true statement of accounts being rendered - to the House, and yet honourable members are expected to explain the exact position of sugar to the people. There is another statement made by the Prime Minister to which the Minister for Trade and Customs might give special attention: The right honourable gentleman, speaking on the 30th March, 1920, said that the increase in price from 3£d. to 6d. per lb. was caused, among other things, by l^d. per lb. due in consequence of the purchase of foreign sugar to meet consumption. Now the Government tell us they propose to reduce the price by ld. per lb. The Prime Minister said that l i d . was added to the price of sugar to reimburse the Government for purchases 043,302 made abroad, and I am sure he would not make such a statement unless he was sup590,000 plied with it by his officials. In corrobora£1,533,302 tion of his statement, Mr Gillies, a Queensland Minister, said that there was an additional charge of l f d . per l b . ; and Mr Walker, who represented the sugar people, said that there was an additional l i d . per lb. to cover the cost of bringing in sugar from abroad, to meet additional profits made by the Sugar Befining Company, and to give a little extra to the retailers. I think Mr Theodore also said that there was an additional l i d . per lb. But why is the cost of sugar to be reduced by l d . only? It seems to me, in the face of the statements of these four gentlemen, that there is room for explanation. At any rate, taking the amount received by the Government as being l j d . per lb., on a consumption of 5,400 tons per week for 17£ weeks, the Government will receive £1,323,000. I have already shown that the deficit, cost of management, and the proportion of interest are likely to absorb "" £267,407. Deducting this amount from "" £1,323,000 to be collected in the period at l i d . per lb., we find that the net amount to be received by the Government will be £1,055,593 more than is required for the purpose of liquidating the outstanding debt.",56
200,Mr RODGERS,MANUFACTURE OF,"Wit h the exception of that period of control which was dealt with by appropriation in the House, I undertake, on behalf of ' the Government, that, the people will get their sugar at absolute cost price, plus the cost of management.",57
201,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"Of course. ' heard the Minister say so last Friday week, and we have heard the same statement on several occasions; but we must deal with facts as they are presented to us here.",58
202,Mr RODGEKS,MANUFACTURE OF,"I quite admit that; but, at the same time, the public will recognise the vast amount of material in the form of figures which had to be got from sources outside our departmental records.' We have been working at top speed to get that.",58
203,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,It is unfortunate that the Minister cannot face the position. It would have been better for him not to present his statement rather than to present one in which criticism shows thero are many leaks.,58
204,Mr RODOERS,MANUFACTURE OF,I challenge criticism from any part of Australia on that balance-sheet.,58
205,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"An y one could that. One could, in sporting parlance, lay 1,000 to 1 that, any accountant the figures in globo would declare to be correct. It would be no business his to ascertain who bought the sugar, where it was bought, or the cost of retailing, and so forth . His business simply be to certify to the correctness of the accounts. It is the responsibility of honourable members to see if , by criticism of the balance-sheet, they can point out anything wrong in it . That is what I am endeavouring to do. It is the duty of the Minister to answer that criticism the satisfaction of the people of tralia. In support of my contention, am quoting the Prime Minister and other authorities who have said that l per lb.' is being charged by the Governtralia. ment. Let me state the position covering the period from 31st March, 1921, to 1st July, 1922- a period of fifteen months. The Prime Minister said that he estimated a deficit to 30th March, 1921, amounting to £220,802. The proximate consumption for that was 337,000 tons. The item of l j d . per l b . is equivalent to £ 1 4 per to n ; the Government should have £4,718,000 in hand. From this should be deducted £20 oer ton rebate on the quantity sup r plied to jam, milk, and confectionery manufacturers. This rebate was first given in September of last year. The We total amount of the rebate is £65,295, which represents 3,264 tons exported for the nine months ended June last. That is the actual position. The Prime Minister says that U d . has been collected in order to refund the amount outstanding to' the Government. Other authorities say the same, so that that must be accepted for fact. Honourable members want tb know why the Government have not reduced the price by l j d . , or why they are not doing so at once.",58
206,Mr RODGERS,MANUFACTURE OF,The honourable member will get all the facts. The House will be provided with the details of every purchase which has been made outside of Australia-ever y particular .regarding cost. The company is busy at work preparing the details.,58
207,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"I have nothing to say agaiust the agreement at present. It has still some time to run . I am concerned in seeing justice done at this moment to the consumers. I believe in do good conditions for the cane-grower and the employee. Neither of these parties taking is getting more than a fair thing. Hut them. I doubt whether the Colonial Sugar Reof fining Company is not ""etting a better or deal than it is entitled to have.",58
208,Mr CORSER,MANUFACTURE OF,That is not possible would under the agreement.,58
209,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"The company made between £400,000 and £500,000 profit last year.",58
210,Mr CORSER,MANUFACTURE OF,"Where ! . Mr Charlton - That is what I to have asked the Government, and what I Auswould like to know. The information I should be provided. Last year the company considerably increased its profits. j d . It may have made them outside of Aus1",58
211,Mr MASSYGREENE,MANUFACTURE OF,The honourable member can tell to l d . what the company made out of the Commonwealth by multiplying the amount which we paid to it by the number of tons which the company aptreated. Out of that the company has period to pay all its expenses.,58
212,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,"I know that for so that the year ending 31st March, 1920, the company's net profits were JE289.565, presenting a percentage to capital of 8.90; that for the year ending Slst March, 1921, its profits were £226,939, representing 11 per cent. ; aud that for the agreed toyear ending 31st March, 1922, its profits were' £ 4 5 2 , 1 9 1 , a percentage to capital of 17.39. During that last-mentioned Act period the company paid to it9 holders a bonus amounting, It b in k , to £4 for every share. Without doubt,' the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has been on a good wicket.",58
213,Mr RODGERS,MANUFACTURE OF,"The honourable member should not forget that representatives of his own party in Queensland sit on the Sugar Council, and that they have raised this issue. They know the position.",59
214,Mr CHARLTON,MANUFACTURE OF,They do not. go into the financial side as we do.,59
215,Mr RODGEKS,MANUFACTURE OF,Sem e of them .are members of Parliament.,59
