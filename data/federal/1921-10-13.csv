VOCATIONAL TRAINEES. Mr MoGRATH -'Will the. Assistant Minister for Repatriation see that the fullest inquiry is made before vocational trainees are transferred to Melbourne from Ballarat, Maryborough, and other inland cities of Victoria?",19
3,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Yes . As the honourable member knows, I interested myself in a former proposed removal of vocational trainees from Ballarat, with the result that it was avoided. It is my opinion that before such removals take 'place, it would be wise for the authorities to consult those who are in charge of the training institutions in the country districts. WAR SERVICE HMS.",19
4,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"I wish to know how the money for War Service Homes for the current financial year will be allotted, and when applicants will know how their applications will be dealt with ?",19
5,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"The money appropriated for this financial year will, so far as possible, be allotted to the States on an enlistment basis. But as that basis Coogee, Sydney, may not have been adopted for prior al8th October, 1921. locations, inequalities will be made good. It is proposed to divide the building programme into two sections-the country most construction and the metropolitan construction, and to determine an order of priority in each, so that the great number of metropolitan - applicants shall not absorb the money' needed for courrtry expenditure. A Board will be appointed to revise the applications which have., been received to date, and these wil l be classified. Each soldier will be allotted his priority number, and will then have a fair idea of when his home will be built. AUSTRALIAN' NAVY.",19

8,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"A statement appears in this morning's newspapers which indicates that it is intended to appoint a Board of Management to assist in controlling the Commonwealth Line of Steaao-Bhip's. Will the Prime Minister, before authorizing any such change . in the management of thy line, give the House an opportunity to consider the alteration of what, appears to be its .present policy in regard to ocean rates of freight, namely, the adoption of rates in accordance with those fixed by the outside shipping ring, the effect of which has boen to crush. Australia with the burden of charges on t e r exports, and to keep 10,000,000 tons of shipping' idle in the ports of the world?",20

16,Mr RODGERS,MOUNT MULLIGAN COLLIERY,"I made a statement has to the House some time ago in the honexisting orable member's absence, but, in fairness consideration. to the honourable member who waited on me with a deputation some time ago, I can inform him that no excess cost will be charged in the case of individual applications for the building of homes within the limit fixed by the Act, and that a Board is investigating every case where the individual undertook to pay tion, upon noticemore than that fixed limit.

18,Dr MALONEY,BRITISHIMPERI AL OIL,"the Treasurer. upon notice I. Have the Government any reason to believe that the British Imperial Oil Company Limited is a branch of a Combine with headquarters outside Australia? 2. Is it a fact that the'Treasurer and officers of the Treasury Department, and the Solicitor General's Department, have been furnished with information alleging that the British Imperial Oil Company Limited has evaded paying a proper share of taxation - on its Australian operations, and that over Â£3,000,000 has heen lost to the revenue in consequence 1 3. Do the Government contemplate instituting a test case with a view to recovering this amount, or a portion of it, from the British Imperial Oil Company Limited. If not, why not?",21
19,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BRITISHIMPERI AL OIL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. According to the Beport of the Interstate Commission on Prices Investigation (No. 6), the British Imperial Oil Company is a subsidiary company of a group with headquarters outside Australia. 2. Allegations of this nature have heen made. 3. No. The Crown Law Department having advised that-the basis on which the company - been taxed is the correct one under the law.

23,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"The position is that the provisions of the Navigation Act, and of the - Regulations relating to wireless telegraphy installations on ships, require that - foreign-going ships carrying 200 or more persons^ and which take, on board passengers in Australia, shall carry three certificated wireless operators, who are required to maintain continuous watch whilst the vessels are at sea.

25,Sir JOSEPH COOK,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are follow:1. One of the positions has been filled. 2.

In Committee (Oonsideratiou Senate's requests).",22
26,Mr WATKINS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Newcastle) '[2.48] When the Tariff was under consideration in this Committee previously I moved for increased duties on iron and steel. It was said at the time that the people engaged in the industry had not sought for increases, and it would appear that I had acted upon my own initiative, increased duties were not desired by those engaged in the industry. In justice myself and those who spoke in support of my amendment, I think I should take this opportunity of putting the true tion before the Committee. I desire to make a statement which I trust may furnish exact proof to the conclosely trary of two statements made, probably in good faith, one by the Acting Prime Minister on the 7th June, 1921, and the other by the Minister in charge of the Customs Tariff Bill in the Senate on request as submitted. 16th August, 1921, each statement in turn greatly influencing the attitude of honorenter able members and senators towards the proposed increase of duty on iron and steel. Apart altogether from the merits of the proposed increase,. I am sure that neither the right honourable the Acting Prime Minister nor the honourable the Minister in charge in another place would desire to have uncorrected a distinctly erroneous statement concerning the tude of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which is definitely All supported - by Mr Hoskins in its request for increased duties. to the turn which the discussion took in this House and another measure place, the directors of the Broken Hill as Proprietary Company Limited have asked me to place before honourable members the facts in relation to their request for inposicreased duties. In submitting data from time to time to the Minister-and much of it was submitted at his request-in addition to that supplied to his omcers in the Customs Department, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited has sought assist in the framing of a Tariff suited to the iron and steel requirements of the Commonwealth rather than to appear as advocates for a particular set of duties. It is only right, however, to state that they have submitted the duties which, in tlieir judgment and experience, are necessary if the iron and steel interests of the of Commonwealth are to be efficiently protected.",22
27,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"On a point of order, I wish to know whether we shall be entitled to make what may be'-termed second-reading speeches on the schedule containing the Senate's requests, or whether we shall be confined to a discussion of each request and that as it comes before us?",22
28,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMENT OF," The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) intimated that he desired to make a personal explanation posiwhich could be made only in Committee, since it related to a matter that arose in Committee. I am following him to see that he does not enter upon a general discussion of the Tariff. Honourable members will not be permitted to discuss the Tariff generally; the discussion will be confined to each particular",22
29,Mr WATKINS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I have no desire to upon a general discussion. I am merely making a personal explanation in order that there may be no misapprehension in regard to the action taken by those interested in the iron and steel industry when the Customs Tariff Bil l was before us. The first list of the duties to which I was referring when interrupted was furnished on the 4th June, 1919, and attihanded to the Minister for Trade and Customs, and the last on 25th May, 1921. of these were submitted before the 7 th June, 1921, when the following debate Owing took place in this House:",22
30,Mr MAHONY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,We desire that a certain of Protection shall be given to the iron industry.,22
31,Sir JOSEPH COOK,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,It has a certain measure of Protection.,23
32,Mr MAHONY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,But it has not a sufficient Protection to enable it to maintain the present standard of wages in competition with the outside world.,23
33,Sir JOSEPH COOK,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Who says thati,23
34,Mr MAHONY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I do, and so also do the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton).",23
35,Sir JOSEPH COOK,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,The Broken Hill prietary Company Limited has never said so.,23
36,Mr MAHONY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Has it not?,23
37,Sir JOSEPH COOK,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,No ; it has not made any representations to us at. all.,23
38,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I think the honourable member is now going beyond a personal explanation. I have looked through the schedule of requests made by the Senate, and find that there is one relating to the iron and steel duties. When that request conies before the Committee the honourable member will be able to deal full y with the matter he now desires to raise.",23
39,Mr WATKINS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Ver y well.,23
40,Mr MATHEWS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Melbourne Ports) [2.56] - I endeavoured to follow the t a r if f debate in another place, so that I might be full y conversant with what was done there. May I suggest to the Minister that as each request made by the Senate comes before us he should give the Committee an explanation of what actually happened with regard to it in another place?",23
41,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.57] - As we come to the items in respect of which requests have been made. we.can deal with the point which the honourable member has raised. Where it is necessary to refer to what happened in another place I shall do so; b ut otherwise we have to take the requests made by the Senate as we find them., and I presume the Committee will deal with them in its wisdom as it thinks best. I desire first of all to move That any amendment made in the schedule by tlic Committee shall have effect on and after the clay following the day the amendment is made, except where the Committee otherwise decides or the contrary intention appears.",23
42,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Will the mission of such a motion prevent a discus* sion as to the right of the Senate to make these requests ? That is a matter I desire to discuss? The CHAIRMAN .^-The honourable membea may raise that question when the requests are before the Chair. I am not yet in possession of the Minister's proposal.,23
43,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"We are now dealing with the clauses of the Customs Tariff Bill itself, and 'as I cannot move a separate resolution I have to submit this proposal as an amendment of the Bill . The object of it is to avoid having to move in Proconnexion with every amendment made the addition of the words "" And on and after,"" &6. In this way we shall save a greab deal of trouble. It is a purely formal matter. Motion agreed to. Clause 12 (Repeal of Acts). Senate's Bequest"" - Leave out the clause and insert the following new clause:""12. (1) The undermentioned Acts are '- hereby repealed, as from the time when this Act is deemed to have come into operation, namely:Customs Tariff 1908 (No. 7 of 1908). Customs Tariff Amendment 1908 (No. 13 .of 1008). Customs Tariff 1910 (No. 39 of 1910). Customs Tariff 1911 (No. 19 of 19H). (2) The Customs Tarifr Validation Act 1917 (No. 6 of 1917) and the Customs Tariff Validation Act 1919 (No. 17 of 1919) shall cease, as from the time when this Act is deemed to have come into operation, to apply to the demanding and collection of duties of Customs pursuant .to any Tariff proposals other than the proposals relating to.the Tariff on goods imported from, and the produce or manufacture of, the Union of South Africa. (3) The Customs Tariff (South African Preference) 1906 (No. 17 of 1906), the Customs Tariff Validation Act 1917 (No. 6 of 1917), and the Customs Tariff Validation Act 1919 (No. 17 of 1919) are hereby repealed as from the date of assent to this Act.""",23
44,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.59] - I move That the requested amendment be made. I am going .to ask the Committee to accept this and the following two requests made by the Senate. The reason for them is that owing to an error in drafting it was found that the South African Preference Tariff would cease from the date of the introduction of this Tariff, namely, 25th March, 1920. That was not our in sub- tention; our intention was to cancel the South African Preference Tariff as from the date on which.this Bill was assented to. The two following requests were made by the Senate, at the instance of the Government, in order to get over the drafting error. .",23
45,Mr FOLEY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I scarcely know on what I am called upon to vote, and I should like some explanation from the Minister. I have just now received my copy of the requests made by the Senate.",24
46,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"It is a purely drafting amendment. If the Bill were passed as it now stands, without the Senate's requests being acceded to, the only effect would be that we would have over-collected in some cases under the South African Tariff, and under-collected in others. The intention was that the South African reciprocal Tariff should come to an end with the .assent to this Bill ; and as the B i ll is now drawn, that Tariff will come to an end as from the date the Bill was introduced.",24
47,Sir ROBERT BEST,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,We are not dealing with the schedule.,24
48,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,No . We are dealing namely:with the machinery portion of the measure.,24
49,Mr CHARLTON,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I agree with the explanation made by the Minister, but I suggest that it would expedite business if we dealt with the three amendments at once.",24
50,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I scarcely follow the honourable member. We propose to take each request of the - Senate in regard to these clauses of the Bill. If the Senate's request in regard to clause 12 be agreed to, it will cover the whole of the amendAct, ments as set out in clause 12.",24
51,Mr CHARLTON,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"The Minister given reasons for accepting the first higher amendment, but what as to the two under others?",24
52,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"They are all the same, all formal, and all made for the same reason.",24
53,Mr MATHEWS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I take it that after this Bill went to the Senate the Governr be ment desired these amendments, and that they were made at the instigationof the Government ?",24
54,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"That is correct. Motion agreed to. Clause 13 (Cessation of certain Tariff proposals). Senate's Request - Leave out'the clause and insert the following new clause:"" 13. (1) The undermentioned Tariff proposals shall be deemed to have ceased to have effect as from the time when this Act is deemed to have come into operation, namely:The Tariff proposals proposed in the House of Representatives on the following dates, namely:3rd December, 1914-(Relatin g to the Tariff on goods other than those imported from, and the produce or manufacture of, the Union of South Africa); 12th December, 1914; Oth June, 1915; 12th November, 1915; 10th August, 1917; 26th September, 1917; and 25th September, 1918-(Relatin g to the Tariff on goods other than those imported from, and the produce or manufacture of, the Union of South Africa).

55,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Illawarra) ![3.6] - I desire to raise the question of the general right of the Senate to interfere in the wholesale way it has done with a purely financial measure. This question has been debated in this chamber before, but in view of the early meeting of the Convention for the purpose of revising the Constitution, I think it should be raised again. This interference of the Senate with the financial legislation of the House of Representatives cannot be justified if the Senate is to be regarded as a States House guarding the rights of the States, unless behind each of these requested amendments there is some indication that the rights of a particular State are infringed. To admit that the Senate, based on the most unequal suffrage - a Chamber in which the elector of one State has many times the powerof the elector of another State",25
56,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMENT OF, Is the honourable member raising a question of order?,25
57,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,No ; I am raising the question of the general right - of the Senate to interfere with the financial policy of the Government.,25
58,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"That is not a matter that is before the Chair, though the honourable member may raise it if he ^chooses.",25
59,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I do not wish to raise it for the purpose of getting a ruling, from the Chair.",25
60,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"If that is so, I am afraid the honourable member must confine himself to the question before the Chair-to this particular amendhient.",25
61,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Then I desire to question the right of the Senate, as the custodian of States rights under ""the Constitution, to interfere with the rates of duties that shall be placed on ales, beers, and spirits. By no stretch of the imagination can it be held that in requesting this - amendment the Senate is doing any other than interfering with the financial policy of the Government, and with the policy as laid down by this Chamber. There is no shadow of pretence that the duty aa set out in the Tariff, as it left this Chamber, in any way interferes with the rights of a State, or is a matter for the determination of the States as States. That being so, if the Oommittee admit the right of the Senate to interfere in a financial matter, in which the rights or powers of a State are in no wise involved, we are admitting the right of the Senate to interfere with the financial policy of the Government, and are acceding to any claim that Chamber may ever have made to the supervision of our financial policy.",25
62,Mr GBEGOBT,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,What have we done about the entertainments tax?,25
63,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"We have done nothing. I strongly hold the view that the Government is the custodian of and ought to fight for the privileges which the Constitution intended to confer on this Chamber. If , on any attack, we simply accept what is done in another place, and allow the control of this Chamber over the finances to be frittered away, we give to the Senate, with its unequal constitution, powers which, in the interests of the electors who send us here, we should most jealously conserve.",25
64,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,This is only a request.,25
65,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"To which the Government have assented, and I object to the Government assenting to a request by the Senate on a matter that in no way affects the rights of any State, but is a matter of financial policy.",25
66,Mr GROOM,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"The honourable member is not raising any question as to the Senate's right to make these requests ? Mr MoWrLLiAMS - That question was settled in 1902. ' Mr HECTOR LAMOND - It was settled wrongty in"" 1902; but I do not wish at this time, when the Constitution Convention is sonear at hand, to take up the time of the Committee by further discussing the point. My only object in drawing attention to it at this time is that the question as to whether the Senate is a States House pr a branch of the Legislature having equal power with this House may be brought before the minds of those constituting the Convention. If it be accepted that the Senate has the same power as this House has to interfere with financial legislation, we must again question the constitution of that Chamber by equal State representation. If the Senate is not a States House ihe electors of Tasmania have no right to the same representation as is given to the electors of New South Wales or Victoria, and it should not be possible for eleven senators representing the smaller States to dictate the financial policy affecting four or five times as many people in other States.",25
67,Mr GROOM,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,But a proposal might have been passed in this House by an even smaller number of members.,26
68,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,That could only be because the much larger number of members who were entitled to sit in this House were not in their places. But an amendment made in another place by even the full membership may have been passed by the votes of senators representing a comparatively small proportion of the electors against the votes of senators representing a much greater number of electors. Equal' State representation in the Senate was conceded on the ground that the Senate was to be practically a States House. There was no such preposterous olaim as that the Senate should have the power to tear up a Tariff passed by this Chamber.,26
69,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"The Tariff has not been torn up half as much as it have been. - Mr HECTOR LAMOND - That is a matter of opinion; but when the priviral, 30 per cent. leges of this House are in question, differences of view in regard to the Tariff should be sunk, and the fact of the rights of the electors of this House being overruled another place in which the people are equally represented, should become the common cause of all honourable members. Because one amendment pleases me and another amendment pleases some other honourable member, that is no reason why any of us should acquiesce in an invasion of the privileges of this Chamber.",26
70,Mr BRENNAN,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Where is the invasion?,26
71,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Yes , where is the invareduction sion ? So far, the honourable member is in the schedule. only shadow-sparring.",26
72,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"The State from which the honourable member for Dampier comes is represented even in this House entirely out of proportion to its population, and has privileges that i should not have under any fair division of representation; therefore, I am not prised that the honourable member should defend Western Australia having four times the representation it should have the Senate. But I object to the Governduties ment yielding to pressure by that Chamber on a matter of financial policy.",26
73,The CHAIRMAN,LAND SETTLEMENT OF," In 1908 this point was taken in Committee, and was referred by the then Chairman (Mr MCDonald) to Mr . Speaker Holder, who gave a very extensive ruling, the effect of which was that the Senate had no power to amend a money Bill , but had the constitutional right to suggest to this House any amendments, whioh this House could accept or reject.

74,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and 'Customs) [3.18] - Honourable members will notice that the Senate is by requesting that the rates which this Comunmittee laid down as alternative shall be Â« made cumulative; that is to say, that they shall be read together, and that both of them shall operate. This is a matter to which the Department has given nareful consideration since the original duty was changed. When the item iwas ibefore the Committee on a previous occasion I moved, and the Committee assented to, a in the rates originally provided Since that time many representations have been made to us by perfumery manufacturers in Australia that the net effect of the alterations which the Committee made has been, to all intents and purposes, to wipe out the t protection of their industry. This is a very complex and difficult subject for survarious reasons, but principally because, unless these duties are read side by side with the Excise duties,' with a thorough in appreciation of the manner in which the operate, it is impossible to ascertain accurately the amount of protection given, as between the Excise duty on the spirits which the Australian manufacturer uses and the import duty which is paid hy *he importers of perfumery. There has been, side by side with the duty on perfumes and the Excise duty charged to the Australian 'manufacturer, an attempt by this Parliament to encourage the growth and development of a primary industry that is carried on in several parts of Australia, namely, the manufacture from various plants and flowers of those essential oils from . which perfumes are made. An attempt has been made by an adjustment in connection with the 'Excise duty to encourage the production of essential oils in Australia. When we were discussing the matter before, it was attempted to encourage the use of Australian essential oils by reducing still further the Excise duty to be paid on the spirit used by Australian perfumery manufacturers, if they used a certain proportion of Australian essential oils. As the Tariff was originally framed, encouragement was given in two ways to Australian manufacturers . of perfumery. The Australian manufacturers were allowed to get their spirit at a special rate of duty, and were charged duty at so much per liquid gallon instead of per proof gallon, provided that they used Australian essential oils in their perfumery. It was found in practice that the quantities of Australian essential oils obtainable were insufficient for the local industry, and that, therefore, this encouragement was of littl e advantage to it . Therefore, the manufacturers were given the advantage I have mentioned, provided that one-third of the essential oils they used were of Australian origin. As the spirit used is very much overproof, that gives an additional advantage. The Committee altered the proposals of the Government, making a reduction in the Excise duty on the liquid gallon for Australian manufacturers using Australian essential oils. These things have to be considered side by side in determining the amount of protection that is being given to this industry. The in dustry is a useful one, because the spirit that it uses is distilled from our primary products, and use is found for our essential oils, the production of which is in creasing. Prior to the war the perfumery made in this country consisted almost wholly of the cheaper kinds of scents, but during the war our manufacturers com[477] menced to make the more expensive perfumes. At the outset they encountered difficulty, because none of the essential oils required for the. higher grades of perfumery were obtainable in this country.",26
75,Mr FLEMING,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Thei r production is being commenced now.,27
76,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Yes , though at the present moment the production is wholly in sufficient for the industry. Australian manufacturers of the higher grades of perfumery cannot take advantage of the provision in the Tariff which allows the use of spirit at a lower rate of duty, charged per liquid gallon instead of per proof gallon, because they cannot comply with the requirement that they must use a certain proportion of Australian essential oils. They have, therefore, to pay the full duty of 25s. per proof gallon.",27
77,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,B y adding water a manufacturer could bring down the duty to 12s.,27
78,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"No , he could not, because unless spirit is used which is very much overproof, the essential oils will not amalgamate with it .",27
79,Mr FLEMING,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Is the Minister standing by the provisions adopted by this House 1,27
80,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Yes , so far as essential oils, about which the honourable member is concerned, are affected. At present the manufacturer of the higher grades of perfumery has to pay 25s. per proof gallon on his spirit, because he cannot obtain the Australian essential oils that he needs. Ignoring the fact that the local manufacturer of high-class perfumery has to pay duty on the fancy bottles and other articles that he is obliged to import-whic h come in at a lower rate when imported with perfumery manufactured abroad - the protection given' to the local manufacturer by the Tariff as it lef t this House was almost negligible.",27
81,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,It was nothing at all.,27
82,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"In some cases that was so.' The following memorandum, which has been carefully prepared by my officers, sets out the true position: _ In a letter addressed to the Department, and circulated also among honourable members, the following statement is made :The following duties were paid a few days ago on a shipment of. eau-de-cologne from France:- 21-oz. bottle, invoice value Â£21 6s. l i d . , duty Â£24 5s. 8d -112 J per cent. 44-oz. bottle, invoice value Â£31 2a. 7d., duty Â£43 17s. lid -14 0 per 9-oz. bottle, invoice value Â£22 4s. 9d., duty Â£41 14s. 10d -18 7 per cent. 18-oz. bottle, invoice value Â£14 6s. 3d., duty Â£39 17s. 2d -28 0 per cent. 36-oz. bottle, invoice value Â£12 7s. 2d., duty Â£39 9s. 6d -317 4 per cent. Tbis statement implies that Australian manufacturers are protected in regard to the lines quoted to the extent of from 112* per cent, to 3174 per cent. This view ignores the fact that the Australian manufacturer has to pay Excise duty on his spirit and import duties on bottles, corks, containers, ribbons, and labels. The duty is also calculated at the general Tariff rate, whereas it is the position in regard to the British preferential Tariff that must be kept in view. The following statement shows the percentages represented by the fixed rates of 40s. and 50s. under British preferential Tariff and general Tariff on the one hand and the percentage represented on the other by the Excise duty alone, i.e., without giving any consideration to the duties the local manufacturer has to pay on his bottles, fancy boxes, labels, &c (1) Duty at British preferential Tariff. (2) Duty at general Tariff. (3) Duty payable by Australian manufacturer on Excise spirit at 25s. per proof gallon. (4) Protection as against United Kingdom. (5) Protection as against other countries. (6) Protection against France if intermediate Tariff extended to French .products. (1.) (2.) (4.)

In every case worked out in this statement the local manufacturer of perfumery is without protection under the present operatiou of the Excise duty. The matter was given careful consideration hy the Department, and the alteration requested by the Seriate, and, as a matter of fact, made at my instance, is in all the circumstances fair. It is not all that the manufacturers have asked for, but at the same time it will give them that encouragement the industry needs. move That the requested amendment be made. Mr Qreene.",27

84,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Excep t that their duties are very much higher.,28
85,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"That is so. The American duty on perfumery is 40 cents per lb., and 60 per cent, ad valorem.",28
86,Sir ROBERT BEST,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,And their spirit is free of duty.,28
87,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Yes , their raw material is absolutely free of duty. I have been informed that 72 per cent, of the material used in the manufacture of Australian perfume is of Australian origin.",28
88,Mr FLEMING,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,I do not think that statement is quite correct. %,28
89,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Of course, the essential oils are imported, because the flowers from which they are extracted are grown in France and Italy. We have not yet developed that branch of the industry.",28
90,Mr FLEMING,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,We can grow most of them in Australia just as well as they can be grown elsewhere.,28

92,Mr FLEMING,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"It is already proved that we can produce these oils, although the fact is not generally known to the public.",28
93,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Australian perfumery manufacturers have been very modest in their request. They might reasonably have asked for greater protection against the wholesale competition to which they are now subjected. As the article they produce is regarded as a luxury, they were protected during the war by the embargo upon the importation of luxuries but now that all barriers against such importations have been removed, the Australian market is being flooded with foreign perfumes, to the I detriment of an industry which gives employment to a large number of people.",28
94,Dr EARLE PAGE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,How many?,28
95,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I will not say how many, but there is no industry in Ausgallon. tralia* in which the employment given is confined merely to itself. It is true the bottles in which the Australian perduction fume is sold and the stoppers are imrally, ported from Belgium and other countries, where the manufacture of dainty glassrial. ware has reached a stage of high perfechere. tion. The Australian buyer of perfumes would be prejudiced against an Auslocal manufactures. tralian perfume put up in the ordinary medicine bottle produced by Australian bottle-makers; but all the lithographic work in the labels on the bottles themwar, selves, and on the boxes in which they packed, is the work of Australian artists. A few years ago this class of work was imported, but our own artists can now produce artistic'work of this description superior to that which is turned out firms in other parts of the world who have been established for centuries. How-.some . ever, I believe that the Committee agree to the request made by the Senate.",29
96,Sir ROBERT BEST,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Kooyong) [3.49] - After the explanation given the Minister (Mr Greene), it is not necessary to enlarge very much on claim for the protection of the perfumery industry. It has been clearly demonjustice. strated that under the Tariff as i this Committee practically little or no protection was afforded to the Australian manufacturer. I believe i represented about Is. Sd. per dozen bottles, a mere trifle in some cases, and quest that the importer in other cases had a distinct advantage over the local manufacturer. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) has emphasized the necessity for encouraging of the flowers that produce the essential oils used in the manufacture of perfumes. That has been recognised in the Tariff, it is necessary that the perfumery manuthe facturers here shall be given such a meaplace. sure of protection as will enable them use those essential oils. The one induswhich try co-operates with the other. Parliainvested. ment in its wisdom has seen fit to give effect to the desire of the people that encouragement shall be given to the duction of essential oils. The local fumery manufacturers, if they use the local essential oils, have to pay an Excise duty of only 23s. per gallon, but if they do not they have to pay 42s. per gallon. [477]- 2",29
97,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"That is, 42s. per liquid",29
98,Sir ROBERT BEST,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"That is so. Thus that ' every encouragement is given to the proof essential oils here, and, natuthe local manufacturer of perfumery desires as far as possible to use local mateI t is useless for any one to attempt to slander the perfumery that is made",29
99,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,No one is slandering the,29
100,Sir ROBERT BEST,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"But circulars reflecting very seriously upon the local product have been distributed. Prior to the it is true,.we produced only the lower ase class of perfumery, but since then there has been a remarkable development in the all local production of high-class perfumery. Various factories 'which produce a high class article have been thoroughly estabby lished in Melbourne, Sydney, and other cities. I have had the pleasure of seeing of these perfumes. They are used by my own family, and no better class of perwill fumery could be imported. I submit, therefore, that we shall be justified in agreeing ta the request made by another by place, and which I remind honourable members was made at the instance of the the Government. The Government saw that they were doing the industry a gross inWhen they found that a mistake t left had been made, and that we could no longer continue to manufacture high-class perfumery unless additional protection t were given, the Government suggested the request made by another place. That reprovides for only a fair and reasonable protection.",29
101,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Is it not strange that the Minister did not discover this mistake until the Tariff had been in operation for the growth more than twelve months?,29
102,Sir ROBERT BEST,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I can only say that as soon as the Minister did discover but it he took the right course. He has told us frankly that the Government prompted making of this request in another I am sure honourable members have to no --desire to destroy this industry, in something like Â£100,000 has been",29
103,Mr FLEMING,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"What has the honourable every member to say as to a duty under which proover Â£1,100 was collected on a shipment perof Eau de Cologne, valued at Â£860. Sir ROBERT. BE ST - I know nothing of the case. The whole matter has been investigated by the officers of the Department, who have shown that under the item as it lef t this House the importers could still bring in perfumes with advantage to themselves. There is no protection to the local manufacturer under the item as it ' stands, and unless we agree to this request the importers will'be able to wipe out the industry. The request is a result of the investigation of invoices actually produced to the Department. ilr. RICHARD FOSTEB - We cannot get away fro m invoices, - in which the effect of the duty is given in pounds, shillings, and pence.",29
104,Sir ROBERT BEST,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I agree with the honourable member, and the Minister has seen the invoices relating to importations actually made and showing the duty paid. The departmental - investigation shows that there is no protection as against the British manufacturer, and only a small measure of protection under the intermediate and general Tariffs. The Minister has done the right thing. says that we have a valuable industry producing high-class perfumery, and that it ought to be encouraged by means of a fair and reasonable measure of protection. I regret that, as the honourable member  it would be impossible to sell the beautif u l perfumes made here, or for that matter any other high-class perfumes, if they were put in the class of bottles that aire manufactured in Australia. High-class perfumes have to be put into high-class fancy bottles, and, unfortunately, at the present time such bottles are not being made here. As soon as they are I am sure the local manufacturers of perfumery will be glad to use them. I submit that the Committee, has always been anxious to give reasonable protection to local manufacturers, and since it has been demonstrated conclusively that the Tariff as it left this Chamber gave practically no protection to the manufacturers of high-class perfumes in Australia, the Minister invites us to agree to this request. I think the Committee will readily accept it .",30
105,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Dampier) [3.57] Again we have the cry that in order to encourage new industries in Australia we must have high duties. The Minister (Mr Greene) told us when the Tariff was before us on a previous occasion that, as the result of the heavy duties for'whic h it provided, we should have cheaper goods. Th'e fact is that these high duties have so increased prices that one wonders how the man in the back country will be able to carry on. Honourable members have been speaking of the great perfumery-making industry of Australia, but we find that practically everything used in the manufacture of perfumes, with the exception of water, is imported. We are told that one reason why this request should be agreed to is that perfumery bottles have to be imported, and are dutiable at a high rate. The corks and practically everything else used in the putting up of perfumery have also to be imported. When we discussed this duty some four months ago, the Tariff had been in operation for more than twelve months, and the Minister then told us, in moving an amendment of the item, that his experience of its operation was that the ad valorem duty pressed heavily on the high grades of perfumed spirits, which were not manufactured in Australia. He He therefore asked for a re-arrangement of the item, which he said was necessary to protect the lower classes of manufacture in this country, would lead to a greater consumption, and would consequently produce more revenue. That was his opinion of the effect of the item'after it had been in operation for about fourteen months; hut as soon as the honourable gentleman showed his hand in this House by agreeing to an enormously increased duty on bananas, we had representatives of the Chamber of Manufactures-whic h has been silent up to that point-as well as individual manufacturers, who up to that time had been quite satisfied with the duties imposed in the Tariff as introduced, besieging the House and making demand after demand for increased duties. The Minister gave way to this clamour, with the result that we have the present monstrous duties. The statements I have before me in regard to the effect of the duty on perfumed spirits came only from the importers of perfumery, and I cannot vouch for their accuracy; but I should like to know what will be the average duty paid when the ad valorem rates are added as proposed to the fixed duty. The Minister has not given us that information.",30
106,Mr GREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,On all the higher grades of perfume it will not exceed 25 per cent.,30
107,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"If the Minister wants an increased duty, why does he not provide for an increase of so much per gallon, so that - we may know exactly what is contemplated ?",30
108,Mr GREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,That would defeat the objects of the Tariff.,31
109,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"What is the reason for this proposal ? Why are we to be kept in the dark ? - I have a memorandum here from-the French Chamber of Commerce, in which it is stated thatThe duty on perfumed spirits, which, up March, 1920, was 25s. per gallon, was altered to 35s., 37s., and 40s. per gallon, cent., 40 per cent., and 45 per cent, ad val. (whichever rate returned the higher duty). This meant an increase of duty of from 200 to 500 per cent.",31
110,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Of course, that is all rubbish. These duties must be considered in conjunction with the Excise duties if honourable members are to grasp the position at all.",31
111,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I have a lively recollection of the cablegram which the Miuister received from Canada in regard to reapers and binders, in which the ex, change between the two countries was added to show the cost of the implements in Canada. That was published in the newspapers. That was so preposterous that I could not understand the press being misled in that way. What had the exchange to do with the price paid by the Canadian farmer for his reaper - and binder? I say that in that matter the Minister misrepresented the position.",31
112,Mr GREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"The honourable member may think so, but I am equally entitled to maintain that I did not misrepresent the position.",31
113,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"As I have explained, I am informed that, if the Senate's request in this matter be. agreed to, it will involve an increase in the duty of from 200 to 500 per cent. In a letter which I have here from a Melbourne firm, the statement is made that this proposal represents, in the case of a 2^-oz. bottle, a duty of 112$ per cent., and to indicate the accuracy of these figures I may say that the Minister has admitted that it represents a duty of 112Â£ per cent. On the 4^-oz. bottle, the duty will be 140 per cent.; on a 9-oz. bottle, 187 per cent.; on an 18-oz. bottle, 280 per cent.; and on a 36-oz. bottle, 317$ per cent. The Minister has himself pointed out that the imposition of such extreme duties must involve a loss of revenue which he does not desire to see brought about.",31
114,Mr GREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Will the honourable member say what is the ad valorem duty on brandy? I may inform him at once that it is about 600 per cent. In dealing with the articles now under consideration, the honourable member is really obto jecting to the spirit duty. He is not making a fair comparison, and so is guilty of or 35 per misrepresentation.",31
115,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"That is not so. I am not putting figures on paper with a view to misrepresent the position. I am quoting figures which I believe to be correct, and I give my authority-, for them. The firm supplying me with those figures must accept responsibility for them.",31
116,Mr MASWELL,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Is the honourable member arguing against the amount of protection involved in the Senate's request or against the principle of Protection?,31
117,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I am objecting to the increase of these duties in the way proposed, merely for the purpose, and I shall speak plainly, of helping certain people starting an industry in a small way. The duty at first proposed by the Minister was in operation for twelve months. Because of certain representations made to him, the Minister changes his mind, and now proposes that on these articles there should be an ad valorem duty as well as the fixed duty previously imposed. The same thing is proposed in connection with cigars; but we shall come to them later. The Minister did not quote the report of the Inter-State Commission in regard to this matter. I specially direct the attention of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) to it.",31
118,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,The honourable gentleman knows my opinion of the Tariff recommendations of the Inter-State Commission.,31
119,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"The Commission reported, in 1914, on this subject, as follows :No particulars were afforded by manufacturers as to the local costs of production. It was said they were mixed up with other costs. The difficulty in connection with this industry is that, whilst it is probable in certain cases there may be some care necessary in the process of the manufacture, in many instances by the use of imported concentrated and synthetic perfumes, the process is that of simple admixture, and is quite useless from an industrial point of view, except the labour indirectly employed in connection with bottles, laibels, and outside packages. In spite of that report, we now have the Minister proposing an increase in the duty on these goods when only a little while ago he told us that he could not accept an increase because it would lead to a reduction of revenue.""",31
120,Mr LAZZARINI,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Werriwa) [4.12] I shall not waste time in submitting arguments in support of the Senate's request in this case. It is so reasonable that : I am satisfied the Committee will agree to it. There is, however, a matter connected with this item to which I should like to refer. When we give adequate protection to an Australian industry, and it is fostered by that protection, those carrying it on should, in Common decency, distribute their products to the public as Australian-made articles. That is not done by those engaged in manufacturing perfumery in Australia. I have been engaged in the retail trade for many years, and prior to the war there was a German Eau de Cologne for sale which had practical control of the Australian market. As a result of the war, that article disappeared from the market, and we had patriotic Australian manufacturers making substitutes for it. They sent their commercial travellers around to the storekeepers of Australia'and sold their perfume to them as an old French Eau de Cologne dating back to 1648. It was put up in bottles and packages with lettering upon them in the French language, although the article was manufactured in Sydney. There should be a condition attaching to the imposition of these duties that the Australian-made article protected by them should be sold as an Australian manufacture. If that practice were adopted, the result would be to foster trade in Australian goods. When perfumes made in Australia are sold in the names of the German and French importations, which had the run of our market for so long, the effect of the Tariff is merely to enable the local manufacturers to make money, whilst it does nothing to create amongst Australians a desire to use Australian-made goods. The man who will prostitute business principles merely in order to make money should be dealt with, and the protection afforded by the Tariff should be withdrawn from him. A man engaged in business has not the time to make these minute inquiries to discover where the goods offered to him are made. In the case of perfumery, storekeepers were invited to give their orders months ahead for the Christmas trade. They were told that because the goods had to be imported from France their orders must be' sent in early. The goods were being made in Sydney and Melbourne all the time, and that is the sort of thing of which I complain, and which should be put an end to.",32
121,Mr MATHEWS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Queenslan d bananas are sold here as F i j i bananas.,32
122,Mr LAZZARINI,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I have no doubt that there are some people who would try to sell apples as F i j i bananas if it suited them, and they thought they could mislead the public. Manufacturers who"" engage in these practices should, in my opinion, not only be refused the protection of the Tariff, but should not be allowed to trade in Australia at all. They should be given only the King's protection in the gaols of Australia. Goods made in Australia need not fear competition with similar goods made elsewhere, and if the local manufacturers labelled their goods ""Made in Australia,"" one result would be to create a general desire for Australian-made goods. We should in this way be doing much to protect Australian industries from foreign competition. I believe that the people of Australia are sufficiently patriotic to prefer to purchase goods made in Australia if they are at all equal to similar goods manufactured elsewhere.",32
123,Mr FLEMING,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Robertson) [4.17] This is a difficult and complicated matter, and without attempting to elucidate a question upon which I am not myself too clear, I wish to impress upon the Minister that we should be careful to do nothing that might interfere with our friendly relations and trade with France. I agree that what we can do to encourage Australian industries should be done. If we establish perfumery and essential oil factories in Australia on a sound basis, they will provide helpful and useful occupation for numbers of people unfitted for heavy toil. In the citrus orchard districts of Australia there is ample scope for the establishment of the essential oil industry. At present we are losing thousands of tons of fruit every year which might be profitably used if that industry were established. It could be worked in conjunction with the perfume industry. At present we are making a well-known perfume in Australia from the eucalyptus. I am not referring to eucalyptus oil, but to a recognised perfume that is made from the eucalyptus. There are many plants in Australia which might be turned to good account in this way. I have seen in Australia a number of imported plants, which it is not generally known are to be found here. The export of some of them from the countries in which they are indigenous is prohibited, yet I have seen them growing in Australia. This industry is in its infancy, but will doubtless become a very valuable, one, and, as I say, find ample employment for those who are unable to do hard work.",32
124,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"It ought to find employment for' thousands, once it is properly understood.",33
125,Mr FLEMING,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"More particularly amongst the gentler sex. ""When the men aTe doing the hard work of the orchard, the girls can do the lighter work of growing plants for perfume. Instead of the present waste, thousands of citrus trees will be turned to account. Only last month I was in one of the great citrus districts of Australia, and I visited one orchard, the proprietor of which had been injured in the back country and rendered unfit for further station work. He pointed to some 6 acres of eight-year-old lemon trees, which were carrying a magnificent crop. When I asked him as to his returns from the land in this particular connection, he told me that he .could make a very comfortable living, but that that was about all he could say. added that there was not much real hard work, and what had to be done could be spread over his own time. As to the lemons on the trees, he told me that he was going to plough them all in, because the price' of lemons at present did not pay for the picking and sending, to market. If the particular industry under discussion can be established in Australia, every lemon will be picked and sent to the factory, and will, at least, realise enough to make their cultivation a paying proposition. Of course, when the price* of lemons is good for their usual purposes, still better returns will be obtained.",33
126,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Then those in the industry should not require protection.,33
127,Mr FLEMING,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"But , as I have been showing, they do require some protection. The lemon peel is well worth handling, and then there is acid production, and quite a number of incidental developments. All that can be done with safety for this industry should be done, and in such a way as not to lessen the trade between here and France. In my opinion we can continue our trade with that country without a prohibitive Tariff; we can allow high-class perfumes to come in on a reasonable basis, and at the same time, under the Excise law, encourage local production in such a way as to establish the iudustry on a firm basis. Mr .MATHEWS (Melbourne Ports) [4.23] - It is Temarkable in an Australian House of Parliament to hear a member so careful of the interests of the French people.",33
128,Mr FLEMING,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"You have not been in France, have you?",33
129,Mr MATHEWS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Ha d I been in France fifty times, I am the representative of the people of Australia, and it is their interests to which I have to pay regard. If it is a matter of sentiment, I have as much sentiment, I think, as has the honourable member; but I can hardly imagine a French deputy speaking in support of the commercial interests of Australia, at any rate, without his tqngue in his cheek. Whether it be the perfume industry or any other, we have to consider Australians, and not the people of France. I may be told that the industry here is hardly worth considering, as we He have been told in regard to every industry whose development has been attempted. There was a time when arguments were raised against duties on any form of machinery, on the ground that the Australian people could not manufacture machinery, but could only assemble parts; but now we are manufacturing in Australia all kinds of machinery. In the present case we are told that the industry is a mere mixing business, but we have to consider the many and varied interests connected with it, and' I may say that in France and Germany whole towns and districts are devoted to the manufacture of perfumes. We hear a great deal of talk from honourable members opposite about the ""poor farmer"" and the "" poor little children "" of Australia, and it is a wonder we have not had the ""poor old widow'' dragged in. Personally, I have never bought any scent in my life, even for my ""best g i r l "" ; the proper thing ""to do is to wash oneself and leave perfumes alone; at any rate, those who demand perfumes ought to be made to pay for them. I am sorry that the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) is not present, for I am sure he would, as usual, be very pathetic and sentimental about the "" poor farmer""; but I should say that .this is an industry in which the farmer is as much interested as anybody else. I do not suggest that' the farmer uses perfumes, or has any need to do so, but the fact that all the ingredients are"" produced from the land gives him an interest. I hope the Minister (Mr Greene) will be quite as explanatory on every item as he has been in regard to this.

133,Mr MATHEWS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I hope that the Minister in succeeding items will have more satisfactory results from hi3 explanations; at any rate, the explanation in regard to this item - was so clear and concise that it has raised the ire of those opposed to Australian manufactures. The farmer of Australia ought to be ashamed of the men who represent him, for they simply make him ridiculous. I hope that the Minister's proposal will be agreed Â«to. The industry is in its initial stage, and requires time for development.

This is a somewhat similar amendment to the last, and arises out of a similar reason, namely, the difference between the amount of Excise duty which the Australian manufacturer has to pay and the amount of import duty. What is requested by the Senate is to strike out of the item medicines and toilet preparations, with a view to inserting them in items 2S5 and 290. If honourable members turn to requests number 60 and 62 they will see exactly what the effect of the requested amendment is. They will see that medicines and toilet preparations are brought under an ad, valorem rate instead of a fixed rate. I do not know me. that I need go into the matter fully at this moment. It was found on a comparison of the rate which the importer was paying under this item with the rate of spirit Excise which the Australian manufacturer had to pay on the spirit he used, the Customs were charging the Australian manufacturer more Excise so. than the amount of protection given him. The requested amendment makes no difference in the rate of duty, but merely has the effect I have indicated. Motion agreed to.

Banana-growing is one of the industries that offer to comparatively poor men a no good opportunity of making a living upon of a very small area of land. If the growers get anything like a reasonable price for their f r u it , and are not robbed by the redistributors, a man can make 'a good living off 5 acres of land. This is a essentially a primary industry, and utilizes land which otherwise would be The majority of bananas are produced on land upon the which one would not ask a self-respecting cow to walk. It is high, cliffy land, for most part, covered with rocks, but on it the banana flourishes in a way that 1 be it could not possibly do on the rich river flats.

150,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"A very large proportion of the banana-growers are returned soldiers. The industry is nourishing, but, at the same time, it is open to petition from the adjacent islands, where the banana is grown by black labour. In regard to the question asked a few moments ago by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) as to whether the higher duty had increased the price to the consumer, I have not the slightest doubt that, before this debate closes, particulars will be furnished the Committee to. prove that since the increased duty was imposed the price of bananas in the markets has ibeen less than for many years previously.",36
151,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Because nobody will buy them.,36

154,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,I did not say that the increase in the duty was responsible for the lower price at which the bananas were sold.,36
155,Mr FOLEY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,But the Minister said that since the duty was increased the production had increased considerably.,36
156,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"That is true, because during the last few months a number of plantations have come into bearing for the first time. For instance, from Coolangatta Station, in Queensland, in the third week in August, six times as many bananas were sent away as were despatched during the corresponding week of the previous year, and that increase was entirely due to the fact that a large area that had been planted"" with bananas last year had come into bearing.  not require encouragement through the Tariff?",36
157,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,The increased duties were not required to bring those plantations into bearing; but the fact that we have a flourishing and extending industry shows the necessity for preventing its com- extinction by the importation of blackgrown bananas.,36
158,Mr FOLEY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Did not the people wbo laid out those plantations know that their product would be competing against black-grown bananas?,36
159,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Possibl y they did. But during the war, when 'the importation of bananas from F i j i was practically discontinued, prices rose higher than ever before, and banana cultivation in Australia received a tremendous - impetus.",36
160,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Fruiterer s in Adelaide state that everybody wants bananas, but nobody will pay the price for them.",36
161,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Grower s sold at remunerative prices every banana they pro1 duced, and I cannot imagine fruiterers buying those bananas unless they were able to sell the fruit at a profit. Owing to the encouragement which the bananagrowing industry received during the war, a very large number of primary producers are growing bananas, and the market is fully supplied. The obstacle with which they have to contend is not the number of bananas imported in the course of a year, but the fact that large shipments come to Australia at a given time, temporarily - destroying entirely the market for the local article. Australian growers who send their bananas to the market at such a period-and bananas must be marketed when they are readystrike an overloaded market, and get practically nothing for their fruit. If that were allowed to continue, it would not be long before the number of banana plantations would be reduced, and many men would be driven off the soil.

When the item was previously before the Committee I went open to verification. to considerable trouble to point out that Australian growers could fully supply the but may local requirements. The last shipment of bananas from F i j i arrived in South Wales and Queensland. Melbourne in May last, and since that time the market has been over supplied. Some of the objections which have been raised this afternoon to the duty of I'd. both per lb., are effectively answered the following letter, which was sent to the by Mr Ellison, Secretary of the Southern Queensland Fruit growers AssoI am in receipt of the following wire today from our Melbourne representative:-""Over supply of bananas; choice to 17s., inferior lines unsaleable."" The prices ruling on the Sydney market, I understand, are from 9s. to 16s. per case of bananas. The above prices and are over-supply are on markets that have no F i j i banana supplies, and fully prove our statements that we could supply the Australian markets. I am advised from Perth this week that two shipments of bananas are due from Java, and growers not to send there for the next three weeks, although latterly we have been sending their full requirements. We are now to send bananas to New Zealand, otherwise allow the fruit to rot here, as cannot consume what we now grow, and yet, in face of these facts, the Senate considered that we should have further competiI That letter brings out three interesting Primary facts, (1) that the Melbourne and Sydney we markets were over-supplied, (2) that being introduced into Western Australia at the present time from Java in spite of the duty of l d . per lb., and (3) that on account of overproduction of bananas in Queensland and New South Wales an outlet is being sought in New Zealand, to which shipments have been sent weekly for some time past. I have also a copy of a letter forwarded to the Minister for Trade and Customs by the secretary of the Tweed Co-operative Fruit-growers' Association. It is dated 29th August, and readsIn view of the .resolution in the Senate to recommend a reduction in the Tariff on imported bananas from 8s. 4d. to 4s. 2d. per . central, my board desires me to submit for your consideration figures taken from the records of this company relative to the increase in production of bananas within the Commonwealth, and market values immediately prior and subsequent to the passing of the Tariff measures m the House of Kepresentatives. company supervises the marketing of the greater portion pf the bananas grown on the per Lower Tweed and in the vicinity, and the figures submitted are authentic records, and The figures regarding production apply, of course, only to that part of the district whose be taken as fairly representative outlet is Tweed Heads, of the general increase in production in New The market values given are those actually realized by growers in the Sydney markets, and are an emphatic denial to the statements made in Houses that the imposition of the increased Tariff had caused an increase in the by the price of the fruit. The total quantities of bananas marketed by the company during the months May to August inclusive, 1920, and during .the corresponding period in the current year are as follow:' May . . 2,341 cases . . 6,523 cases June . . 2,455 â . . 7,927 â July .. 2,061 â .. 6,715 â August .. 2,297 â .. 9,421 â Total .. 9,154 cases .. 30,586 cases These figures represent an increase in production in one year of 234 per cent. The relative market values of the entire quantity of fruit sold through the company for the period of six weeks both prior and subsequent to the imposition of the increased Tariff are as follow:-Six weeks prior to increase, 10,342 cases realized Â£11,829 10s -22s . lOd. per case average; six weeks subsequent to increase, 11,190 cases realized Â£11,903 4s. - 6d -21s . 3d. .per case average. The difference in values for fruit sold during the calendar months prior and subsequent Â»to that in whioh the Tariff was imposed is still more marked, being 22s. 6d. per case for the month of April, and 19s. 4d. per case for the month of June. Since the Tariff was increased values have consistently declined, and the average value at time of writing is about 13s. per case. Had the Fiji fruit been arriving on the markets in the customary way, it would probably have been found impossible to dispose of large quantities of both the Australian and F i j i - products at any price. With reference to the opinion expressed in quarters hostile to the Tariff that the Commonwealth is unable to produce sufficient bananas for her requirements, I may say that my directors, who can claim to have a sound practical knowledge of the various phases of the industry, consider that the question of over-production has to be faced in the very near future. This matter has been engaging their serious attention for some months' past, and practical steps, have already.been taken towards an endeavour to cope with the situation when it arises, if we are not entirely faced with it. (Sgd.) E. M. SMITH, Manager. Honourable members will notice that for the four months mentioned there was an increase of 21,432 oases, and the writer of the communication points out that this may be taken as fairly representative of the general average increase in production in the two States during that period. desire now to refer to the quantity of bananas at present arriving in Melbourne. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Richard Foster) has said, by that there has been a shortage of this fruit in South Australia; but the figures I have before me showing the weekly consignments reaching the Melbourne disclose that for the first week of the pre-sent year 2,421 cases arrived bourne, and that the total number of Ur. Macleay. cases which arrived only yesterday was 12,198. The honourable member will therefore see that there has been a considerable 1920. 1921. increase during recent months. Every fourth week, when a F i j i boat arrived here, it was necessary for the Queensland growers to reduce their shipments, because they had to compete with the F i j i consignments, and, consequently, suffered considerable loss. Now that the growers have the market to themselves they are despatching supplies with the greatest confidence, and any one who has been around Melbourne or Sydney streets must admit that the price of the f r u it is extremely moderate.",37
170,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Then the honourable nj ember admits that they have now the market to themselves, and that .there is an embargo on importations?",38
171,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,That is disproved by the fact that bananas from Java are coming into Western Australia. The Queensland growers have been sending as much as 700 cases a week to Western Australia; but consignments have been arriving from Java.,38
172,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,We cannot obtain bananas in Western Australia.,38
173,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"They are being shipped there in large quantities. Many misleading statements have been made, particularly in another place, concerning the price at which the f r u it is being sold. The growers have no control over the price at which it is disposed of, because it is consigned to their representative in Melbourne, who distributes it to the various agents. The growers are in the hands of the distributer. I produce for the information of the Committee two photographs taken in Sydney, showing f r u it carts on which appear the words "" Bananas, extra choice, 18 for 6d.""",38
174,Mr GABB,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,I would like to see that in Adelaide.,38

176,Mr FLEMING,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,The photograph does hot give any indication of the quality.,38
177,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"They are marked as market "" extra choice,"" and if the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) in Mel- ticketed his wool in such a way he would expect his classification to be accepted.",38
178,Mr JOWETT,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,How many bananas are packed in a case?,39
179,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I sball deal with that when I bave dealt with prices. The selling agents have given the highest and lowest price at which fruit arriving in Melbourne has been sold, from the 7th June to the 22nd September. During this period bananas have been sold at as high as 23s., and as low as 6s. per case.",39
180,Mr JOWETT,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Is that since the duty was imposed?,39
181,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Yes .,39
182,Mr G,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,SEENE - Are there not twenty-five dozen bananas to a case?,39
183,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,There are from twenty-four to thirty dozen of choice f r u it ; but with smaller fruit the number would be larger.,39
184,Mr GABB,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"If there were thirty dozen, the fruit would be very small.",39
185,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Perhaps the honourable member may know something of this particular business. I have made 'it my duty to investigate the position _ very closely, and in doing so have visited banana-growing districts.",39
186,Mr GABB,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Has the honourable member any figures showing the quantity despatched to Adelaide? .,39
187,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"In my letter-box I have a telegram sent to the organization in Queensland from the agent in Adelaide to the effect that 2,000 cases had arrived, and that they did not know what they were going to do with them. Mr G.iBB -""When was that?",39
188,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"About one month ago. Considering the quantity arriving in Melbourne. I cannot see that there is any possibility of the, Adelaide market being in any way neglected.",39
189,Mr GABB,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,In Adelaide they arc being sold at ten for Is.,39
190,Mr JOWETT,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,What quantity was sold at as low as 6s. per case? Was it one case?,39
191,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"The honourable member knows perfectly well that a retailer would not purchase only one case._ A ll the fruit arriving in Melbourne is received in a green state, and no one would think of purchasing one case of green bananas. All the fruit goes into ripening rooms, where it remains for ten days or a fortnight before it is ready for consumption.",39
192,Mr JOWETT,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"A fruiterer in my district said that he paid 28s. for a case, and I want to know where they can be purchased at 6s.",39
193,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I am quoting authentic figures to prove my statements. I now desire to refer to the allegation that the industry in Queensland is in the hands of the Chinese.' The Minister for Agriculture in Queensland recently introduced and passed a* measure entitled "" The Banana Industry Preservation Act,"" which deals with foreigners 'engaged in the industry. Tn the measure provision is made whereby any one who wishes to engage in the banana-growing business shall submit to a' dictation test. It is very evident that the Queensland Government are anxious to make this industry a white man's industry, and to do all they can to prevent foreigners engaging in it. The Queensland Minister saidThere was an additional reason why they should get this legislation on the statute book at the earliest possible date, in order to prove to the Federal Parliament-particularl y the Senate-tli e taxpayers, and consumer that they were determined to keep the industry white. He hoped that the House of Representatives would not reduce* the Tariff as suggested by tha Senate, because a duty of 8s. 4(1. per central would encourage the growers to establish themselves in Queensland and in New South Wales. The Minister of Agriculture is to be congratulated upon having introduced such legislation, and I understand that tha New South Wales Government also intend passing a similar measure.",39
194,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Does that mean that a' naturalized Chinese would be excluded?,39
195,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"No . That point was raised during the debate, aud the Minister made it clear that any foreigner at present engaged in the industry would not be disturbed. I understand that there are not more than half-a-dozen Chinese so employed in Queensland.",39
196,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,There are fifty or sixty on one plantation in New South Wales.,39
197,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"There are a number on one plantation in New South Wales controlled by Chinese in Melbourne, but on the Tweed Biver there is not a single Chinaman.",39
198,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,The figures in regard to New South Wales were that there were fifty or sivty.,39
199,Mr GREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,But all on one plantation.,40
200,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Anothe r objection raised is that ex-soldiers are engaged in F i j i in the production of bananas; but for every ex-soldier so engaged in F i j i there are forty or fifty in Queensland and in New South Wales. As I said on a previous occasion, a great - deal of the money advanced for the repatriation of soldiers has been spent in establishing men on banana plantations, and as the plants take only about eighteen months to develop', much of the land is now coming into production. There has been a remarkable increase in the area under cultivation, and thousands of acres are still available for banana-growing. I cannot imagine any returned man preferring to settle in F i j i instead of in Australia. The duty will stabilize the banana industry, and in the future there will be plenty of bananas available for local consumption; indeed, the production will be so great . that it will be necessary to export some of the fruit. This will insure reasonable prices in the Australian market. Even now we are sending bananas to New Zealand. It is not intended to penalize the banana-growers in F i j i ; it is the speculators there who dre hit by the duty. In the last issue of Nickos, a journal published in Brisbane in the interests of the fruit industry, a correspondent writes:When I was in Fiji recently I was surprised at the conditions prevailing there. I was told that all the banana exporters were only dealers who bought the fruit as cheaply as they could from the natives, paying from 7d. to 2s. a bunch, and 2s. 6d. to 3s. a case for the fruit on the river bank. These statements are confirmed by a passhope, age which appears on page 39 of Land Products, a little publication printed by the duty. the Government Printer of F i j i Many growers disposed of their fruit to shippers on the plantation or on the steamer, thereby saving much trouble and thus securing a certain and quick cash return for their without taking the risk of the outside market. Apparently, therefore, the F i j i growers of bananas will continue to be as well off as they have been. They will get same prices as formerly, and the profits that have been going into the pockets the speculators will add to the revenue this country. I take it that there have been cannot live an insular life. no F i j i bananas sent to this market May last merely to scare this House into reducing the duty, because I have not the slightest doubt but that F i j i fruit will come on to this market again, even if the duty is continued. The duty has already had beneficial effects. Not only has it increased production in Queensland and New South Wales, but I learn on the authority of the Customs officials, and have heard from representatives of Western Australia, that banana plants have been sent to Western Australia, so that within a short time that State will be growing bananas for itself. The following is a resolution passed by the Country party in the Queensland Parliament; and I understand that a copy of it has been sent to the Leader of the Country party here. I quote it in the hope that members of the Commonwealth Country party may realise that it is just as important to protect the growers of bananas in Queensland and New South Wales as to protect those engaged ' in industries in Victoria and the other States:That the Federal Government bo approached with a view of getting the full protection in the banana industry, as moved in the House of Representatives. Further, in view of the legislation which is being passed by the Queensland Government, which practically makes the banana industry a white-man industry, and such policy is part of the Federal Constitution, we think that a full measure of protection should be granted to the banana industry. That the above motion be sent to the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Country party, the Leader of the Opposition, and the President of the Senate, asking them that, as the matter is urgent, steps be taken to deal with the matter at once. The banana industry is of great importance to the people of two States, and I therefore, that the Committee will and agree to the motion for the retention of  titude towards the duty on bananas is the same now as it was when the rate orifruit ginally proposed by the Government was increased. The Minister for Trade and Customs has spoken of the short-sightedness of certain persons, but I was at least the able to foresee the consequences of this restrictive impost and its effect on the of trade of this country. As I pointed out of on a former occasion, we in Australia F i j i is a since British territory, where bananas were growing before Australia was discovered. The growing of bananas is, part of the livelihood of the people of that country, and is it a Christian act to seek to deprive them of it? Furthermore, there is a tremendous amount of Australian capital in F i j i . Persons connected with the Government of that country have shown how offensive some of our legislation has been to its people, and that it has resulted in the diversion of trade which was more beneficial to Australia than to Fiji. Mr H . M . Scott, KC , who has been a member of the Legislative Council of F i j i since his election to that body nearly fourteen years ago, and who has been mayor of Suva for the last six years, arrived in Sydney recently by the Niagara, and an interview with him was published in a local newspaper. follows:In an interview to-night, he spoke as an ardent advocate of a federation of British-owned islands in the Pacific. He was asked whether such a federation would not tend further to sever Australia's connection with the islands. "" F i j i is not thinking of that aspect,"" he plied, ""and this is hardly to he wondered at m view of the very unfriendly policy of the Australian authorities towards Fij i and all other islands. We have so long had to put up with hostile Tariffs and irritating restrictions on ,our produce, not to speak of strikes that delay our steamers, that we have grown sick of Australia's treatment. It is not for me to question the wisdom of the Commonwealth Parliament in imposing a tremendously heavy duty on our bananas, for instance, but do Australians realise that where our people sold their bananas they bought their goods? They sell their bananas in New Zealand now., and they are purchasing their requirements there. Our trade with Australia was worth, roughly, Â£1,000,000 a year, and with New Zealand about Â£250,000, but New Zealand's trade will show a great advance nest year. The feeling is growing in Fiji that we must strike out for ourselves, so we have established a direct service with England that cuts out Australia. Just before my departure from Suva, the first steamer under the new contract left with 5,000 tons of copra, and it will come back also vi& Panama full of goods from England. For example, it will bring Â£15,000 worth of machinery for our electric light plant in Suva. The last plant was purchased in Australia, but such is tlic resentment against Australia's treatment of us that this timewe decided to import direct from England."" The honourable member for Lilley (Mr experience, Mackay) has stated that ""an attempt is being made to grow bananas in Western position, Australia. That State has found - it practically impossible to get Queensland bananas. Messrs. H . J. and. F. Simper Limited, two of the leading f r u it merchants there, sayWe have many times endeavoured to import bananas from the eastern States, but without success. The distance is too far for the fruit to carry, and the cost too great to enable the people to buy them. During the past few years we have interested ourselves in the Java trade, and now have a considerable amount of capital invested in it. This has enabled us to provide a good outlet for Western Australian fresh fruit. Take grapes, for instance. Previously we have exported a few hundred cases each year. This year we have sent out about 3,000 cases, obtaining high prices for the Western Australian grower. We would Â»point out that it is only because we are reciprocating by taking their goods that we are able to do this. The new duty of ld. per lb. is too heavy to allow of the successful importation of bananas from Java, which is the only practical source of supply; consequently we fear the loss of It is as our investments. Wc would like to point out that during a considerable portion of the year bananas are the principal fruit of the people, and this impost is likely to rob them of this fruit. This is serious as regards young children. During the glut season of VVestern Australian fruit, when soft fruits are in, very few bananas are imported, but large quantire- ties are brought in commencing about April, when the only local fruits available are apples and oranges, with .a few pears. The restriction of the importation of bananas will not in any way affect the price of these fruits, which is always high during this period, but it will have a bad effect on all fruit shops, as this is one of their principal lines. Wo would ask you to use every endeavour to obtain a reduction in this rate, or at least exempt Western Australia. A letter I have received from, anotber source statesWe learn from the Customs Department that a duty of ld. per lb. on all bananas grown overseas is now in operation throughout Australia. We wish to draw your attention to the serious position in which it places the whole of the residents of Western Australia. As you are no doubt aware, the following towns, viz.:-Derby , Broome, Port Hcdland, Point Samson, and Onslow, are for a great part of the year without any fruit at all, except that received from Java. These ports are supplied by the Joint Service boats, one about every two to three weeks, the bulk of fruit being bananas. Up to the present no one has been successful in growing bananas on a commercial basis in Western Australia, consequently the gold-fields and agricultural towns are supplied from Perth and Fremantle with fruit also grown, at Java. From many years* the importers in this State recognise that the importation of bananas from Queensland or Sydney is not a commercial proowing to the fruit deteriorating in transit. This, in actual practice, is proved to be a very real risk against which the importer has no redress. We feel that we'are on safe ground in saying that, sliould bananas be absolutely prohibited from entering Australia, Queensland growers cannot, now or at any future date, supply Western Australia with bananas. The reason is that the fruit is of a delicate nature, and the distance from the source of supply is too great to avoid heavy losses. This is accentuated by the many delays in transit, caused by ships calling at Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. You are aware that our company (consisting of all local shareholders) has been trading between Fremantle, Java, and Singapore for the last eight years, and during that time has been the means of shipping a very large portion of Westralian fresh fruit, flour, and other products to these markets., It has been said that man cannot live on bread alone, nor can he subsist merely on bananas. '""Western Australia, as well as Queensland, has big interests.",40
201,Mr COHSEB,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Why injure the primary producer?  do that. If I were speaking selfishly, I would go for a high Tariff. That might be good on party lines, but I wish to get as far away from those lines as possible. The duty suggested by the Senate is quite high enough for the protection of this industry. According to the Minister's own statement, the industry developed to a huge extent in Queensland before this protection was offered it . Now there is to be almost a prohibitive Tariff directed against the f r u it of a friendly country which is a British Territory.' We are professing to have a fatherly interest in F and we are going to point out at the Washington Conference how careful White Australia is in looking after the interests of black Polynesia. We cannot live without trading with the people of the Pacific. We have Â£7,000,000 worth of trade with France, and' we buy from that country goods to the value of only Â£1,000,000, yet we are endeavouring to manufacture perfumes in Australia by the aid of a Tariff which will exclude the French product. It would be better to take advantage of the natural potentialities of our country, and extend a little reciprocity in connection with an industry which has been peculiar to France for centuries. We cannot be surprised if , in pursuing such a policy, we find other people building up walls of reprisal against us. It is natural for the people in the Pacific Islands 'to grow bananas, and yet there are members in this House who seem to suggest that those people should be starved. There is a huge principle in volved in the question of the duty on bananas. I support the reduction suggested by the Senate, and think it ought to give reasonable protection. The Minister said the production of bananas had already increased rapidly in Australia, but it shows that the people who undertook the project without a Tariff knew what they were doing. The very costliness of some of the banana-growing lands, which have fetched up to Â£150 an acre, indicates that there is money in the in dustry. I do not favour excessive costs for anything. The attitude adopted by the House will shut out interests in a way that will simply make the Budget of the Federal Treasury the most difficult in Australia. It means killing our own goose that is laying the golden eggs. When I was living in Queensland twenty-one years ago the banana trade was thriving.",42
202,Mr COBSEB,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"The Kanakas were there then.  The honourable member for Lilley (Mr. Mackay) has already told us that Queensland bananas are being sold in New Zealand. It seems to be a sin for Australia to get anything cheaply. Notwithstanding all the protection that seems to be necessary for Queensland traders, they are able to send their goods to New Zealand against all competitors, and they say they are doing very well.",42
203,Mr GABB,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Angas) [ 5 . 4 7 ] - I support i j i , the reduction in duty suggested by the Senate. When the matter was before the House recently I opposed the duty of l d . per l b . , which works out at about 4d. per dozen for good-sized bananas, and if we bring the duty down to ^d. it amounts to 2d. a dozen. As I previously stated, from my experience of the retail f r u it trade, there is a fairly long period in South Australia, as there is in Western Australia, when for variety in f r u it the people depend largely on the banana. Many of the poorer people purchase a few oranges and bananas once a week for a salad'for the Sunday evening meal. Knowing that f r u it is one of the finest foods for mankind, I am opposed to any duty being put on which would keep it off the market. My .district is the principal fruit-growing area in South Australia, and if 1 spoke purely fro m a parochial view-point I would be advocating as high a duty as I could possibly obtain, so as to leave the market free for the f r u it grown in my own district. As I stated a few moments ago, however, there is a period when even my district cannot .provide a sufficient variety.",42
204,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,In what months would that be?,43
205,Mr GABB,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"In a heavy apple year, from the end of June to the middle of November, and in a light apple year, from the end of May until the middle of November.",43
206,Mr COKSBK,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Are the apples not into cold storage?,43
207,Mr GABB,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Yes ; but the conditions which apply to bananas also apply to cool storage apples; that is to say, they are in the hands of a few packers. The retailer gets a fair deal when he can deal direct with the growers, and the consumers also benefit; but the retailer who is compelled to buy from the packers finds himself very much at their mercy. When I heard the honourable member for Lilley (Mr. Mackay) inform the Committee a little while ago that the price of prime bananas in Sydney quite recently was 17s. per crate, and that inferior bananas were at the time unsaleable, I went into the Library and had a glance at the Adelaide papers. I found that the quote for bananas in Adelaide last Saturday was 30s. per crate. There are about 24 dozen decent sized bananas in a crate.",43
208,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Adelaid e is a long way from Sydney.,43
209,Mr GABB,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,And 30s. is a long way above 17s. The railway freight would not account for the difference.,43
210,Mr BAMFORD,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Do the Adelaide people ever get their bananas at 17s. a crate when the price in Melbourne is 26s. per crate?,43
211,Mr GABB,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"The Adelaide prices for bananas are always above the Melbourne prices, and, in fact, never even approach them. I would like the co-operative concerns among the banana-growers in Queensland to extend their operations to Adelaide, and deal direct with the retailers there.",43
212,Mr MACKAY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,They are making preparations to do so.,43
213,Mr GABB,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I am pleased to hear that statement. I cannot think that the agent in Adelaide who informed the honourable member that two months ago there was a glut of bananas on the Adelaide market, and that it could not do with another 2,000 cases, was telling the truth, because at that time there was room in the city for a big supply of bananas at anything like a reasonable price, particularly if they could be quoted at the rate of eighteen for 6d., at which, according to the photographs in possession of the honourable member for Lilley, they were being sold in Sydney the other day. In my experience, the price of this fruit has put not altered very much in Adelaide. Bananas were dear years ago; they are still dear. The only way out of the difficulty is to get growers to cut out the middleman. The honourable member for  ing the views of a middleman in Western Australia, said that bananas were one of the profitable lines of the retailer. His statement was contrary to facts. The banana to the greengrocer is like sugar used to be to the grocer. There is very little profit in selling it, but it is necessary to cai'ry stocks in order to meet customers' needs.",43
214,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Are there not big losses in connection with bananas?,43
215,Mr GABB,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"As a retailer I lost more than I made oub of them. If a man could get at a reasonable cost a line that had ripened loo speedily to' suit the packer's plan, he could sell as many as he could secure, and make a good profit on them, but no one could make a reasonable profit out of fruit kept closely under the control of packers. I shall vote against high duties on bananas. I shall be pleased to see evidence of the fact' that the Queensland growers are about to go into the business of meeting the retailer direct. If they do so in Adelaide, it will be a good business deal on their part.",43
216,Mr BURCHELL,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Fremantle) [5.56]. - I think that I was the only Western Australian representative who supported the increased duty on bananas when the Tariff was before the Committee on a previous occasion, and I did so because, a few weeks previously, I had seen official reports concerning the prospects of growing bananas in the north-west of Western Australia. One authority I had in mind was Sir James Mitchell, the Premier of the State, who is as keen on land settlement and on the development of the State as any one could possibly be, and who is very anxious that steps shall be taken to encourage banana-growing in the north-west.",43

These are the people who developed the trade in bananas between Java and mantle. They are excellent authorities upon all phases of the question of importbanana ing this fruit. I understand that in Queensland the growing is done on small plantations, because it is not practicable to got an extensive area of suitable land. I am not in the position to say how much of the area taken up by Messrs. MCCorkill and Simper, who are working in conjuncin tion in this matter, is fit for banana-growand ing, but fifteen years ago bananas grown in the district on experimental plots.",44

224,Mr BURCHELL,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"The firms I have mentioned had. invested a considerable amount of capital in a steamer running between Fremantle and Java, but they realized that the imposition of an in that creased duty on bananas compelled them to focus their attention on locally-grown fruit. I do not regret the fact that had to turn their eyes to internal growing^ of bananas. Within the last few weeks, plants have been secured from Queensparticular land, and if they are not already planted are now on their way'to Carnarvon.",44
225,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I was in Carnarvon the' other day, and the people there urged to do all t could to get the duty off.",44

We are endeavouring to encourage the settlement of white people grow. throughout Australia. Most honourable say members on this side of the Chamber the favour a strong policy of immigration. the If we could encourage hundreds of people to settle in the north-west of Australia, it would mean providing emat ployment for others in supplying them with food and other requirements. Certainly we should do all we can to assist in bringing abdiut such a settlement. Queensland had to make a beginning this somewhere in this industry. Western Australia is about to make a beginning. I am pleased at the prospect of the people the State being able to get bananas at a reasonable cost. At present, the cost of conveying the fruit from Queensland to Fremantle makes its price well-nigh proFrehibitive. Furthermore, as every bananagrower will admit, the fact that the has to be cut before it reaches a decent stage of maturity has a bad effect on it when it is placed on the market. I do not think that the Queensland growers would offer any opposition to the granting of practical assistance to those who are endeavouring to establish the industry Western Australia. Messrs. MCCorkill Simper have placed before the were Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) a request for direct assistance during the period their banana plants are growing. Before the plants mature sufficiently to enable the growers to put on the market a quantity sufficient to have an appreciable effect upon the position, nearly two_ years must elapse. I realise the Minister is placed in a very peculiar position in regard to this request, because he cannot make fish of one and flesh they^ of another, and anything done by the Commonwealth Government must apply to the whole continent, and not to any State or section of it. However, I hope that he will.be able to assist these firms who are blazing the trail in Western Australia, just as assistance was me given to encourage banana-growing in Queensland in years gone by, and that he will, as a Protectionist, exercise the wide powers he possesses in the direction of helping to develop an industry which badly needs encouragement.",44

They seem to think, bemittee. cause during a certain period of port the motion. the year banana-growers have to export their surplus product, that that is a sufficient reason why. they should not have protection. If that idea were applied logically, what would the position of the fruit-growers Victoria and South Australia-at Mil dura, Renmark, and elsewhere? have increased the production of fruit eightfold as compared with pre-war days. Why should they have a protective duty of 3d. per lb., when they export large quantities of their products to other of the world? What is sauce for one dustry should be sauce for another. We must have a larger population in Austowns. tralia, and that in the near future, i are to continue to hold this very large territory under the White Australia policy.

There is not the doubt that Parliament, in imthe - posing a duty of 8s. 4d. per central, has done an enormous amount of in j u r y to Australia as fa r as these islands are concerned. Is this policy going to be extended when we are dealing with the mandates that have been placed in our We have a mandate for New they Guinea. Are we going to apply the same arguments to that territory in the future If people undertake the development of these is it going to be said to them that, I because native labour is employed, special duties must be imposed upon their products coining into this country? Is this Austhe way in which we will build up our prestige as a nation ? I think the figures in quoted by the honourable member for  beto cause our imports from F i j i were in the neighbourhood of Â£350,000 a year, while our exrjort trade with that island varied from Â£750,000 to Â£800,000 each year. That is to say, we were sending to F i j i quite double, if not more than double, the value of the products which we were receiving from that place. It is our duty as members of this National Parliament to do all we can to create a feeling of friendship with the peoples of the Pacific Islands, and to make them believe that Australia would be their futur e friend, as well as their chief market. In sending a delegate to the Washington Conference we are claiming a voice in matters pertain ing to the Pacific. The actions of the Government, so far as concerns our trade with F i j i , are proving injurious from the stand-point of statesmanship, and costly fro m the economic point of view. We are losing our trade associations with F i j i , and before long we shall be able to say the same, unfortunately, of our relations with Java. Java has been buying from Australia more than double the value of the goods which we have been purchasing from that country. It may be said, of course, that it pays Java to trade with us; but, even so, if Australia shows that she does not want to trade with Java, there are bound to be reprisals. Already F i j i has informed us that she does not want to have anything more to do with"" us commercially. But we must find and keep markets for the export of our goods."" I had been hopeful of seeing the expansion of considerable trade, in the matter of flour, fruits, and cattle, between Western Australia and the islands and peoples generally of the north and east; but now we must look for reprisals, and is it all worthwhile ?

There must be something in the nature of reciprocity in a trade of this kind. I was surprised to hear the statement made by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Burchell) in regard to the attitude taken up by certain business people in his constituency. The honourable member for Swan (Mr . Prowse), when this question was before us on a previous occasion, read letters dated 27th May of this year; in which certain f r u it and produce merchants carrying on business in Perth pointed out that at considerable expense they had built up a trade with the islands to the north and countries to the east in connection with the banana industry. In 'a letter to me, one of these firms, writing in May last, stated thatDuring the past few years we have interested ourselves in the Java trade, and now have a considerable amount of capital invested in it. This has enabled us to provide a. good outlet for Western Australian fresh fruit. Take grapes, for instance. Previously we have exported a few hundred cases each year; this year we have sent out about 3,000 cases, obtaining high prices for the Western Australian grower. We would point out that it is only because we are reciprocating hy taking their goods that we are able to do this. The new duty of ld. per lb. is too heavy to allow of the successful importation of bananas from Java, which is the only practical source of supply. Consequently we fear the loss of our investments. I wish to emphasize the point that this trade between Java and Western tralia has been built up only as the result of our taking bananas from that The trade that Western Australia is doing with the islands to the north is three times as great as that which they are doing with us. We have established in and around the southern portions of Western tralia a big fruit industry, and the Java market for that fruit will be destroyed unless we are able in return to import bananas from that country. Where are the people along the north-west coast of Western Australia to get fresh fruit if this supply be cut off 1 - Surely those who are trying to develop that part of the continent-the people in and about Carnarvon, Roeburne, Port Hedland, Bar, Broome, and many other places-are deserving of some consideration. I sent a telegram 'a little while ago to the then Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Wise), pointing out that he was able to allow tram rails to come in free of duty under the heading: of machine tools and appliances, and asking him whether bananas could not be classified as a medicine, and allowed as such to come in free Mr Gregory. of duty. He was not prepared, however, to entertain that proposal. If we could induce people to settle in the tropical parts of Western Australia, there is no doubt that bananas and other tropical fruits would ultimately be grown there. So far, however, we have not been able to do so. Mr Despeissis, a specialist who was apv pointed by the Western Australian Government to visit that part of the State, reported that it comprised big areas of very rich land with a splendid rainfall. In and around the Kimberleys there is some of the finest country in Australia; but the temperature is bad. and we shall have difficulty in settling that part of the - country. Until we can induce people to produce bananas in^the tropical parts of Western Australia, the Parliament should not be prepared to impose a duty of l d . per lb. on this f r u it . In the far-distant parts people have very little in the way of good fresh fruits, and it is essential that they should obtain a supply of bananas. Are they to wait until the people of whom the honourable member for Fremantle has spoken haveÂ» their plantations going? I very much doubt the advisability of handing over Western Australia's banana supply to those who have been enr deavouring to build up this trade. They are wholesalers and retailers, and I do Aus- not know whether, if these plantations were developed, the people would be better island. 'supplied than they are at present. The development of the country should, of course, be encouraged, but this heavy duty is absolutely unjustifiable. The Minister knows that great losses are suffered in conAus- nexion with the shipment of bananas from Java to Fremantle. The duty of 8s. 4d. per central has to be paid on a full consignment, and it is quite possible that, having regard to .the wastage that takes place, it may amount to 10s. or 15s. per central in respect of the marketable bananas actually delivered. I object to the duty as passed by the Committee, and hope that the request made by another place will be Marble agreed to. It offers a fair compromise. The duty accepted by this Committee absolutely astounded the people. It is preposterously high, and it has done us in finite harm. I hope that the good sense of the Committee will lead to the request for a reduction of that duty being agreed to, so that the people of Western Australia, by whom this f r u it is badly needed, will be able to obtain it at something like a moderate price. Customs Tariff",47
253,Mr BAYLE Y,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Oxley) [ 8 . 9 ] - It is to be regretted that the majority of honourable members have gained .their knowledge of bananas and the banana-growing industry from f r u it shops and f r u it trucks. If they were to visit Queensland or the northern rivers of New South Wales, and see'the industry as it is carried on there, they would realise what a great asset it is, not only to the districts in which the f r u it is grown, but to the whole of the Commonwealth. Despite what the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) has said, we have in Queensland vast areas suited to the production of bananas. It may not be known that bananas are grown as far north as Cooktown. It is true that few, if any, of the bananas grown, in the northern part of Queensland reach the southern markets, but that is due solely to shipping difficulties. The steamship Levuka, which was built specially for the banana trade between F i j i and Sydney, has during the last three or four months been on the No r t h Queensland run. The company operating that vessel has put her in commission there for the tourist traffic, and there is every hope that she will ultimately be used for the carriage of bananas from North Queensland ports as far South as Sydney. When that takes place, there will be no furthe r talk as to the impossibility of Queensland and the Northern Eiver districts of New South Wales supplying the whole of the Australian market in bananas. , Mr GREGORY - They cannot supply Western Australia.",49
254,Mr BAYLEY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I admit that there is some difficulty in so far as that State is concerned. Thank Heaven, however, all the people of Western Australia are not pessimists. It was a positive joy to hear the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr. Burchell) speak as he did. He gives us a ray of hope that the people of Western Australia will try to help themselves in regard to the banana industry. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) said that incalculable damage had been done Australia by the imposition of the duty of l d . per l b . If , however, the imposition of that duty has induced the two firms mentioned by the honourable member for Fremantle to embark on the industry in Western Australia, then it can only be said that it has done incalculable good. The objections raised to the duty as passed by this Committee some months ""jl'A OCTOBER, 1921.] Bill. 11965 ago are based very largely on 'the fact that middlemen have been able to make large profits out of the industry. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay), when addressing himself to the question earlier this afternoon, mentioned that it is necessary to cut bananas while they are in a more or less green state in order that they may be placed on the southern market in sound condition, and that, because of this, the marketing of them could not be handled by the growers direct. The ' green bananas are bought up *by men known in the trade as ""ripeners,"" who store them, and place them on the market when they become fit for consumption. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) was bitter in his denunciation of the middlemen and the profits which they take unto themselves. He expressed the hope that the time would soon come when the Queensland growers would co-operate and place their f r u it upcn the market by means of their own direct agencies. I should like honourable members to realise that a co-operative movement of that kind cannot be entered upon u n t i l the growers .are assured of a steady market. In the past they have not had that assurance. They knew that any day a shipment of bananas from F i j i might reach Sydney simultaneously with a large consignment from Queensland, with the result that the market would be glutted, and the return would not pay them for the cost of conveying the f r u it to that city. If the duty passed by this Committee be retained, however, the growers will be assured of a reasonable return for their labour. They are not unmindful of the fact that should the price of bananas go beyond a certain point the general public will cease to buy them. There is a price beyond which bananas will not be purchased by the average in dividual.. Rather than pay such a price, he would spend his money in buying some other f r u it , such as Tasmanian apples. We should not forget 'that the Tariff Board will have all these matters under supervision, and should it be proved to its satisfaction that the growers are unduly "" bulling "" the market, Parliament will be informed, and we shall have an - opportunity to prevent it . The honourable member for Swan dealt with F i j i as well as with Java, and lamented that our trade with F i j i has fallen off in a marked degree. He neglected to say that, although the Levuka has been taken from, the F i j i trade, the Suva is still ning, and the trade between F i j i and Australia is still' of very great sions. The honourable member for Perth dealt with the high cost of land used the cultivation of bananas. He looked the fact that the average bananathe welfare of Australia generally. grower is content with a very small age. A farm of 15 acres is sufficient him. When it is remembered that land used for the growth of bananas is, in virgin ^tate, covered with very thick scrub, and costs anything from Â£40 to Â£50 per acre to clear, and that on a 15-acre farm there.may be erected a more or less substantial house, with storing sheds and other conveniences, it will seen that the overhead charge per acre amounts to a very considerable sum. We cannot compare the cost per acre banana land with the cost per acre of land suitable for the growth of wheat. ",49
255,Mr BAYLEY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"A man requires a larger acreage for a vineyard than for the growth of bananas. The class of land suitable for a vineyard is not as expenbelieve, sive to bring under cultivation as is the soil required for the successful production tion of bananas. It must further borne in mind that a vineyard will last for many years, and that there is pracstrict tically no limit to the life of a grape",50
256,Mr GREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,There is higher protecChinese tion on grapes than on bananas.,50
257,Mr BAYLEY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"As I mentioned when this matter was previously discussed in this Chamber, ithe banana is a great feeder. Although it comes into bearing within eighteen (months, it is found that at the end of five years the land on which bananas are growing is practically worked out, and must be discarded that purpose. These things should taken into consideration, and the question should also be regarded from the point of view of the national welfare of Australia. Every member of the Committee realizes the necessity for peopling the north of Australia. The fostering of the bananapatriation, industry will prevent settlers being forced into the back blocks of the interior. I will induce them to take up coastal lands. Many things might be said in favour of the advantages to be gained by settling people on our coastal lands. I know no reason for the objection to the duty on bananas at first agreed to by the runmittee if it be not, I will not say the selfishness, but the self-interest, of people dimenof States in whioh the banana is not grown. They are disposed to view this for matter solely from the point of view of overtheir own pockets, and do not consider I acrehope the Committee will adhere to its for previous decision, and will retain the duty at 8s. 4d. per central, which, as the its Minister has pointed out, is only equal to the duty imposed on citrus fruits.",50
258,Mr WIENHOLT,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Moreton) [8.20] For a representative of a Queensland constituency, and especially one holding the be views on Tariff matters which I have expressed, this is, perhaps, a question on which silence might be said to be golden. of However, one question has been raised during the debate, amongst others, by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr. Mackay), who directed attention to the measures passed by the Queensland Parliament affecting the Chinese engaged in this particular industry. In common, I with every other true Australian, I am opposed, of course, to the introducinto this country of any Asiatics. I be should say at the same time that I have often wondered how it is that, with the laws we have, and have had for vine. many years in Australia against their introduction, there should be so many in this country as we see here even now. But as we have a number"" of Chinese in Australia, who, I presume, are legally and rightfully here, I believe they could not be better employed than in producing something from the land, and especially any commodity such as the banana, which is, after all, a valuable and a poor man's food. When I was a memfor ber of the Queensland Parliament, a be measure was passed prohibiting the Chinese from following the occupation of cook. If it is right to prohibit their employment in this and in that occupation, the logical thing to do would be to go further and propose their expulsion or rewith or without compensation. After the war I returned on a transport t on which there was a Chinese private of the Australian Imperial Force. He was born, no doubt, in Australia, but was, I believe, the son of full-blooded Chinese of parents. That soldier wore the D.C.M., the Military Medal, and a bar to the ComMilitary Medal. I appeal to any soldier in the Committee to say whether he on thinks that 9uch a man won his view decorations undeservedly. I say hesitatingly that that man is as good a man as is any member of this Committee. I bring the incident forward not with a view to altering the decision of per lb., 4jd. any member of the Committee on this matter, but in order that we might be warned, in dealing with these questions, for not to be induced by any almost unconmovescious prejudice against doing anything which might afterwards appear to us have been in any way unfair or unwith British.

259,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) move That the requested amendment be made. This is one of the items which I prothat mised to look into when the Tariff was going through this Chamber; and it has, investigation, been found necessary, in of the sugar position, to give some unadditional protection to preserved ginger.

260,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Richmond-Minister Trade and Customs) [8.31] - I That the requested amendment be not made. to I presume that the Senate, in dealing this item, considered that prunes did not require any higher duty than the of the dried fruits, and tried to bring the whole into line. There are two reasons why I think we should give slightly additional protection to prunes. .One reason is that this is a comparatively new industry, and the other that prunes are subject to a special for m of competition to which other d r i e d . f r u it s are AYES. not. Our prunes have to compete against the end-of-the-season trade of America, and that acts most prejudicially to our growers. The American f r u it is dumped here at a comparatively low price at the end of the season to clear out stocks; and the result is the destruction of our market just at the time when our new season's f r u it is coming in . Honora'ble members will, no doubt, recollect that this was one of the recommitted items. During the original discussion here, a request was made for an increased duty of, I think, - 6d. per lb., and I promised to NOES. go thoroughly into the whole question, so Maxwell, G. A. that when the item was recommitted. I should be able to deal with it . This I did, and on the strength of the inquiries made, and the information we were able to gather, we increased* the duty on prunes from 3d. to 4$d., which, I think, is full y justified.",51
261,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Is not 4d. per lb. a very fair impost?,51
262,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Unde r all the circumstances, I think that 4-Â£d. is about the fair thing.",51
263,Mr FOWLER,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Perth) [ 8 . 3 5 ] - I do [8.30] - I not think it matters in the least whether Ave make the duty 4d. or 4-Â£d - it might just as well be 4s. The prune is a f r u it is grown without the slightest trouble or difficulty almost anywhere a person cares to stick in a tree. The cultivation is of the simplest, and the curing of the f r u it is also, a simple matter. At the present time, the price of prunes in Australia is about 100 per cent, higher than in other countries that are not subject to excessive duties, so that we practically pay double prices for every pound we buy today. This kind of thing prevails right throughout the dried-fruit trade.",51
264,Mr HILL,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,How many kinds of prunes are there?,52
265,Mr FOWLER,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,There are various kinds.,52
266,Mr HILL,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,And what are the prices?,52
267,Mr FOWLER,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"There is practically no difference in price; the Australian f r u it is sold at one price, and there is one kind of prune right throughout Australia.",52
268,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Tha b is nob,52
269,Mr FOWLER,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"If a person goes into a retail place and asks for prunes he takes simply what is given him, because he does not know one prune"" from another. There are various kinds of prunes grown in different parts of the world. The French prune is excellent quality, and is subject to special conditions in growth and preparat i o n ; but, so f ar as my experience goes, we in Australia do nob know what we are getting, except that it is a dried plum of some kind or other. However, I do not think it worthwhile making any fuss about the difference between 4^d. and 4d.; in either case the duty practically means prohibition against the importation of the f r u it into Australia. Motion agreed to. Item 53Fruits, dried, viz. :- . . . per Ib., 3d. &enate-'& Request - Inser t new sub-item(D) Apples, pears, peaches, nectarines, and apricots, dried or evaporated, per lb., 4d.

270,Mr FOLEY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Eialgoorlie) [8.38] - In view of the big increase in the duty requested by the Senate, I think that the Minister (Mr Greene) should give us a little information before he so readily asks us to accept it . If this requested amendment be made it will be a direction to the people in the trade to add the in creased duty to.the price. No one can say with any reason that if this duty be imposed the people in the trade will pay it themselves, for we know that it is sure. to be passed on to the consumer.",52
271,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Dampier) [8.39] To my mind the dried f r u it industry should become a great one in Australia, and I would do a good deal to aid in nicking it prosperous. When we consider the history of fruit-growing in Australia, and the marvellous progress of Mildura, we not only realise the great value of an in dustry of the sort, but wonder how it comes that an increase in the duty is demanded. W it h the duty of 3d., which has hitherto prevailed, the industry at Mildura and throughout the country has progresed by leaps and bounds Magnificent dried f r u it , of which we can well be proud, is produced, and I am looking forward to a large export trade. We must, however, also consider the consumso. ing public. In view of this continued prosperity, land at Mildura is worth large sums, and under the De Garis movement people have made enormous fortunes. I see no danger to the industry if the old duty be retained. Question-That the requested amend of ment be made-put . The Committee divided. Ayes . . .. . . 36 Noes . . .. . . 11 Majority ' 25 AYES.

""When this item was previously before the and Committee, a discussion arose as to whether these articles of attire were made in any quantity in Australia. I am quite satisfied that the imposition of this duty has led to the local manufacture of corsets on a very large scale; and that if the proposals I am now submitting to the Committee are accepted there will be a or considerable extension of the industry. The latest information I have is that a factory is almost completed in Sydney, which, when in full working order, will be capable of ' turning out over 600,000 pairs of corsets per annum.",54
284,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"""We heard a lot of these fairy tales when the Tariff was before the Committee previously. '",54
285,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"If the honourable member will inspect the factory in 'Sydney, he will agree with me as to the value of this industry and the possibility of extending it. The Inter-State Commission reported fihat, in their opinion, there was no reason why corsets should bear a lower duty than the rest of wearing apparel; and, following upon that recommendation, and in view of the information we had obtained regarding the progress of the industry in Australia and its proposed further development, we agreed to eliminate corsets as a separate item in the Tariff, and include them under the apparel duty. I feel confident that if the Senate's request were acceded to, we should revert to the old conditions, when practically all the corsets required were imported, representing a value of Â£300,000 - per annum. Inasmuch as I feel quite sure that we can make in Australia all the corsets that are required, and thus give employment to a large number of people, the duties I am now proposing are very modest, and will probably be acceptable to the Senate.",54
286,Mr BAMFORD,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Herbert) [9.10] - I asked the Minister (Mr Greene) to consider this requested amendment in per cent.; connection with the one which follows. Item 110 (B ) comprises "" A p parel, n.e.i., for the human body, partly or wholly made up, including material cut into shape there for; also materials defined by pattern or design for manufacture into apparel,"" and the duties per passed by this House were 40 per cent., 50 per cent., and 55 per cent. What does thÂ© Minister intend to do when we reach the next amendment, which proposes to add a new sub-item relating to woven underskirts, undervests, underpants, and combinations, on which the Senate has proposed duties of 30 per cent., 40 per cent., and 45 per cent. ? The made-up garments are to bear practically the same duty as is imposed on the material defined by pattern or design for manufacture into apparel. I was shown in Sydney material called Cooltex, of which many of these garments are made, and the manufacturers complained that the raw material is subject to almost the same duty as is imposed on the made-up garment.",54
287,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.131 - The honourable member has been wrongly informed. The materials that are imported for manufacture into corsets are piece goods, and are not defined by pattern or design for manufacture into apparel. The articles to which the honourable member refers are nearly complete garments. The object of subjecting them to the full apparel duty was to insure'that as much of the work as possible would be done in this country, and that the garments - should be made up right from the piece goods. Corsets are made from piece goods, which are admitted free of duty.",55
288,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Wakefield) [9.14""] - I remind the Committee that the representations regarding the' extent of the Australian manufacture of corsets are so much nonsense, and there is not likely bo be any material increase of local manufactures. The higher-grade corset is not made in the Commonwealth at all. The proposed duty is good for revenue purposes, and that is its only redeeming feature. It is not fair to lead the community to think that the new corset-making industry will supply the requirements of Australia straight away.",55
289,Mr LAZZARINI,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Werriwa) [9.15] I was not aware that corset3 were being manufactured in Australia in any quantity, because when I left the trade it was impossible to purchase an Australianntade article that could be sold over the counter to the average purchaser. I do not know what development has taken place in the last eighteen months or two years, but at the time of which I speak the wholesale houses were not handling any Australian-made corsets. If the article submitted by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), which is priced at 42s., is the Only type that can be produced, it cannot be expected to meet with a ready sale, because the wife or daughter of the average working man would not be in a position to purchase at what is practically a prohibitive price. Years ago retailers were selling Canadian corsets at 3s. l i d . and 4s. l i d . per pair; but they are not procurable today owing to the altered conditions. Speaking from memory, I believe the highest price ruling towards the end of the war was from 102s. to 108s. per dozen; but now it is possible to procure only three pairs for an amount which would previously purchase a dozen pairs. I do not feel disposed to oppose a duty if there is an industry in Australia which is in a position to meet all our requirements;, but before givingthe Minister's proposal my support I would like to have some guarantee in that direction. Of course, there are some women in our community who would willingly pay 42s., and who would not care if a duty of 200 per cent, were imposed. If the Australian manufacturers can p""lace their corsets on the market at a price at which they can easily be purchased by all sections, I am in favour of an adequate protective duty being levied; but up to the present I have not seen any indication of that being done. If the manufacturers in Australia have made such rapid strides that they can meet the demands of the people of Australia when previously they could not supply anything, it is a wonder that their product is not more readily obtainable. I have been under the impression that the only Australian-made corsets available were tailored or hand-made articles, and if there are others being manufactured in any quantity I would be pleased to hear of it. I believe in adequate protection to all Australian industries; but I regard it as a misguided policy to protect one or two small industries and enable those conducting them to become wealthy at the expense of the purchasers. That is what would happen in this instance. Judging from my past experience I cannot, without proof, accept the statement that the Australian manufacturers can supply the requirements of the wives and daughters of working men at a reasonable price.",55
290,Mr JOWETT,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Grampians) [ 9 . 2 0 ] rise under a deep sense of responsibility endeavour to impress upon the Committee the necessity of supporting the Senate's request for the reduction of this item. As the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) suggests, by interjection, corsets should be brought within the reach of al h It will be remembered when this matter was before. the Commatter mittee some months ago, I asked the M ister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Greene) whether he considered corsets luxury or a necessity. I will not that he gave me a flippant answer, but terests. that he, like the Chancellor in Tennyson's poem- i . . . dallied with his golden chain, And smiling put the question by. Up to the present, I have been unable to obtain any information on this point, either from the Minister or from member of the Committee, and I thereundertaking fore turned, as a last resource, to the formation supplied in the daily press. I doing so, I found that a charming lady friend of mine, who is the the Housewives' Association- a very i m portant body, representing a most in fluential, section of the community-ad dressed a meeting in the Town H all , Melbourne, on 1st September, and in ferring to the price of corsets, Mrs Glenthis cross saidMen do not seem to see the necessity of corsets. They do not seem to care a button whether we wear them OT not. I regard this as a serious reflection intelligence and judgment, and we only free ourselves from the painful proach by directing ourselves more serithe ously to the question than we have done before. There was a time when such charge could not be made against memonly bers of this Chamber, and when, to quote the words of Edmund GosseLife, that when youth was hot and bold Leapt up in scarlet and in gold, It seems, however, that l if e Now walks in solemn garb attest In russet and in silver dressed. Times have changed, and perhaps I may now quote the immortal words of Edmund Burke on this subject, when he saidBut, alas, the age of chivalry has gone, of sophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded, and the glory of Europe is guished forever. - I Having done my best to impress upon to honourable members the seriousness of the question, I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to give the women a chance by reducing this monstrous impost, and to agree to the request made by the Senate to lower the duty.",56
291,Mr WATKI NS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Newcastle) [9.26] that It was not my intention to speak on this had it not been for the speech in - delivered by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), who, instead of a fighting for the women of our community, say .was apparently considering his own in I have had an opportunity of visiting' the factories where Australian corsets are made, and I am convinced that the industry is one that should be encouraged. I presume the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) has > considered this matter very carefully, and has come to the conclusion that the duty any suggested is necessary. In an industry the higher grade work, a in - large number of women are employed, n and if operations are carried out as they are in Canada the industry should have President of adequate protection.",56
292,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Dampier) [9.28] - I trust the Committee will support the in suggestion submitted by the Senate to rereduce the duty on imported corsets. When item was previously under consideration, I endeavoured to impress upon honourable members that the duty imposed is a heavy tax upon the womenfolk in our community, and unless we have"" concrete evidence that there is a big industry being on our profitably conducted in the Commoncan wealth we should not impose heavy reduties. Statistics show that for 1919; latest figures available-the total importations were valued at Â£876,000, and a the Australian production was equal to 3 per cent. About 97 per cent, of the corsets used were imported principally from America and Great Britain . Only Â£36,000 worth of corsets were made in Australia. We have heard that cotton ' socks and stockings were being manufactured in the Commonwealth to such an extent that the trade could be supplied. The same has been said concerning corsets, and in order to prove if such were the case the Housewives' Association directed two ladies to visit the shops to ascertain that if Australian corsets were available, and extinthey reported that they were unprocurable.",56
293,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Severa l firms are advertising and selling them.,57
294,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I know that there is a firm in Sydney making corsets, but until 1920 the industry was not successful is Australia, though there have always been a few persons making corsets to order. Apparently very few of the locally made corsets have yet come into use. The Minister (Mr Greene) now asks us to agree to a duty on the American and other foreign corsets of 45 per cent., and on British corsets of 30 per cent. lady wishes to buy the style of corset that suits her best, and undoubtedly the American manufacturers, having paid more attention to hygiene than their British rivals, have won a popularity for their goods which insures them a more ready sale. The Senate requests us to make the duty on corsets 25 per cent, on the general Tariff and 15 per oent. against Great Britain. Surely those rates are high enough to enable our manufacturers to keep this market, especially when in addition to them there is the natural protection-perhap s not very large-and the exchange protection, which amounts to a great deal. I hope that the Committee will give effect to the request of the Senate.",57
295,Dr MALONEY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Melbourne) [ 9 . 3 4 ] shall vote for the Minister's proposal. Over fort y years ago an expert stay maker came here from. London and employed a few hands at corset making, but the industry was not supported. honourable member for Dampier (Mr : Gregory) has given us the Free Trade arguments, but none are so blind as those who will not see. While he has some admirable qualities, he is as blind as a bat with Tegard to the virtues of Australian manufactures - The corset which I have here can be bought for Â£ 2 2s., and that is not considered dear. I understand that certain material, which comes from AlsaceLorraine, is used for some kinds of corsets, and that, when imported in the piece, it has to pav a duty of 40 per oent.",57
296,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,No .,57
297,Dr MALONEY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"It is time we had some women in Parliament. were women here to speak for their sex, there would not be so much foolishness spoken on their behalf as we now hear. Thirty years ago I moved in this ber to separate women from the criminals and lunatics with whom they were classed in being deprived of the' right to vote. Woman has since obtained some of her rights, but she is not yet the political equal of man. This Parliament is not as civilized as that of Finland, which has twenty-two women in a House of 200 members. On one occasion, when there was some labour trouble, the care of the principal city was intrusted to a committee elected from these twentyEvery two women. I believe that the Australian woman and girl would prefer the Australian article to an imported one'. Because of the trickery of trade, boots manufactured in this city are sometimes sold as American or English goods. If this Parliament has not the power, the State Parliament should make it a criminal offence to sell goods under a wrong description. Let us, like the Americans do, glory in our country and have f a it h in her productions. I am sure that the women will support that view.",57
298,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Maribyrnong) [9.37] The honourable member for Werriwa. (Mr Lazzarini) realizes that he made a mistake when he said that Australian-made . corsets could not be - I purchased for less than Â£ 2 2s. a pair, which is more than the worker's wife can afford to pay. He has since seen seme samples, which he has examined carefully, that are priced at a The much lower figure. I understand that some dorsets are made in Australia which usual can be bought for 5s. a pair. Others of better quality are dearer, going up to Â£ 2 2s. a pair. Naturally, those made of the bettor materials are dearer than others, just as a suit made of good tweed costs more than, one made of moderate quality. I am one of those who would give the Australian manufacturer a chance in respect to this as well as other lines. We have been given evidence this afternoon that the imposition of aduty has reduced the price of certain clommodities considerably. According to the Minister, our manufacturers are now making"" hundreds of thousands of pairs of corsets. If there Mr MASSYGREENE - There are three .firms which are manufacturing on a big scale. One of the plants, which is working at . full capacity, is, I understand, capable Chamof making 624,000 pairs a year.",57
299,Mr FENTON,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"With , the other two firms manufacturing as well, there is no reason why the Australian demand should not be satisfied. People who are judges of corsets 'tell me that those made here are really first class articles, and are of a hygienic shape. I believe there were times when the articles made here were not of such a character, but more common sense is being used today in the manufacture of both men's and women's clothing. I support this Australian industry.",58
300,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Wakefield) [9.42] - If the Minister (Mr Greene) will not make a more reasonable compromise, I must support the suggestion of the Senate. The proposed duty would impose an outrageous and unjustifiable burden on almost every home in Australia. Only a few countries excel in the manufacture of corsets. The trade is very different from what it was five or ten years ago. For hygienic purposes, there is a class of goods manufactured today that is enoi'monsly costly compared 'with those of pre-war days and the old style of corsets.",58
301,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Are you opposing the duty ?,58
302,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Yes .,58
303,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,You voted for it last time.,58
304,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"No , I opposed it unsuccessfully. Including even the lowest type of corset manufactured here, there is an insignificant supply of the locally-made article to meet the demands of Australia. We should not put on a duty of 40 per cent, or 50 per cent, when this country will not manufacture the higher class of corset, perhaps, for the next ten years. The duty is simply , a revenue-producing one, and the revenue thus raised often comes out of homes which can ill-afford to pay it. The Minister has provided for a'Tariff Board, and for machinery for the investigation of the operations of this Tariff. It is for the purpose of showing whether the people are unduly imposed upon, whether a growing industry is being strangled for want of generous treatment, or whether the protection already afforded is too high. As the Board will soon be in operation, I hope the Minister will be a little more considerate, at all events, to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom and America are the countries where the best corsets are manufactured.",58
305,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,You did vote for this duty last time.,58
306,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I was not under the impression that I did; but I did let a good many items go through because of the mad, unreasonable attitude of honourable members on the question of Protection. I certainly spoke in favour of making corsets in this country, because I want to see as many goods manufactured here as possible, but there is a limit to the price that the people can pay.",58
307,Mr MATHEWS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Melbourne Ports) [9.46] - Like the Minister (Mr. Greene) I was somewhat surprised to - hear the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) say that he opposed the duty, because I remember well that he voted for it. The Senate set out deliberately to assist the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) to injure this industry., HonotrabUe members in another place must have known that the proposed 15 per cent, duty against the United Kingdom might as well have been wiped oub altogether. Australia has a population of about 5,000,000, and any other country producing this article to any great extent could flood our market at the end of the season with, at any rate, 500,000 or 1,000,000 pairs. Australia ought to be able to manufacture corsets for itseK. We cannot, of course, supply the quantity of manufactured goods required in Australia, and it is simply because we have not given manufacturers the opportunity to produce sufficient. Does any honourable member think that people with money will put hundreds of thousands of pounds into an industry without any hope of getting it protected? I heard the debate on this item in another place. Many honourable senators are like the honourable member for Dampier. They have no use for Australian made goods. The honourable member is honest enough to admit that he does not care a rap whether an article is manufactured here or not if it has to be bolstered up by a high protective duty; but he must kuow that it is impossible for any Australian manufacturer to compete in the corset-making industry under a protective duty of 15 per cent. At the end of any season in Great Britain the. British manufacturers could dump corsets into Australia to put half of the workers in the Australian industry out of employment. All articles of apparel are subject to changes of fashion. Manufacturers of goods so affected are only too glad to dump theirsurplus in other countries, where they may be able to place them with advantage, even at prices lower than those charged by them in their own countries. We would do the same in Australia if we were able to manufacture articles in sufficient quantities. For years in the State of Victoria the producers sold their wheat and other farm products at a cheaper rate for export than they charged for' them locally. ",58
308,Mr MATHEWS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,The honourable member does not know what he is talking about. In 1908 flour was sold for export at 10s. per ton cheaper than the Melbourne price. If we want to build up a corset-making industry we must have higher duties than those requested by the Senate. I am surprised that the Minister (Mr Greene) should have caved into the extent of suggesting a rate of only 30 per cent. British.,59
309,Mr LAZZARINI,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"The effective rate under the Minister's proposal will be 45 per cent., because very few corsets come here from Great Britain.",59
310,Mr MATHEWS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"There are corsetmakers in Great Britain, and they would be only too pleased to send their articles here if it would pay them to do so. The margin proposed by the Minister against them is notsufficient.",59
311,Mr GREGORY,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"On whab basis is it necessary to have a high duty on corsets ? Why will not a rate of 15 per cent, suffice?",59
312,Mr MATHEWS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"I would place a duty of 1,000 per'cent, on every article that could be manufactured here. The honourable member would not propose any duty. That is the difference between us. We are as far apart in our views on this subject as are the poles, but I am representing a section of the Australian people, whereas one would think the honourable member was representing foreigners. I [478 ] hope that the Minister will not be so weakkneed in regard to other requests. Mr MoWILLIAMS (Franklin) [9.59]. - The figures given by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) should make the Committee pause. He has told us that corsets were purchased before the war at Â£ 5 5s. per dozen.",59
313,Mr LAZZARINI,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,They were sold as low: as Â£ 3 3s. per dozen.,59
314,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,Australia n manufacturers are turning out one style of corsets at Â£3 per dozen.,59
315,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"Le t us take 9s. or 10s. as the price at which a good corset could be purchased at the time of which I am speaking. The articles exhibited to the Committee were quoted at 42s., and the honourable members for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) and Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster), who are experts, assured us that they were by no means high class. An expenditure of 42s. represents a very considerable portion of the weekly wage of a large number of workers in Australia. The prices before the war were 5s. l i d . , 9s. 6d., and 12s. 6d. I can quite understand the advocacy of high duties in the case of big industries, although I cannot agree with it , but in the case of an article of common use high duties are indefensible. If the price of such articles is made very much higher, the penalty upon the people of Australia becomes very great. Such articles as corsets are in almost universal use from one end of the country to the other. The Minister (Mr Greene) ought to have stated how many corsetswere imported into Australia, and how many were made in this country. Numbers of small industries are being coddled in the big cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and it would pay the people of Australia to give every employee in many of' them Â£5 per week to engage in some other business. The Committee has not been shown to what extent the Australian trade is being supplied by the Australian manufacturer. If , as I am informed, only an infinitesimal portion of the local requirements is manufactured in Australia, the people are being compelled to pay an enhanced price, not only on the small number made here, but also on the total number used. The Tariff is a monstrosity from start to finish. In some parts nf 11976 Customs Tariff [REPRESENTATIVES.] Maranoa during the recent by-election the Tariff now before the Committee had more to do with the outcome of the contest than anything else. I am speaking particularly of those parts of the electorate that I visited. Is it worthwhile to foster an dustry that is turning out only an infinitesimal portion of the number of corsets required; and is it fair to place on the whole of the people of Australia the burden of increased prices for every pair of corsets that they buy? Rich people do not care what they have to - pay. The working people are the real sufferers. It is not a fair deal. I hope the Senate's requested amendment will be agreed to.  honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) said he thought it would be an advantage if we had women membars of this House. I think that, for the consideration of many subjects, it might be advantageous were women privileged to help in the government of the country. They would enlighten certain honourable members. I would refer the honourable member for Melbourne to the counsel of Mrs Booth, head of the Women's National Council. The matter that we have before us is very serious. If Australian manufacturers could make corsets, or any other requirements of Australia, of a proper quality, and in sufficient quantity, it would be infinitely more reasonable to prohibit the importation of them entirely. What I object to is giving a fabulous 55 per cent, protection, such as was given to the corset industry. It only tends to aggravate the iniquitous system of centralization that has grown up in Australia. All our leading newspapers are lamenting the position that we now find ourselves in in this regard. honourable member for Melbourne Ports is supporting that little centralization section like a jumper in the "" cheese"" that he represents, while he thinks that he represents the whole of Australia. He is the representative only of centralization. If we think that we can advance Australia by taking in each other's washing, we are on the wrong track. A few women in this hall of government would be a distinct advantage. It seems that if certain honourable members can quote that in some hole or corner in Australia a thing can be manufactured, they think they have a Bill. good case for Protection. The sympathetic Minister, the capitalists, and the Labour representatives, cheek by jowl, will support him. Occasionally one of them will slip, like the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini), on incorsets; and still more occasionally, like the honourable member, for Hunter (Mr. Charlton), on mining explosives. They bring up the arguments that we, on this side, consistently put forward, and they disclose where the shoe pinches. If the honourable members representing the cities think they can further aggregate the people in the cities, and, by force of numbers, exploit the other sections, they must be taught that there is a limit to that kind of thing. Otherwise Australia will be bled white. I have no objection to things being manufactured in Australia any more than 1 object to produce being grown in Australia. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports alleged that produce grown here had been sold in other parts of the world cheaper than in Australia. He may be able to cite certain instances where, possibly, contracts were made at prices which subsequently were below the local prices. The primary producers are favourable to maintaining contracts. The honourable member referred to the price of bread, but that was in the case of a contract. If contracts of any kind are undertaken in connection with the Tariff they should, of course, be honoured. I do not desire to see foreign-made goods and products supplant Australian manufactures under reasonable competition, but T object to the erection of a high Tariff wall. The tendency today is not to give the public the advantage of inordinate protection; it is divided between the manufacturer and the few people who assist him in his The factory, and, together, they exploit the people. I repeat that the Tariff should not be expected to do more than afford reasonable protection.",59
316,Mr WEST,LAND SETTLEMENT OF,"East Sydney) [10.11] I had expected that when this Committee came to consider the requests of another place there would be little need either to go over the old ground or to advance fresh argument, since the Government would naturally adhere to their original intentions except in cases where errors or omissions had to be rectified. In connection with the duty upon corsets, consideration was given to the item i other place during an all-night sitting, and it is very evident that justice was not done to the subject. The honourable mem be possessed of animosity against the dwellers in the big manufacturing cities - in fact, against almost all the people of Australia except those who live m his own electorate. Most of our city residents livo in the crowded areas because they have no option but to do so. Owners of land are so greedy and selfish that . they will not permit others to get away from the congested areas in order to make a living in the wide spaces and the open air. W it h respect to the sample corsets which have been displayed in this Chamber, it seems to me that all the artistic work put into them is mere waste, and is intended solely to add to their cost. But Australian makers can produce good utility corsets which can compare and compete with the productions of any country. One would think when listening to the opinions of some honourable members that the item dealing with corsets manufactured in Australia represented something new. I point out that corsets were dealt with in the Tariff schedule of 1908 and of 1914, and that the duties today are lower than those imposed previously. Yet the rent of premises nsed for the manufacture of corsets was much lower in 1908 than today, and wages were much lower. On the whole, the corset manufacturing industry is a credit to Australia, and should be reasonably encouraged. Every enlightened community realizes that it is essential to create and encourage secondary in dustries. I cannot appreciate seriousness of the requested amendment. I cannot think that honourable senators were in earnest when they framed their request. They failed to do themselves justice. I understand that before a vote was taken upon this item in the Senate there were not enough members of the Committee to carry on the business, and that others had to be awakened from their sleep to provide a quorum. Honourable senators were absolutely demented under the pressure of an all-night sitting They were not wide awake when the vote was taken and did not know what they were doing.

I find that in nine cases out of ten, honourable members who, after .visiting .tie latrines, used to resort to the lavatory to wash their hands, now fail to do so. In these days, when, so much, attention is paid to the health of the individual, I think that the lavatory should be in the most convenient position, and that, failing a retarn to the old order of things, a washbasin should be provided in tie latrine.",61
318,Mr SPEAKER,WAR PENSIONSAPPROPRIATIO N," Owing to the shortage of accommodation in this building, it was found necessary to rent, at very considerable cost, outside offices for the use of one of the Parliamentary Committees. When the new rooms were being added to the north wing of this building, it was thought wise to remove the lavatory in .the main corridor to what was considered to be an equally convenient, though less conspicuous position. That change released a large room in the most prominent part of the building, which can now be made available for one of the Committees, so that a considerable saving in the annual Tentals now being paid for outside premises can be effected. With regard to the other suggestion made by the. honourable member, I shall be glad to submit it to the State architect for his consideration. I think it would be very convenient if what the honourable member has suggested could be done. - Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.30 p.m.",62
