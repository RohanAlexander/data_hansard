2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"(IO.OI a.m.}-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. On 27 May I presented the report of the Advisory Committee on the Proposed Creation of a Department of Parliamentary Information and Reporting Services and foreshadowed a response to the committee's recommendations in the budget sittings. The bilI now before the House implements the recommendations of. the committee's majority report which the President and I have accepted. Accordingly, the bilI provides for the creation of the Department of Parliamentary Library and Reporting Services to replace the current Department of the Parliamentary Library, DPL, and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, DPRS. The bill provides that the new department wilI come into existence on I. July 1994. The introduction of a bill by a Speaker is an unusual procedure, but has occurred in the past with proposed legislative changes which related solely to the parliament. The principal advantage of the merger of the two departments will be improvements in the provision of information services to the parliament. The new department will comprise the Parliamentary Library, Hansard, the Parliamentary Information Systems Office and the Sound and Vision Office, all of which will operate as separate client service programs supported by a single administrative and corporate management structure. This wilI give the parliament two service departments, one providing information services, the other-the Joint House Department-providing physical services. The President and I believe that this structure is the most appropriate and effective one for the parliament. We do not believe that any further reduction in the number of parliamentary service departments is warranted and we do not intend to propose that there be any further changes. 1993 Background Recent years have seen major developments in the provision of information services. Increasingly, the services provided by the Parliamentary Library, Hansard, the Parliamentary Information Systems Office and the Sound and Vision Office have become more interrelated and more interdependent. This trend will continue-indeed, accelerate. The merger of DPL and DPRS will place the parliament in a position to take the maximum advantage of developments in these areas, by bringing about much closer coordination of services and greater financial flexibility. The bringing together of the two departments into one.wilI allow for greater efficien-:cy in the corporate support areas and will lead to savings of around $1 million over the life of a parliament. The money saved will be used to enhance services to honourable members and senators. The savings will occur only as a result of attrition in staff numbers and only in the corporate services area of the new department. No present staff will lose their jobs, but as individuals are promoted, transferred, retire or resign, the positions vacated will be reviewed, and, where appropriate, not filled. No positions in the client services programs of the new departmentthat is, in the Library, Hansard, PISO or SAVO-wilI be affected. Honourable members would be aware that the task of supporting' the parliament has grown substantially in recent years, in part as a result of the additional facilities and services available in the new building but also as a result of the expansion of the work of committees of both chambers. The President and I wish to ensure there is, maximum cooperation and coordination between the parliamentary departments, consistent with the constitutional independence and roles of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Meetings of the heads of the parliamentary departments with the Presiding Officers have been a useful means of assisting in this process and the President and I are anxious to continue to develop this positive approach. . However, the President and I believe that there will need to be more frequent and more wide ranging meetings of department heads with the implementation of this proposal. We have therefore decided to establish. a more formal coordinating group comprising - eads of each parliamentary department to provide an effective forum for ensuring the most efficient use of all resources available to parliament. Advisory committee report The advisory committee's first recommendation was that a new parliamentary department be created to replace the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. This recommendation was based on 'the opportunity for the generation of savings which could be applied· to enhance information services provided to senators and members'. The committee further recommendedrecommendation 4-that the name of the new department be the Department 9f Parliamentary Library and Reporting Services. This title reflects the historical importance of both library and reporting services to the parliament. The committee's second recommendation was that a consultative group comprising representatives of management and staff of both departments be set up for a specified period to assist with the implementation of recommendation 1. The President and I have accepted this recommendation and have directed that a group be established from the consultative committees of both departments to carry out this task. The amalgamation of the corporate services areas of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the Department of the Parliamentary Library will result in appreciable financial savings. The committee recommended-recommendation 3-that the Presiding Officers seek the firm agreement of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) that the total appropriations for the two departments would be maintained in real terms for the new department. .This assurance was given to the advisory committee by the Department of Finance but the committee believed that ministerial level confirmation of this would be appropriate. The President and I have written to the Minister for Finance seeking his confirmation of this position. At present the Parliamentary Librarian is responsible to the parliament directly through the Presiding Officers and indirectly through the the Library Committee. The secretary to the new department will have administrative responsibility under the Public Service Act for the management and administration of the whole department, but the advisory committee recommended-recommendation 5-that the Parliamentary Librarian have the right of direct access to the Presiding Officers on library matters and be able to provide advice on matters within his or her professional responsibilities. This arrangement would be similar to that applying to the Chief Hansard Reporter since 1990. The President and I have accepted this recommendation. The Joint Library Committee provides a forum for honourable members and senators to discuss matters relating to the functions of the Parliamentary Library. The advisory committee recommended-recommendation 6-that the Parliamentary Librarian, as the person with responsibility for the day-today running of the library, be Secretary to the Library Committee or any equivalent body of honourable members and senators. The President and I have accepted this recommendation. The committee made a number of recommendations designed to preserve the perceived historical importance of the office of Parliamentary Librarian-and, by analogy, that of the head of Hansard. The first of these was-recommendation 7-that the positions of Parliamentary Librarian and Chief Hansard Reporter be statutory offices created under the Public Service Act 1922. The bill implements that recommendation, the purpose of which is to prevent the positions being abolished by administrative action and to ensure that they can be pensed with only by the parliament's amendfeasibility ing the Public Service Act. The proposed requirements. provision would not give the occupant of either position the authority or responsibility of a departmental secretary. Three offices are directly affected by the terms of the committee's recominendations: the Secretary to the new department, the Parliamentary Librarian and the Chief l:Ianstheless, ard Reporter. The committee recommendedour recommendation 8-that, in order to ensure that the positions were filled on merit, and were seen to be filled on merit,the positions of head of the new department, Parliamentary Librarian and Chief Hansard Reporter be advertised. The President and! have accepted that recommendation as well as the conseenable quent recommendation-recommendation 9that the library committee be consulted on the composition of selection panels for the tions of head of the new department and and Parliamentary Librarian. The President and would anticipate a member of the library committee being on the selection panels the latter positions. As a program of the new department, the Parliamentary Library will report on its operations as part of the new department's annual report. However, the committee has recommended-recommendation 1O-that a report from the Parliamentary Librarian in respect of his or her responsibilities be ed in the annual report of the department. This recommendation will be implemented including a specific Parliamentary Librarian's report in the new department's annual report. The committee's final recommendationthe recommendation 11-:-refers to the tabling the committee's report in both H:ouses parliament. This recommendation has already been implemented by the tabling of the report on 27 May 1993. The committee suggested, formal recommendation, that the Presiding Officers make a statement of principle cerning the library's independence. The committee identified two areas where, potenmajority tially, the library's ability to serve the parliaproduced ment could be affected: firstly, reduction services through management intervention disand, secondly, emphasis on technological rather than client information The continuation of the library committee, with unchanged terms of reference, and the ability of the Parliamentary Librarian to go directly to the Presiding Officers on library professional matters will provide significant safeguards against such eventualities. Neverthe President and I place/ on record commitment to the importance of the Parliamentary Library's role as a ,provider of independent information, research and advice to members and senators of all' parties, as well as independent members and senators. The President and I are also committed to the library continuing to be funded at a level to it properly to meet client needs. The committee commented on the need to clarify the roles and functions of the Parliaposimentary Information Systems Office-PISOits clients, principally the other parliaI mentary departmellts. This has been addressed by the Senior Management Coordination for Group-SMCG-of the five parliamentary departments in its report Review of the r;elationship between the parliamentary departments and f[SO: roles, responsibilities and funding arrangements, which has been endorsed by the heads of the parliamentary departments and by the President and me. Paragraphs 5.10.9 to 5.10.11 of the advisory inchidcommittee's report suggest the need for a review to clarify the functions and roles of the by various information providers within the parliament. Some aspects of this have been addressed in the SMCG report referred to, but possibility of overlap between the infor.of mation services offered by the library and of those offered by some other parliamentary departments is a matter of which the President and I,would hope all departments would be mindful. though not as a Minority· report Although members of both the gQvernment conand the opposition from both the House of Representatives and the Senate endorsed the report, three committee members a minority, dissenting report recomof mendillg ,that the' proposed creation, of the new department not proceed. As indicated by the introduction of the bill now before the House, this recommendation is not accepted by the President and me. The minority report also recommended that the majority and minority· reports be tabled and debated before the President and I make any response to the report and the dissenting report. The first part of this recommendation has been complied with. The President and I have considered the second part of the recommendation and have come to the conclusion that debate on the legislation currently before motion by Mr Keating: the House will provide senators and members with considerable opportunity to make their views known, particularly since they have had the opportunity to put their views to the committee. To ensure that members and senators have time properly to consider the proposal, which was first circulated to members and senators in September 1992, debate on this bill will not be .brought on until the autumn sittings next year-IS months after the proposition was first ppt forward. Conclusion The creation of the new department will benefit the .parliament by providing the potential for better information services to members and senators, better integration of available and future technologies and the ability to use a greater proportion of the parliament's resources on direct service delivery to members and senators as a result of more cost-effective corporate support structures. As a separate program of the new department, the library .will maintain its identity and high profile, just as Hansard has since the reorganisation of DPRS in 1990. The objective of the new department will be to provide the parliament with library, reportTitle ing, information technology and communications services of the highest possible quality. I reiterate the thanks of the President and me to all members of the advisory committee for their very careful and thoughtful considerbeen ation of the proposal. I also thank all those individual- and,organisations that assisted the committee in i-s delibtirations. I would also make particular mention of the formerSpeaker,the honourable member for Watson, Mr Leo MCLeay, not only for his role in establishing:the committee his continuing interest in the administration of the parliament. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Howard) adjourned. NATIVE TITLE BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed .from 23 November, on . That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Dr Hewson had moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House declines to give the Billa second reading, and (1) notes that"" as a consequence of the High Court's Mabo(No. 2). decision, Australia al{eady has a national native title system without the need for any legislative action; (2) acknowledges that, in order to meet the. requirements of the Racial Discrimination Act, a government dealing with native title must do so on a non-discriminatory basis in'c1uding the payment of just terms compensation for any extinguishment of native title; (3) condemns the. Keating Government for using the Bill to make an unnecessary intrusion into the land management responsibilities of State Governments; and (4) fllrther notes that the only additional federal law that may be necessary would be to facilitate the validation of past grants"".",11
3,Mr ELLIOTT,Unknown,"I am very pleased this morning to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Native Bill, and to give support to what that bill represents as an historic response to the Mabo High Court decision and the impact that has on Australia finally, belatedly, corning to grips with the needs, aspirations and desires of our indigenous people. This should have a debate that focused on the spirit of' reform, the spirit of opportunity and the challenge to the parliament. It is disappointing that, instead, the debate has focused on the old issues relating to states rights, federalism and an· unwillingness to come to grips with just how important land and land rights are to but also for indigenous people. I think a test of a nation's maturity is its ability to meet the needs and to satisfy the just claims of all its population, but particularnegotiation ly indigenous people. As other speakers in the debate have said, other countries have addressed this issue over the years. New Zealand, the United States and Canada are all examples of countries that have recognised how important land and the dispossession of land have been. Those countries have also recognised the importance of the correction of those issues in coming to grips with justice for indigenous peoples. When the High Court handed' down the Mabo decision, I think most of us felt it was an opportunity for Australia to take advantage of it. It is disappointing to note that the opposition has failed to grasp that opportunity. It is even more disappointing to see the spectacle where the Western Australian government, largely driven by political imperatives, has decided to take a particular course of action, and that automatically the coalition in the national parliament has fallen. in line with that view of the world. Some of the speakers in the debate so far have quite rightly pointed out just how unfortunate it is if states rights issues are let drive the debate. Listening last night to the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), for instance, I think it was clear that he is one who has had an extensive background in state and federalism issues and who understands the difficulty of trying to get a' national approach, a national response, and counteract the parochialism of the states. Much of the opposition's approach to this issue I think reflects just how unfortunate· it is that there has not been stronger leadership and stl'onger vision from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). ' The key aspects of the Mabo legislation can be put into four areas: it gives unambiguous recognition and protection of native title; provision for clear and certain validation of past acts, including grants and laws, if they have been invalidated because of the existence of native title'; a just and practical regime governing future grants and acts affecting native title; and rigorous specialised and accessible tribunal and court processes for determining claims to native title and for and decisions on proposed grants over native title land. The response to the High Court decision on Mabo has involved painstaking and detailed analysis, dialogue, and consultation with a whole range of groups to try to get those four objectives into legislation that represented not some sort of political fix, as the opposition's approach on Mabo is, but to get a principled outcome so that the nation could go forward believing quite rightly that it had met that fundamental test of nationhood maturity relating to land title. When we look at the response to that matter, we see that a national approach has been adopted through the Commonwealth's legislation. It is only the Commonwealth. parliament, when it is all said and done, that can ensure there is the appropriate national response. Certainly, we have regard to the issues relating to the role of states in land management but it should logically be the national parliament that passes laws to deal with the comprehensive matters that the High Court decision on Mabo requires. It is most unfortunate that speaker after speaker from the opposition has come iil here and basically railed against the High Court for the decision that it has taken. They are basically unwilling in many cases to recognise first of all the' fact that the court has brought down the decision relating to native title. that provides a historic opportunity but, secondly-and I think just as significantlY7they are unwilling to recognise that it gives the parliament a chance to show leadership, as a national parliament should, .and as the 1967 referendum suggests we not only should hut also are obliged and required to. I think the people around the world who are judging us on the queStion of indigenous people's rights and on our record of human rights can only look and wonder about political fixes such as the ones that the opposition has taken with its policy of being more concerned 'with trying to preserve some veneer of unity rather than actually trying to come to grips with the issue and show the vision and the opportunity that the High Court decision provided. All of those matters really are most disappointing and I think the debate, therefore, has lost some of the potential impact that it has and that is indeed most regrettable. To reinforce that, I think the views of a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Fred Chaney, who retired at the last election, are worth noting in this regard. As last Friday's Sydney Morning Herald stated: . . . the Federal Opposition's Mabo policy is that - it's ""a Liberal minimalist position"". Fred Chaney went on to say: But I am sorry there is not a hint of the possibiliprinciples ties of Mabo and no leadership on what could have been made of it. He said that there was no leadership. That is essentially what the former Liberal Minister .for Aboriginal Affairs has said in describing the opposition's approach to Mabo. In the . article written by Geoff Kitney in Friday's Sydney Morning Herald, he makes the observation, and I think again it is an appropriate one: Instead of seeing the High Court's Mabo decision as an opportunity to give a moral as well as an economic base to dealing with the terrible problems of a group of people on which large amounts of money have had little effect, the Coalition has seen it primarily as a threat to people who have always enjoyed a vastly better quality of life than Aboriginal people. As Fred Chaney might have added, the Coalition response is uninspiring and lacking in vision. The article goes on to state that it is more about the protection of the vulnerable position of the Leader of the Opposition than it is about concern for the people that the Mabo decision was directed towards and which the native title bill is directed towards. I think most people who have spent time looking at issues relating to Aboriginal people and their needs do come to the conclusion, quite rightly, that fundamental to justice and social justice for Aboriginal people is the issue of land and land rights. No-one pretends or has tried to pretend in this debate that there are not other needs that have to be met as far as Aboriginal people are concerned. Some honourable members have referred to the fact that there are questions relating to health, education, employment and other social demands and requirements that many in the Aboriginal community have that still need further attention. These needs always should be provided in the most appropriate fashion and with the most appropriate programs. Noone pretends that those things are not still valid, real and justifiable points to make as far as the well-being of Aboriginal people is concerned. What we also know about Aboriginal culture, like many others, is that rights to land are important. One of the fundamentals of recognition of a civilisation is to recognise the it stands by and the symbols it has. The rights a civilisation has over land are often one of those imperatives that are culturally important to that civilisation. In particular, when we look at the historical development of Aboriginal civilisation in Australia, we see just how pivotal the land rights issue is. That is why we cannot run away and just talk about the other problems, as real and as valid as they are. We do have to face up to the fact that the national government is genuinely concerned about the well-being of its indigenous peoples. We have to see land rights as one of those issues that cannot be fudged or ignored, one of those issues that does require the vision and leadership that I believe the Native Title Bill is providing. I certainly think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has met the test of what he claimed, quite rightly, in his address in Redfern was the government's fundamental threshold test as far as responding to Mabo is concerned. I want to commend those who have been involved in the preparation of the legislation, particularly the groups that have had consultations with the government and have been prepared to respond maturely and constructively. Everybody knows, as the Prime Minister said in his second reading speech, that this legislation is not about saying that everyone will get all they want, it is not about saying that there are not some people that still think there is more to be done; it is about trying to provide the best possible outcome as a response to the High Court decision and the best possible regime to provide both effective land management into the future and fundamentally the recognition of Aboriginal peoples' land rights claims through the Native Title Bill and the fundamental recognition of retention of the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act as one of the fundamental tenets that we will see as part and parcel of that delivery of social justice through the Bill. I think we can legitimately say that the consultation process has ensured a very diverse range of groups have largely had what many would have said were insoluble concerns not only addressed but also overcome to the stage that they were prepared to say that this is a workable, coherent, comprehensive response to the Mabo legislation-it can remove the doubt. No-one disputes the fact that there will still be matters that the tribunals will have to determine over time. That will be part of the legal process that will develop, but there is a certainty as to how that process will move on-to such an extent that groups like the National Farmers Federation have urged the opposition to take a step back and think again about whether the opposition should be opposing this legislation. People in New South Wales and the conservative premiers have also been prepared to say, 'We take on board these arrangements. We have a spirit to make them work. They can be made to work, and we will ensure that they are able to be implemented through our complementary legislative arrangements'. The detail of those things is important, but the principles on which that cooperative spirit and dialogue are built are fundamental. Those opposite appear to be saying-certainly the shadow spokesman, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), was indicating this yesterday-that they stand behind the Premier of Western Australia and are prepared to be subservient to the Western Australian view about native title issues and in not giving legitimacy to the real claims and the real opportunities provided by the High Court's Mabo decision. The opposition should be prepared to listen to the opposition moderates, some of whom have spoken in the debate. No doubt there was quite an intensive debate. I do think it is reasonable to say, as one honourable member opposite said, 'This is great as far as we are - oncerned. We have achieved a unique posihon where we can all fit together', without worrying about whether the actual legislation and the opposition's approach to policy in this area are right and decent. Surely as members of parliament we should be concerned about that, not about achieving some political fix that keeps the wets, who have a range of views and who have been basically rolled on this issue, as part of a coherent or unified team. I do not think that is the test that honourable members opposite should be trying to satisfy. They should be asking, 'Does it meet the fundamental principles that are important to us and what we stand for? Does it meet the fundamental principles of justice for Aboriginal indigenous people? Does it ensure that, in the future, there will be national leadership on land rights and native title protections?'. Instead, they are asking, 'Do we say that premiers can follow whatever agenda they have?'. The Premier of Western Australia said at the Press Club the other day that he felt he was on a political winner. If that is the imperative that drives the opposition on native title issues, I suggest it has abrogated its responsibility on an issue that this national parliament should be delivering on. For those reasons, I applaud the Prime Minister's leadership in bringing this matter to the parliament. The legislation and the administrative arrangements to follow are complex, but we do have a national response: Aboriginal leaders are prepared to deal with the issue maturely. I pay tribute to the Aboriginal leaders who have been part of the process of negotiation. I think that they have demonstrated a strong belief in meeting the aspitations of their community and the people they represent. But, just as importantly, there is a strong recognition that the national parliament and the national government are taking them responsibly and maturely into their confidence, and they have responded in kind. For all those reasons, this bill should go forward with the strong endorsement of the whole House. I have much pleasure in supporting the bill.  the High Court in Mabo v.Queensland righted a 200-year-old historic wrong. Aboriginal Australians did not need the court to tell them that their people were living here before James Cook. They know their ancesmeasure tors were on this continent. They know they are the heirs to the oldest continuous culture in the world. They are a strong and proud as people and they know that this is their counand, try. Now the High Court has recognised this truth through the legal system. It could said that this is the way that white men to understand things. In the Mabo case, the High Court overturned the fiction of terra nullius-the claim that this land belonged to no-one before European colonisation. The court has said that a form of native title predating European settlement exists in the common law, not just since June 1992 but from 1788 and earlier. The Liberal Party believes a strong and independent judiciary is one of the three Australia. pillars of our constitution, along with the parliament and the executive. The Liberal Party believes in the rule of law. That is why we have recognised the concept of native title. We applauded the High Court's decision to overturn the ban on political advertising and its creation of an implied bill of rights Australian Capital Television v. the Commoninterests wealth. It would be the grossest hypocrisy then reject the court's ruling on Mabo native title. We cannot uphold the High Court as an independent body if we selectively praise and condemn its findings. The High Court ruling is not a matter of community sectional opinion. The people and the groups in our community who reject the concept of native title and believe the court's decision should be revoked are not just giving implicit support to the continuance of an historical legal injustice against the Aboriginal people. They seek to ignore, or circumvent, our institutions. When an extraordinary High Court judgamount ment such as that in the Mabo case is down, we should accept its rulings and, if necessary, legislate to take account of the consequences. That is what we are doing today. Mabo needs legislative solutions. The government's offerings are seriously flawed. I have four major concerns with the Native Title Bill. The first concern is legal and stitutional matters. There is some doubt that the Native Title Bill wi\l constitute a special for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people under the Racial Discrimination Act. There is a question mark to whether this bill is of a temporary nature therefore, in compliance with the special measure provisions of the RDA. It could also be be argued that the government is attempting come to legislate to cover land management in Australia or, at the very least, attempting to coexist with state land management legislation. The constitution makes land managem-nt a responsibility of the states, and there is some question that section 51 (xxvi) of the constitution, dealing with race and the external affairs powers, is enough to enable the government to override the pre-eminence of the states in dealing with land management in My second concern is that the bill determines which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations are to assist claimants. It means that the government of the day could exercise a preference for certain organisations that it is more comfortable with rather than in those which may genuinely represent .the of the indigenous people they seek to to serve. The third concern deals with the and committee the government has agreed to establish to assist the Attorney-General in determining whether legal assistance should be provided to third parties and key stakeor holders in any claims. This has not been . included in the legislation. There must be some genuine concern that the proposal will vanish as soon as the bill has been passed. My final concern is the haste in which the and bill has been introduced into the parliament and is expected to be debated and passed by the House. A bill of such significance and complexity should be allocated a suitable of time for scrutiny by the House and handed proper determination of its merits. Much of the debate over the High Court's decision in the Mabo case has been ill-informed and divisive. The facts of the Mabo case are still not widely known and the truth is being shamelessly distorted. The High Court found that the Merian people of the conMurray Islands, the land at stake in the Mabo case, treated land differently to most of their counterparts on the mainland, owning plots land which they inherited and willed to following generations, leasing plots of land and working land they owned as gardens fishing sites. Many other indigenous people making land claims based on Mabo will find it difficult to prove that their native title has' not been extinguished. Native title is extinguished grants of freehold estates. or leases over land when tribal groups lose connection with their land or cease to recognise their own laws. Aboriginal people seeking to make a native title claim will have to show that they have specific connection With the land that has been broken. The burden for proving a nection is on the Aboriginal people. If native title claimants lose connection with the land, if they no longer live on the land, and If do not abide by the laws they previously observed, that connection cannot be made. . According to the High Court, once native title is extinguished it cannot be revived. J:his environment will make the success of many Mabo style claims unlikely. When this fact has been ignomic success. nored, it has been the source of many of the grossest and most divisive distortions of rilling's implications. Ambit land claims have generated massive community resentment. These. have provoked alannist responses about threats to property; Some 'of these, unfortuthat nately, have come from my own side of tics. I trust this debate can correct these misconceptions and offer a new, positive response to the challenge of native title from the coalition. The Liberal' and National parties have acknowledged the High Court's declaration native title. However, we do not believe the government has offered a suitable legislative response to the issue of native title and other matters arising from' the Mabo ment. We accept the existence of native title as' declared by the High Court and finnly recognise the equal right of indig-nous people as Australian citizens to the enjoyment protection of their rights. The coalition will uphold the federal Racial Discrimination Act to ensure that all Australpal ians, including indigenous Australians, are treated in a non-discriminatory of Nonetheless, given the need to remove uncertainty about existing grants of title, we maintain that any validation must be accompanied and by the payment of just tenns compensation. As I have said, the coalition acknowledges the existence of native title as declared by the High Court andreeognises the equal right of the indigenous people to the enjoyment and by protection of their rights. Some commentators, politicians and business people argue that native title is a distraction; that there are more important issues we should be focusing on, like economic misa management, debt and unemployinent. These not figures believe democratic rights follow coneconomic prosperity and, therefore, that economic' matters are more important than either social or rights issues. However, one of they the most important questions in our society has to be how we treat each other. That is a question of rights. The historical weight of evidence overwhelmingly suggests that an where citizens enjoy rights and respect the rights of others best fosters ecoIt is a fundamental liberal principle that the people are unlikely to fully contribute to a society in a way that best meets that society's needs unless they feel they have detennined their own destinies. Therefore, it has to follow rights issues are as important as, if not polimore important than, economic, issues. The report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody argues that the empowennent and self-detennination of indigenous Australians are critical to the elimination· of Aboriginal disadvantage. Aborigines of must be given the opportunity to take control of their own lives and destinies. In doing so, they will be given the most significant role to the play in' dealing with their own disadvantage. judgThat is why many prominent Aboriginal leaders have urged others to establish businesses and take advantage of joint opportunities for mining, tourism and other developments. and Mick Dodson, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, stated in a speech in Adelaide that the princiaspects of indigenous rights are the right to distinct status and culture, the right to selfmanner. detennination, and land rights. Australia has one of the most multicultural and diverse populations in the world. We enjoy and draw on the rich diversity of cultures and experiences in this country. However, we have often ignored our indigenous people. For many of the last 200 years, white Australians have actively fought against Aboriginal culture- We have sought to assimilate our indigenous people into a way of life that has been entirely foreign to them. At its worse, we have seen how this policy has led to such things as the genocide of the Tasmanian Aborigines last century and the Myall Creek massacre in the 1920s. However, it has also caused thousands of everyday tragedies. We have seen the forced breaking up' of Aboriginal families, the separation of children from their families and attempts to deny many Aborigines the right to learn and pr-ctice their own culture and traditions. We like to think that all the groups in our society enjoy the right to a distinct status culture. However, we have ignored Aboriginal Australians. Most Australians have no contact with Aboriginal people. The theme of the International Year for the World's Indigenous People is 'a new partnership'. We stilL have a huge job al}ead of us if' we are going to build that partQership in Australia. Most average suburban whites in this country can expect to live their lives without ever meeting one of this country's original inhabitants. They will never talk to an Aboriginal Australian, let alone know one. But it is important, if not essential, for white Australians to know more about the first people to live on this land. We must learn about the issues and concerns of indigenous people, including their views on land, resources and the kind of development they want for their future generations. The International Year for the, World's Indigenous People gives Aboriginal Australians a platform to convey their message and to promote an understanding of their culture, their ways of life and their aspirations. It is only by listening to . this message, by learning and establishing a dialogue, that we will create a new partnership. We know that our indigenous people are the most disadvantaged group in our society. Too often, we are unwilling to recognise this, let alone work to correct the situation. There is an enormous amount of suspicion in Aboriginal affairs, not just on one side or another, but across the board. What might give us a wonderfully warm feeling may a-tuany create barriers between black and white Australians. We all recognise the centuries old occupation of this country by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. We know that, since white. settlement, thousands of people have been kilIed or dispossessed and' scattered from their traditional lands. These are simple statements of facts but, for many white Australians, there was a great resistance to, let alone resentment about, acknowl-dglng these basic truths. . Before we can begin to construct any partnership, w- face an almighty stumbling block: we ,have to break free of our stereotypes. That is why the process of reconciliand ation between black and white Australia is so important. Reconciliation is not just a vast undertaking, it is also an undertaking which, if we leave it only in abstract terms, will be meaningless. The goal in itself is simple: a united Australia which respects this land of ours, values the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage and provides justice and unity for all. If we can achieve that, our heirs and successors will look back and value our contribution to making Australia a better place for them to inherit. The coalition has strongly reconfirmed· its commitment to the process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and is even more committed to the view that this process should concentrate on AbOriginal and Ishinder disadvantage. In . the Mabo judgment, the High Court specifically rejected the concept of sovereignty for' Aboriginal people. It has stated that native title cannot lessen in any 'way the Crown's sovereignty over Australia. Mick Dodson claimed yesterday that Australian governments have adopted a paternalistic and destructive welfare approach in dealing with the problems indigenous Australians face. He said this approach had failed to recognise self determination as a right of indigenous people and· the key issue to social justice. The differing views of Aboriginal groups as to what self-determination means makes it difficult to quantify. However, Australia cannot have one country within another. Selfdetermination cannot mean the creation of any separate state or sovereignty. Instead, it means Aboriginal _people, must have the right to control, their own destiny within the framework of ,our laws and institutions. Mick Dodson claims the option of secession only arises where indigenous people see no hope of exercising their rights to self, determination as part of the existing nation. He believes ATSIC has only limited decision making powers and that governments still decide the major issues concerning indigenous people. However, it' is vital that we support the continued existence of ATSIC and encourage the attempts it makes to have indigenous people making decisions about funding of indigenous people for the benefit of indigenous people. ATSIC may not be perfect, but it is institution that can grow to provide indigenQueensland ous people with real power and the opportuniceptable ty to make a genuine contribution' to their development. Justice and truth are imperative to the future of this nation. The High Court judgment has given us the chance to fashion anew beginning on this basis. It has rejected the. fictions of the past. It is up to us to make sure there is justice for black and Australians. It calls for a special approach. The Native Title Bill fails to meet t-e chalcountry, lenge. We must keep on fighting, as this the most significant social justice issue federation has faced in its history.",14
4,Mr DODD,Unknown,"Leichhardt) (10.49 a.m-)­ The fiction by which the rights and interests indigenous inhabitants in land were existent was justified by a policy which has no place in the contemporary law of this country. Those were the words of His Honour Mr Justice Brennan of the High Court of Australia in the historic Mabo case. The policy referred to was the doctrine of terril nullius, a doctrine-to quote Mr Justice Brennan again - based on: ... the discriminatory denigration of indigenous inhabitants, their social organisation and customs. The Native Title Bill, despite what the opposition says, is a direct result of the High Court's decision to throw out the legal fiction of terra nullius, to free the common law and all Australians of the shackles of our colonial past. Our nation has changed vastly since 1 ' August 1879, when the Murray Islands, in my electorate, were annexed by Queensland-an act which, according to the common law of the day, dictated that Queen Victoria had been 'vested with absolute ownership and legal possession of the land occupied by the Meriam people of the Torres Strait. Women now have the vote, slavery has been'abolished and the White Australia policy has been abolished. III 1879 it was only a decade since the last convict ship - umped its miserable human cargo at Fremantle in Western Australia. In 1879 it was acceptable and legal to deny women the vote, not to allow them to enter educational institutions anq, in many cases, not to own property. In 1879 it was acceptable and legal to employ slave labour an from the South Pacific' to work on the cane fields. In 1879 it was acand'legal to dispossess the indigenous people of this country without any compensation. Fortunately, as I said before, our nation has vastly changed since that day. The common law of our nation has evolved now to reflect the changed attitudes of Austrlllians white and of the international community towards unjust discrimination on the basis of gender, origin and race. These are very imis portant principles. Today, in standing up in our this parliament, I would like to be confident 'of ,the unanimous endorsement of those principles embodied in the legislation. But, unfortunately, that is not to be the case. The of coalition has adopted the policy which it treated as nonespouses in the amendment. I cannot help feeling sorry for people such as the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), who has justspoken in the debate; the' Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge); and the honourable member for Aston (MrNugent), who is the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I cannot help feeling sorry for them because they have had to come in here and defend the indefensible. The honourable member for Sturt spoke some very fine words in the debate. It would be a great speech if it were made in support of the bill. But, unfortunately, I predict that tomorrow he is going to come in here and vote against this legislation. I think it' is a disgrace. People such as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who was shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, and the current shadow minister have visited remote Aboriginal communities. Th'ey know about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander attachment to land. They know that it is inextricably linked with those other issues, such as health and Aboriginal housing, which they are bringing into this place to debate. They know that, to Aboriginal people, there is no distinction between those issues; they are inextricably linked. The land is so important to Aboriginal people that without the land the other things are meaningless. That is what Aboriginal people say, not what I say. That is what Aboriginal people tell me. I believe that honourable members opposite know in their heart of hearts that Aboriginal people right throughout this country support this legislation. I feel especially sorry for the so-caIled wets in the Liberal Party who got done in the party room. I feel sorry for them because they had t6 come' in here and defend the indefensible. I feel sorry for the honourable member for Aston. He came to my electorate a few months ago and also went to the electorate of Kennedy. He Was proudly espousing what, as I understand it, is still the Liberal Party policy in Queensland of land acquisition. He was happy to say that the Queensland government should do it and not this government. But, of course, this is not what he is saying to the parliament now because he has been rolled by people such as the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I want to refer briefly to the speech of the honourable member for Sturt, who has just spoken. They were very fine words, but the real decision comes tomorrow when the House votes on this bill. We will see on which side of this House the honourable member for Sturt is sitting-on the side of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people of Australia, or on the side of the honourable member for Flinders and'the other wreckets of the Mabo decision. I want to get back to the main point of the debate, which is that all Australians can be proud of the High Court's decision in the Mabo case. I certainly feel very privileged to be able to stand in this House today and join in the debate on the passage of the Native Title Bill, which provides the legislative framework to administer the outcomes of the High Court's decision. The devel9pment of this legislation has been a ch!lllenging experience for me in Canberra, and even more so because I represent the electorate of Leichhardt in Far North Queensland and because the islands of Mer are in my electorate. The Mer, Dauar and Waier islands do not feature on most maps of Australia. They are a thousand kilometres from Cairns and very remote from Canberra. This sometimes makes it hard to believe that the decision taken by Eddie Mabo, David Passi and James Rice back in 1982 to establish their legal rights to.. their families' traditional lands on the Murray Islands has resulted in such a maelstrom of public opinion and debate across the nation. . Eddie Mabo's name has been immortalised in the law reports and in the history booksso much so that calls by some members of his family for the court's decision to be called the Murray Island case have been overwhelmed by, the speed with which the name Mabo has been incorporated into the Australian lexicon. It is worth noting for the record that it is only due to the legal system's penchant for alphabetic listing that we have not been passionately debating the Passi or. the Rice case. since December 1992. There is another indigenous person from my electorate who is not so well known outside the legal profession, and the Cape York Peninsula, and who has played a key role in the recognition of native title: I recently attended the tombstone opening of John Koowana at Aurukun. Like Eddie Mabo, John Koowarta took on the Queensland government over a lands rights issue and won, on the basis of the Racial Discrimination Act. Unfortunately, like Eddie Mabo, he died before his dream was realised. I spoke that day about Aboriginal heroes, about how John Kowarta would be remembered forever as an Aboriginal hero, as well as Eddie Mabo. Those names will be long remembered in Australian history. They will be remembered when names like Wooldridge, Nugent and Reith are long forgotten. The fact is that all indigenous and nonindigenous Australians alike owe a great debt to John Koowarta and the Meriam people of the Torres Strait for bringing the common law of our nation into the 20th century. This government has embraced the principles of the Mabo decision. I want to put on record the fact that the bill would not be in its current form in this House today if it were not for the efforts of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is in the chamber today. As secretary of the caucus Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs committee, I can attest to the determination of the Prime Minister and the minister to see that the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people were not diminished in the drafting of this bill. I saw my role in the committee as ensuring that there was maximum consultation and negotiation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people and the government because I was confident of the justice and the logic of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people's case. I was confident that the Mabo High Court decision would be translated into good legislation. I was right because that negotiating team negotiated hard and well with the Prime Minister and came up with the legislation that we have before us today. The Prime Minister has definitely fulfilled his commitment given in his Redfern speech to make the Mabo decision, as he stated: . . . an historic turning point, the basis of relationship between indigenous and non-Aboriginal Australians. In the process of forging that new relationship the· government has always had two key goals: to do justice to the Mabo decision in protecting native title and to ensure workable, certain land management. This bill is a test imony to the successful achievement of both goals. The bill has the support of the National Farmers Federation-I hope the opposition listens to this-the Australian Council of Churches, the United Graziers Association and, of course, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, Aboriginal land councils and many other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and individuals. I hear a lot of waffle and garbage in this place about Aboriginal people opposing this legislation. Not one Aboriginal person in my electorate would oppose the legislation, at least from the opposition's point of view. There are people who say it does not go far enough; that is expected. But not one Aboriginal person has come to me in my electorate and said, 'We do not like the legislation becauSe of the guff put forward by the opposition-because the bill is too big'. What an insult it is to Aboriginal people to say that the bill is too big and complex. We have tax legislation that is twice the size of this legislation, but tax legislation is for business people, not for Aboriginal people. That is the implication of the oppOSition's argument: Aboriginal people should have something simple-something that is not complex. I reject that. This legislation is good legislation. It is complex because the issue is complex and Aboriginal people deserve the attention given to that whole process of negotiation and consultation that has resulted in the bill. . The turning point in the negotiations was the media conference here in Canberra at which ATSIC commissipner, Lois O'Donoghue, led a delegation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who expressed their bitter disappointment with the way negotiations were progressing. Just over six weeks a new ago, Lois O'Donoghue said that it seemed the Prime Minister had decided that states rights were more important than human rights. We have heard that before. At the same media conference, the Director of the Cape York Land Council, Noel Pearson; commenting on the proposed suspension of the Racial Discrimination Act, said: . . . in their minds is more important to get the States in at the expense of racially discriminatory laws than keeping us in and keeping in place the only protection that the High Court has put in place for our rights. I want to acknowledge the key role played by Noel Pearson and Marcia Langton from my electorate in the negotiating process. The government has not suspended the RDA; states rights have been recognised but not at the expense of human rights. The legislation complies with Australia's international obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. The legislation constitutes a special measure under the Racial Discrimination Act for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people providing, as it does, significant benefits such as special processes for determining native title, protection of native title rights, just terms compensation for any extinguishment of native title, special rights for negotiation and grants affecting native title land, designation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to assist payments and the establishment of a national land fund. One of the most important things that the bill also provides here-I wander outside my electorate-is that for the first time Western Australian Aboriginal people will have access to their land and to what has generally been described as land rights. It is very significant that in the gallery today is a constituent of mine, Ms Marg Baldwin. Marg lives in Cairns but comes from the Kimberley country, it is her country-and for the first time under this legislation Aboriginal people in Western Australia will have some land rights. The irresolvable has been resolved and, as a result, this bill will pass through this House. On this great occasion-and I believe it is a great occasion in this House-I am reminded of a song I was listening to last weekend by Paul Kelly and Aboriginal songwriter Kev Carmody. It was a story of the struggle of the Gurindji people in Western Australia against the Vesteys. The end of the story was that Gough Whitlam symbolically passed a handful of land through the hands of Vincent Lingiari. The theme of that song is that 'from little things big things grow'. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people have been on this continent for thousands of years. They have had a very long wait to get land rights and justice. The Aboriginal land rights movement has moved through the 1960s and 1970s with the establishment of land councils, federal legislation in the Northern Territory, to the New South Wales and Queensland legislation, the Koowarta casewhich I referred to earlier-and finally the Mabo High Court decision. This historic legislation will be passed through this House. This legislation is not the end of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people's struggle for rights to their land. But to the great credit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait, Island people, their negotiators and the great Australian Labor Party-of which I am very proud this day to be a member-this is probably the most important legislation of this decade that will pass through this House. I am very proud to stand here today as the member for Leichhardt and urge the House to support the bill.",21
5,Mr REID,Unknown,"The government's Native Title Bill is a recipe for uncertainty and division. There is absolutely no certainty that the bill will address the real problems of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. It will do nothing about improving their health, education or welfare. There is also no certainty that the bill will provide security for existing land titles. The only thing that is certain is that it will create more uncertainty in the community. Many farmers and miners will still end up in court. The government's bill will lead to court cases that will drag on through Australia's courts for years and years, at great cost. In: the end, the legislation will prove to be unworkable. The bill tries to take over the long established responsibility of the states under the Australian constitution for land management and land administration. I will come back to that issue later in my contribution. The Mabo legislation will not address the real problems of Aboriginal and Islander Australians. One of the great tragedies in Australia has been that those questions of health, education and welfare of Aboriginal and Islander Australians have not been addressed. These matters must be addressed immediately-and with resolve-by the government. For too long they have been neglected. Most Aborigines will not be better off because of the government's legislation, but a lot of other Australians could be worse off. No law that so abjectly fails in simple purpose deserves the support of Australians and it will not receive the support of the coalition. The Mabo bill goes a long way beyond what the High Court decided. It is incredibly complex, runs to 115 pages, 238 clauses, 23 pages of definitions-and the explanatory notes are even longer than the bill. It also sets up a new bureaucracy of tribunals, assessors and registrars. That will be a legal and bureaucratic nightmare for many years to come. What is needed is a national resolve to address both the reality of Aboriginal and Islander disadvantage and the claims of these communities for great recognition of their culture and heritage. In addition, the resolve of the Australian states and the Australian Commonwealth is needed to work together to bring about improvements in the conditions of Aboriginal and Islander Australians in so many fields. Those I believe to be of the utmost priority are health, education and welfare. I come back to the question of the constitutional rights of the states. I recently asked the following question of the Deputy Prime Minister, then Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe): ... whether it is true that under the Australian constitution the states and territories of Australia are and always have been responsible for the administration of land matters in Australia? If so, will the Acting Prime Minister give the House an assurance that the constitutional role will continue and that the states will continue to perform that role? . The .Acting Prime Minister left no doubt in anyone's mind when he answered: I have no difficulty at all in answering that question in the affirmative. That is a clear recognition by him that the states do have the responsibility under the Australian constitution for all matters of land management, land administration, the issue of title, negotiation of Crown leases and conversion of adverse possession to freehold. In fact, the whole administration of land issues constitutionally falls under the state governments in Australia. He went on to say: . . . not any fundamental change in the constitutional position that is being proposed by us or any change in the attitude towards land. We have worked very hard to protect the states' position of having responsibility for the management of land. The states' responsibility is not only the management of lands but also the whole administration of land matters, including the issue of title and the administration of the creation of any other form of land title in Australia. I was interested in the comments last night of the honourable member for Barton (Mr - unch). He started his contribution by retell109 the story of the first English arrivals in 1788 in New South Wales-a state which has preserved its sovereignty, independence and rights from its inception, through federation of the Australian states, right up until today. When the Australian constitution was written in Bendigo-its architects included Sir John Quick; the first member for Bendigo-it was written in such a manner that the states' rights, powers and responsibilities were preserved. Under the constitution the states retain the power to manage and administer lands within their boundaries. The honourable member for Barton made a very telling comment in his statement about the arrival of English people on New South Wales soil and the role that the states play under the Australian constitution. In section 118 of the constitution there is specific reference made to the recognition of laws, et cetera, of the states. It states: FulI faith and credit shall be given, throughout the Commonwealth to the laws, the public Acts and records, and the judicial proceedings of every State. There are four priorities that my party sees as being very important to this debate and also to the Australian community. Those overriding priorities are: firstly, the Commonwealth and the states must· work' together to make sure that people's titles are secure and that they will not have to go to court to prove that. Secondly, the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have to be respected. That is without question. Thirdly, the Commonwealth should recognise the constitutional right of the states to administer land titles, subject to-this is very important-the existence of native title as declared by the High Court, and subject to the requirements of the Racial Discrimination Act. There is an absolutely clear acknowledgment by the coalition parties to that third priority. We recognise native title as declared by the High Court. We recognise that the constitutional rights of the states to administer land are absolute and that they must be subject to the requirements of the Racial Discrimination Act. Fourthly, we must advance national development, employment, the economic use of land and the further development of Australia's mineral, pastoral and other great industries. The coalition has looked very carefully at the government's legislation, and our decision is to oppose it. We have only to look at the legislation to see how bad it is. I refer to 51 of the bill which sets out details of the tribunal and some of its powers. I want to briefly refer to one aspect of it-the way in which the tribunal will operate. Section 102 (3) states: The Tribunal, in conducting an inquiry, is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence. Page 51 of the bill shows the membership of the National Native Title Tribunal. Under the heading 'Persons who may be appointed', it states. that people who may be appointed president are: (1) a Judge of the Federal Court; or (2) a former judge. How could a judge of the Federal Court be chairman of that tribunal when that tribunal is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence? AIl of the legal forms and rules of evidence would be part of the training of a judge of the Federal Court and would be implicit in his continuing as a judge of the Federal Court. In that position he must be bound by legal forms and rules of evidence. I fail to see how a chairman of the native title tribunal could remove himself from adhering to any legal forms or rules of evidence as chairman of that tribunal. The priorities that we looked at are most important not only for Australian residents but also for our place in the world. Many people throughout the world will be watching this debate and will be interested in the decisions that are finally made both here and in another place. It is important that we put on the record our recognition of the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the existence of native title as declared by the High Court of Australia a.nd the fact that we recognise the requirements of the Racial Discrimination Act. I note that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) made a statement to the media this morning that he thinks the legislation is a 'disaster'. I am pleased to see the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) in the chamber at the moment because one of his own senior colleagues, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, said that he would abstain from page voting because the legislation was a disaster and, in his words, would set 'white against black' in this nation. I invite the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to not abstain from voting but simply to cross the floor and vote with the coalition in opposing this bill if it is the disaster that he said it is. He has a responsibility to his electorate, to the people of Australia, and to himself, to come and vote with the coalition against this legislation which he described as a disaster. I invite him to do so and I will be watching with great interest when the division is taken on the legislation in this place. In closing, I want to reaffirm the coalition's position and my own position on this most important legislation. Firstly, the Commonwealth and states must work together. No arrogant Prime Minister can ride roughshod over the states of this nation. Secondly, the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have to be respected. The Commonwealth must recognise the constitutional right of the states to administer land title, subject to the existence of native title-which we recognise-and subject to the requirements of the Racial Discrimination Act. Finally, we must advance national development, employment, the economic use of land and the further development of Australia's mineral, pastoral and other great industries. That is the message that all Australians should receive.",24
6,Ms HENZELL,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker, it is with considerable pride that I rise to support the passage of the Native Title Bill through the House, and in doing so I reject the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). The legislation is the product of consultation and negotiation over more than 12 months with representatives of indigenous people, the states, industry and community representatives. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in his second reading speech, the government had twin goals: ... to do justice to the Mabo decision in protecting native title and to ensure workable, certain land management. The High Court's decision in the Mabo case provided this country with one of the most significant challenges in its history. As I said in a speech to this House on 1 September 1993: The question is whether we have the foresight, the courage and the maturity to respond to that challenge. I believe that this legislation will provide a watershed in our relationship with our indigenous brothers and sisters and open up the opportunity for true reconciliation. In fact, this bill once again demonstrates the strength of our democratic institutions arid processes. It also represents the true difference leadership and commitment to principle can make to that democratic process. I am proud to say that it is the Labor Government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Keating, that has achieved this result-with the excellent support of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is in the chamber today. Leadership and a vision for this country's future is what separates us from our colleagues on the other side of the House. The inability of the coalition parties to rise to the challenge of the High Court's decision unfortunately has more to do with a leadership malaise and consequent policy vacuum than real objections to the substantive issue in question. In their response to this issue, the coalition parties have forfeited their right to be seriously considered as an alternative government in the foreseeable future, They have capitulated to the forces representing parochialism, vested interests, and economic exploitation-the forces of darkness, as I describe them. It is sad to see individuals of integrity on the other side having to support the disgraceful position of the Court government in Western Australia. They have not been able to rise to the occasion or accept the offer of the Prime Minister to assume a bipartisan stance on this vital issue. I am afraid that history will judge them harshly. It is the history of dispossession and government response that I want to focus on in my contribution to this debate. Some honour. able members opposite and some people in the community are of the opinion that the concept of native title and the rejection of terra nullius by the High Court has been a political judgment and should be overturned by legislation. It is therefore constructive to summarise the history of native title in this country and elsewhere. Colonisation of the new world by European powers created a crisis of legitimacy for the forces of occupation. British colonists transferred common law to their new territories. An integral aspect of common· law is the feudal basis of property law under which the ownership ofland is vested in the. Crown and people are granted.estates. Following colonisation, the Crown assumed radical title-or root title-and then had to determine the property rights of indigenous inhabitants. The options were to recognise the property rights of settled societies while assuming sovereignty or, if the land was deemed to be vacant, to treat it as terra nullius-land belonging to noone-and hence the new sovereign power gained immediate ownership of all property rights. It is true that early explorers initiated the myth of terra nullius. In 1770, Sir Joseph Banks described the eastern coastline of Australia as 'thinly inhabited'. Descriptions prior to 1788 repeated the view that the country was 'the solitary haunt of a few mis- . erable savages'. However, such views were challenged by the experience of the early occupiers, and the Crown's legitimacy was questioned in law in 1836 in Regina ,v. Murrell, as quoted in Garth Mettheim's Indigenous Rights, Human Rights and Australia: This country was not originally desert, nor peopled from the mother country, having had a population far more numerous than' those. that have since arrived from the mother country. Neither can it be called a conquered country, as Great Britain has never been at war with the natives, nor a ceded country either. It, in fact, comes within neither of these, but was a country having a population which had manners and customs of their own and we have to come to reside among them. Therefore in point of strictness and analogy to our law, we are bound to obey their laws,not they to obey ours. In 1837 a select committee of the House of Commons found: In the formation of these settlements it does not appear that the territorial rights of the natives considered . . . the land has been taken from them without the assertion of any other title than that of superior force., Between 1836 and -1855, the Colonial Office attempted to address ,these dilemmas in formulating colonial policy. By way of example, I quote the advice of Lord Glenelg to Colonel Torrens, which I am sure will be of interest to my colleague the honourable  The Commissioners should prepare a plan for securing the rights of the Aborigines . . . to secure to the Natives the full and undisturbed occupation or enjoyment of those lands and afford them legal redress against depredation and trespasses. In 1840-as quoted in Henry Reynolds's article in the Aboriginal Law Bulletin No. 29 of December 1987-Governor Gawler, wrote: From time immemorial they the Aborigineshad distinct, defined and absolute rights of proprietary and hereditary possession. However, other interests were at work, and in 1844 this justification of the unique colonial policy which incorporated sovereignty, radical title and full land ownership was given to the .New Zealand Governor by the British Colonial Secretary: The Aborigines Of New Holland generally are broken into feeble and perfectly savage migratory tribes, roaming over boundless extents of country, subsisting from day to day on the precarious products of the soil, with no principles of civil government, or recognition of private property, and little, if any, knowledge of the simplest forms of religion, or even ,the existence of a Supreme Being. This attitude, understandable in its historical context, though never justifiable, became the convenient raison d'etre for one of the biggest land grabs in history. It is interesting to note that very similar attitudes were expressed by the Young Liberals at their' 1991 national convention. The dispossession and discrimination which followed the application of terra nullius have had a disastrous impact on indigenous culture. It is the root cause of the complex. problems which face indigenous people today. If we consider the international ,context, we see that it is Australia which has been out of step with the rest of the world in its refusaUo confront were its responsibilities on native title. The British government, in its royal proclamation issued in North America in 1763, recognised indigenous title based on preexisting occupation, as did later US judgments. The Canadian Supreme Court concluded in 1973 that native title was not extinguished by legislation opening up land for settlement. In 1975 the International Court of Justice, in response to a United Nations Assembly request for an opinion on ownership of the Western Sahara, concluded that nomadic tribes exercised de facto sovereignty over their lands and that these lands were not terra nullius. Despite a contemptible history of genocide and paternalism, Australian courts and governments have been m-)Ving slowly towards social justice for our dispossessed indigenous peoples. The 1967 referendum gave the Commonwealth government a mandate to accept responsibility for Aboriginal people and so began a period of benign discrimination. Of course, the excellent result in that referendum was attributable to the bipartisan support of l>othparties in this House. It was the Whitlam Labor government in 1972 which' embarked on a rever-al of the previous assimilation policy with the. aim to: restore to the Aboriginal people of Australia their lost power of self-determination in economic, social and political affairs. At the same time, the courts were, for the first time, attempting to cOPle to terms with Aboriginal, dispossession. In the Gove land rights case-more specifically referred to as Milirrpum v. Naba1co Pty Ltd-Justice Blackburn concluded: The evidence shows a subtle and elaborate system highly adapted to the country in which the people led their lives, which provided a stable order of society and was remarkably free from the vagaries of personal whim or influence. If ever a system could be called 'a government of laws and not men', it is that shown in evidence before me. This judgment invited an appeal to the High Court but this did not occur. This may have .been because of the processes occurring in this place. The Whitlam government instigated the Woodward Commission and, upon receipt of its recommendations in 1974, introduced the Aboriginal Land Fund Act 1974 and the Aboriginal Lands (Northern Territory) Bill 1975 which unfortunately lapsed with the dissolution of the parliament in November 1975. So one disgraceful episode further affected the fortunes of indigen-mspeople in this country. It is to the credit of the Fraser government that it enacted this legislation in 1976 which established the land councils to represent Aboriginal communities. However, the coalition government did not use its powers conferred in the 1967 referendum to intervene in subsequent state disputes. It was the decision of the Meriam people of the Murray Islands to challenge in the High Court that: the Murray Island are not and have never been ""Crown Land"" within the meaning of the Lands Act 1962 (Qld) and prior Crown lands legislation and that the State of Queensland is not entitled to extinguish the title of the Meriam people. The rest, as they say, is history and has brought us to the legislation under consideration in this House. Given this history, it is of considerable concern that certain members of the opposition-particularly the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) in their speeches during the second reading debate:-implicitly challenged the High Court ruling. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has merely abrogated his responsibility by throwing his lot in with the Western Australian government, whose indecent rush to get its legislation through the state parliament has not stopped the legislation being roundly condemned by. most analysts. The main effect of the legislation is to extinguish, subordinate and diminish Aboriginal rights to land. It does not comply with the Racial Discrimination Act ... It is a complex and tortuous piece of legislation, the substance of which ... shows it to be a deliberate sham. So said Professor Richard Bartlett from the University of Western Australia as quoted in the West Australian on 10 November 1993 . The opposition claims that our bill is too complex - or is it that its approach is too simplistic? If those opposite are having trouble understanding our bill I refer them to the document of the coalition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations working party entitled The Native Title Billa plain English guide. Once again, it is this group that has been able to express eloquently the complexities and difficulties of the native title legislation. ' I refer to the negotiating process. It is true, is . it not, that the victors deter:mine how history is written. I think the history that I have just outlined suggests that the victors, the conquerors, for a very great period in Australia's recent colonial history have determined how history has been viewed. The great challenge that the High Court presented to this government was the opportunity to rewrite history. In doing that, I believe it is incumbent on members of this side of the House to be careful also that we do not reinvent the most recent history and assume for ourselves the only moral high ground. It is Indeed a comfortable position that we are working from in the outcome of this legislation. But it is true to say that this legislation has been the consequence of an intense period of negotiation and cons,uItation within the government and it is to the very great credit of all participants that we have been able to come up with a socially just result. Apart from the Prime Minister, the. Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, members of the caucus and the ministerial working party, I believe very credit must be given to the 'indigenous people who represented the cause of their peOple eloquently and with such integrity and princiStrait ple. In faCt, I belie.ve it was their ability educate us about the complexities of the issue that was really effective in this process. new member faced with the responsibility attempting to understand the processes, there is no doubt that it was the presentations the working party representing the ATSIC commissioners, the land councillors and various other groups that were instrumental assis-ing the' government to be informed and to make a valued and measured response. It is· no secret that there were different views and different opinions from people on our side of politics, just as, there - ave been on the other side. That is as it shouJdbe in a democracy. I am vC(ry proud to say that there has been a resolution on matters of priT)ciple and integrity. Although I am a new. member of this House, and at the beginning of what, I hope will be a long association with this place, predict that no other issue with which likely to be associated will be of such importtheir ance to the future welfare of this its international reputation as the Native Title ,Bill 1993. I say this because it has been clear throughout the process that international opinion has been very concerned about what this government was going to do on this and, issue. I refer to comments made to me and to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) on his recent European tour. Members of European institutions were very concerned about thi!! issue, as indeed were members of the Chilean delegation who visited Australia. At the formal, reception, I was interestep to fil}d that they recognised the ATSI badge that I am wearing today and straight away made reference tq the native title issue. They were able to inform me that the Chilean parliament had just recently passed legislation to provide native title for their indigenous people. So issue will be very' important for our internaland tional reputati.on. It has been my privilege to serve on the great Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, which in the last few months has toured the so country meeting with Aboriginal and Torres Islander people. r want to refer to to Kalgoorlie, as referred to by the previous speaker. I want to tell honourable members As a about Ninga Mia, which is a fringe dwelling of camp on the outskirts of Kalgoorlie within a kilometre of the richest mining area in this by country. My visit to that area was an experience that i!! hard to describe because the people there live in such abject conditions in next door to one of the richest mining' areas in this country. That is an indictment of not ,only the Western Australian government but of all people in this country. However, there are many complex. reasons for that situation. I also want to pay tribute to young indigenous people such as Maria Meredith, who could well be wending her way to Perth, going to university and taking what we would see as the normal career path for intelligent young women, which we support and encourage. It, is true of not only Maria but many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people I that I met in the course of my travels that I am they have made a commitment to work with people so that the conditions of those country and people can be improved. ' While across this country there are huge problems that we must face and rectify, it is very heartening that the great strength and leadership will come from indigenous people despite'these difficulties, they are showing true leadership. Many of these indigenous people would grace the parliament with their ability to present their concern and commitment to the fortunes and the future of this country. In the midst of the difficulties we must take heart from this. But, most importantly, this bill will provide us with a major opportunity to forward the reconciliation, which will ultima'tely be to the future welfare of this country.",27
7,Mr KATTER,Unknown,"Kennedy) (11.43 a.m.)T-ere are a lot of detailed problems with the Native Title Bill. I think it is only right that this I point out two of those problems. In Queens40 per cent of the surface area is pastoral leases. Ten years before the expiry of those pastoral leases any interested party can negotiate ownership of the leases. That situation was deferred when the previous Queensland government extended the pastoral leases. However, I think next year the pastoral leaseholders will be in their 10th year, so of those leaseholders will be asking for those leases to be renewed. When those pastoral leases come up for renewal, the Australian government has said that indigenous people will have a native title right. So people have been led to believe that they have a right to claim this land. The High Court has made a decision which leads these people to believe that they have a native title right to this land. The NFF, the National Farmers Federation, has told these people that they have a right to apply for this land. Who on this planet can blame them for believing that they have a right to apply for a pastoral lease? Quite frankly, in many cases these people have a substantive argument for that claim. I am at least a fourth generation member of the Cloncurry community. For all of my life I have shot and camped on the land and fished and swum in the rivers of the surrounding stations. For at least four generations I have had hunting rights on that land. So, for this reason and the reasons stated above""that is one grave difficulty I have with pastoral leases. It is said that this act extinguishes native title where a pastoral lease has been issued. The Queensland government legislated to extinguish native title on reserves such as Murray Island. For 200 years law codified and common law said again and again that native title was extinguished. But both of those laws were ignored by the High Court. No argument known to man would convince me that the same changes could not occur in the future. Mr Dodd-He's very lucky he's not in the High Court. MrKATTER-I take up the interjection of the honourable member for Leichhardt. I will shortly address the issue of him and his party in Queensland, to which I am sure he anxiously looks forward. Under native title, when mining leases in Queensland run out, they can now be applied for. In Queensland, all mines with the exception of Mount Isa, but including the two biggest gold mines of Kidston and Mount Leyshon, are on expired leases. If the mining companies had to battle all native title holders over those leases, those two operations would not exist today. Those two mines alone have brought in over $1,000 million to the Australian community. To my knowledge, almost every single mine, with the exception of coal mines, falls into that category. So there are two vast gulfs of concern. I do not criticise the government over native title being revived and, quite frankly, I do not think the government can do much about the problem of pastoral leases in Queensland. The horse has bolted and there is not much that anybody can do about itexpectations have been raised. When I was appointed a minister in Queensland I said, 'I will not stand before you here and seriously say that I can turn the clock back. If I did then I would be lying to you. As the minister, the one thing that I will desperately try not to do is lie to you'. That was one commitment that I went as close to fulfilling as anyone could. I used to have a saying, 'Trust me' , and everyone would burst out laughing whenever that was raised at a meeting because of the concept of trusting a politician in the Queensland government. Mr Dodd-I wonder why.",30
8,Mr KATTER,Unknown,"I take up that interjection because the honourable member for Leichhardt has been provoking me. That is good, because I need a bit of provocation as it makes me run better. When the honourable member's party was elected to government in Queensland in 1989, it passed land legislation. When I was minister, we passed land legislation which was effectively drawn up by a stack of black people. I would love to have the time to mention their names. When that legislation was passed 10,000 black people in Queensland celebrated. The priests and bishops-all the religious clergy-attended functions which were regarded almost as holy writ: the handing over of land ownership to the indigenous people of Queensland. Many people, including those as diverse George Mye and Noel Pearson, congratulated us, on the record, for what we did in those days-and 10,000 people attended the celebrations. When the government of the honourable member for Leichhardt passed legislation identical to that which we are passing here today, 3,000 people demonstrated. They turned on the worse demonstration in the history of Queensland: they tore down the fences in the front of Parliament House in Brisbane and assaulted the doors to parliament. That was how the honourable member's legislation was received. Compare that with the way our legislation was received in Queensland. The honourable member provoked me, so I invite more provocation. We went to each of the communities, sat down with them and later sent a person to each community-in this case Lester Rosendale and Eric Law-asking what they wanted. These communities said, 'We want self-management'. I said, 'You've got it'. They got self-management and they still have it today. That is one thing the Queensland government did not overturn, but it is most certainly undermining it at present. The Queensland government thinks that it should run everything for the black people. It believes it knows what needs to be done far better than the black people. We also said them, 'There is the land. We have no desire to own the land occupied by Aboriginal reserves. What do you want us to do with this land?' . We said, 'You can have it owned by a land council, the same as the Labor Party put into practice in the Northern Territory. You can have your local shire council own it. You can have the state government own it under some sort of trust relationship, or you can own it yourself, personally. You own your own home, you own your own farm or your own cattle station. What do you want?'. We have tapes of those meetings, and we have notations taken by the black people-not by us, but by the black people themselves. We took votes. At every single meeting we insisted absolutely that a vote be taken. r think over 3,000 people voted at the meetings as that were held, and just six people voted for something other than private ownership. I do not know whether it is Aboriginal culture or not. 1I have heard the arguments backwards and forwards about only a family being able to live on a patch of dirt. There could not be more than one family because they would not get enough food in that area to stay alive. People lived in family situations and the head of the family owned the land which they were occupying. Whether the argument is true or not, we are not talking about ancient history here; we are not talking about feudalism; we are talking about giving these people the machinery to enable them to go into the next century. Again and again in this House honourable members have heard that this station or this particular commercial operation that the black people took over is falling over since they took it over. If we give them the same machinery as people are given in Russia for land ownership, and expect them to perform in the same way as the agricultural giants of the world-such as our .own nation and America-they will not succeed. Communal ownership has failed in every single country in the world where it has been tried. 1 can give honourable members the reasons why: 1 went to the Neal farm at Yarrabah to recently. I said, 'Hey mate, what has happened to you?'. Old Alfie said to me, 'Well, what's the use, mate; the local tribe here is going to take over. They are running around the place saying they own everything. What's the use of me working?'. I said, 'I don't know'. He said, 'Maybe the council will own it. But then what's the point in me working on this place?'. If honourable members can show me one single, solitary case on the entire planet where communal ownership has worked in the field of agriculture I would be very interested to know it. Then people will go around blaming the black people for the failure. The failure is not the fault of the black people, but of the machinery that was given to them. I am pleased the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is in the chamber. An article in Time Magazine-perhaps four editions ago-said that for the first time in Russian history Russians will own their own land. They will be able to sell it, they will be able to mortgage it and they will be able to bequeath it to somebody. I heard exactly that phrase used by one of the leading black radical leaders in Queensland. I said, 'Why haven't you blokes used Mabo to seize the Queensland reserves back? I mean, heavens, you own eight million acres here,. and you have let the Queensland government get away with thieving it off you. Why haven't you done something about it?'. He said, 'Done something?'. He said, 'We can go via native title'. He said, 'What do we own? We own Uluru. What a joke'. He said, 'We get some piddling piece of rent from the migalos who have lied and cheated us over the last 200 years and they say we own Uluru. What a joke. Do you want to see me try and walk over Uluru without permission from the authorities who run these places? What a joke'. He said, 'That is all we are saying here. There will be a native title controlled by government legislation in Canberra or Brisbane or somewhere. Anyway, what the hell's the use of supposedly owning a piece of land when you can't give it to your kids? You can't mortgage it and raise any money to do anything with it, and you can't sell it. What the hell use is it? We are going to eat the land, are we?'. He hung up on me in a fair sort of rage over the further hypocrisy of the governments of Australia. So, today we are delivering to them all of the enlightened land ownership concepts of feudal Russia. Let me move on to tell of the tremendous success stories as far as land ownership goes. The Lincoln Homestead Act in the United States is unparalleled: everybody got a mile by a mile on the basis of occupation, cultivation and production. The Queensland mining act covers a very large proportion of Queensland, and it is the land act I have lived with all my life. I thank those old legislators. For the interest of honourable members, most of them were in the Labor Party-as was my family at the time. Every day of my life I thank them for the wonderful laws that they gave us in the state of Queensland. I thought, 'If only we could give those laws to the black people of Queensland'. And we did. We have here the record of what happened when we gave them those laws in Queensland. The supermarkets went from a loss of $400,000 a year to a profit of $900,000 a year. The cattle turnoff leapt from 965 to nearly 6,000 head per year-and they were male cattle too, by the way. Crayfishing and other fishing operations-unfortunately it is not possible to get a hard figure here, whereas the other figures were the hardest of hard audited figures-went from $300,000 to $7 million a year. In Badu alone, where there was virtually no crayfishing at all, Mr Raptis informed me that he had sent $3.5 million to the Badu syndicate-Nona, Armat and Bowie. The Massig Island freezer went from $14,000 to $291,000 in one year. The number of businesses operating went from three to 52. The number of employees in building alone went from 40 to 300 people. That is what can be achieved when we give the people the machineryeven though many of them cannot speak or write English properly and even though many of them had no commercial experience whatsoever. I was watching parliament one night, listening to the bleeding hearts-and I am proud to say they were all on the government's side of the fence-talking about the sentimental relationship with the land and the religious relationship and how we have to get back to our cultural roots. A person was going on with this same absolute drivel that I have been hearing here in the House over the last day or two. A white bloke was arguing with a black person. He said, 'Listen, you can do all of that. At the end of the day the boys will be watching the Sydney rugby league on Saturday afternoon and going to the disco on Friday night'. I went to the trouble of ringing Sydney to find out who it was and they said, 'It's a Professor Fred Hollows'. I rang him up and said, 'Listen, mate, you sure know what you are talking about when you are talking about black people""-good on you; keep going'. He was a nobody then; I had never heard of him before, but of course later on he became very famous. He knew what he was talking about. Today 1 speak on behalf of the black people of Queensland-if my electorate will allow me to do that. Virtually 99 per cent of the black-owned land in Queensland is reserve land, and 90 per cent of the people on those reserves are not native or indigenous to that area. So this act will in fact dispossess almost half the black population of Queensland. If honourable members want to know why there is no enthusiasm and why people like Pat O'Shane-who comes from Queensland-are notoriously opposed to this bill, th- reason is that it does not in fact give the land in Queensland to the black people; it in fact dispossesses 90 per cent of the people on reserve areas, which is about 50 per cent of the black population of the state of Queensland. If honourable members think they are sitting here today doing something for the black people, 1 conclude by referring to the remarks made to me by one of Queensland's most radical leaders when he said, 'This is just another migalo trick. They give us something we can't use. They divide and rule. Each tribe will be fighting against each other tribe and, at the end of the day, even if we achieve all those things, we don't own anything'. As it said in Time Magazine, we are in the same position as feudal Russia. That is no incentive to go out and muster cattle. Mustering cattle is a very dangerous occupation. Not only is it dangerous, but it also hard work in temperatures above 100 say degrees Fahrenheit. 1 saw one of the greatest and most successful experiments, if the 'experiment' can be used. 1 simply sat down with the people of Pomparau and said, 'What do you want?'. A couple of blokes said, 'Can we have a hit at the cleanskins all over this place?' 1 said, 'Why don't you take up some land because you aren't going to get the cleanskins in unless you build yards and a bit of a track made out to where you will pull them in and that, and you'll ,need fence'. They said, 'We can't do that, we don't own this land'. The government said 'No, no; everything is going to be different; you are going to own this land'. So Eddie Holroyd took up a block of country. This was shown on the 60 Minutes program some 10 or 15 years ago. Nobody knew whether it would be successful or not. 1I have not rung Eddie lately, but 1 know he was up to 2,000 head. On the 60 Minutes program we could see a huge yard which covered almost an acre. It must have taken three men to carry the poles and timber to build the yard which was all ironwood-the best quality timber available in Australia. He selected only the best quality timber for his yard. Eddie Holroyd made a success, and is making a success, where very few cattle operations north of Cairns in fact run at a profit. But he is still surviving, and that is a magnificent achievement. That is what can be achieved by people if they are given the proper machinery. Not only does this bill not deliver that machinery-and not only is it another cheap trick to turn black against black to deliver nothing at the end of the day and leave 'the migalos completely in control', to quote them-but also it engenders the sort of racial hatred which we are desperately trying in this country to minimise. It is with deep regret that 1 say that Australian rugby league has done more for integration in this country than all of the parliaments in Australian history put together. That does not say much about the people that sit in this place, including me. This bill is creating a situation for which 1 is do not blame the High Court judges. 1 must that in fairness to them. Father Passi, one of the complainants in the case who got his word land-Mabo lived of course in Townsville, and had .for many years-clearly owned the piece of land involved in his case. But land ownership based on prior title is only as good as the next person who turns up and says, 'I atn a Passi and my branch of the family was here before your branch of the family'. There get is no way that people can move forward unless they know exactly who owns the land. a The only way people can know-as far as 1 can see, this has always been the way-is by no, . the government of the day giving them a piece of paper with an official seal and stamp on it which says that they own the land. If the government says that land ownership is based on prior title, for heaven's sake, where are we going to be? Where is this invalidly going to end? If honourable members say that this legislation will put out the fire, them that we legislated in Queensland parliaments over the years to establish a clear-cut situation. We legislated, but the legislation was overturned. The courts have decided against it again and again. So what we have here today is a concept being clothed, I suppose, in approva:l by the government of Australia which will-and, as I say, I must be fair here and not entirely blame situation because it is very hard to see what can be done-on the balance, exacerbate the actual technicalities of the existing Mabo situation. Clearly, Father Passi owned land. Clearly the legislation in Queensland delivered that ownership to Father Passi. (TIme expired).",31
9,Mr CREAN,Unknown," simple The High Court. decision on Mabo in June bill 1992 was a watershed in relation to land title in this country. In rejecting the concept terra nullius, the High Court recognised that native title was part of our common law. grants; Something which had been ignored for more than 200 years could no longer be disregardclaims. ed. The High Court decision, in the governfairly ment's view, has to be embraced, not rejected or sought to be legislated away. Unlike the Liberal Party and the Western Australian vernment, we have chosen to accept and build upon the High Court decision. In the uncertainty following the decision, the government moved quickly to assure existing titleholders that their rights were not affected. Over a year ago, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that 'existing legal rights in relation to property continue'. In February of this year, on behalf of the government I stated that we would act, if necessary, to ensure that the rights of existing land-holders are protected. At the New South Wales Farmers Association annual conference in July of this year, I said that the government would ensure that Australia's farmers could be certain that they can conduct their business with no effective threat of their land being taken away. This bill delivers on all of these commitments and validates all grants which may have been issued as a result of the existence of native title. In doing so, it extinguishes native I say to title completely where necessary. With the re-election of the government, the Prime Minister not only saw the need to. give substance to these reassurances but also seized the opportunity to link the government's response to the process of reconciliation with Aboriginal people. I want to pay tribute to the Prime Minister for his leadership in realising that opportunity through the legislation that is it for this before the House today. No-one is denying that the task was ex.tremely complex. It was because it had to that deal with land management, .with human rights, with traditional values. and with federal/state relationships. It had to deal with competing interests and what appeared to be irreconcilable differences. But for all of that, result, through the Native Title Bill, is in its presentation. Essentially what the does is in three parts: first, it validates all past grants without suspending the Racial of Discrimination Act; second, it establishes a clear set of principles for dealing with future and, third, it establishes the structures and mechanisms for dealing with native title Most important of all, the bill delivers that certainty and that clarity as to future dealings. It is built not on the principle of special land rights for Aboriginal people gobut on the premise of treating their common law rights as determined by the High Court in the same way as the rights of other titlehold. ers-that is, on the principle of non-discrimination or equality; not on special rights. Despite the confusion and complexity which followed the High Court decision, the government has moved carefully but expeditiously to deal with the issue. No. single issue has involved the government in more time. There has been extensive consultation with various interest groups and· with the states. In my portfolio, the rural and mining groups have had unlimited access and input to government. I find it astounding that the Australian Mining Industry Council and the opposition, which called so vocally for the government to act in the context of the Wik claim to secure pre1975 titles, are now prepared to get behind the Western Australian legislation which does not secure pre-1975 titles. In addressing the issue, a major concern was security of title for agricultural holdings, not only because of the uncertainty that was raised bqt, in particular, because farmers also have a very strong attachment to the land. The land, in many cases, is theit livelihood. The opposition has harped on the issue of security of valid title. What this bill deals with is validatio- of potentially invalidly issued grants. Valid grants are exactly that. It is nonsense therefore to seek or argue for legislation to validate what is already valid. Moreover on this point, the majority of the High Court clearly found that the Crown can validly deal in land and; to the extent of any inconsistency, native title is extinguished.. The bill's definitions of leasehold title are also broad. Here I want to turn to the issue of the definition .of leasehold title. I encourage those opposite to read the relevant clauses. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) is plainly wrong al)d, inmy view, scaremongering in saying that there is doubt surrounding term leaseholds in Queensland. There is.no doubt on that point because the term 'lease' in the definition of the bill includes .Ieases enforceable in equity, contracts that state that they are leases, or anything declared or described by law to be a lease. If states wish in the future to alter the terms of leases, they may do so, but they must do it on a non-discrimiQatory basis. I urge those on the other side of the House to take a more measured approach to this issue. I urge, in particular, the Leader of the National Party to follow more in the vein of his deputy, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), who I think made a very rational contribution to this debate. Importantly, for the states and territories cooperating in a national approach, the bill provides for governments to pay any compensation .for past extinguishments and impair.ments of native title. Further, the government has signalled its clear intention to provide additional support to enable third party. representation in test cases. I have already referred to the scaremongering on the other side, but the other area in which there has been particular scare-mongering associated with agricultural holdings is in relation to the claim that this bill will lock up pastoral lands. It is clear from the approach that we have adopted that Aboriginal pastoralists who can establish,' through the High Court's criteria, including the notion of a continuous association with the land, a claim for native title can have that claim determined. But, in the process, that claim does not become an inalienable one. Lease conditions can continue. Pastoral land can remain in active agricultural production. A fundamental part of the land management provisions of the land acquisition· fund, which is to be established under this legislation, is to equip Aboriginal interests to conduct effective and sustainable agricultural practices if they so choose. They will be required to apply the same principles and procedures as we require of other land-holders. Much has also been said about states rights on this issue. This bill leaves the states to continue to deal in land if the state Jaw is consistent with Commonwealth treatment of native title. But the reality is that the Western Australian law is not consistent with this bill. It seeks to extinguish native title in return for lesser rights for Aboriginal people. In doing so, it flies in the face of the High Court decision. It does not deal with pre-1975 leases, as I have said before, in terms of validating them, and its activities, its actions under it, could lead' to potential invalidity through being contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act. So one really has to ask the question: given that, where is the certainty in the Western Australian model that the coalition so eagerly embraces in its desire to find a position in the Mabo debate? How can the coalition, in particular the National Party, support the Western Australian approach? The reality is that the coalition has not got a policy. What it has got is a result which is a cop-out to the hardliners to shore up the failing leadership position of the current leader of the Liberal Party. It is a position which will only fuel confusion and uncertainty and create further division-all of the things that those on the other side have argued they have been against. Their position does not support it through the outcome. Let us look at what the, National Farmers }<'ederation has had to say. At its recent national conference, it carried a decision Qnanimously supporting the government's position on theMabo legislation. We cannot dismiss this as being a decision engineered by the leadership. It was a full national conference which included the Western Australian and Queensland representatives and-I repeat this point-they have unanimously supported the government's position. This only serves to demonstrate how, yet again, the National Party in particular is out of touch with its soccaHed constituency. It is little wonder that the NFF in tum attacks the National Party, calls it irrelevant and groups the coalition as a whole in that part. In reality, the Nationals have once again rolled over to the wishes of the Liberal Party, in particular to the shoring up of the leadership position of the current incumbent. Turning to another important area of my portfolio, I must say that I find AMIC's response very disappointing and short-sighted. The bill protects all existing mining leases, including options, offers and extensions on those leases. In relation to future grants, - it provides a certain time frame against which claims have to be registered, 'negotiated and determined, with the Crown in the national interest able to override that determination if it chooses. Many mining applications will still be progressed through existing state land management procedures. Past compensation is borne by governments. Future compensation, because title is not extinguished, can be determined in accordance with existing known and understood state practices. There is no right of veto over the land. AMIC goes on to assert, as a result of a recent survey which it has released, that 76 per cent of people think Aboriginal people should be treated equally, not favourably. The simple fact of the matter is that the bill does treat Aboriginal people on the same footing as other titleholders. It does not give preferenbeen tial treatment, but it gives equal standing in relation to land. The bill recognises and protects a common law right-native title-on the clear principle of non-discrimination. AMIC conveniently overlooks the fact that titleholders around the country enjoy vastly different rights, depending on the state they live in and what title they hold. Some have rights for veto over mining activity. Some have special rights to compensation. This bill, by establishing a national approach to native title, gives fair and consistent, not preferential, treatment to native title holders. Genetally, 'governments will be able to make grants over native' title land if they could make such grants over freehold titJethat is, native title holders have the same protection as do freehold titleholders. Revival of title after mining.leases expire is the same treatment freehold titleholders currently receive. The opposition has yet again failed to focus fully on the key issues, repeatedly throwing up irrelevant matterS, such as the length of the bill and pointing out its complexity. It is instructive to look at some of the other legislation that mining and pastoral interests have to deal with on a regular basis if we are to give any credence to the view that the length of the bill is to its detriment. The New South Wales Mining Act has 186 pages, with a further 38 pages of regulations; the Queensland Mineral Resources Act 1989 has 221 pages, with_ 156 pages of regulations;, the Victorian ,Land Act has 349 pages and 12 pages of regulations; and the WA Mining Act, where most of this criticism seems to be coming from, is also longerthan the Native Title Bill at 116 pages, with 89 pages of regulations to boot. Mr Thckey-Surprise, surprise.",35
10,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"I add for those on the other side who may want to forget about it that ' Fightbackhad 700 pages and was treated with the contempt that it deserved. The fact is that people need to go to the substance of the legislation and seek to understand the balances that we have been trying to achieve- I believe that this outcome achieved by the government is remarkable. I am proud to have associated with it because through this legislation we have been able to give the certainty that is required for existing holdings of land, to give clarity to future dealings in land so that people know precisely where they stand in a national framework. but at the same time to deliver fairness. I urge those on the other side to rethink their position in the national interest; to get behind this legislation; to support it rather than run the scaremongering campaign; to make the decision on this bill, as a matter of principle, to ditch the frail leadership that their leader is hanging on to at the moment; and to actually make a decision based on principle and in the interests of this nation.",37
11,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"I very much wish that I could support the Native Title Bill 1993. It saddens me-as it does the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar)-that the bill is flawed and that I cannot. Some 18 months ago the High Court of Australia found that there existed in the common law a right of our indigenous people in land, a right which previously had not been held to exist. While not defining in a legal sense the full meaning of entitlements, the justices nonetheless named those land rights as n.ative title and further defined a range of proprietary and usury rights which might exist for any tribe or group of indigenous people who could satisfy a number of criteria. The Native Title Bill 1993 sets out a regulative but not definitive jurisdiction with respect to native title. It is in this respect this issue that we call Mlibo witheside in the courts for decades to come. In my view, this bill will not resolve these issues, nor will it go to the heart of the issue of those rights in land usage which are deemed to be held by our Aboriginal people. It will not resolve those issues; only the courts will resolve them. The parliamentary debate on the second reading of this bill has to this time addressed a whole range of issues surrounding the legislation, including the law, land management, social justice and Aboriginal affairs generally. We'· have talked about all these things because they are all bound up in the decisions that we must make in this parliament with regard to regulations, with regard to law with respect to land management, and with regard to our responsibilities to all the people of this nation, including our indigenous people. Despite the many extremist statements by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), I suspect that he too is in this debate because essentially all of us in this place care rather deeply about any member ot any group of our society that suffers depravation-in that regard, OUf indigenous people. We are a community of people· and a community of the law. Largely, my concern surr0unding this debate is that we run a very severe risk of disuniting Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his speech at Redfern and in his words in New Zealand, raised expectations of our indigenous people far beyond his or our ability to deliver. Those expectations now have become very real in the minds of many people. And so they should be. All of us have expectations. We all wish for ourselves perhaps more than we h-ve. I hope each of us wishes the very best that this nation can offer for olir neighbours, colleagues, friends and people of all races, creeds, colours and religions. Around the world we are seen as a united nation and a melting pot of the world's people in which they have worked very well together and produced a fair standard of this thing that we call social justice. But I fear that this issue will divide the nation-set black against that black, white against black and black against white. We see many examples of that in the public arena already today. This bill will only, because of its bureaucratic nature, exacerbate the problem. The High Court of Australia is a court of last resort and its findings of the law are the law unless we, the parliament, determine to reverse any decision it brings down by making new law which replaces the law found by the High Court. In this instance both sides of this chamber agree that the High Court decision is just and is accepted by the parliament. That is a significant statement. But when one listenS to some of the contributions made by members on the government's side of this House in .this debate about individuals on my side of the House, one wonders if they have really understood that message. We accept, agree with and embrace the High Court's decision. Under the constitution, land management is an issue for the states, and Aboriginal affairs is an issue for the Commonwealth. This issue is not really a states rights versus social justice issue, as was put forward by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis). Rather, it is that the Commonwealth is not competent in land administration nor is it empowered by the constitution, and that social justice will not be advanced by bureaucratic means. Many have spoken of the bureaucratic nature of this Native Title Bill-of the tribunals to be set up, independently, federally, and by each of the states, acting as competing courts with competing interests where one may choose one's court of jurisdiction if one wishes; and of the confusion and uncertainty that that brings to the whole issue of determining who has native title, what native title they have and where it resides.  Territory, said yesterday, 'The bill is not a cure for dealing with Mabo; it's a cure for insomniacs. It is just plain incomprehensible'. He also said he strongly objected to the bill  a situation to know because he has dealt with these issues, as has the Northern Territory government, for many years. In that regard it seems to me that the comments by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) have some very strong weight attached to them. He has a great deal of credibility when he comes into this place and speaks on these issues. He is a man worth listening to because of his vast experience in Aboriginal affairs and land management as an individual, as a member of the Queensland state parliament and as a minister responsible for administering affairs of the indigenous people in that state. I abhor the fact that in this debate the term 'racism' has reared its ugly head far too frequently. Many hold strong· views, and so they should. I think all of us feel a sense of responsibility for any group in our society that is deprived of rights or justice; a sense responsibility for those whose lifestyles are less than we would wish them to be, who cannot live their lives to the fullest and who suffer partially because of societal problems. Australia is not a racist country-it never has been a racist country-to the extent that racism exists through much of Europe and North America. But we have not yet solved the problem of our native people. The American Indians still suffer today the same problems as our Aborigines suffer: high rates of alcoholism, early death, many childhood deaths, imprisonment rates many times those of the rest of the population, low education standards, few job opportunities and many unemployed. In that respect, I have great concerns and great fears for our Aboriginal youth. Many of them, growing up now in the welfare state, without proper levels of education or training and without jobs available to support them, are becoming a generation which will never know what it means to work. They will never know the values that work brings to one: the satisfaction, the joy, the sense of achievement which we get from work, from contributing to society and from doing things for ourselves and saying at the end of the day, 'Hey, I did a good job today. I feel good because of it and I can look forward to tomorrow'. What is frightening is that we are depriving these youths of real opportunities. This bill, unfortunately, does not address those issues, nor should it address those issues. This bill, which the government and the Prime Minister say begins on the course of reconciliation, is in fact a bill about land management. In that respect our States have had 200 years of experience, dating back to their time as colonies, in dealing with land management issues. That experience must be taken into account. It is not easy for a new bureaucracy which we form. in Canberra-forgetting the issue of so-called states rights-to come to grips with the day-today practical obstacles that one faces when one deals with pieces of paper that describe pieces of land. I well understand that the Aborigines have expectations about land ownership-each of us does-and so they should. I. support them. of This bill, in my view, does not meet the criteria. It does not cut the mustard. The land acquisition fund proposed in this bill gives me a sense of great concern. It has been said that possibly only five per cent of the quarter of a million people who identify as Aboriginal in Australia may ultimately benefit from native title. That leaves the 95 per cent who live in cities, on the outskirts of cities or in remote areas but who cannot prove continuous connection with the land with no position whatsoever. In fairness and equity, if we decide that we will give each of those who make up the 95 per cent a plot of land, then we will need to say to our new Australians from Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia, the United States, Chile, Peru, Mexico or anyone of the 140 or 150 nations from which our citizens come today that we will give them a plot of land-a proposition which is highly improbable and highly impractical. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), who spoke in this place before me, talked in glowing tenns about how the National Fanners Federation had fully supported the government's legislation. I point out to the House that the NFF's resolution No.4 said: That NFF urge the Federal Government and the Western Australian Government to negotiate a mutually acceptable position on native title legislatralia, tion. That does not sound like support for this bill. If I read it properly, it sounds like the NFF is saying, ' Mr Keating and Mr Court, you ought to get together and sort this thing out so that we will all have an understanding of how we are going to approach the issue'. Item 6 said: That NFF recognises that constitutional responsibility for land administration lies with the states. Hear, hear; so it does. The real issue about the thing that we call reconciliation with our indigenous people-which I would call a sense of justice-involves us in looking for effective mechanisms, not to create new bureaucracies but to work our way around, beyond or under the existing bureaucracy, because that is where all the assistance is getting tied up in big knots .. The honourable member for Kennedy said that the people in his area wanted freehold title; of course they do. It is the only kind of title that is useful to people. Telling people that we spend $1.3 billion a year in Aboriginal affairs but that less than 25c in the dollar actually arrives on the ground to real mums and dads, boys and girls and grandmothers and grandfathers is a nonsense. It all winds up in this huge black hole that sucks it in and does not know how to spit it out. It is that problem which we need to address and which will more than address the social justice issues so frequently talked about by those opposite. In my view, the solution to this problem was always self-evident: very simply, the Commonwealth plus the states in agreement with whatever it takes to get there. It is only because this Prime Minister is so stubborn and detennined to have his own way and so engrossed with himself that he is unable and unwilling to force, meet or agree to any collegiate decision. The meetings 'with the states which were aborted need not have been aborted. If at the first meeting it was proven that they were unable to reach agreement, more meetings should have been held because this is an issue which is important for all Australians for all time. The decisions we make here are critical to the uniting of Ausand it is critical that we do not disunite Australia. So the states, which have responsibility for land management, and the Commonwealth, which has responsibility for Aboriginal affairs, must agree. If they do not agree they have to go back to the table and work it out until they do, until we find that sensible course that we all agree is practical, will work and benefit those to whom native title has finally been given.",38
12,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"This debate and this topic have been extant in the community now for quite some time. The impression has been given that the High Court has somehow changed its mind over time; that it has reversed a decision of some previous period; that the concept of terra nullius has now been reversed by the High Court; and that the High Court has made new laws in the case of Mabo v. Queensland. My exploration of the subject reveals that this matter has never been detennined before. The High Court has not reversed a position that it had taken previously. It has simply taken a position for the very first time. A case of this nature has never been dealt with by the High Court before. The whole concept that judges have somehow made new laws is fallacious and misleading. What the judges have done is rule on a matter that they have finally been asked to rule on. If one looks at the history of this matter over the last 10 years, that is not surprising. If the initial case started in 1982, why was it in 1985 that the Queensland government passed an act, called the Queensland Coast Islands Declaratory Act, which effectively tried to wipe out the chances of this case ever being dealt with? In other words, the .Queensland government understood in 1985 that the Murray Islands case had legal potential that was unfavourable to state interests as it saw them. In fact, it read the High Court very well-and it was a different High Court. So much for the idea that the judges have all changed and the court's nature has changed and is now activist. If that were the case, why in 1985 did the National Party government in Queensland pass legislation to eradicate this case? That act was struck down by the High Court in 1988 for being against the Racial Discrimination Act. That is really the clue. The clue is to go back to that period 1985-88. The Queensland government's lawyers clearly said to the state government of the day, 'This case will win. It has merit. It has never been tested before. If this ever gets to court, the High Court is going to uphold the Murray Islanders' claim to native title, to land rights, in their country'. That the first furphy. This whole debate is partly based on a misconception, a deliberate attempt to mislead the community, that somehow the High Court is overriding the parliament. Contrary to all the nonsense about needing a referendum to fix the High Court because it got out of order, the fact is that this was the first time the High Court had been asked to judge whether or not the land in Australia was all owned by the Crown freehold, as had been perceived, under terra nullius. For many of us who are not lawyers and do not follow these constitutional matters all that closely, the question of native title seems like a whole new concept. We have heard in the debate that it dates back to the last century, certainly to early this century. Of course, a case about Nigeria came before the Privy Council in 1957. I think it is worth reading into the record some of the comments that were made in that case, because they give us some perspective of where we stand, both in British common law and of our international standing. Lord Denning said: In inquiring, however, what rights are recognised, there is one guiding principle. It is this: The courts will assume that the British Crown intends that the rights of property of the inhabitants are to be fully respected. Whilst, therefore, the British Crown, as Sovereign, can make laws enabling it compulsorily to acquire land for public purposes, it will see that the proper compensation is awarded to every one of the inhabitants who has by native law an interest in it ... This particular case was to do with compensation more than anything else. What Lord Denning and the Privy Council were, in fact, determining was that ownership, title, was not of any particular form; that native law was a valid claim and valid ownership. As I said, that was decades ago. It is clear that the legal fraternity, particularly in Queensland, understood the problem back in 1985. I found a most useful and interesting paper on this subject by Adrian Roden, an ex-justice of the New South Wales Supreme Court. Adrian Roden QC was appointed as a commissioner to ICAC by the Greiner government and is currently looking after the inquiry into the security of drugs seized by the police. He is made a speech early in November at a conference arranged by some of the churches, and particularly Alan Walker. His comments regarding acquisition of land are worth referring to. He said: It is probably through a rule of international law, rather than the English common law, that the terra nullius question arises. International law recognised three ways in which sovereignty over new territory could be acquired: · conquest; · cession, and . · occupation of terra nullius. He said later on: . . . the assumption was that ous inhabitants, no laws, and obviously no landholders with interest either to respect or to ignore. The law of England (insofar as it was applicable to local conditions) applied at once. In other words, it was a use of ,convenience. There was an instant application of British statute law and British common law. That may have been the assumption, but the Australian High Court for the first time-in determining whether the land was vacant or not occupied and whether, therefore, British law did apply instantly-has said in one sense that it does but in another sense that people also have rights under what is now called native title under native law. At the end of all of that is the constitution, which says fairly clearly that the Commonwealth may acquire property on just terms from any state or person for any purpose in respect of which the parliament has a power to make law and must pay just compensation. In other words, the Crown-the Commonwealth or the states-can acquire land, but of course should recognise people's rights in it. Lord Denning pointed out that the rights are recognised even under native law. I think exjustice Roden's comments reinforce that. This whole matter is basically about how we reconcile that within our legal system and our land ownership system. Clearly, the solution should be a national solution. There is no question of that. Clearly, constitutionally the states have management of land as their responsibility. Why was it not possible for the Commonwealth and the states to agree on a single national solution? I suspect the answer was partly in the Queensland legislation of 1985: it wanted to pass laws wiping out all other claims. In other words, the Queensland parliament tried in 1985 to do what Richard Court is doing at the moment-to wipe out native title. Give Aboriginals traditional rights by all means. Let them go hunt, fish and gather all they like, but do not give them ownership or a sense of proprietary ownership of that land in any form. That is what the Queensland government did in 1985. What Court is doing at the moment is nothing new. It is remarkably similar to what Queensland did, as far as there were no indigenI can see. The fact is that the legislation before the parliament does retain land management within the states. That is unmistakable. In his second reading speech the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said: In regard to decisions on land use, where we have recognised state and territory processes the Commonwealth will step back. State bodies, not the Commonwealth tribunal, will decide whether grants should proceed. Of course there are powers to override. He continued: States and territories that wish to see a national system with proper recognition of their land management responsibilities, and with fairness for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, will find it in this bill. We will be happy to cooperate with them. In other words, the legislation allows the states to maintain their responsibility over land. What is happening now is an attempt by the opposition to draw artificial divisions between determination of native title and land management. There are two entirely separate issues involved there-not one. I think the High Court has established that. The Mabo case is actually about that differentiation. To simply say that because the Commonwealth is saying that there should be a single national criterion on which native title is determined it removes the state's capacity to manage land is an absolute falsity. It is a falsehood. It is misleading and deceptive. When the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) makes statements about the opposition's four points, saying that the Commonwealth and states must work together and make sure that people's titles are secure, that is a nonsense because, clearly, the Commonwealth legislation does just that. The fact that Richard Court will not cooperate is not the Commonwealth's responsibility, more the opposition's. In a sense, the opposition is saying that every state could and should go its oWn way. We had the spectacle last night of the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) hectoring us about how much is being spent per person, per Aboriginal, in terms of land grants in his state, in Western Australia and in other states compared with Victoria and New South. Wales. We got a right old lecture about that. Basically, he was talking about how in this c(;mntry the states have gone their different ways. He was asking us to keep land grants going rather than try to make them uniform. He was saying, 'Let the states go their own ways'. But last night he was critical of the fact that the states all have different degrees of land ceding to Aboriginals of Australia. . The fact is that we need a national system, a national approach and a national set of criteria. We do not need each state determiningwhat native title means to it. That would make a mockery not just of the High Court but of the Privy Council and the whole system of primary responsibility. In effect, High Court has said that the Crown has been simply the custodian of this land for its original native owners where they have retained their connection and their involvement. That is a'respcinsibility that clearly precedent both in other countries of the world and in international law. The opposition is saying that it will oppose this bill. The tragedy of this whole debate is that it would have been so easy for the opposition to have said, 'We accept'the national solution. We. accept the states are going to disagree. We accept that the matter, should be negotiated-. We will help that happen. We accept the spirit of the legislation and the intent,. as Premier Kennett has done'. The opposition could have negotiated and been paq of the. process to make sure the legislation was as good as possible. The message that would have gone, particularly to the Aboriginal people but also to the broader Australian community anc:i to the world would have been that we as a country were finally recognising that we had overlooked the legal occupation of this country and how it was done in international and British law. It is under British law that the High Court found that common law had eStablished native title and not something 'different or new. ' For the opposition to have said that would have sent out an enormous message. For the opposition to say 'We oppose' and then pretend it has an alternativ,e solution, when basically all it is. doing is opposing, is. not only mean spirited but divisive. For the opposition to accuse the legislation. of being divisive when, it chose in, effect to say. 'We are supporting Western Australia doing its own thing and in its own way because it is a state and states. have the responsibility for land' overrides, considerations of race; human rights, common law and a sense of social justice. The opposition says, 'States land rights in the constitution are more important than all the other things put together; so Richard Court can do what he likes'. Essentially, the Leader' of the Opposition has said that the Commonwealth should recognise the constitutional rights of the states to administer land titles. He is saying in effect that, because the of that one right about land titles, they have the rights to native title over common law. That is not in the constitution. It is not correct in common law. Under the 1985 Queensland act, which was has struck down in 1988 by the High Court, there is also a very likely chance that what Premier Court is doing is racist. When I say 'racist', that is riot a misuse of the word. The Racial Discrimination A6t is an act about racism. Anything in breach of that is automatically racist. The Queensland act was racist.. It is very likely that what Court is doing now is raCist. If that is the case, it is certain that everybody in this House who is supporting Court is, by implication, automatically being racist. If one is in breach of the act, then one cannot avoid the label. If one breaches the Racial Discrimination Act, One is being racist. How else can it be defined? When is one not being raCist? When one is not breaching the act that defines what racism is. I find it very peculiar for the opposition, on the one hand, to be arguing that it is not racist and, on the other hand, to be supporting a Premier and an act which apparently is racist-certainlyon my reading of it,' although the High Court will finally determintl it. If the High Court does strike down' the' Western Australian legislation,' I expect every member of the opposition to stand up publicly and admit, 'We were racist, we were wrong, but we didn't know we were wrong'. I expect eve,ry melT\ber to admit it and to withdraw 3540 completely from this debate. I do not want them to pretend that they can support state' use of land titles and native title. They should admit and confess that they were, inadvertently in some cases, being racist. The fact is that native title does much less for the indigenous people of this couQtry than successive colonial and state governments have done for their later inhabitants. ' I heard a speaker last night say that he has leases in perpetuity on, land. I wonder what it cost him. How many people i.n this place have families who were given land for nothing? How many honourable members were recipients or beneficiaries of l!lnd grants by previous governments, colonial secretaries or previous administrations throughout Australia? Apparently it is okay to give land to some people in totality, in freehold Or in perpetual leases, as we heard last night, but it is not okay to give native title to the people who have lived there for hundreds of thousands of years and are still living there. They have no rights. The constitution says that they have rights; they are Australian-. The common law says, via the High Court, that they have rights., The opposition and the opponents of the legislation are saying that those people do not have rights, that hunting and gathering rights are equivalent to native title. The fact i- that nalive title is not equivalent to freehold. the question about recipients of land grants and leases in perpetuity fascinating. I wonder what it cost some of, these people to get it. Who are the vjctims? Who gave it away? The Crown. Who is the Crown? I do not know who the Crown is. None ,of us do. It is a very strange situation. But whose land was it? The High Court has said that it actually belonged to somebody else. The Crown gave it away and, as Lord Denning said, in that situation the Crown acts responsibly on behalf of those whose'land it holds custody of. . It is unfortunate that the opposition has chosen this issue on which to be divisive. It would have been a wonderful thing for Australia and for the world if we as a parliament-as one of the world's leading countries On human rights-had accepted the underlying principles here and had resolved to sit REPRESENT ATIVES Wednesday, 24 November 1993 down and negotiate first. That is the tragedy of this issue. I trust in the months ahead that thatinight be removed as the High Court, as, I feel sure it will,strikes down the Western Australian legislation.

15,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister.

18,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"Let me just begin by saying that the preamble to the question comes from a person who is notorious for ringing journalists and ticking them off, as every-or practically every-journalist in the press gallery will attest. So we can just dismiss that humbug for the humbug that it is. On the question of newspaper ownership, the government's policy has been put together thoughtfully and with complete probity. Let me refer to an answer the Treasurer gave on Monday, when he saidMr Downer interjecting Mr Tuckey interjecting",45
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Mayo and the honourable member for O'Connor!,45
20,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"He said: On 14 December 1992 the government received an application on behalf of Mr Black's interests in which he sought to increase his holding in Fairfax from 15 to 25 per cent. The authors of this application apparently decided to publish this fact because it was reported in the press on 15 December. The first thing is, Mr Black has made an application and told the world that he has-it is a completely open matter. The Treasurer then said that he sought an interim order, and he went on to say: In the event, little was done prior to the calling the election, at which stage I believed it was inappropriateMr Downer-But you rang up Black and suggested it.",45
21,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I warn the honourable member for Mayo.,45
22,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"The Treasurer continued: ... I believed it was inappropriate for the government to give further consideration or at least to make a policy decision on this matter. The reason for that being we were then in an election period and he believed, appropriately, that a question of policy should not be decided by a caretaker government. The Treasurer went on: Upon the re-election of the government, I prepared a submission to the cabinet which set out to review the policy for foreign ownership of mass circulation newspapers . . . It was a full cabinet discussion to review the question of foreign ownership of mass circulation newspapers-entirely and completely appropriate. He then put out a press statement on 19 November. Mr Thckey-You are giving us a history of events, not a justification.",45
23,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I warn the honourable member for O'Connor as well. All week he has been sitting there sniping. I will not tolerate that during today's proceedings.,45
24,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"The government announced.its policy on mass circulation newspapers at the time. When I spoke to Mr Black I made these points to him: I said to him that in Canada there is a limit of 25 per cent on foreign ownership of mass circulation print media. That is to protect the interests of Canada in tenns of its cultural and national interests. But I made the point to him that whatever Canada's cultural and national interests are, its plurality as a society is protected by the media of the United States, the television of the United States, and by the fact that Canada is landlocked by Alaska and continental USA. So Canada's strategic interests are protected by the presence of the United States, with its vast community of 230 miIIion Americans, and the fact that it is of landlocked on both sides. I said that that was not true of Australia, and Australia's newspapers, particularly its broadsheet newspapers, should reflect unambiguously those things which are in Australia's best national interests. 1 said that my view was that a financial arrangement by a foreigner, in this case a Canadian who is not often resident in Canada, coming from the acquisition of Mr Warwick Fairfax and the aborted takeover of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Australian Financial Review, cannot lead simply to I a thoughtless shift of ownership and control to a foreigner of Australia's principal broadsheet newspapers which have an authority to at least speak about the country's national interests. Mr Black said to me, 'I have now, for better or worse, charge of this company, an important industrial company in Australia, the primary print media company, and 1 cannot manage it on 14.9 per cent of the stock'. He said to me on the day on which 1 saw him-I was at the Opera House; he had a meeting with his shareholders the day before- 'I have taken responsibility for it. It needs colour presses; it needs $300 million or $400 million worth of equipment, and 1 cannot do it from a base of 14.9 per cent'. That is what he was permitted in the first instance. The Treasurer made it clear on Monday-and 1 quote: When the government made this decision, the primary and, indeed, sole argument advanced in my submission was on the basis that Mr Black, at this stage, was contemplating an expansion or a reinvestment in Fairfax. The total investment the order of $400 million ... Those who live in Sydney will know that John Fairfax and Sons is transferring its print establishment from the city to the western suburbs and making such investments. So the fact was that, at 25 per cent, such an interest meant there was at least a degree of managerial control in the hands of the Black interests. It could then advance the Fairfax group in terms of its investments, but at the same time the majority of the stock was owned by Australians. It was on that basis that 1 spoke to Mr Black and 1 did raise with him the record of his newspapers. Let me just quote from a couple of articles. Opposition members-Oh!",45
25,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"No, a couple of articles in the Canadian press, one of which states: . Since purchasing the Jerusalem Post he has forced the paper's most senior and respected staff members to quit, provoked the rest into striking and eventually reduced the work force by 190. Another piece in Maclean s magazine in Canada reads: Black's record on permitting his own publishers a free editorial hand is mixed, but since purchasing the Jerusalem Post in 1989 he has firmly nudged its editorial policy from well left of centre to the radical right wing. 1 said to him that 1 accepted his arguments about not being able to have any executive control of the papers at 14.9 per cent, but the government wanted the papers to be a serious reflection of the state of Australian national Iife",46
26,Unknown,Unknown,Opposition members interjecting,46
27,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"I did-and that that should be reflected in these newspapers. He said to me in the course of conversation that the Leader of the Opposition had offered him an unlimited amount of stock in the company. He said, 'He's offered me the right to buy the company'. 1 said, 'What, 100 per cent?' He said, 'Well, he put no limit on it, but 1 only need 50 plus'. Let me point to two references. Firstly, there is the reference in Mr Black's book which states: The Leader of the Opposition had already promised that if he was elected, he would remove restraints on our ownership. was in Secondly, last week on television he said: The issue of our ownership of Fairfax was that the opposition's view was, as a matter of policy, we should be allowed to raise our percentage and they gave no indication that they had any ceiling in mind. Here is the government saying that there are national interests here; that we do not believe that these newspapers should be thrown to the highest bidder; and that we do not arrogantly believe that the election is in the bag and that therefore we could deal with the proprietor and try to rope his newspapers in on the basis of 100 per cent ownership as the Leader of the Opposition did. What is more, the eleCtion was held, the government won it and then properly introduced a cabinet submission by the Treasurer on these issues and took it to 25 per cent""':""-not 50, not 100. There are the express references to Mr Black's view and my repetition of what he told me. That is, that the Leader of the Opposition had offered him the right to buy the papers and I said, '100 per cent'. He said",46
28,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"Don't spread your dirt on us, though.",47
29,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,47
30,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"No, but it is the Leader of the Opposition's dirt. Let me make this clear: we are at 25 per cent, the opposition is at 50 to 100 per cent The Leader of the Opposition is at full and unambiguous control of the stock. If the Leader of the Opposition calls that dirt, he is the only one with the dirt. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order; The question by the Leader of the Opposition specifically related to the grubby and secret negotiations conducted by the emperor-the Prime Minister-by the emperor with Conrad Black and those negotiations",47
31,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The Leader of the National Party will notMr Tim Fischer-Sorry, by the Prime Minister-I withdraw that-with Conrad Black. His reply has dwelt on coalition policy way beyond the specific question. Whilst he is allowed to make passing reference, I ask that you to direct the Prime Minister to come back to the specific question.",47
32,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister is answering a specific question in respect of an issue which the opposition itself has raised of some considerable importance because it has placed it on the Notice Paper as a matter of public importance. I find the Prime Minister entirely accurate-'-rather, entirely appropriate-in what he is answering in respect of the Leader of the National Party's point of order.",47
33,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"During that episode, the Leader of the Opposition made the interjection of corruption. I ask that that be withdrawn.",47
34,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If such an interjection was made, the Leader of the Opposition will withdraw.",47
35,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"I withdraw, but I am not going to have him sharing his dirt with us.",47
36,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"You do not have anything else, you will just withdraw.",47
37,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"The government, subsequent to the election, gave Mr Black and his interests the right to take his equity to 25 per cent. I record that the Age editorialised against the government in an article headed, 'Why the coalition should win tomorrow'; the Sydney Morning Herald editorialised, 'It's time for a change'; the Australian Financial Review, 'Why Hewson Should Win'. There was probity in the government's decision making, notwithstanding the fact that the Fairfax empire had gone against the government-including in the presentation on the front page; after the policy speech, of the heading 'Pork-barrel republic' and the worse imaginable picture that could have been chosen from what was a gala event. It also said, 'and a free set of steak knives too', in what was the most rancid and malicious presentation by a newspaper after a policy speech in the postwar years. Under the heading 'Pork-barrel republic' were the words, '$1.1 billion in handouts and a free set of steak knives too'. I ask honourable rriembers to look at the picture that was included despite the fact that it was the policy speech and I was there with my family.",47
38,Unknown,Unknown,Opposition members interjecting,47
39,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Those on my left will come to order. The Prime Minister is answering the question and will be heard in silence.,47
40,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"The tradition of the Australian media, whatever their position on elections, in editorial terms, is that they run the policy speech straight and give the party that introduces it a go the next day. This breached all such protocols and reasonable events. Without doubt it was the most maliciously put together and most rancid presentation by a newspaper of any major policy speech in my time in public life. So the Sydney Morning Herald did not support the government, neither did the Age or the Australian Financial Review, but we still agreed to lift Mr Black's holding from 15 to 25 per cent. This is against the background of the smug, arrogant Leader of the Opposition going to see Mr Black and saying, 'We have got it in the bag; you can join the strength and if you do there is up to 100 per cent ownership of John Fairfax and Sons for you'. He has the hide to be supporting a Senate committee's inquiry into the government's decision making when we had the Black interest in John Fairfax at 25 per cent and when Mr Black is on the record twice as saying: . . . our ownership of Fairfax was that the opposition's view was that as a matter of policy should be allowed to raise our percentage and they gave no indication they had any ceiling in mind. The Leader of the Opposition had already promised that if he was elected he would remove restraints on our ownership'. In other words, this man sat down with Conrad Black and sought to beguile his support for his party, by throwing Australian interests out the door and throwing away all consideration of Australia's social and strategic interests, and he said to the foreigner, 'Here is 100 per cent if you want it, provided you are with us'. That is John Hewson for you, Mr Speaker. Women: Australian Public Service",47
41,Mrs EASSON,Unknown,My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Is he aware of reports which claim that research by the Department of Finance shows that women face a barrier to promotion in the Australian Public Service? Are these reports accurate? What is the position of women in the Australian Public Service.,48
42,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Lowe for her question. I am aware of a report in the Australian Financial Review yesterday headed 'Too few women in federal bureaucracy'. In part, it says: Women could be facing a barrier to promotion in the federal bureaucracy, the Department of Finance has concluded in research released yesterday. The research, on the Government as an employer, shows ""an unequal representation"" of women in senior positions. The department said this ""could imply a barrier to the promotional prospects of women in the Australian Public Service"". The research referred to was contained in the Australian Public Service statistical bulletin 1992-93 published by my department which contained a chapter on women in the Australian Public Service. I will just quote from the introduction of that chapter. It said: While the overall employ '!lent share of women in the Australian Public Service (APS) is now 46%, it is less than 30% in the Senior Officer classifications, and less than 15% in the SES classifications. This unequal representation could imply a barrier to the promotional prospects of women in the APS. we Having stated that, it then went on to test that premise by analysing the career prospects of two cohorts, of male and female appointees to the Public Service in 1982-83 and again in 1987-88. It concluded from that analysis that particularly since 1987-88 there is no barrier to promotion in the Australian Public Service for women. It is precisely the opposite to what the Australian Financial Review reported as the thrust of the analysis. I quote from the conclusion of the chapter, which said: There appears at least over the past decade to have been no significant difference between the career paths of men and women moving up from base grade levels. Male and female appointee groups are experiencing similar progression paths, particularly those appointed as GAAsthat is, graduate administrative assistants. It continued: Before the introduction of the ASO structure, large numbers of females plateaued earlier and at lower levels than males. This imbalance is now not as pronounced. There is no indication that women entering the APS at the ASO 1 or GAA levels will, as a group, be disadvantaged relative to men in their career progression. So the Australian Financial Review got it entirely wrong. It quoted the premise of the chapter as though it were the conclusion; whereas the conclusion was that there was no truth at all in the premise. As the conclusion notes, the introduction of the ASO structure was important in removing a barrier to women. I might explain how that happened. Essentially, it eliminated a· number of classifications which were heavily gender biased,particularly typists and data processing which were almost entirely female, and it encouraged such people to broaden their skills, become multi-skilled and to be able to progress up the career ladder as a consequence. It also amalgamated the clerical assistant and clerical paths-the clerical assistant's stream was very predominantly female-and that had the effect also of enhancing females' career progression. Since the ASO structure was introduced in 1987-88, there appears to be little difference at all in the progression rates of men and women. But there are some other factors which are also important. If we go back to 1966, which was within the parliamentary life of a couple of members of this chamber, there was a marriage bar on women. Women in the Australian Public Service who married had to resign. This happened just 27 years ago. They may have been taken on again as temporaries in some cases, but essentially it was a total blockage to their career path. After that, the Whitlam government made a number of changes which assisted them, including equal pay for work of equal value, and maternity leave. Equal employment opportunity principles were introduced and have been vigorously pursued by this government as well, so that selection is now entirely on merit. Under this government we have had almost a revolution in child care. The number of government funded places has gone from 46,000 to 237,000 this year. We have introduced fee relief and extended it to private places. From July next year we will have the child care cash rebate to provide substantial further assistance to women. There have been many changes made which have enabled women to reach the point where they have virtually the same career prospects as men. There is no discrimination at all in the Australian Public Service against women. The APS statistics show clearly what is happening. In 1973, 29 per cent of total public servants were female. In 1983, that figure was 37 per cent; in 1993, it is 46 per cent. If we look at the senior officers, the numbers are rather less. Women who were senior officers in 1973 were 1.9 per cent, and in 1983, 8.7 per cent. The figure has increased rapidly so that by 1993 it is 25.8 per cent. For the very top level of the Public Service, the Senior Executive Service, in 1973 women were 0.3 per cent. In 1983 the figure was still only 2.6 per cent but this year it is 14.9 per cent, so the figure is increasing quite rapidly. The lower number of women reaching senior levels reflects the smaller number of women in the feeder groups to those levels. The proportion of women in the senior officer and SES levels has grown consistently by about one to two per cent each year over the last 10 years. If we look at the promotions to the Senior Executive Service, 26 per cent of the promotions last year were women. So o'nly 15 per cent actually are women, but 26 per cent of the promotions are women. So, clearly, women are rapidly increasing their numbers in the SES. Women were 18 per cent of the promotions the previous year and only about 13 per cent five years ago. So from all of that one can see quite clearly that the Financial Review got it woefully wrong-absolutely, woefully wrong. I hope that it is big enough to print the true story. Media Ownership",48
43,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Did the Prime Minister tell senior Fairfax journalists and editors at a luncheon on 19 October last year that Mr Conrad Black was 'on probation' and that the Prime Minister wanted 'more clappers' in the Fairfax papers for his own achievements? I also refer the Prime Minister to a report of a telephone call to Mr Conrad Black in December last year in which he is reported to have warned Mr Black: If you touch me, I will knock yourexpletive deletedblock off. Is this the usual method he uses to achieve balanced reporting? If so, why should anyone have any confidence at all in his ability to determine what is balanced?",49
44,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"What I do not do is sell the national interest out. What I do not do is slime into some foreigner'S office and give away the country's broadsheet newspapers, like the Leader of the Opposition did. I say to the honourable member for Goldstein, 'Leave the questions to the bigger guys instead of pipsqueaks like you'.",49
45,Unknown,Unknown,Opposition members interjecting,50
46,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Prime Minister might withdraw that comment.,50
47,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"I will withdraw, Mr Speaker, if it upsets him. Talk about gall! What does the Leader of the Opposition require? In his first question, er I had a right as Prime Minister to consider the question of balance. The government was the deciding authority. I am the leader of the government. That is where the authority comes from. On the question of balance, what does the Leader of the Opposition want? Does he want an unbalanced newspaper-one· that reflects proprietorial interventions and proprietorial whims? Is that what he is after? No doubt that was exactly what he was after. This was the born-to-rule squad arrogantly thinking they would slide back into office, rolling down the salad days when everyone wanted to see what the Leader of the Opposition's view was on this matter or that matter. He was being feted around the eastern suburbs, at parties and by the business community. He rolled down for a conversation with that great entrepreneur and international media owner Conrad Black. He sat down and said, 'What do you want?'. Mr Black said, 'Well, I'd like to get control of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age'. The Leader of the Opposition said, 'Oh, that's fine, you can them-provided that. .. '. The Leader of the Opposition admitted last night on ABC television that he had discussed the behaviour of journalists with Mr Black. What a front! One has to have some hide to ask questions like he has asked. On this matter of great importance, by the way, yesterday he could not even ask one question about it. He has now sought to set up a Senate committee. When he appears before it, he should tell committee members what he said to Mr Black.",50
48,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,Are you appearing?,50
49,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"Listen, brother, I know my place in the world. I do not slum it before Senate committees. He should try to rebut the claim by Mr Black which was mentioned in this interview last week: The opposition's view was, as a matter of policy, we should be allowed to raise our percentage, and they gave no indication they had a ceiling in mind. He went on to say: This was not an issue with him and he was, in agreed phraseology, very relaxed about what our level of ownership would be in the event that he he asked whethwon the election.",50
50,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister was asked by the honourable member for Goldstein a precise question about a meeting with Fairfax journalists, about a conversation between the Prime Minister and Mr Conrad Black, and about another particular incident. The Prime Minister has spent almost five minutes attacking the opposition but he has not attempted in any way to address those precise questions. Mr Speaker, I think he should be asked by you on the score of relevance to address the matters raised by the honourable member for Goldstein.",50
51,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister was asked a question related to an issue which will be before the House this afternoon. The Prime Minister is answering the question. I might again point out to the honourable member for Bennelong, and other honourable members who have taken points of order in respect of standing order 145 pertaining to relevance, that I am constantly saying .to honourable members that, if they believe that have that standing order needs changing in some way, they should refer it to the Standing Committee on Procedure and bring that about.",50
52,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"If the Leader of the Opposition appears before a Senate committee, he should either confirm or rebut the claim made by Mr Black in his book that: The Leader of the Opposition had already promised that if he was elected he would remove restraints on our ownership. Mr Black has made that clear. Mr Black told me that is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition had said to him. If the Leader of the Opposition was prepared to thoughtlessly pass Australia's national broadsheet newspapers to a foreigner for majority control, on what basis does he have the front to ask any questions about this issue when the government has Mr Black's interest sitting on 25 per cent.",50
53,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,We're not letting you spread your dirt onto us.,51
54,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"I think the thing is that the dirt has come back all over you, pal. I think that is the trouble. When people throw a bit of mud like he has done, they have to get the right angle of attack otherwise it comes back all over them-and it is coming back all over the Leader of the Opposition. He is the man who promised Black 100 per cent stock in John Fairfax. By a cabinet decision, we gave him 25 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition has the question to answer. He alone has the explaining to do. Quality",51
55,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technolcocktail ogy and Regional Development. I would like to draw the minister's attention to today's supplement in the Australian on the Australian quality awards. Can the minister advise the House of the importance of quality to maintaining the national competitiveness of our industries and of the measures the government is taking to promote the issue of quality in Australia?",51
56,Mr GRIFFITHS,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Newcastle for his question. He has had a long standing interest in these matters and I commend him for that. All organisations, public or private, should have-and under this government increasingly do have-a commitment to quality in the way they go about doing their business. Indeed, the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures recently surveyed some 500 Australian exporting companies and 63 per cent of those companies nominated quality criteria as one of the key areas of their competitive advantage. The Australian government, through working with the Australian Quality Council and other organisations, and through various government programs, has sought to enhance and improve the opportunity for Australian companies to compete internationally and to achieve world-best practice in some considerable measure by putting a priority on the issue of becoming competitive in quality. It was not that many years ago that the description 'Made in Australia' would have implied more of a warning than a seal of approval, but we have come a very long way since then. Mr MCGauran-No, that is not correct.",51
57,Mr GRIFFITHS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Gippsland interjects to say, 'No, that is not correct'. He knows little about Australian industry, because everyone of significance in Australian industry would agree with that basic proposition. Indeed, last evening the Australian quality awards were held in Melbourne. The function was addressed, I might say, by the Prime Minister and attended by all premiers except one. The Liberal Premier for New South Wales, in ordering his priorities, thought it was more appropriate to go to a party. Admittedly it was with the very good international pop group, U2, but it makes one wonder about the order of priorities that some people have. I notice in passing, Mr SPEAKER - as you would know, being a fan of the same group-that one of the more popular recent songs of the group U2 is Lemon. The Premier of New South Wales was associating himself not with quality on this occasion, but with lemons. The Ford Motor Co. received the award for large organisations for making huge gains in the quality of its product. The Ford Motor Co. and other organisations regard the awards, and the government's assistance to those awards, as of seminal importance. In terms of medium sized companies, Enhance Systems was the beneficiary. It is a small Queensland company showing what smart, creative small business can do with a commitment to quality. The TVS partnership, a firm of architects, was the winner of the small enterprise section. The government gave a considerable fillip to companies in this area in the last budget when we provided nearly $100 million for a range of programs, an important sub-component of which was the pursuit of better quality outcomes. We should hold this in stark contrast to the opposition policy. I note that the shadow minister for industry, the honourable member for Forrest put out a press release castigating the government on the issue of government procurement. He, along with the honourable member for Goldstein, has castigated the government on issues like quality in the past. It is worth observing that, just as we have. this obvious case of hypocrisy on the matter of Mr Black, we also have an obvious hypocrisy on this issue. Whilst. the shadow minister was castigating the government on the issue of government procurement, he was of course party to the opposition policy during the last election campaign which was not only going to abolish the government's procurement program but also in terms of the vendor qualification scheme-which is a assets mainstream scheme whereby governments the demand of those doing business with them adherence to basic quality principles-to tip answer. the program over. On all of these issues those opposite stand condemned by the absolute hypocrisy of their positions. Media Ownership",51
58,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,I again direct my question to the Prime Minister. Was Mr Conrad Black correct when he claimed on Monday that the Prime Minister invited him to make an applia cation to go from 15 per cent to 25 per cent ownership of the Fairfax group? When Prime Minister invite Mr Black to make that application? Did he believe that in doing this he could coerce Mr Black into ensuring that the Labor Party got more favourable coverage from the Fairfax press?,52
59,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"Mr Black sought from me majority control of John Fairfax and he did not get it. I said that the most the government could consider would be such that would guarantee him the right to have clear managerial control of a company which needed it, which needed the capital invested, ment, because his complaint was that other people could get the 14.9 per cent and no-one could run the company. I think that had validity. I said to him that the government would consider this view, but of course had to make a formal application. Now, that firming up. was not inviting him to make a formal application; he made a formal application. No amount of wriggling around on this is going to change two facts. The government considered this question through a full cabinet process and decided on 25 per cent equity for Mr Black's interests-Telegraph newspapers. The leader of the coalition promised the same group 100 per cent of the stock or that much which it needed to get majority control. They case of are the objective facts. So it is the Leader of the Opposition who needs to answer the questions-on what basis he believed, in his arrogance' at the time thinking the election was in the bag, that he could approach Mr Black and thoughtlessly offer him control of Australia's premier media without a tinker's cuss of thought for strategic and social policy interests of this country. They are the questions he has to Economy",52
60,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown,I ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware of any recent confirmation of a strengthening expansion in the Australian economy. Does he believe that the international economic environment will support Australian economic growth? What policies is the government pursuing to create more favourable international economy? Is he aware of alternative policy ideas to those did the pursued by the government?,52
61,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"I am delighted to be able to report to the House further evidence today of strengthening economic activity. Motor vehicle registrations for October were 15 112 per cent higher than September on a seasonally adjusted basis. This shows that sales are rebounding after the pre-budget bringing and Sons, forward of car purchases. Also, the ABS survey of private new capital a expenditure out today shows that equipment spending in constant prices, seasonally adjustwas four percentage points up in the September quarter on the June quarter. The latest estimate of expe<;:ted investment for 1993-94 is six per cent higher than the June quarter estimate of the same period. In other he words, investment plans by business are This good news comes on top of other good news in recent weeks. Employment rose by over 70,000 in the last two releases: ANZ vacancies are up; DEET skill vacancies are up; the Westpac leading index is up; and housing finance continues to show a strong trend. Compounding those trends in the domestic economy is the tremendous export showing of the economy, particularly in the Asia-Pacific area where the government is again continuing to build a framework for even greater growth. This government has always been open· to good policy ideas. But, having got the economy now growing and these statistics coming out, I have not heard one policy idea from the opposition. All we hear there about is domestic arrangements at the Lodge, who gets a sports grant, whether the dog's kennel has been heated and whether there will be a ban on Christmas carols in child-care centres. This is the level of the debate from the Leader of the Opposition and his party. What is the opposition doing while the government is looking at the big issues of creating a structure in the Asia-Pacific area for Australia to find its place in the next century, while the government has, through 1992 with the One Nation and Investing in the Nation programs and the budget, promoted the growth of the Australian economy as it is dealing with the big social questions like Mabo? It is wading around in sports grants, dog kennels, teak tables and Christmas carol bans because that is about its speed. This is not lost on the whole community. The community knows the government is seeking to create something bigger and better, something stronger and broader and that the economy is responding and society is responding to it. The community sees, from the opposition nitpicking, an absence of leadership, no clarity and no alternative in the policy structure; only the Leader of the Opposition's edict that the opposition will oppose and that is all it will do. Let the public today record again these indices-that the economy is strengthening and that only the government has the policy and the framework to see this change through and that there is not one clear policy idea coming from the opposition. Community Grants",52
62,Mr REID,Unknown,"I refer the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories to an application for a grant under the community cultural and sporting facilities program for an indoor heated pool in Bendigo. The minister will recall a meeting on Thursday, 4 March 1993 with the Bendigo Regional Recreation Board outside the Golden Dragon museum when she told the Mayor of Huntly, the chairman of the board and other board members that, ' Mr Helper is the man to talk to about funding for the project'. If the minister continues to maintain that grants under this scheme were not influenced by political bias, can she please explain why those seeking the Bendigo grant were specifically told by her that Mr Joe Helper, the Labor candidate for Bendigo, and of course not the sitting member, was 'the man to talk to about funding'?",53
63,Mrs KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member's electorate in the last round received approximately $426,000, one of the largest grants in Victoria under the needs basis for funding. Which of those grants does he not want to fund under the needs basis of the assessment?",53
64,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA References to Committees",53
65,Mr TAYLOR,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, my question to you relates to the House Hansard of 16 November at page 2875 where it refers to Auditor-General's report No.9, the one to which the honourable member for Bendigo has just referred. Part of that Hansard reads: ... the report be referred to the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. Can you tell the House who decides to which committee such a matter is referred? Can you explain why in this instance that particular Auditor-General's report was not referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts . which has a standing remit in terms of those reports? Finally, bearing in mind the urgency of the ministerial accountability issues here, can you give an assurance to this House that this matter will be brought to fruition before we get up for Christmas?",53
66,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In respect of the first question that the honourable member has raised, I understand that it is now standard practice within this place-and I will check on the specifics as to whether agreement from both sides was arrived at on this-that when Auditor-General reports are tllbled in this place which are relevant to a particular department and there is a standing committee of tJ1e parliament which is",54
67,Unknown,Unknown,Government members interjecting,54
68,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I do not need the help of those on my right, even though it might be the chairmen of the relevant committees. It subsequently passes that those particular Auditor-General reports go to those committees which in fact have been established and which mirror those particular issues. I well remember when I occupied one of those chairmanships that exactly that happened. In regard to the latter part of your question as to the timing, as to when a report on that specific Auditor-General's report might come before this place; that is entirely a matter for the deliberations of the committee. I would think that in the fullness of time, as they say in politics, that matter will come before the parliament for further deliberation. Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories",54
69,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I address a question to you arising out of the Hansard report of yesterday's exchanges between the Leader of the House and. the honourable member for Higgins. You will recall that during the motion to suspend standing orders the Leader of the House made the following precise allegation: 'The only reason this censure motion is taken up'-ignoring the fact that one was taken up yesterday-' is that the minister happens tQ be on the front bench wearing a skirt'. He alleged specifically, with no shade of grey, that that is what the honourable member for Higgins had said. The honourable member for Higgins took a personal explanation and, having scoured the Hansard, it is quite plain that the honourable member for Higgins' did not utter the words alleged against him. It was a totally false claim made by the Leader of the House. The point of my question is this: this morning there were quite widespread reports in the media of the false allegation made by the Leader of the House. It is alleged in those reports that a sexist remark was made by those on this side of the House. My question to you is: with your responsibility",54
70,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. As interesting as this may be to the honourable member for Bennelong, he has no right to introduce a matter of debate under the guise of a question to you about a matter such as this. If the honourable member has made a personal explanation, that is the end of it.",54
71,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong was coming to his question.,54
72,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, as you are well aware, your authority is the ultimate custodian for the good order of the House. You have a capacity to ask, if not require, that the Leader of the House withdraw the allegation that he made yesterday. It was a totally. false and deliberately inaccurate allegation and if he has the parliamentary guts he alleges he has he will withdraw the allegation'.",54
73,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I assume the question to me is: will I look at the issue that you have raised and will I require the,54

83,Mr LIEBERMAN,Unknown,"I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. My question relates to the Prime Minister's statement during question time today. If my words are not entirely accurate it is because of the noise, but I think I got them down fairly accurately. He said: ... I know my place in the world. I do not slum it before Senate committees. My question to you is: do such statements and attacks on the parliamentary select committee system by a Prime Minister",55
84,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It has become the tactic by the opposition in question time to try to extend it by 10 minutes under the guise of supposed questions to you. If you require a change to the standing orders, only ask and we will provide it to you to stop this kind of abuse of the parliamentary forum.",55
85,Unknown,Unknown,Opposition members interjecting,55
86,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I call the honourable member for Indi with his question.,55
87,Mr LIEBERMAN,Unknown,"My question to you, sir, is: do you consider that such statements and attacks on the parliamentary select committee system by a Prime Minister constitute unacceptable parliamentary language? Can you suggest ways of protecting such valuable committees of the parliament from these megalomaniacal statements by the Prime Minister?",55
88,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The short answer I think would be no. I would think that others in this place would hold a similar view as no point of order was taken and the inference that was contained in the minds of some was at it again not asked to be withdrawn. , Obeisance to the Chair Mr SLiPPER- Mr SPEAKER ",55

90,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I would hope that this has some relevance.,55
91,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,I draw your attention to the provisions of standing order 56: Every Member shaH make obeisance to the Chair in passing to or from his seat. I distinctly saw the Prime Minister of this nation walk out of· the parliament without showing you obeisance.,55
92,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Resume your seat. I will say now-I hope that all in this place take heed of what I say-that the Prime Minister has in fact raised a very valid point. Opposition members-Oh!,55
93,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is no good saying oh to me. This has been demonstrated by that last question directed to me. The role that I perform in this place is to adjudicate on the standing orders and, hopefully, to ensure that the business of this parliament is run effectively and efficiently. I say to all honourable members that questions directed to me should be relevant to matters with which I have direct responsibility and they should not seek to get some fairly crass political advantage from the sort of question the honourable member for Fisher was pursuing. Native Title",55
94,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"That being said, a genuine question was asked yesterday to which I have a response. It was a question from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), and it was an issue which those on my left had an interest in as well. Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General asked me a question about the Native Title Bill 1993 and the entitlement of members to vote on the bill. I undertook to look at the matter raised and advise the House. Standing order 196 provides: No Member shall be entitled to vote in any division upon a question (not being a matter of public policy) in which he has a direct pecuniary interest not held in common with the rest of the subjects of the Crown. The vote of a Member may not be challenged except on a substantive motion moved immediately after the division is completed, and the vote of a Member determined to be so interested shall be disallowed. Honourable members will note that the standing order relates to voting on a question not being a matter of public policy. That is really the nub of the issue. As stated in House of Representatives Practice at page 176 and following: Public policy can be defined as government policy, not identifying any particular person individually and immediately. All legislation which comes before the House deals with matters of public policy and there is no provision in the standing orders for private bills. There have been a number of challenges in the House on the ground of pecuniary interest and each case the motion was negatived or ruled out of order. On this matter May states: No Member who has a direct pecuniary interest in a question is allowed to vote upon it: but, in order to operate as a disqualification, this must be immediate and personal, and not merely of a general or remote character. I am sure honourable members will be interested to hear that on 17 July 1811 the rule was explained thus by Mr Speaker Abbotappeared Mr Costello-I remember it well.",55
95,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"You might, yes. Mr track Speaker Abbot explained: 'This interest must be a direct pecuniary and separately belonging to the persons whose votes were questioned, and not in common the rest of his Majesty's subjects, or on of state policy'. Therefore, it would seem highly unlikely that a Member could become subject to a disqualification of voting rights in the House because the House primarily, if not solely, concerned with matters public or state interest. The Native Title Bill 1993 quite clearly deals with a matter of public policy. I cannot see how any member of this House who votes on the bill can be acting in contravention of standing order 196. Of course, should any member challenge the vote of another member on the bill, it would be a matter for determination by the House itself. Finally, may I say that the conclusion I have reached in respect of this matter is consistent with the views taken by my predecessors in similar circumstances. Some of these cases are referred to in House of Representatives Practice, from which I have earlier quoted. NA",56

98,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,Yes.,56
99,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Please proceed.,56
100,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"Yesterday while I was absent from the chamber attending a funeral, the Minister for the Environment; Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) accused me of having in attempted to have a grant given under the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program to the Howard BMX club transferred to a different organisation. This interest allegation is utterly and completely false. These are the facts: prior to the 1993 federal election, the minister announced a $20,000 grant to the Howard BMX club. In about August or September this year, posters around Howard and a notice was placed in the Burrum River News' advising that this club was no longer operating and its was closed. On 25 October 1993 the Howard Progress Association-a highly interest, respected organisation in the communitywrote to me suggesting that, since the BMX with club had been disbanded, the grant should be a matter transferred to some other organisation in Howard. My office contacted Mrs Marion MCDonald is from the club, who advised that, even though of the club was currently inoperative, it intended ' to proceed with its project next March. On 3 November 1993 I wrote to the progress association and informed it of these facts. I never at any time made any attempt to transfer the grant-or even suggested that it should be transferred-to any other organisation. Indeed, I specifically declined a request to do so. I believe the minister should have known that because, had I wanted to change the grant, I would have gone to her as she is the one who decides the grants.",56

NA Privileges Committee Membership Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveagreed to: That during the consideration of the matters referred to the Committee of Privileges on 28  Quick be appointed to the committee in place of Mr Brown and Mr Simmons. NA Media Ownership",58
106,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! I have received a letter from the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Prime Minister'S unacceptable action in making a government decision concerning foreign ownership of a major Australian media group conditional on his own assessment of whether that group's election coverage fitted balance. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number o/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",61
107,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"I welcome this opportunity to raise this matter of public importance. In doing so, I emphasise at the start that yesterday this matter was blocked as a matter of public importance and today it will be noticed that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is not here. He has again lost control, lost his temper and walked out of the parliament. It is becoming a consistent feature of this government and its approach to public policy that there be no accountability. We have had a minister here swinging for days on the sports rorts issue. Nobody in the government seems to think that is an issue. The Prime Minister has committed one of the most disgraceful acts in Australian public policythis deal he did with Conrad Black-and he is not going to come into this parliament and answer the matter of public importance on that subject. One of the great ironies of recent days is that it took the publication of Conrad Black's autobiography and his appearance on Lateline and other media outlets to start to flush out what, as I said, is one of the most disgraceful acts in public policy in the history of this country. That act, let us be absolutely clear, was that the Prime Minister made a specific commitment to Mr Black that he would consider allowing Black to increase his shareholding in Fairfax from 14.9 per cent to 25 per cent and possibly more, not subject to the national interest, which should be the only criterion, but subject to what he would conclude about whether or not the Fairfax press gave balanced and fair coverage in the course of the election campaign. Do not just take my words for it; let us take the Prime Minister's words. Let us go to the statement he made in Seattle when he was flushed out. He was asked a question about it and he said: I had a conversation with himhis definition of that is, Mr Blacklate last year. When talking about increasing the shareholding from 14 to 25 per cent, he went on to say: We'll think about it, but we want a commitment from youthat is what he said to Mr B1ackthat the paper will be balanced. If there is any notion that you know of bias, that is, that you barrack for the coalition, then there's no way you would qualify as the kind of owner we would like. After the election, the Prime Minister said: I, on behalf of the government, made good a commitment to reconsider and took them to 25 per cent. The Prime Minister then was asked the foIlowing question by a journalist: But, Mr Keating, should a commercial dealing of that sort rest on your judgment about whether a media organisation is fair to Labor? The Prime Minister answered: No, not whether it's fair to Labor, but whether the reporting is fair. The journalist said: You're the judge, are you? The Prime Minister said: Well, I'm the Prime Minister, that's how I become the judge. That is without doubt one of the most disgraceful acts in Australian public policy-not Sleepless in Seattle, absolutely totaIly shameless in Seattle. This issue is important because it goes to the very heart of what we are seeing as a consistent feature of this government. It is the nature of the man who is the Prime Minister and it is the nature of the government and the extent of the impropriety of the government that he runs. We have seen a developing imperial style by this man. No doubt he has left here today and gone back to the palace because he cannot stand the heat. He has an imperial style where he is above everything. He runs the Lodge, and he runs his art collection here or whatever, to suit his own particular tastes and his own particular desire for the better trappings of life to the total disrespect of the interests of the average Australian and the total disregard for the national interest. It is interesting that when that commitment was being made by the Prime Minister late last year in his discussions with Mr Black, he certainly was not letting that be said as a public statement of the position because, on a number of occasions in the media, his staff or spokespeople for the government were saying that there was not any commitment or assurance. They were denying it publicly, but working on it privately. Similarly, the Prime Minister was up to his neck in some of those private negotiations. We have seen reported in the press in recent days a statement about a lunch that took place on 19 October when the Prime Minister met with a group of Sydney Morning Herald journalists and editors at the Broadway office of the Fairfax newspapers. The article stated: Mr Keating gave Mr Mulhol1andthe new managing director of Fairfaxand his offsider, Michael Hoy, a lecture on how they had to realise they now had community responsibilities and that their 'truant proprietor' 'on probation'. They couldn't expect to just come in with their 15 per cent and expect him to give them whatever they wanted ... He went on on another occasion to give a lecture on how Labor was not the Labor Mr Mulholland and Mr Black were used to. The press had given Dr Hewson a sleigh ride, he said, and he wanted more clappers. The Prime Minister wanted more recogn ition and applause for his party's achievements. Mr Mulholland is reported to have then asked Mr Keating to contact him if Fairfax w., doing anything to jeopardise Mr Black's sl,.ueholdings and interests. We all know the Prime Minister's tendency to contact people. It i0 also interesting that in the course of that article, another occasion is referred to my colleague mentioned this today in one of the questions in this House-and that involved a telephone conversation. Apparently, there were several telephone conversations between the Prime Minister and Mr Black in the leadup to this decision. The article says: Mr Keating was in frequent phone contact with Mr Black and told the journalists at that lunch that they were 'stuck with' Mr Black. In one phone conversation, Mr Keating has apparently said to Mr Black: If you touch me, I'll knock yourexpletive deletedblock off. That is the nature of the discussions that were taking place behind the scenes to give substance to the commitment that had been made between the Prime Minister and Mr Black. I notice that he did not tell any of his caucus colleagues about this. There is plenty of evidence on the record-letters from the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) for example, drawing attention to the fact. I quote: Mr Black knew of this policythat is the old policy of 15 per centat the time the Tourang purchase of Fairfax was approved and that policy has been firmly reiterated several times since then. Nothing has occurred to our knowledge which would warrant changing that policy now. If there have been any changes we would appreciate being told what those changes are. was He was working behind the scenes with Mr Black and his organisation. He was not telling his caucus colleagues and was running the public line that there was no assurance; no commitment. It is interesting that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore)-a government member-when the decision was finally announced in favour of Mr Black said: The decision allows both an increase in the concentration of media ownership and an increase in foreign ownership, both of which are contrary to Australia's national interest. Nothing has happened to justify this change. No explanation for the reasons for the change has been given by the Treasurer. So while the Prime Minister was pushing this through behind the scenes, he was misleading his caucus colleagues as well as the people of Australia. A comment reported to have been made by Senator Richardson at the time this decision was being taken is most interesting. The Prime Minister went to great lengths to say it had been through the normal cabinet process, and so on. Senator Richardson is reported as saying: It will be Keating who will ultimately decide although, typically, Keating likes to leave very few fingerprints when he intervenes in media issues. On this occasion, he has slipped up. He has left fingerprints all over this issue. Mr Downer-Footprints.",61
108,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"Footprints and fingerprints; he has been totally exposed. When we criticise the Prime Minister about this or seek to ask questions, what is his response? He dismisses the issue as irrelevant. As he said in Seattle the other day: It is just simply dust in the cracks of history. He also said: . . . not even a splash of paint on the big picture. These two statements he made-as Joh said, 'Don't you worry about that'-would make Joh look like a novice. The Prime Minister has developed a technique of flitting around issues rather than being drawn into answering questions about them. Obviously he is maintaining that approach by not being in the chamber at the moment. I have news for the him: this is not just 'dust in the cracks of history'; this is dirt· oozing out of the gaping hole in his integrity. It is not just a 'splash of paint on the big picture'; it is becoming the big picture as far as this government is concerned. It goes to the very heart of the Prime Minister's role and the type of government he runs-out of touch, out of control and prepared to manipulate the system to any lengths to satisfy his own desires. The other interesting thing is the Prime Minister's statement that he will be the judge of what is fair and what is balanced, in order to judge whether these commitments should be met. We should stop and think about that statement. Allowing the Prime Minister to be the judge of what is fair and balanced is like putting the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in charge of the Department of Finance. Let us think about his track record. He has intimidated more journalists, editors and proprietors than we have had breakfasts. We have only to go anywhere in the press and look at how things operate. If journalists behave they get put on the quality drip and the information is fed out to them. If they do not, they have to look forward to one of those dreaded phone calls-and there have been many of them. An example is the phone call to Bruce Jones of the Sun-Herald in September 1991 when the Prime Minister was a backbencher and offended by the fact that his Comcar bill had been written about. It was a Sunday afternoon on 15 September and Bruce was just sitting down to watch a Raiders game on television. He describes the phone call in the following terms: The former Deputy Prime Minister rang me at home on Sunday, just after the kick-off, to complain about my front page story in the Sun-Herald. His tirade did not finish until after half time . The Prime Minister has no interest in football but Bruce Jones obviously does-and it cost him a half to cop it. He went on to say: 'Known for his robust language Mr Keating didn't mince words or leave any doubt that he has a low opinion of me. This is very damaging to me. He said of the story ""I am a simple fellow. You have hurt me and I will hurt you, you can count on it. You have given me a boot up theexpletive deletedand I will make sure you will get one. That is typical of the way the Prime Minister judges balance and fairness. We can go through dozens and dozens of examples. He had a falling out with the Age and said to the deputy editor: Never in my life will I allow a member of the Sunday Age to talk to a member of my staff. The same will apply to the Treasurer's office. Michael Gordonthen the Sunday Age's Canberra correspondentwill be cut dead. Yes, you are banned. There are dozens of examples. Recently Kerry-Anne Walsh got several phone calls. Randall Markey was told: You are a disgrace. You and your newspaper and your editor are corrupt. You are finished and will never get anything else out of us. That is the behaviour of this Prime Minister time and time again. Of course, he is on the record many times, and there have been suggestions that he has used veiled threats of tax audits. He calls the press 'scavengers and parasites living off decent politicians', 'jokers', 'preying types', 'junkie writers'fundamentally a lazy group of incompetent people. They are just a few of the things he has put on the public record-typical of this man and of the way he would judge balance. He would have us believe that this commitment should be made behind the scenes against the national interest and he should be left free to make the judgment about what is fair and what is balanced. But I guess the most offensive thing in all of this is the way when this Prime Minister is in trouble-and in this case he is in troublehe tries to shift the blame onto somebody else. We saw it all today in question time when he tried to have a go at me about what I reportedly said to Conrad Black about our attitude to foreign investment policy in the media. Mr Lee-What did you say?",63
109,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"I am going to get to it. Do not worry. The Prime Minister indulges in this tactic where, when there is dirt sticking on him or initiated by him, he tries to spread it around and make it our issue and our dirt. We are not going to cop it. In fact, the Prime Minister referred to the so-called commitment to go to tOO per cent. I have never given Conrad Black a commitment to go to 100 per cent. Mr Lee-What about 50 per cent?",64
110,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"Or to 50 per cent, or to any specific number. I have never given that commitment. If he had the decency to go back to the Hansard when those allegations were first made at the end of last year he would read that the then shadow minister, Warwick Smith, denied in this place that there was ever a commitment to go to 100 per cent. Mr Lee-He said. What about you?",64
111,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"There is absolutely no you commitment. All I have ever done publicly or privately is to state our position. Our position is very clear on this issue. We will not have any specific limits on foreign investment. We . do not believe they work. Look at what has happened at Channel to and Channel 7. Specific limits do not work. We start with a disposition towards Australian ownership-a strong preference for Australian ownership and control-and then we look at proposals in relation to media ownership against that disposition. If those proposals have any foreign interest in them or if they are ca1ling for an increase in foreign interest, they will be assessed on their merits against their impact on the national interest-not some personal interest, not some media interest of the Prime Minister, not some political whim of the Prime Minister, but in the national interest. That is the policy I have stated consistently, publicly and privately to Mr Black and to everybody who has cared to ask me. The fact is that nobody should be fooled or deceived by the Prime Minister's phoney distraction on this issue about our media policy. It is his policy, his interventions and his private deals that are the issues, not us. We never sought to extract any sort of undertaking or broker any sort of deal-the Prime Minister did. We never set ourselves up as the sole arbiter of fairness in the media, as the Prime Minister has done. We never linked increased foreign ownership with acceptable levels of fairness, as the Prime Minister has done. We never substituted the economic interests of this country for party political or personal interest in the lead-up to the election, as the Prime Minister has done. He has not even got the guts to come in here and face this MPI and to answer the questions that are genuinely put to him about the extent to which he sold out the national interest of this country for his own personal, political gain.",64
112,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"What a struggle that was. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has been threatening and breathing fire over the last week or so about what he was going to do on this. particular issue and how he was going to pursue the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on this matter. Of course, it has taken until now for the opposition to decide that it is important enough for it actually to merit a speech from the Leader of the Opposition. And what a pathetic excuse for a speech that was. It was, in a sense, just an excuse the opposition leader to vent his well-known spleen on what he considers to be some of the personal quirks of the Prime Minister. This had nothing to do with a matter of great public policy. It was an opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition, under the guise of a matter of public importance, to criticise what he describes as the Prime Minister's imperial style; in other words, to poke fun at, to disparage, the Prime Minister in relation to some of his domestic arrangements and in relation to some of the other issues which have entertained the small minds of this parliament over the last couple of weeks. The opposition simply is constitutionally incapable of addressing itself to the major issues. Opposition members have been squirming around and scurrying around in either the dustbin of the Lodge or the dustbin of some sports grants issue, trying to extract some political point. Of course they have failed absolutely on every attempt, but in doing so they have quite unambiguously and unapologetically avoided the big issues which are confronting this country. They have avoided of course the big issues which were concerned with the APEC meeting in Seattle, the big issues which confront the economy, the big issues in relation to Mabo, industrial relations and so on. We had just a glimpse of what this Leader of the Opposition is really about as he struggles to maintain the flimsy toehold he has on his leadership. He not only abandons any sense of creativity or any sense of responsibility as far as developing policy is concerned but rather he, first of all, opposes everything the government does and then, secondly, looks around in the minutiae of issues to find some particular political advantage. It does not matter how stinky the issue happens to be. Nothing is beneath this man, the Leader 'of the Opposition, in terms of what he is prepared to dirty his fingers with in the pursuit of political office. He raises this issue as a matter of high principle. He raises it as a matter of national interest. It was only in the closing minutes that the Leader of the Opposition actually gave the game away as far as his position is for concerned. Whilst the Leader of the Opposition says that he gave no commitment to Mr Black in terms of what the opposition's view would be on the extent of foreign ownership in Fairfax, he actually gave a quite clear impression to Mr Black that there were no limits as far as opposition policy was concerned to what Mr Black could own of the Fairfax organisation. In other words, when Mr Black had a meeting with the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Black went away with the impression-an impression which he writes about in his book; he has talked about it on a number of occasions since his recent visit to Australia-that there was no limitation at all on the extent of his permitted ownership of Fairfax under a Hewson-led government. Let us crystallise what this debate is really all about. The Leader of the Opposition, when we strip away all the rubbish that he dragged into the debate about the Prime Minister's style-I will get on to his style in a moment, if there is time-is essentially trying to make the point that the Prime Minister, before the election, said to Mr Black, 'You can extend your ownership from 15 per cent to 25 per cent', and that that was said in the hope that it would curry some favour with some or all of the newspapers over which Mr Black could exert some influence. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition is saying that Mr Black should conduct himself, in terms of his papers, in a way which would please the Prime Minister, so that after the election the government would reconsider its position and extend from 15 per cent to 25 per cent the permissible maximum ownership of Black's organisation in Fairfax. If that is the claim, let us look at the counterpoint of it. Mr Black has said that he met with the Leader of the Opposition and had a similar conyersation with him. He has admitted that, in his conversation with Mr Black, he canvassed not only the conduct of Black's newspapers and the behaviour of his journalists but also issues of foreign ownership. On the other side, the Leader of the Opposition has said to Mr Black, 'If I win the election, you can have 100 per cent of the Fairfax newspaper group'. Where is the inducement? Where is the alleged inducement in terms of Mr Black's behaviour during the election campaign? That is what this is all about: whether the Prime Minister was trying to encourage Mr Black, through his newspapers, to adopt a favourable point of view during the election campaign. That is the issue. If that is the issue, what kind of behaviour was the Leader of the Opposition trying to induce in Mr Black by saying, 'If I win this election, you can have 100 per cent of the newspaper. '? Even that was more than the Leader of the Opposition needed to offer because Mr Black had already said that 50 per cent would do. However, the point here is that, even if there were an attempt to induce a kind of behaviour in the newspapers over which Mr Black had some control, we should compare the two offers. Firstly, there was an offer from the Prime Minister to consider, after the election, an increase in Mr Black's holdings from 15 to 25 per cent when Mr Black was asking for 50 per cent. That was the offer from the Prime Minister. Then there was a counter offer from the Leader of the Opposition, if he won the election, that Mr Black could have not only the 50 per cent he had asked for but 100 per cent if he wanted it. What contorted, Alice in Wonderland type logic can bring the Leader of the Opposition in here to criticise the Prime Minister about his pre-election conduct in relation to Mr Black while ignoring, for the sake of his own convenience, his own conduct, behaviour, policy and inducements as far as this matter is concerned? There was an allegation running through what the Leader of the Opposition said-in what he purported to be a speech-that somehow this had been done secretively. As the Prime Minister pointed out, the day after Mr Black's application was made, which was in about the middle of December, it was made public, either by Mr Black or his representatives, that he had applied to increase his stake from 15 to 25 per cent. This was, after all, a public issue. It was further a public issue when I published-published meaning 'made public'-an interim order extending for 90 days the time during which the government would give consideration to this matter. In other words, if the government had been simply going to reject the 25 per cent claim, no doubt we would have done it at that time. But there were issues which Mr Black had raised with us about his ability to control the businessnot the papers; the business-and his ability to justify the investments which he believed were necessary. These were issues that could not be considered between 11 December and 11 January, bearing in mind the holiday period that intervened. Therefore, the government quite publicly said, 'This is an issue which requires more consideration'. In other words, the government was saying that this was a matter at which it was looking. So, there was no secrecy whatsoever. There was the public application by Mr Black to raise his stake from 15 to 25 per cent. There was the government's issuing of an interim order, which meant that the government was giving consideration to the matter. Soon after the issuing of that interim order an election was called and, obviously, the policy consideration was put on ice, which was the appropriate way to go. After the election, the matter was brought before the government in the proper way. Consultations were held with the appropriate parties, including members of our own parliamentary party. The letter from the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), to which the Leader of the Opposition referred, was a letter which the honourable member wrote, along with others, at the time the cabinet was giving consideration to this matterconsideration which was well publicised at the time. There can be no suggestion that any part of the government's consideration of this matter was other than normal and appropriate. The Leader of the Opposition has. said on a number of occasions that there were no commitments made. What we do know is that there were many stories in the press that it was well known that the opposition's policy in relation to foreign ownership was 'the sky's the limit'. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition confirmed the point here today. He said that he can see no point in having artificial limitations on foreign control of the media or the extent of foreign ownership in the media. It is no wonder that Mr Black went away with the impression from his meeting that, if the Leader of the Opposition were elected, he would be able to extend his ownership from the then 15 per cent to 50 per cent, or even higher. This needs to be considered in the context of what actually happened during the election campaign-an election campaign in which the three Fairfax papers all recommended a vote for the coalition. I do not think anyone would say that those newspapers bent over backwards to assist the government. In fact, I do not think any newspaper in the country bent over backwards to assist the government in its re-election campaign. We had a situation where not only were the Fairfax newspapers not going out of their way to support the government but also the government simply looked at this request from Mr Black on the basis on which it was putthat is, at 15 per cent he could not effectively manage his assets, could not effectively protect his interests, and therefore the government considered that an increase to 25 per cent was justifiable. But I find probably the most outrageous part of the Leader of the Opposition's contribution here is the way in which he has decided to bring personality issues into this debate. I would have thought, if there was anyone in this parliament who needed to be concerned and embarrassed about his personality, it was the Leader of the Opposition himself. We need only to look at the way in which he treats tradesmen who build his houses in Bowral; we need only to look at some of the other personality defects of the Leader of the Opposition-his renowned shocking temper and his renowned shocking treatment of his own staff. Before he comes in here making allegations about the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's relations with the press gallery, he ought to look very carefully at his own conduct-not only his conduct in public life but his conduct in his private life as well.",64
113,Dr KEMP,Unknown, Mr Deputy Speaker,67
114,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,You take that back. That is outrageous. Are you really going down that gutter path? You take that back.,67
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, Order! Resume your seat!,67

117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Bennelong will resume his seat.,67

120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Would the honourable member please resume his seat? Does the Treasurer wish to raise a point of order? Mr Dawkins-Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. For 10 minutes the Leader of the Opposition went on a tirade of abuse about the Prime Minister's personal style, including his conduct in the domestic situation of the Lodge. If that is the path down which the opposition wants to go, we will join it.",67
121,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Withdraw it. Mr Dawkins-But if the Manager of Opposition Business in the House takes exception, I will withdraw it. But I say to him that, if his leader goes down that path, I will join him and you. You will not be safe either.",67

123,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,He said he was prepared to withdraw-and that might help the situation. Mr Dawkins-I have. I have withdrawn.,68
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The Treasurer has withdrawn; the discussion will continue. Mr Downer-The Treasurer is unbalanced.,68
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! That will be enough from the honourable member for Mayo. I call the honourable member for Goldstein to continue the debate.,68
126,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"There is really no end to the humiliation which the Prime Minister (Mf Keating) is prepared to heap on his Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). We see a government on the edge; a government which is under enormous pressure; a Prime Minister who finds it very difficult to cope with question time and who cannot cope with an MPI. He cannot come into this House and answer. He throws into the breech the Treasurer-the tame dog that yaps along at his heels-to defend him. What a pathetic defence it was. Mr Leo MCLeay-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: we had a fair amount of confected anger from the honourable member for Bennelong on what the Treasurer saidabout how the debate should be kept on a proper plane. Then, as soon as he sat down, the honourable member for Goldstein referred to the Treasurer as a 'tame dog'. If the opposition wants the debate kept on a proper plane, the honourable member for G01dstein should withdraw that remark.",68
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,It might help the whole debate if the honourable member for Goldstein got to the substance of the MPI.,68
128,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"The Treasurer tried to come into this House and defend the Prime Minister on totally spurious grounds. He told the parliament that this was not a secret deal. He was not even able to mouth the actual terms of this deal in which the Prime Minister has admitted he was prepared to see the shareholding of Conrad Black in Fairfax increase-the Treasurer did not once refer to that. The Treasurer had the gall to tell this House that this was not a secret deal, yet the Treasurer himself in December clearly knew nothing about it. At the very moment when he was telling any journalist who inquired that there was no possibility that the stake of Conrad Black in Fairfax would be increased, an entirely different message was coming out of the Prime Minister's office. This deal was struck over a period of months. The Prime Minister visited senior journalists and editors of the Fairfax organisation in October and told them he wanted more clappers and that, unless he saw a change in the performance of the Fairfax press, he would not consider Conrad Black as the kind of owner the government would want to see increase its shareholding. That same proposition was put by the Prime Minister to Conrad Black in November. The Treasurer still did not know about it. And, in case Conrad Black had not got the message, in December the Prime Minister rang him and Black got it straight from the horse's mouth again when the Prime Minister said: If you touch me I'll knock yourexpletive deletedblock off. Up to that point, the Treasurer knew nothing about it. Of course, the Prime Minister is an expert on secret deals, the most famous of which was the Kirribilli House deal, described totally accurately in Paul Kelly's book, The End of Certainty. What did he say about that deal? He said that Hawke and Keating had made a pledge. Both lied about this secret deal, and then Hawke dishonoured the pledge. In the case of the secret deal with Conrad Black, the Prime Minister went out of his way to conceal the substance of that conversation. The Prime Minister was not prepared to admit that any condition had been put on the deal until Conrad Black, in his frankness, wrote in his book that there had been such a conversation and that there had been a condition. And that condition totally undermined the integrity of the government's position. Again and again the Prime Minister confuses his own political interests with the interests of Australia. He is no longer in a frame of mind where he can distinguish between the two. One of the most frightening aspects, one of the most chilling aspects, about this whole grubby business is the fact that the leaders on that side of the House apparently have no understanding of what is at stake, what they have given away and what they are doing to the' standards of government and democracy in this country, which Australians used to take for granted, It is very interesting that in some of the editorials we have had today it has been said that there has been no evidence of wrongdoing. That was not the view of Kerry Stokes on AM this morning who, in response to a journalist's question, 'Conrad Black says Mr Keating has not compromised the integrity of his office; do you agree with that assessment?', replied, 'I certainly do not; Mr Keating should not have been discussing the issue at all', That is the substantive problem, That is the fact which is too horrific for the Treasurer even to mention in his address because hewho is quite accustomed to personal abuse, who did not hesitate to threaten business organisations of this country who expressed their views during the election and who threatens to blackball them from any contact with the bureaucracy-could not himself come out and admit what the Prime Minister apparently finds no difficulty in admitting. The standards of government in this country have been degraded by a man who has got himself totally out of perspective, who is out of touch with what the Labor Party used to demand of leaders and with what Australians demand of their leaders-that they be honest, that they have decency, and that they be prepared to tell people the truth, to uphold the standards of government and to clearly differentiate their political interests and the public interest. The cancer at the centre of this government has spread out inexorably across that front bench. Yesterday we saw what it has done to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly), one of the acolytes of the Prime Minister. She has picked up the message; she knows what the message is: there is no difference between the public interest and the private interest. The Prime Minister is a man who starts to think of himself as above the caucus, as above the Labor Party; he is far too important for that. The Lodge is being treated more and more like a palace-forget the old colonial furniture from Australia; let us have French clocks; Regency furniture from the period 1800 to 1805 is a la mode; let us have $45,000 sets of dining chairs. If the staff at the Lodge displease him they get a phone call on the weekend, without warning, and they are told not to come back on Monday. (Time expired)",68
129,Mr LEO MCLEAY,Unknown,"Watson) (3.42 p.m.)From the opposition here today we have had a terrible attempt to breathe some life into this issue. We had the confected anger of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and some spraying around the chamber by him and by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). When we look at the legislative program this week, it is rather interesting to see what are the issues in front of Australia at present. There is the question of Mabo; there is the question of industrial relations; there is economics; there is the IR decision; there is the APEC leaders conference; and there is a whole range of big issues. But what issues has the opposition decided to run on in the last two weeks in the parliament? It has been onto sports grants; it has been onto what is in, the Lodge; it has been onto dog kennels; and now it is trying to get onto newspapers. It is as if the Leader of the Opposition in his worry about what Bronwyn Bishop will do has decided to fight her on her own ground. Members of the opposition are getting into the minutia, down in the gutter, and are trying to find the lowest common denominator. Their attitude is, 'Don't worry about what the big issues in the country are. Don't worry about the things that are important to the future of Australia. Let's just get in here and spread around some allegations and a lot of rhetoric and hope that some of it will stick to the front page of the newspaper'. The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Goldstein have put forward a rather bizarre point of view. They have said that the government is disgraceful because it has agreed to a 25 per cent shareholding in the Fairfax organisation by Conrad Black. But it would appear from the evidence that has been put forward that the opposition had no worry about Conrad Black increasing his shareholding to any limit. Somewhere along the line a party that seems to be in favour in the end of 100 per cent foreign ownership is now saying that there is something terrible with the government because it has said that the Fairfax organisation can have a 25 per cent foreign ownership. Even some of the opposition backbenchers are starting to think that there is something amiss with opposition frontbenchers when these are the types of arguments they are putting forward. But what is the government's position? The government's position was made clear by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). The Treasurer, in the press release he put out on 20 April this year, made the government's position very clear. After the government had agreed to increase Black's holding to 25 per cent, the Treasurer said: Fairfax publishers are the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, the Australian Financial Review, Business Review Weekly and various other regional and community newspapers and magazines. The government has determined that a single foreign investor can have a shareholding of up to 25 per cent and an unrelated foreign interest can have portfolio shareholdings of up to five per cent, and the government will not countenance further increases in the permitted level of foreign ment in mass circulation newspapers. If that was not clear enough to the opposition, the Treasurer, in a press release that he put out last Sunday on 19 November, made it very clear. He said: There appear to be some misconceptions regarding the statement by the Prime Minister on the matter of Conrad Black's shareholding in John Fairfax Holdings. The government position remains firmly that a single foreign investor can have a shareholding of up to 25 per cent. An unrelated foreign interest can have non-portfolio shareholdings of up to five per cent. The government will not countenance further increases in the permitted level of foreign involvement in mass circulation newspapers. This is the position adopted by the government and announced on 20 April 1993. There has not been, and there will not be, any change to this policy. That is very clear. The opposition's position is a little unclear. When Senator Alston was interviewed on Face the Press recently and asked what the opposition's position was, he said, 'Well, we've always had a relatively relaxed view about foreign ownership'. And that was repeated by his leader here today. Even though his leader said something about how Warwick Smith had denied this earlierI do not know what he meant by that-the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Alston said that they have had a relatively relaxed view about foreign ownership. They said: We judge it on the merits essentially and we start with a strong predisposition to local ownership and control. But ultimately we are not xenophobic about this. If the technology and the resources and the skills lay elsewhere and they are a necessary part of ensuring that we get a strong, viable local media, then we do not see anything wrong with increasing those limits. Malcolm FaIT raised a rather interesting point. He asked: But if you judge it on the merits, one of those merits you would be looking at would be balanced political coverage from the various outlets. 'Not for us', says Senator Alston. Senator Alston takes a different view when he is dealing with a public broadcaster. He says, 'It is not for us to interfere with what the privately owned newspapers in Australia will nonsay'. But what does he want to do with the public broadcaster? At Estimates Committee involveEon 15 November 1993 he was engaged in a very interesting witch-hunt with the ABC. Senator Alston wanted to know how many people in the ABC were members of the ALP and how many were members of the Liberal Party. He asked Mr Hill, the Chairman of the ABC: Would it be possible for you to provide a list of those staff members who have previously been on the staff of Labor politicians-and Liberal ... Senator Macdonald said: When are you going to get 50 per cent of your staff as Liberals ... These are the sorts of civil libertarians we have on the opposition side. The honourable member for Goldstein has not had much to say about this. Senator Macdonald says, 'What we want in the ABC is 50 per cent Liberals'. Senator Alston says, 'Name them; give us their names'. I wonder why he would want their names. Maybe if he ever became a minister he would decide to do what the opposition is accusing the government of doing-of trying to cause some trouble for these people. The government has never done that but, in regard to the ABC, Senator Macdonald and Senator Alston are pretty clear on this point. They say, 'Give us a list of who works for you, who is Labor and who is Liberal'. So it is pretty clear what their point of view is. The opposition is attempting to suggest there is some sort of impropriety between Mr Black and the Prime Minister in having discussions before the election. Of course, we have not heard too much from the Leader of the Opposition about what he said to Mr Black before the election. But Mr Black was pretty clear about what he understood the Leader of the Opposition was saying. When he was interviewed on Business Sunday he said: I thought this propositionabout his discussion with the Prime Ministermight be seized upon by his opponents, but not successfully, and I made the point of the Opposition was very relaxed about what our ownership ceiling would be in Fairfax. So I thought, perhaps naively, that there would not be a great issue there. It is interesting that this very relaxed thread comes through all the time. Senator Alston is very relaxed about how much Conrad Black owns; the Leader of the Opposition is very relaxed about how much Conrad Black can own; Conrao Black thinks they are all pretty relaxed and that they will relax the 25 per cent rule up to 100 per cent. That is about how relaxed they are. But opposition members come in here with all this waffle and all this confected anger. It is absolute hypocrisy and an absolute attempt to gild the lily. When Mr Black was asked about it by a journalist on PM the other day he said: Well, you can tell the opposition that what Mr Keating said was virtually identical to what Mr Hewson said and they have both behaved with the most complete probity. If the Leader of the Opposition reckons he behaved correctly, according to Mr Black so has the Prime Minister. The last thing I want to mention is this alleged suggestion that Fairfax has been good to us. My God! Let us look at the editorials of 12 March. The headline of the editorial in the Age read, 'Why the coalition should win tomorrow'. In the Sydney Morning Herald the editorial stated, 'It is time for a change'. In the Australian Financial Review it read, 'Why Hewson should win'. I have to say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, if that is how they are"" helping us, I would hate to see them try to hinder us. That is the problem with this whole debate. The opposition knows that what it is putting forward is a truckful of lies. It knows there is nothing in it, but it is getting down into the gutter so that the Leader of the Opposition can confront Senator Bishop on the same playing field as she is used to.",69
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, Order! The discussion is concluded.

131,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, I present the report of the committee, entitled Differential voting shares and the Australian Stock Exchange. Ordered that the report be printed.",71
132,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown,"by leave-This report has its genesis in a request by News Corporation Ltd to the Australian Stock Exchange for waiver from listing rule 3K(2). That would enable Newscorp to put to its shareholders for approval a proposal to introduce super voting shares. The committee was extremely concerned-I would say that on both sides of the House there is a fairly uniform view on thisabout the proposal. It introduces a blurring of the distinction between private companies and public companies, it introduces the concept that a public company could have a differential class issue of shares which could give certain rights to individual shareholders and, ultimately, the taking of control of a public company. As I understand it, the original concept was to have super shares carrying 25 votes per share. The committee's concern is that the time allowed for a proper debate on this matter is too short. The committee was concerned that the Australian Stock Exchange withdrew its power to waive the requirement, which meant the Attorney-General of this country would not then have the power to veto that. The committee has been told by the Australian Stock Exchange that it will not exercise its waiver. The committee now hopes that some time will be given for all interested parties have a good look at this issue, debate it properly, and to take evidence from people who have an interest, before the stock exchange moves and considers the issue of differential shares or class shares in public companies. COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (REENACTMENT) BILL 1993 Consideration resumed from 23 November. Second Reading",71
133,Mr DUNCAN,Unknown," I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to re-enact important provisions of the Copyright Amendment Act 1989-the amending act-in the Copyright Act 1968, which is the principal act. The government has recently been advised by the Chief General Counsel of Australia, Mr Dennis Rose QC, that due to the operation of section 55 of the constitution the whole of the amending act has been invalidated as a result of a decision made by the High Court in March 1993. This opinion was provided after detailed consideration of the terms of the judgment and earlier cases on similar points. That decision, Australian Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd v. The Commonwealth (1993) 112 ALR 53, was concerned with a challenge to the validity of the imposition, in the amending act, of a royalty on blank audio tapes. The court held by a majority of four to three on this point that the royalty levied on vendors of blank tapes was a tax. In consequence it was invalid by reason of non-compliance with section 55 of the constitution. The first paragraph of section 55 of the constitution provides: . Laws imposing taxation shall only deal with the imposition of taxation and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect. In his advice · Mr Rose notes that: The High Court majority went on to hold that since the 'royalty' provisions are inseverably connected with some of the provisions that are invalid because of the first paragraph of s. 55 the 'royalty' provisions are also invalid. The result is that all the provisions in the Amending Act are invalid. to In addition to the purported imposition of the blank tape royalty and associated provisions related to home audio taping, the amending act gave effect to a number of other very significant changes to Australia's laws on copyright and related rights. These were: adding new parts VA and VB to the principal act providing for statutory licence schemes for educational and other institutions to copy, respectively, television and radio broadcasts and print copyright works; adding new part XIA, providing, for the first time, a range of performers' rights; clarification of the relationship between the principal act and the Designs Act 1906 regarding industrially applied artistic works; and streamlining the statutory licence for recording musical works. These amendments were the third stage of important copyright reforms begun in 1984. They were formulated after extensive consultations by the government with consumers, educators and industry participants. Honourable members from all parties generally supported the 1989 bill and its reforms as being significant additions to the principal While some aspects of the protection proposed for performers and various matters of detail in drafting were the subject of debate and subsequent amendment during the passage of the legislation, the amendments have been relatively uncontroversial in practice, apart from the blank tape royalty scheme. I do not intend to repeat a detailed examination of the changes wrought by the amending act. Apart from the blank audio tape royalty that the government has promised to reintroduce separately and associated provisions related to home taping of audio media, an overview of the other provisions of the amending act that this act will retrospectively validate is substantively set out in the second reading speech by the then Attorney-General Bowen beginning at page 2392 in the Hansard of the proceedings of the House of Representatives on 3 November 1988 and beginning at page 3008 in the Hansard of the proceedings of the Senate on 28 November 1988. I wish to emphasise that the provisions of this bill do not effect any policy change or new initiative; They are directed solely to reenacting all the amendments to the principal act made by the amending act except those imposing, and related to the imposition of, the blank tape royalty. The validation is retrospective, operating from the respective dates on which the various provisions of the amending act were proclaimed. There is some variation in the form of the re-enacting provisions. This arises for technical reasons due to the fact that the stages of commencement of various parts of the amending act and the actual dates of deemed commencement of particular sections are now known. It would be, in the government's view, inappropriate to reopen any of the issues exhaustively debated late in 1988 and in the early months of 1989. A vast range of commercial and legal arrangements have been set in place, decisions made about the taking or assertion of legal rights and so on, all based on the presumption of the validity of the amending act, except, of course, the blank tape royalty. We do not envisage that any person would be unfairly affected by the act. reinstatement of the law by this bill. As I have said, the bill is purely technical in nature. The invalidity of these provisions is an unexpected and unfortunate result of a High Court challenge to just one part of a raft of significant measures. I would hope that the parliament would see the value of their reinstatement and of doing so quick1y now that the issue of the invalidity of the provisions has been raised. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Williams) adjourned. NA SAFETY (MARITIME INDUSTRy) BILL 1993 Consideration resumed from 23 November. Second Reading",72
134,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Burke-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (4.03 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Australians and the Australian economy pay dearly for work-related fatalities, injuries and industrial diseases. The Industry Commission, in its recently released draft report into workers compensation in Australia, has noted that every year there are at least 500 deaths, 200,000 injuries and an unknown number of people who fall ill principally because of hazards they have been exposed to at work. The monetary costs are estimated to be of the order of $10 billion annually. Employees, their families, employers, insurers and society in general all bear this burden. Non-monetary costs, such as the pain and suffering of an injured employee or the loss of a loved one killed in a work-related accident, cannot be calculated. In the Australian shipping industry alone, over the past five years there has been an average of 1,000 injuries a year reported to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Many of these injuries could have been avoided. The purpose of this bill is to make the maritime industry a healthier and safer industry to work in. The bill has two key elements. Firstly, it establishes a consultative framework for the ship operator and maritime industry workers to cooperate in developing a safer working environment and better work practices. Secondly, it sets out the duties of care to be observed by all who work on board ships and offshore industry mobile units. This element, in effect, codifies the common law. Over the past decade or so, all Australian states, territories and the Commonwealth have developed new style OHS legislation based on International Labour Organisation Convention No. ISS-the Occupational Safety and Health Convention 1981. This national approach was reinforced in 1985, when this government established the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission to provide national coordination, facilitate national action and raise public awareness of OHS issues. The arrangements set out in the bill are based on the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 and are similar to the arrangements provided under the occupational health and safety laws of the Australian states and territories. Last year, parliament passed legislation introducing a new workers compensation scheme for seafarers. One of the vital elements of that scheme is its mandatory rehabilitation arrangements, aimed at getting injured workers restored to health and back to work 'as quickly as possible. The new OHS arrangements will complement the new seafarers compensation legislation by addressing the causes of accidents and thus reducing workplace injuries. To reinforce this complementary element, the administration of the new maritime OHS arrangements will be combined with the administration of the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992. The authority will have its functions expanded to reflect its new responsibilities and its name will be changed to the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority. I will now describe the major features of the bill. General duties of care , The provisions contained in part 2 of the bill set out in general terms the mutual responsibilities of ship operators, employees and contractors, as well as the responsibilities of manufacturers and suppliers of plant 'and substances used on ships. In essence, all parties must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the workplace and the work performed there do not endanger the safety or health of the workers, or of any other person in the vicinity. Included in the employer's responsibilities is the important requirement to give employees the necessary information, instruction, training and supervision to perform their work safely and in a way that does not risk their health. As part of those responsibilities, industry employers and the maritime unions have been jointly developing industry-wide training packages suitable for use on board ships. I commend the industry on this initiative, which will allow seafarers to keep up to date with their OHS training during their offduty periods. Workplace arrangements The bill provides a framework for employers and employees to cooperate and consult in addressing health and safety t,natters in the workplace. It does this through the establishment of designated work groups and health and safety committees, and the selection of health and safety representatives. The workplace arrangements provide mechanisms for the health and safety representatives of the shipboard work groups to work with shipboard management in ensuring safe working practices and in identifying and eliminating work hazards. I do riot intend to describe these arrangements in detail. However, it is important to note a number of aspects in relation to the powers of a health and safety representative. The representati ve has the power to issue a provisional improvement notice requiring the person in command to take corrective action to stop or to avoid an unsafe practice. If the person in command and a health and safety representative cannot agree on the solution to a problem, the bill provides for intervention by an inspector. In addition, if the representative believes there is an immediate threat to health and safety, the representative may order a cessation of the activity in question. This action can only be taken in an emergency and only if a supervisor cannot immediately be located. The cessation of work must be immediately reported to a supervisor so that an assessment can be made as to whether it is safe to resume the activity. Standards and codes of practice An important aspect of the bill, in terms of the government's commitment to encouraging a uniform national approach to OHS, is that it provides for the adoption of suitable standards and codes of practice which have been declared by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. However, account will also need to be taken of the standards imposed on shipping by international maritime safety conventions and international labour conventions, through the Navigation Act. Inspectorate While the legislation's co-regulatory approach, which I have already outlined, emphasises cooperation in ensuring health and safety in the workplace, there needs to be effective enforcement of standards. The Australian Maritime Safety AuthorityAMSA-will have inspectorate responsibilities under the bill. AMSA has extensive experience in dealing with health and safety matters on Australian and foreign ships in its administration of the Navigation Act and the judgment and skills of AMSA's marine surveyors are widely acknowledged throughout the industry. AMSA is developing appropriate OHS training courses for its surveyors to reinforce their existing knowledge and experience. Appeals The bill provides for appeals against the decisions of inspectors. Appeals may be made to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, referred to in the bill as the 'reviewing authority' . Sanctions The bill provides that financial penalties be imposed on employers or employees who breach the legislation. Manufacturers and suppliers will also be liable to prosecution and fines for contravening the legislation. If a health and safety representative abuses his or her powers, the representative can be disqualified for up to five years. Conclusion Over the past decade the Labor government has introduced a number of far-reaching reforms for the shipping industry and the waterfront. These reforms have resulted in large productivity gains and significant improvements in industry sector competitiveness. In the shipping industry, there has been nearly a 40 per cent reduction in crew sizes on modem ships, compared with the situation 10 years ago. This biII is another step in the reform program. It will bring the maritime industry into line with the modem OHS arrangements applicable in the states and in Commonwealth employment, ensuring a safer working environment for seafarers. This, in tum, will further reduce costs to the maritime industry and the many industries it serves. I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Cobb) adjourned. NA SAFETY (MARITIME INDUSTRy) NA . BILL 1993 Consideration resumed from 23 November. Second Reading",73
135,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Burke-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (4.12 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill makes a number of consequential amendments to the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992. They relate to changes to the name, functions and constitution of the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority. The authority will now be called the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority, to can reflect the expanded range of responsibilities which it will perform upon enactment of the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Bill 1993. The provisions of this bill are described in detail in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Cobb) adjourned. VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Beddall, and read a first time. Second Reading",75
136,Mr BEDDALL,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill reflects the government's continuing concern for the welfare of veterans and their dependants. In Building on strength, the government announced as part of its advancement towards a fairer Australia that it would improve the position of low income retirees by easing the pensions assets test and by introducing a seniors health card. The government fulfilled the first part of this commitment by introducing legislation to ease the pensions assets test from 20 September 1993. This bill meets the second part of that commitment by introducing a seniors health card from 1 July 1994. This card will give certain low income non-service pensioners access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits and hearing aid concessions as well as entitling them to dental and optometry services. It is estimated that this proposal will assist a total of 10,000 veterans and dependants. This bill improves the assessment of child related payments for service pensioners. The main features include: the ability to redirect child related payments to the partner; adjusting the pension payment in shared care cases so that the child related payments are also shared; backdating child related payments to the first payday after the date of birth in those cases where notification is received within thirteen weeks of the birth; and ensuring, where pensioners have children and are receiving maintenance income, the maintenance income only affects the child related payments. These changes result in a more equitable method for assessing child related payments and flow from the family payments structure under the Social Security Act. The bill also contains three measures concerning the assessment of managed investments. As all these changes are beneficial to service pensioners with managed investments, it is proposed that they commence from 1 April 1993. The first clarifies the legislation by ensuring that all losses can be offset against profits from other managed investments. The second ensures that, where an investment has been held for less than 12 months and. only an interim rate of return has been declared, that rate will be maintained as the annual rate of return. Applying the current provisions, the interim rate of return is extrapolated for twelve months. This can result in a higher rate of return being maintained in the service pension assessment than the actual rate of return over a 12-month period. The third measure addresses certain friendly society investments. In the current economic climate a number of friendly societies have changed status. Under the act, a change in the status of a friendly society would affect an investment made with that company. The investment would be considered as 'realised' and any profit that has accrued would be maintained in a person's service pension assessment for 12 months. This measure would safeguard these investments by providing that, where the conditions of the investment remain substantially the same, the current assessment rules will apply. Profits from the investment will not be assessed until it is 'realised' by some other method. This bill provides consistency in the 'arrangements for offsetting compensation payments against disability pension for the same incapacity or death for which compensation is paid. At present, these provisions apply only to disability pensions paid under part IV of the act in respect of defence or certain peacekeeping service. The amendment ensures that . the offsetting arrangements will also apply to disability pension paid under part II in respect of war or operational service. These provisions will apply only to payments of compensation made after the date of royal assent. The bill also clarifies the operation of the tax file number provisions where a person fails to comply with a request for a tax file number. In such instances, the Veterans' Entitlements Act currently directs that the person's pension or allowance is not to be paid. The amendments set out the effect of failing to comply with a request for a tax file number and introduce a generous reconsideration period. It is proposed to give the person three months from the date the pension was last paid to comply with the request for a tax file number and still receive full restitution the cancelled payment. This would allow the person time to consider the consequences of failing to provide the tax file number. If a person complies with the request after the expiration of the three-month period, the pension or allowance will be restored from the payday after compliance. This three-month period is in addition to the 28 days that the secretary already allows the person to comply with the request before action is taken to stop the pension payment. This amendment puts beyond doubt the intention of the legislation. Another initiative simplifies the current arrangements for withdrawing an application to determine qualifying service or a claim for service pension. It allows for a person to orally withdraw a claim and to reactivate the claim, within 28 days of its withdrawal, without penalty to the original claim. This initiative is consistent with the aim of assisting pensioners in their dealings with the department by encouraging oral communications. Finally, this bill will make a number of minor changes in the area of service pension assessment including a series of technical and consequential amendments. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Cobb) adjourned. NATIVE TITLE BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed.",76
137,Ms WORTH,Unknown,"I am pleased to speak on the Native Title Bill 1993, for it is commonly recognised as one of the most significant pieces of legislation to come before this parliament. Yet I am acutely aware of my limited experience on indigenous issues. There are 66 members of this House with larger Aboriginal and Islander communities than I have. Five out of every six Aborigines and Islanders come from four states and territories other than South Australia, namely, Queensland, Northern Territory, New South Wales and Western Australia. My contact with Aboriginal and Islander people of has been positive but limited. Yet, perhaps with the clarity of someone who can stand back from the heat, I hope I can see some of the issues more clearly. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) aspires to the high moral ground. In his address to the nation last week he claimed that native title is an issue that the country could not ignore either legally or morally. The following day he used question time to cast aspersions on my party. He implied that if the Liberal Party were not racist it would support his bill.",77
138,Mr COBB,Unknown,Outrageous!,77
139,Ms WORTH,Unknown,"The honourable member for Parkes is quite right: it is absolutely outrageous. The Prime Minister said: What we are seeing, as we have all the way through, is simply a moral and political vacuum. Our response to the Mabo decision involves us in deep issues of morality. However, I find the preacher's zeal displayed by the Prime Minister galling to say the least. This is the Prime Minister who congratulated the true believers on a campaign victory based on misinformation. This is the Prime Minister who gave the trade union movement an industrial relations bill as a reward for campaign support. This is the Prime Minister who used public funds from a so-called community facilities program to pork-barrel marginal Labor seats. This is the Prime Minister who told a newspaper proprietor that government decisions were to be based on whether the Prime Minister's party got a good run in his paper. This Prime Minister has no right to preach at us. He has put up support for his Native Title Bill as his test of moral purity. Let me suggest my own test. The moral way is that course of action which will best enable Aboriginal and Islander Australians to craft their own future free from disadvantage and discrimination and in a state of harmony with other Australians which is founded on an honest appreciation of our shared history. Fundamental to this approach is an acknowledgment of native title and the legitimacy of the Mabo decision. Let us. not let the drama of high policy blind us to the communities which have to live with the consequences of our decisions. The Meriam people of the Murray Islands are one such community. For countless generations their forebears have occupied three islands in the Torres Strait. They have cultivated their traditional lands according to their own local laws and customs. These families came to the High Court and said, 'We have respected each other's rights for centuries according to the laws of our community. Please recognise our rights according to the laws and customs of the nation of which we now find ourselves'. I believe that the Mabo claimants were asking for a fair thing and that the High Court was just to grant the claim. The High Court's decision has given us as a nation an opportunity to make a realignment of the legal principles underlying our nation to more accurately reflect reality. The reality is that Aborigines and Islanders occupied this land for thousands of years before European settlement. Aboriginals and Islanders, in spite of significant dispossession, were the first Australians, and within the new nation continued to enjoy many of their established rights over the land. The Mabo decision acknowledges this reality and asserts that the estimated five per cent of Aboriginals and Islanders that remain in possession have the right to have this possession recognised under the introduced English common. law system. It is fundamental that our response to the Mabo decision accepts the legitimacy of the Mabo decision. The Liberal and National parties accept the legitimacy of the Mabo decision-full stop. The Liberal Party's acceptance of Aboriginal aspirations to land is not given grudgingly. My party has a proud record in Aboriginal land rights. At the federal level we implemented the Northern Territory land rights act. At the state level, in my own state of South Australia, it was the Tonkin Liberal government which enacted the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Act in 1981. One leading legal authority described the act as 'a landmark in legislation' and 'one of the most far-reaching enactments for the general advancement of Aborigines since white settlement'. The Liberal Party continues in that tradition by accepting native title. The second fundamental principle in relation to our response to Mabo is that we are committed to protecting the rights of all Australians equally. Having recognised native title, we are committed to establishing processes for its administration which are not discriminatory. The federal Liberal and National parties have declared that they do not support any weakening of the Racial Discrimination Act. There are some who suggest that native title is inherently discriminatory in that it is a class title which is only available to one group of Australians. Therefore, it is said that the title offends the principle of equality before the law. Certainly, native title is available only to one group of Australians, but even under current land management regimes there are forms of property rights which are available in one state and not in another. Further, native title will often be similar to other established property rights such as easements and rights of way. The term 'native title' indicates the source of the right more than the nature of the right. Even then, native title will usually involve less complete rights over property than the freehold title held by most other Australians. The Liberal Party has yet again passed the test. We adamantly support the recognition of native title and a non-discriminatory approach to its administration. Yet the government condemns us, seeking to cast us as racists, not because we support native title and not because we uphold the Racial Discrimination Act but because we differ from the government on how best to implement these decisions. In acknowledging the existence of native title rights at common law the High Court did not detail those rights and their operation to the level that we will need for social and economic advancement. It is appropriate that the states and the federal government work cooperatively to clarify the situation. There be differences of opinion on how best to accommodate the various interests involved. Yet the government asserts that if we do not support its approach we are racists of some kind. This approach is not merely politically irritating. I believe it undennines the very reconciliation the Prime Minister claims that he seeks to promote. He constructs a racist straw man and tries to mislead Aborigines and Islanders into believing that the alternative national government does not acknowledge their basic rights. How can Aboriginal and Islander Australians be reconciled to this country when the Prime Minister peddles such assertions? By continually casting the coalition as racist and unsupportive of Aboriginal and Islander aspirations, the government is holding back the cause of reconciliation. As a member of my first parliament, I have been struck by the depth of commitment on both sides of the parliament for the advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia. On the government side, I do not question that both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) are sincere in their commitment to redress disadvantage. On the coalition benches, our leadership has been active, listening to Aboriginal and Islander people. In particular, I pay tribute to the work of coalition members who represent large rural electorates with significant Aboriginal communities. While some government members have freely boxed in these people as rednecks and cross-wavers, I have been impressed with their wannth and active advocacy of Aboriginal advancement. Yet this breadth of commitment has not produced unanimity in policy issues. While there can be bipartisan support for global objectives, we are a long way from unanimity on the policy response. Where perhaps we can be bipartisan in the short tenn is in being more tolerant of others' perspectives, less focused on what values we think motivate people and more focused on the policy than results. I would urge all participants in these issues to stop using the label 'racist' as some sort of curse to ward off evil spirits. The fact is that racist values are will not rooted in reality and will produce poor policy. It is more constructive to highlight the deficiencies of the policy than to be distracted by name calling. The federal coalition does not consider that this bill represents a just or a workable response to the Mabo judgment and we reject it on four grounds. Firstly, it tries to link the Mabo judgment with the process of reconciliation. The process of reconciliation is very important to Australia's future. The coalition is committed to this process, and our shadow minister, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), is a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. However, it is reckless to intenningle issues relating to reconciliation which are sociological with issues relating to the Mabo judgment which are legal and administrative. We cannot legislate for good race relations, and to try to incorporate reconciliation and legal refonn into the one process could jeopardise both. Secondly, we reject this bill because we consider that it will prove to be unworkable. It is undoubtedly a legal, bureaucratic and administrative nightmare. An illustration of this is the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. As recently as September 1993, the government was proposing to suspend the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act to enable the states to validate past grants affecting native title. It was then the opinion of the government .that suspension of the act was necessary to ensure that the validation of leases would be effective. By October 1993, the government had decided not to suspend the act. Nothing has changed except the government's advice. The government believed that the leases would be effectively validated while the act remained in force. Now it is November. What if the government were right in September? This bill is not watertight. It threatens to create as many legal and administrative nightmares as it purports to resolve. Thirdly, the coalition rejects this bill, because its constitutional validity will undoubtedly be questioned, especially in view of the significant grab for power by Canberra at the expense of the constitutional rights of the states for land management. It is high time that the Commonwealth accepted a cooperative, federalist approach with the states and territorthis ies on Aboriginal and Islander affairs. Even if Labor's ideological aversion to states and territories is so great that it will not consider states rights arguments, I urge Labor to cooperate for the sake of Aboriginals and Islanders. Most of the services provided to address the significant social and economic disadvantages experienced by Aboriginals and Islanders are primarily delivered by the states and territories. Only through a cooperative approach can we ensure that Aboriginals and Islanders receive the services they need to meet their needs. Let us consider some of these needs. Fifty per cent of Aborigines and Islanders from 15 to 19 years of age are attending some form of educational institution compared to 90 per cent of the total population, and education is a state service. The life expectancy of male Aboriginals and Islanders is 18 years less than the Australian male population as a whole, and health is a state service. Aborigines and Islanders are more than twice as likely to be in rental housing than other Australians, and housing is a state service. The rate of Aboriginal imprisonment is 18 times higher than that of other Australians, and police and correctional services are state services. The Commonwealth is again launching into land management, an area which is primarily a responsibility of the states. Rather than supporting the states and territories in their responsibilities, the Commonwealth seems determined to interfere, duplicate and usurp. In 1967 the Aboriginal referendum authorised the involvement of the Commonwealth in Aboriginal affairs but, in doing so, it gave the Commonwealth concurrent rather than exclusive powers. The Commonwealth needs to share these responsibilities. After 25 years of involvement, the Commonwealth government expenditure on indigenous programs is over $1 billion each year. It might be expected that the government may have learnt something from this and learnt some humility. The socio-economic and health situation of Aboriginal and Islander Australians is similar to that of a community in a Third World country. To overcome shameful situation, there needs to be full cooperation between the Commonwealth, states and territories. I am not saying that the Commonwealth should not be involved in the provision of land for Aborigines. The special relationship that many indigenous people have with the land is so integral to their culture and prosperity that it needs to be a key policy tool in Aboriginal affairs. With Aboriginal groups straddling the old colonial boundaries, it is appropriate for the Commonwealth to have a role in developing a national presence on the issue. However, as usual, the government began this process like a bull at a gate and had to be bludgeoned from all sides to develop a compromise which is still only acceptable to some parties. It is a matter of real concern that the Western Australian and Northern Territory governments do not support the legislation. In these two jurisdictions alone there are nearly twice as many Aborigines and Islanders as there are in Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the ACT combined. The Commonwealth needs the cooperation of Western Australia and the Northern Territory to achieve a workable strategy for Aboriginal advancement. Fourthly, the coalition opposes this bill because, rather than reducing uncertainty, it will significantly increase it thereby destroying investment and costing jobs. These issues are of real concern not only to the Australian community as a whole but also to the Aboriginal and Islander people that this bill is meant to help. They, like other Australians, want property rights which are clear and secure and they will not get it from this bill. Aboriginal and Islander communities seeking to develop economic self-sufficiency will not be immune from the instability that will result from the government's approach. Investment and jobs will be lost throughout the Australian community. In closing, I record my disappointment at the government's approach to the development of this legislation. Initially, the coalition parties broadly endorsed the government's program of consultation. Yet at the June 1993 Council of Australian Governments meeting in Melbourne, the Prime Minister arrogantly tried to hijack the agenda and forced a broader reconciliation package on the meeting at the last moment. The other leaders rejected this approach and an opportunity for agreement was lost. Since this debacle the Prime Minister's arrogance has shot to the surface. He has largely acted unilaterally, with reckless regard to the practicalities of land management in the states.",77
140,Mr COBB,Unknown,Almost a daily event.,81
141,Ms WORTH,Unknown,"That is right. The government has frequently used the racist slur to suppress debate. There has not been effective community debate and consultation. It is my hope that the Senate will see the wisdom of holding its own inquiry into this bill to try to bring the community back into this process. No doubt such a decision would stimulate another display of prime ministerial arrogance, but how could we not justify a review of this legislation? The federal budget produced a flurry of committee references. If this legislation is one of the most important and far-reaching pieces of legislation to come before this parliament, why should it not also be reviewed by a Senate committee? The community needs to be consulted thoroughly, not only so that we can avoid bad policy but also so that the community is able to come to a shared commitment on these issues.",81
142,Mr QUICK,Unknown,"Franklin) (4.36 p.m.)Representing a Tasmanian electorate, I am very well aware of the divisiveness concerning the Aboriginal issues facing this country. Nowhere else in Australia saw the English concept of terra nullius exploited to such a high degree. The false notion that no-one inhabited Tasmania previous to white settlement, and the ensuing program by the English to prove that falsehood, is a sad testimony to why the Mabo decision is so important for this nation. Having the opportunity to speak on this very important Native Title Bill, one is mindful of the historic nature of this bill and the emotive reactions that it has generated out in the public domain. These responses are good only if we can ensure that all people are aware of the issue,. the reason behind the introduction of the legislation and the consequences of its implementation once it is passed by both Houses. To hear the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in his speech say that most indigenous people are uncertain of what the Mabo decision means for them and that they have not been properly consulted might be true. It is true not only of indigenous people but also of the rest of the community. But surely this is true of most of the legislation that is debated in this House. Just because this might be so does not mean that we just accept this ongoing fact. Surely our task as members of this House is to ensure that this ignorance and non-involvement by Australians on this most important issue changes and that all people have an opinion one way or the other. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), during his speech on the bill, said: The government recognised the national and historic importance of a proper response to the Mabo decision, and put in place a year-long process of consultation and detailed policy development. The reason those opposed to the Native Title Bill have been able to generate so much hysteria, fear and uncertainty in the general community is that we have a huge, urban electorate with little or no experience of contact with indigenous Australians and their way of life. These people should know the truth behind all aspects of the Native Title Bill. It is up to us, the elected members of parliament, to do this here in this place as well as out in the electorate. It is also vitally important that the media accurately portray the bill for what it is, rather than seek to sensationalise it by emotive headers in their dailies. I cite for the record some headers that have appeared across the country: 'Blacks Culturally Backward: Perron'; 'Archbishop Brings Hitler into the Mabo Debate'; 'The Mabo Monster Unmasked'; and 'Fischer Brands Aboriginal People as Ungrateful Lot'. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 21 July this year Gary Foley put this view regarding urban Australia's non-understanding of the Mabo issue most succinctly when he said: While most Kooris know your world, your society, your language and culture very well, you know .virtually nothing of our world, and what affects today. How is it possible for people so ignorant a topic to participate and be taken seriously? How is it that anyone can even pretend that any semblance of intelligent debate could occur in the midst of such appalling ignorance? In my first speech in this House I mentioned that one of my priorities was to participate in any debate on the process of reconciliation between indigenous people and other Australians. This issue, like that of slavery in the United States in the mid-1800s, has galvanised and divided public opinion into two distinctly opposing groups, each with their emotive rhetoric and appeal to 'ordinary Australians' that their's is the way, the truth and the light. The Keating government is concerned with the big picture issues and is determined to ensure that the passage of this very important bill is accompanied by an understanding by the Australian population in general of the reasons behind the consultation and discussions that have taken place already. Just like all the big picture issues facing parliaments across the world-free multi-racial elections in South Africa, Palestinian sovereignty, the Irish issue, and democracy in Burma, to name but a few-there are those whose position in society enables them to command media attention and espouse doctrinal points of view. These people have an obligation to put forward a true and balanced point of view regarding the Mabo issue. Unfortunately, this has not been the case for many on the other side of the argument. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron, attacked Aborigines for what he said was their lack of hygiene, their extraordinary relationship with dogs, and their refusal to live in houses. A former Liberal Prime Minister, Sir John Gorton, said that there could be no reconciliation with Aborigines because: You need to look after them and treat them probably better than ordinary whites are treated, because they're inferior. In his speech, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said that the Native Title Bill was complex. Of course it is. This issue is probably the most complex issue that us the federal parliament has ever had to tackle . of What does the honourable member for O'Connor want: a simple answer; a shallow response to right one of our country's major wrongs? . To return to what I was saying at the beginning of my speech, the concept of terra nullius is one of our country's major wrongs. Australia was occupied by Aboriginal people before English settlement. Not only was it occupied but it was, and still is, the home of nations of people whose borders are well marked and well known. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Mabo decision provides all Australians with the opportunity to cease living the lie of terra nullius. What a rejuvenating and purging opportunity our nation has been given with the Mabo decision. Through Mabo, our nation can recognise that, following English settlement, a great struggle occurred between Aboriginal people and white settlers. Across Australia, there were wars between white settlers and Aboriginals over land. All of these events occurred yet, unfortunately, they have been buried by white Australians through our history. Millions of Australians now have the opportunity to recognise what actually occurred in our history. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) said in his speech that he was raising the concerns of millions of Australians. I think that was rather presumptuous of him. It shows how he unnecessarily continues to live a myth on behalf of the people he claims to represent. The honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) stated that this bill will not result in reconciliation. It would result in reconciliation if only the opposition parties supported the spirit of this bill rather than continuing their campaign of misinformation and subterfuge. The Leader of the Opposition stated yesterday that he made a big trip to see indigenous people. Like a modern day Stanley, he came back an expert on Aboriginal people and their problems. I would like to remind the House that in Tasmania during the early 1800s, George Augustus Robinson made a similar trip to that of the Leader of the Opposition. Robinson also thought that by visiting and meeting Aboriginal people he would be able to understand their needs and make a decision on their behalf about what would be right for them. We now know how misguided and terribly destructive those sorts of patronising thoughts and actions can be. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Mabo decision and the Native Title Bill are not about telling Aboriginal people-or finding out from nonindigenous Australians what they think-what is right for them. Together, they are a simple recognition of the fact that Australia was occupied before white settlement; that across Australia indigenous occupation has continued; and that provisions have been made for that occupation to continue with security. In many ways,. the attitude of the Court government, with its decision to introduce its own legislation rather than participate in a national legislative solution to a difficult question, smacks of the way governments of the last century handled the question of Aboriginal sovereignty over the land: compulsory, wholesale extinguishment of and a land management regime which provides only the flimsiest protection for Aboriginal people. In Tasmania, the Native Title Bill could provide security of occupation for those Aboriginals who have been living, fishing, hunting and carrying out ceremonies around the islands and the foreshores of northern Tasmania. I am hopeful that one day other areas of importance to Aboriginal people in Tasmania-areas outside those upon which the Native Title Bill will impact-will also be handed over to the care of the Aboriginal community. In much the same way as the Court government, the Groom Liberal government will do all in its power to stop these very important advances from occurring. The Native Title Bill provides for a federal or state arbitrator, and in the case of Tasmania I think that the federal alternative would always provide preferable outcomes for the Aboriginal community. The involvement of the states in the Native Title Bill has been a source of contention on the other side of the House, but I believe that the bill has such a great national significance that it is incumbent upon the Commonwealth to accept primary responsibility for its carriage. One only has to read the history of our country to see how ineffectual the role of the states has been in the sensitive issue of recognising that Aboriginal people, no less than other Australians, are entitled to the basic rights of inheriting and holding land free of racial discrimination. Mr Deputy Speaker, we on this side of the House are always criticised if we raise the issue of just how ineffectual the states are when it comes to dealing with an issue which has a national perspective. People in this House readily don their state jumpers in order to placate the empty vessels that are generating the emotive responses in the electorate. The Mabo decision and the Native Title Bill are only the very beginning of a rising maturity within our very young nation. There is .a great deal of work and talking to do in an effort to resolve what occurred when the British first settled in Australia. The Keating government is determined to see that this native title, dialogue will continue. The government's approach is in sharp contrast with the coalition's stand on this issue. The editorial in today's Australian sums up the coalition's position: On Mabo, the federal Opposition has contrived a smart political fix-,-but adopted a policy without principle. It has papered over its deep Mabo divisions, for the moment, and distracted from its weak leadership. But it has done this at the expense of a bipartisan response to Mabo. It has further undermined the Liberal Party's credibility on questions of national identity and culture. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to conclude by quoting Lois O'Donoghue,the chairperson of ATSIC, in her response to the Mabo decision. She said that the decision: . . . meets the major interest, not only of our people, but of all Australians, and by doing so ensures that we start off together down the long path to genuine reconciliation.",81
143,Ms MOYLAN,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to express my opposition to the divisive and centralist piece of legislation that we have before us with the Native Title Bill. My opposition is shared by the majority of Pearce electors who have rung or written to my office in the last fortnight and, I must say, is also shared by a great majority of Western Australians. Equally, I place on record my support of the just and principled stand taken by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in the face of narrow-minded criticism. First and foremost, this is a bill that seeks to impose federal government intervention in a matter that the constitution has reserved for the states-the administration of land title. There is simply no justification to diminish the primary responsibility of the states and territories in land management, and the only proper course of action in an honest federal system is for this parliament to assist the states with complementary legislation. An honest federal government that believed it had a duty to assume control of land management would put a referendum on that particular matter of constitutionality to the Australian people and give them the right to determine constitutional change. In the debasement of the constitution practised by this Labor government, such a suggestion has become unthinkable. Rather, this government advances its centralist objectives in a piecemeal fashion that is not only cowardly and dishonest but also creates uncertainty through disputed authority. We have a government so lacking in confidence in the constitutionality of its own bill that it takes out a legislative insurance policy to ensure that if parts of the act are struck down the remainder will continue in force. Where this will leave the certainty of land title is a matter for speculation, like so many of the effects of this bill. Of course, when the issue of constitutional rights of the states is ever raised in debate this place we get the parrot response from the government benches and from sections of the media that the coalition wants to sacrifice human rights on the altar of states rights. This has become a dogma, and· I am reminded at this time of the words of Sir Robert Menzies nearly 40 years ago when he said that 'dogma is a comfortable thing; it saves thought'. A little dispassionate reflection would lead to the conclusion that there is no future for human rights, or in fact any other rights, by giving greater power to central governments. In the practical world of today, human rights are simply not safe when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) seeks to assert power over the responsibility of states as intended in the constitution. The Prime Minister makes it clear that his guiding principle is the unfettered exercise of executive power to reward and to punish. The human rights of all Australians will simply be less safe when such a government extends its domination of our daily lives. Opposition to centralism is fundamental to human rights. Proponents of strong government, as opposed to those of us who believe that the essence of democracy lies in the checks and balances, justify intervention on the grounds that it provides justice and certainty. This bill does neither. It is flawed from the outset, first by a preamble that in effect seeks to enact an interpretation of history. Some of the statements in the preamble are legitimate comments, but they do not belong in acts of parliament that must deal strictly in facts. Certainly in past generations Aboriginal Australians were unjustly treated, by violence and later through misguided paternalism. That is a crime that is not exclusive to any particular political party in this country. Neither their interests nor those of other Australians, however, will be enhanced by generalised statements that only create possibilities of legal disputes. It is a matter of argument, and not a question of undisputed fact, for the preamble to assert that the High Court has held that the common law of Australia recognises an entitlement to traditional lands as distinct in from rights of usage. The matter remains to be decided. It is this likelihood of a different interpretation of the High Court Mabo ruling that is the basis of the Land (Titles and Traditional Usage) Bill of the Western Australian government. This is an honest attempt to fulfil the responsibility of any fair-minded government to safeguard existing property rights without depriving another group of Australians of legal entitlements, and to institute equity and certainty in all future grants of land. To hurriedly overturn 200 years of legal precedent to right the wrongs of the past is flawed thinking. It is legislation that enables Aboriginal people to be compensated for the impairment of traditional land usage, with a 20 per cent solatium for loss involving any special spiritual connection. It ensures that disputes will be settled in courts governed by rules of evidence and not by tribunals with the strong possibility of unconscious bias and legal uncertainty. It is a considered response from the government of the state of Western Australia that contains 84 per cent of the vacant crown land in Australia, comprising in tum 33 per cent of the land surface in Western Australia. Again, there is doubt that the 37 per cent of the state covered by pastoral leases have fully extinguished native title, and thus may experience native title claims. The Prime Minister and other members of his government admit that my state is disproportionately affected by the Mabo ruling. Yet they and sections of the media vilify Richard Court for seeking a solution in the best interests of the people concerned. On the government benches, only the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has the intellectual integrity to tell our imperialist Prime Minister that he wears no clothes. For the offence of exercising independent judgment and standing up for his electors, he is apparently to be punished. This bill, of course, is designed to override proper legislative action by the parliament of Western Australia. In so doing, it will however substitute confusion, delay and ruinous legal expense for the predictability and relative simplicity that the Western Australian legislation foreshadows. We need only consider the position of the small business prospectors, who are responsible for the majority of the 6,000 annual applications for Western Australian mining leases. Under this bill, they face a gauntlet of notification, of assessors, tribunals and eventually courts, all involving expense and delay. Under the state legislation, any impairment of Aboriginal interests involved in the application will be negotiated by the state. This, to my mind, is justice; both for the miner and the Aboriginal communities who will not themselves gain advantage by legal delay. It also constitutes justice for the Australian community who will not suffer from the undoubted loss of mining investment that will be the inevitable result if this Commonwealth bill proceeds. Mining represents small as well as large companies. It sustains many small businesses that service mining ventures. It is developing as a source of employment in which Aboriginal Australians are sharing, and Aboriginal leaders in the Kalgoorlie area have told us firmly that their priority is jobs for their young people. The mining industry has contributed indirectly to improving the standard of living for all Australian families. We have all been very happy to share in the wealth that has been created in this country through our mining industries. I have not seen too many people knock that back. Revenue from the mining industry has contributed to the $1.2 billion that is budgeted annually specifically for Aboriginal people in this country. It is again a matter of relativity. If we do not have viable business and if we do not help and encourage our mining industry to continue to exist and be profitable then we do not have the money for social justice and for these programs that benefit all Australians regardless of colour. By allowing the reversion of mining leases to native title on the expiry of a lease, the government is unnecessarily hobbling the mining industry. This, firstly, ignores the possibility that advances in technology can enable the recovery of economic mineral deposits in leases thought to be exhausted. Secondly, there will be a possibility of legal action on the grounds that these may be detrimental to the residual property rights of Aboriginal communities. Of course, such claims may fail in law, but again we come back to the reality that they must be defended and may cause delay as well as expense. Native title rights can be protected without going to such extremes. There is possible injustice in this bill through the potential to convert pastoral leaseholdings into native title. This will allow the conversion of vast tracts of Western Australia and the Northern Territory from one form of land use open to all Australians, to another that cannot be sold. Such a development is neither in the interests of a viable pastoral industry, subject to commercial discipline and enforceable standards of land care, or for those Aboriginal communities that are successfully managing their own pastoral leases. The Premier of Western Australia has pointed out that the Yungngora community at Noonkanbah in the Kimberleys is operating a pastoral lease where it is not the traditional owner of the land. Any possibility of native title claim is as much to its detriment as to any other pastoralist. It is ironic that, whereas in 1980 members of the ALP were loud in their protests when Aboriginal people at Noonkanbah resisted mining exploration on their land, they now bring forward a biII that jeopardises the achievements of this Aboriginal community. The honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) asserted that people who own large tracts of land tend to be the richer and more prosperous. I fear very much that this misconception colours the attitude of this government towards the pastoral industry, and somewhat unfairly I might say. Pastoralists are nothing more than small business people whose large holdings renect the sparse capacity of semi-arid lands. It is manifestly unjust that they should remain exposed to native title claims that they must defend, no matter what the ultimate legal position. There is a fundamental injustice in the provision of the bill that allows for funding assistance to Aboriginal bodies for the preparation of native title claims, over and above the public money already channelled to this purpose through ATSIC and the Aboriginal Legal Service, while conferring no such complementary assistance to those in the private sector who may have to defend these claims. It is this kind of partiality that not only makes for inherently bad law, but also damages relations between Australians. The Minister Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) admits, as is too easily forgotten, that only a minority of Aboriginal Australians can benefit from native title. All Aboriginal people are the losers when there is a perceived lack of equity that goes beyond the very necessary special assistance that Aboriginal Australians deserve in improving their standards of health and opportunities. Division between black and white Australians is made worse through the degeneration of the Mabo debate into accusations of racism, without regard to principle and objectivity. It is an indication of the low point of debate in this place. This centralist legislation will do nothing to improve the quality of life of the most disadvantaged section of the Australian community. In contrast, the Leader of the Opposition upholds the principle of justice and certainty, of enabling elected state governments to fulfil their constitutional responsibilities. As I said, the government can legitimately change the constitution if it wants to take away states rights and that is, properly, by referendum. The furtherance of social justice will not be achiev-d by seeking to undo the past, by locking away land from development, by hampering wealth production and by openended expenditure. We have provided the people of Australia with a clear alternative and one that is based on equity and common sense.",84
144,Mr LAVARCH,Unknown,"Some 223 years ago on an island in the Torres Strait not far from the island of Mer, James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the British Crown. His act was the first step in the assertion of British sovereignty over the Australian continent to the exclusion of the rights and the laws of its Aboriginal inhabitants. Eighteen years later the first European settlement of these shores was established, in the main by people who were, in equal parts, prisoners of the laws of England and of the hostile environment of the strange land to which they were sent. From such beginnings a strong Australian democracy has emergedvital, innovative, grounded in the notion of a fair go for all its members. But the laws which we have inherited and framed and the society those laws regulate have developed with a fundamental error at its heart-that Australia was a settlers' land because it had been terra nullius, the land of no-one, before the peoples of Europe, and later from every continent, came to make the country their home. The homes and the fanns, the mines and the industries of the successive waves of immigrants to this country were often created at the expense of the land, the community life and spiritual values of the indigenous peoples found here. The result was the economic, social and cultural impoverishment of the indigenous Australians, leaving them with the status of the most disadvantaged group in our society. It is against this background that the decision of the High Court in Mabo No. 2 should be seen as a landmark in the development of Australian law. The High Court decided that the Meriam people were entitled, as against the whole of the world, to the possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of most of the land of the island of Mer in the Murray Islands of the Torres Strait. In reaching this conclusion, a majority of the court held that the common law of Australia recognises a fonn of native title. Such native title exists in accordance with the laws and customs of indigenous people, where those people have maintainea their connection with the land and where their title has not been extinguished by the acts of imperial, colonial, state, territory or Commonwealth governments. The court rejected the traditional doctrine that Australia was a land belonging to no-one. At the time of European settlement the implication was that absolute ownership of land vested on settlement in the Crown. Rather, the High Court accepted that native title rights survived settlement, though they were, of course, subject to the sovereignty of the Crown. The court indicated that it could not perpetuate a view of the common law which wa.s unjust, did not respect all Australians as equal, was out of step with international human rights and nonns and was inconsistent with historical reality. Significantly, the decision also recognises a new source of Australian law. In addition to the common law inherited from England and statute law made by Commonwealth, state and territory parliaments, the Mabo decision acknowledges the traditions and customs of indigenous Australians in relation to land as a source of legal rights and obligatio'ns. The Commonwealth government has welcomed this decision. It is a decision in the best tradition of the common law-a decision which draws on the broad principles of justice, human rights and contemporary values. Rather than being too adventurous, the Australian court has been amongst the last in the common law countries to recognis!! native title rights. It is a decision which is appropriate and does not, as Mr Justice Brennan said, fracture the skeleton of principles which give the body of our Australian law its shape and internal consistency. The High Court ruling does, however, pose a challenge for all governments-a challenge of taking the decision and native title rights and accommodating them within the Australian legal and social framework. It is a challenge which this government meets in the Native Title Bill. Let me first deal with the power of the parliament to enact this bill. It has been mooted by a number of people, including the previous speaker, the honourable member for Pearce (Ms Moylan), that the legislation will be challenged on constitutional grounds. The bill deals with a fonn of land title, which by definition can be held only by Aboriginal people or Torres Strait Islanders. As such, the bill is within the Commonwealth's power under paragraph 26 of section 51 of the constitution, which provides that this parliament is able to make laws with respect to the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will well recall that until 1967 this power included the words 'other than the Aboriginal race in any state'. In 1967 the Australian people, by an overwhelming majority, gave to this parliament the power to make laws for the indigenous people"" of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and other opposition speakers suggested that the constitution needs now to be amended by referendum to give this parliament the power to make a law of this kind. We had that referendum in 1967 and that power now exists. That power has been upheld by the High Court, particularly in the Tasmanian dams case where a majority of the court held that a law which protected areas which were of significance to the whole of humanity but which had a special and deeper significance to a particular race-the Aboriginal race-was within paragraph 26 of section 51. Even the minority in that case held that the power extended to laws which conferred rights and imposed duties on the members of the Aboriginal race or on other persons of other races in their dealings with members of the Aboriginal race. That is the very essence of this bill. It confers rights on and protects native title holders. It restricts and places conditions on the acts that others can take which will affect native title rights. It is a law within the power of this parliament, even on the most conservative view of that power. Where an acquisition of property is concerned, the provisions of the bill are an exercise of the parliament's power under paragraph (31) of section 55 of the constitution. It has also been suggested that this bill is too complicated. The bill deals with new and complex issues. It is essential that it do so in a thorough and sophisticated manner. There is no need to apologise for such a rigorous approach to an issue of this importance. However, the level of complexity has been very greatly exaggerated and misrepresented, especially when we compare this bill to most land and mining legislation throughout Australia. The concepts involved and the detail required make these laws notoriously difficult. The basic framework of this bill is, however, quite straightforward. The major purpose of the bill is to recognise and protect native title, which it does in clause 9. The bill then goes on to do three main tasks. Firstly, it validates past Commonwealth grants and actions and enables states and territories to validate their past grants and actions which may have been rendered invalid by the existence of native title in the operation of any law. Secondly, it establishes a future regime which protects native title but which allows state and territory land management systems to deal appropriately with that title. Finally, it puts in place processes whereby native title holders can seek to have their rights determined. I believe that the bill achieves each of these tasks. The validation of existing statutory titles and of past actions by government is predicated on the need to provide absolute certainty to private interests and lanCl. This does not indicate that the Commonwealth is of the view that past actions by the Commonwealth, state or territory governments are invalid. The Mabo decision held that the governments are able to affect and indeed extinguish native title by valid acts, but concerns have been expressed in relation to the validity of some past actsj in particular by industry, the states and territories, and the opposition. The government has examined these concerns and regards the invalidity of past acts as a legal possibility. Because of the possibility that some past acts which affect native title may have been rendered invalid, particularly by the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act, but also potentially by other laws, the Commonwealth has decided to include in its legislation for the validation of such past acts in order to remove any doubt whatsoever. The bill will enable the states and territories also to validate existing titles, and does not prevent the governments of the states and territories from attempting to do this on their own terms. However, if a state or territory wishes to have the complete certainty of being complementary with the Commonwealth legislation, then they have to accept the scheme and the national standards set out in this legislation. But it is important to note that, in terms of validation, if a state wishes to chance its arm, it can do so, and nothing in this act whatsoever impinges upon or stops a state or territory government attempting to take that action. The Commonwealth has sought to achieve validation in a way which is nondiscriminatory against native title holders. Indeed, it gives special rights to native title holders affected. If the validation exercise results in the extinguishment of native title in a limited number of cases, then native title holders so affected are entitled to compensation on just terms. Where the grants could not have been made over freehold land, then the native title holders will also be entitled to just terms compensation. In the cases where there is the impairment of native title by validated grant, native title will be able to be compensated, and this compensation may be in a nonmonetary form. As well as validating past acts, the bill looks to the future. In relation to new legislation, the future regime commences from 1 July 1993. In relation to the validations of titles and grants issued by government, the future begins on 1 January 1994. Obviously, all governments have been on notice since the handing down of the Mabo decision in June 1992 that it was going to be necessary for there to be changes to some of our laws. Aboriginal representatives have very strongly argued that the cut-off date for the past and the future should be the date on which the decision was handed down, but the government has balanced that legitimate argument with the practicalities of the times necessary for governments to change and examine their regimes, and those are the dates which have been decided upon. For the future, both clauses 21 and 22 of the bill are pivotal. These clauses divide acts which will affect native title into two classes: permissible future acts and impermissible future acts. In a nutshell, a permissible future act is one which affects native title and could be done if the native title holders instead held generally, say, freehold title. If the act can done over freehold land, the bill allows it to be done over native title land and allows it to affect native title. In the case of legislation, laws which apply to native title holders in the same way as they apply to freeholders, or which have the effect on native title holders which places their title no worse off than freehold, are permissible. By clause 21, native title is generally protected from other future acts which are impermissible. The compulsory acquisition of native title is allowed, but payment of just terms compensation is required. Native title holders can also agree to surrender their rights or to authorise future acts which will affect their title. All other future permissible acts will not extinguish native title, but that title will be subject to that act. Native title holders will receive compensation where a freeholder would have received compensation, and they are entitled to the same procedural rights as freeholders. That is not to say that native title is the equivalent of freehold; it is not. Certainly in some rights, particularly exclusive possession, there may be very great differences between native title and freeholders' rights. Clauses 25 to 42 go on to provide that a special right to negotiate is created where there are registered native title claimants or holders, and it is proposed to issue a mining claim or interest over native title land. These are detailed provisions, but they are detailed in order to ensure that the process is clear and strictly delineated. The right to negotiate has been misrepresented by some as a veto. It is not. Realistic time frames are set for negotiations and, if they are not successful, for determination. It is unfortunate that those who wanted detail and precision in this process are the first to criticise it when it is provided. It is interesting to recall that amongst those most demanding of the comprehensive approach was the Leader of the Opposition who, on 28 June, called for an urgent, coordinated and decisive response from the government. Of course, this bill provides those very things, be but by this stage the Leader of the Opposition has changed his mind. The Commonwealth is of the view that the whole of the bill complies with Australia's international obligations, in particular the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination. The bill is essentially non-discriminatory. In so far as it grants special rights to native title holders, bill may discriminate in favour of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders. These additional rights, and also the land acquisition fund and other initiatives, will be a special measure for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people pursuant to section 8 of the Racial Discrimination Act. The bill provides an effective mechanism for dealing with native title claims. The Commonwealth system consists of two elements: a national native title tribunal and the Federal Court. Essentially, the tribunal's role will be to deal with those cases which are uncontested or which can be handled by way of negotiation and mediation. Where this is not possible, the matter will be heard by the full Federal Court. The court will have some modified rules of evidence and be a bit more flexible in its procedures in handling these claims. That is not to say that the due process will not be complied with or somehow we are walking away and there will not be a full, proper and just determination of the matter. It is not uncommon that in appropriate cases the rules of evidence are relaxed to achieve justice. That is what the rules of evidence are aboutto make sure that proper matters are before a court in order to achieve a just outcome. They are not some great thing set in stone in order to deny justice; they are there to achieve justice. That is why, on numerous occasions in a variety of tribunals and processes, the rules of evidence are relaxed. This is no different from all those other examples. With respect to land use decisions, the government recognises the primary role of state and territory governments, thus the bill provides that, where there is a recognised state or territory body process, that system alone will determine whether grants can be made over native title land. Then these determinations can be overturned in the state or territory interest by a state or territory minister. So again the furphy that we are impinging into land management systems or taking away the fundamental constitutional rights of the states and attempting to hijack land management is simply totally unfounded. If honourable members look through the the act, look at the scheme-they should divorce themselves from the rhetoric of Richard Court and his ilk-and look objectively at the realities, they will see that nothing of the kind is provided. The bill provides for national standards and national accreditation, if you like, of processes. We make no apologies for that. We want this to be a national outcome. There will be a similar result from whatever part of the country one goes to. If we are concerned about certainty and economic development, could honourable members think of anything more destructive of both those elements than having different outcomes approaching in each different state jurisdiction? That is the prescription which the opposition promotes for us. Yet, interestingly enough, Premier Jeff Kennett, a Liberal premier in this country, recognises that this issue is important enough that it should be beyond party politics, that we need a national outcome, and that it is not desirable for there to be a variety of outcomes, depending on the inclination of a at all particular state government. So the states maintain control over the land management system, they have their own processes in place, and they merely have to meet a national standard. I do not see how that is a great attack upon the rights of the states to manage the land which is their responsibility. All in all, this bill seeks to carefully balance a wide range of interests within the Australian community. This is clearly a difficult task, which has required a detailed bill. The bill seeks to balance justice for Aboriginal and Islander peoples with certainty for the holders of interests in land and for resource developers; it seeks to balance the state and territory responsibility for the land management with the Commonwealth responsibility for indigenous people; it seeks to meet international human right norms in a way which is appropriate for our domestic situation. Most importantly, it responds to the challenge of the High Court's decision by establishing a cooperative and workable legal regime. I commend the bill to the House.",86
145,Mr COBB,Unknown,"I set my comments today against the background of one who has several thousand Aborigines in his electorate; as one who despairs at their appalling lifestyles and living conditions; as one who has taken a keen interest in Aboriginal education, particularly the welfare of Aboriginal women, who are all too often victims of alcohol related assault; and as one who has tried hard to promote artistic abilities of Aborigines. In fact, only this week I brought down the last of three carloads of paintings to an exhibition put on by the Australian Heritage Commission. I find it despicable that the government calls those who oppose this bill racists. On 3 June 1992, in an unprecedented act of judicial activism, the High Court, in a six to one decision, with Justice Dawson dissenting, overturned 205 years of settled land law in declaring that native title has always existed in this country. That caused some shock waves around Australia. Many people felt that it was the parliament's job to create laws and it was the courts' job to interpret them. That is surely why we have elections for politicians but appointments for judges. In an extraordinary display of adventurism, the High Court virtually usurped the role of parliament, moved into the political arena and set a precedent in law that will have ramifications lasting for years to come. The crux of the judgment reads: The Meriam people are entitled as against the whole of the world to possession, occupation, and enjoyment of the lands of the Murray Islands. That is in itself an unremarkable statement which I think everybody would wholeheartedly agree with. But the High Court's decision, which should have applied specifically to the island of Mer, all 386 hectares of it, was then extrapolated to the mainland without any case before the High Court for doing this and without it hearing any argument for or against the entirely different situation which exists on the mainland. This is unprecedented legal behaviour in the centuries old history of British law. Since 1788 all land in this country has been administered by states and is available to everyone. Since the 1970s we have had land rights legislation which is available to Aborigines only, and that has been available to all Aborigines. But from 1993 apparently we are going to have native title land which will be available to only a small percentage of Aborigines, probably five per cent. This native title decision was made in a case put before the High Court in the Murray Islands, where there are three little islandsMer, Dauar and Waier-way up in the northeast comer of the Torres Strait islands not far from Papua New Guinea. They have been part of Queensland since 1879. There are only about 300 or 400 people who live on the island of Mer, and they are known as the Meriam people. They are Melanesians and they came there from Papua New Guinea, it is thought, at least several decades before they were discovered by white people. Their language is the Meriam-Mer language, which is classified as a member of the eastern transFly family of Papuan languages. They have a market garden system, not unlike What the Chinese operate in some areas of Australia. They had a developed system of land ownership with inheritance of land through family groups, and they had a settled, ordered society. Terra nullius clearly did not apply to them. But they are totally different from the nomadic and comparatively unstructured societies that existed on mainland Australia at the time. The case before the High Court had Eddie Mabo, as the first of three islanders, use who claimed that the Meriam people are entitled to the Murray Islands-first, as owners; second, as possessors; third as occupiers; and, fourth, as people entitled to the use and enjoyment of the islands-and that the . state of Queensland is not entitled to extinguish the title of the Meriam people, as it tried to do. Eddie Mabo, along with two other islanders, Father Dave Passi and James Rice, went forward as a test case against the state of Queensland. They were funded by Aboriginal legal aid as a test case. to overturn the concept of terra nullius. The case, of course, ended up in the High Court. I would like to say something about terra nullius. The government has put the proposition forward that terra nullius meant that Australia was not inhabited at all when Captain Cook et al sailed into this country. That is clearly ridiculous. Of course the mainland was inhabited. Terra nullius meant that there was no structured, organised society which the 'discoverers' of Australia could negotiate with. That is all terra nullius meant. Under the international law of the time where terra nullius applied, the discoverers of that land could set up their own structured society. It certainly did not mean that Australia was uninhabited. The Murray Islands were put before the High Court as a test case because it was thought that this was a perfect case to overturn terra nullius. There is no doubt that those islanders owned the island of Mer and the other two islands. In fact, had I been sitting on the High Court I would have probably given them the island under freehold title rather than native title. The High Court, when it declared that native title existed, said that Aborigines could claim native title where this title had not already been legitimately extinguished by the Crown-for example, the transfer of crown land to freehold land-and where indigenous peoples could prove an unbroken and continuous association with that same area of land on which they had practised their traditional cultural and hunting pursuits. These pursuits can be updated over a period of time. For example, if a person moved across a passage of land and speared a kangaroo 100 years ago, presumably he could move across the same passage of land now and shoot a kangaroo. I think that is a reasonable interpretation. So there we have the criteria: unbroken contact with the land in question and the pursuit of traditional practices on that land. But this leads me to make some comments about how inappropriate I believe it is that the native title decision is popularly called the Mabo case. By my reading of the evidence that Eddie Mabo gave, while Dave Passi and James Rice may properly qualify for native title under the High Court's criteria, Eddie Mabo certainly does not. I believe it should be called the native title decision, as the bill implies, the Passi decision or the Rice decision, but certainly not the Mabo decision. I would like to explain why, because it highlights vividly some of the concerns people now have about how the High Court operated and handled this case. I wonder how many Australians would know that the High Court deputised a judge, as is common practice in these matters, to do the hack work, if you like, to take all the evidence from the plaintiffs and other witnesses. It appointed a Queensland Supreme Court justice, Justice Moynihan, a very highly respected judge, to hear the case and take the evidence. He did this very thoroughly. He took evidence over 66 days, as well as making inspections of the islands and preparing materials. He examined 44 witnesses and 3,464 pages of evidence were taken down. A 500-page report was produced. It came up with some startling and remarkable findings. I think it is regrettable that very few people know how very few of his findings were allowed to appear in the High Court judgments, because he was the only judge to hear and take evidence from the plaintiffs and other witnesses. Let us look briefly at Eddie Mabo's evidence and bear in mind, as Justice Moynihan said, that in his evidence Eddie Mabo obviously wanted to establish that he had a continuous association with the land on Mer via inheritance and that he followed Mer's traditiomil cultural practices. Eddie Mabo was a crucial witness in the plaintiffs' case. As Justice Moynihan said: He gave evidence on almost every aspect of the case and was examined, cross-examined and reexamined over 19 of the 66 days of sitting. The first· thing that raised my eyebrows was that Eddie Mabo was not Eddie Mabo; he was actually Eddie Sambo. He was born on 26 June 1936, the son of Robert and Poipe Sambo. He then claimed he was adopted by Benny and Maiga Mabo. The evidence put before the findings was that he was not adopted by the Mabos. He then claimed he was the eldest son, so that he could establish inheritance of the land and prove his case for native title. But even if he had been adopted, he was not the eldest son. In fact, even on his biological side, he was the sixth in line of the Sambos. His evidence also did not stand up regarding his continuous association with the island of Mer. His biological father, Robert Sambo, remarried and moved to Thursday Island in the 1940s and Eddie Mabo went there to live with him. Eddie Mabo said that he had gone to Thursday Island because his so-called adoptive father, Benny Mabo, was in gaol there, but there is no record that Benny Mabo was ever in gaol. In fact, the social history card shows that Eddie Mabo went to live with his biological father and his new wife from the date of their marriage. He was claimed as a dependant by his biological father in his tax return for the 1947-48 year. In a letter Eddie Mabo wrote in 1966 to his biological father, he started the letter with the words, 'Dear Dad', although, to quote Justice Moynihan, 'he initially denied ever doing so'. Eddie Mabo also acknowledged that. his biological father always claimed him, Eddie, as his son right until his death. In 1980 Eddie Mabo claimed a Commonwealth army pension as the son of his biological father, even though, had he been adopted by Benny Mabo, he would have been entitled to claim a pension as his son as well. It is interesting to quote Justice Moynihan. He said: I have the distinct impression that Eddie Mabo was less than frank about his relations with his father from whom it now suits him to distance himself. He continued: In the circumstances I am not prepared to conclude that Robert Sambo relinquished his son Eddie to Benny and Maiga Mabo for the purpose of adoption to be their or Benny's heir or that Eddie Mabo was adopted with the consequence that he became heir to Benny or Maiga Mabo. In 1952 Eddie Mabo moved to Yorke Island and there he undertook some studies and various forms of work. From 1958 he was a resident of Townsville. When it was put to him during the inquiries that he did not live on the island of Mer he claimed that he had visited the island a number of times. Evidence was taken and this could not be substantiated. He then said he would have liked to have visited the island, but he could not do so because the Queensland government was stopping him. But as Justice Moynihan said: . . . there is no evidence to sustain a view that the Queensland Government intervened either directly or indirectly to prevent Eddie Mabo visiting Murray. I again quote Justice Moynihan: In 1956 a decision of the island councilthat is, on the island of Merordered him off the island for some sort of antisocial conduct, apparently associated with drinking. Again, Eddie Mabo's evidence did not stand up. In fact, there is evidence that the island council or its chairman refused him permission to visit the island on occasion. Justice Moynihan said: There are indications that at various times the island's elected council or its chairman may not have wanted him there. Eddie Mabo went on to make various other claims. He said that he observed faithfully the Meriam customs. Again, the evidence did not stand up so well. As Justice Moynihan said: The plaintiff Eddie Mabo had read Idriess' book ""The Drums of Mer"" and was no doubt familiar with Haddon. I am inclined to think his account. .. owes more to those works than they do to any oral history. Ion Idriess, of course, was a popular adventure fiction writer at the time who wrote the book The Drums of Mer. A number of copies natural of his book were seen floating around the island. Eddie Mabo also claimed that he was 'a descendant of the traditional leaders', although this was later dropped because that, too, could not be substantiated. Justice Moynihan said: The claims may owe their inspiration to the writing of Ion Idriess . . . and other sources altered and embraced from the point of view of advancing Eddie Mabo's cause. The claims are largely without foundation and Eddie Mabo must have known it. He also said: The evidence tendered inexorably to a conclusion that Aietthe traditional leaderwas a personal name used by the Passi and Modee families of Murray Islanders. That evidence does not support the view that Murray Island had traditional leaders of the kind to which Eddie Mabo claimed to be the heir or who played the roles in which he cast himself. The claims had a slight basis in fact but they reflect a distortion and embroidering of fact to advance There we are. His evidence did not stand up in any shape or form. I am appalled to read the High Court's decision and find out that that was just brushed aside as if it meant nothing. It was almost as if the High Court judges had their minds already made up. Turning specifically to the bill, the first thing that strikes me about it is that it is extraordinarily complex despite the comments of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). It was drawn up and decided without any proper consultation at all with the Australian people and certainly with very little or no consultation with the Aboriginal people. I cannot find an Aboriginal person in my electorate-and I have several thousand of them-who has been consulted on this bill. In fact, I cannot even find an Aboriginal in my electorate who agrees with the bill. They think it is a nonsense. I think that all the bill will do is ensure that the courts will be jammed with legal cases for years to come. The ultimate test of the bill is whether it will benefit the Aboriginal people. I see no evidence that it will. The Aboriginal consultative committee and the government legal advisers who addressed us the other day agree that only five per cent at best of mainland Aborigines will benefit by native title. That means that 95 per cent will miss out. In a sense, that makes the bill discriminatory. That is why the government is talking about bringing in an extra social justice package further down the track for urban Aborigines and a land acquisition bank, which is mentioned in the bill, to buy land for Aborigines. If this legislation is going to be meaningful, rather than just tokenism, it has to be done on a massive scale. Goodness knows what that will cost. What alarms me particularly is that efforts will be made to convert this purchased land to native title where various criteria can apply. That will simply mean that tIe Aborigines who move onto that land will not be able to borrow at a bank because the land cannot be sold up. Therefore, it will be useless in that sense and these people, if they ever want extra money to develop the property, will be forced to become dependent on the the plaintiffs' case. government. The compensation for the extinguishment of native title-which has applied under the Racial Discrimination Act since 1975-will be massive. Only the other night on television the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that it would cost 'at least several hundred million dollars'. That is no doubt code language for several thousand million dollars. I do not know how the country can afford this. The results so far of Aboriginal policy in the country are appalling. Many Aborigines in my electorate live in squalor. Already, apart from the pensions and welfare that are available to them like any other Australian, there is $1,300 million appropriated in the budget specifically for them- I do not know where that money goes. If we selected the poorest 50,000 Aboriginal families in this country and gave them $25,000 a year every year for the rest of their lives, it would still cost the taxpayers less and I believe the Aboriginal families in question would be better off. Aboriginals get land rights now. Already they have 48 per cent of the Northern Territory. In New South Wales a certain percentage of land tax is put aside for them and that runs into many millions of dollars. The states have programs specifically for them in the areas of housing, and that is to be applauded. They also receive mining royalties. The Ranger mine in Kakadu in the Northern Territory has so far handed over $288 million for that purpose. This bill will not benefit Aborigines at all. It will set them back and, in the words of Pat O'Shane, it should be junked. (TIme expired)",91
146,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown," lam very pleased to be speaking on the Native Title Bill because of its historic importance. The starting point is the fact that a great injustice has occurred with respect to the Aboriginal people. But the injustice is not merely a physical injustice; it is not merely an injustice in terms of the standards of living, the poverty and the deprivation. There has also been an injustice in the sense of the destruction of the culture and spirituality of the Abor.iginal people. This is the issue which must be addressed. Without land rights, the Aboriginal people cannot restore the metaphysical structure of their spirituality and cannot, therefore, restore their culture. The rich cultural heritage of the Aboriginal people has only recently been really appreciated. In earlier times-even 20 years agothere was the propensity to think of Aboriginal culture as some kind of mumbo jumbo; as not having a status of its own; as not having any substance. Nothing could be further from the truth. On the contrary, there is no doubt that in the Aboriginal culture there is a world view which, in a sense, constitutes a real challenge to the world view of the West. It is a world view, a metaphysical system and a spiritual system which has its own validity and from which we can learn a great deal. The most fundamental point about this world view is that it is tied up both in physical terms and in spiritual terms to the land. That is why the issue of land rights is fundamental. An Aboriginal Uniting Church minister is quoted in the book A Certain Heritage as saying: The land my mother. Like a human mother, the land gives us protection, enjoyment, and provides for our needs-economic, social and religious. We have a human relationship with the land: motherdaughter, son. When the land is taken from us or destroyed, we feel hurt because we belong to the land and we are part of it. The land is described by an Aboriginal teacher from Arnhem Land: The land makes everybody one. It determines relationships between the clans in their social as well as in their spiritual life. There is no doubt about the importance of the land to Aboriginal life. It is repeated over and over in statements from Aboriginal people, whether they are very articulate in English or not. Let me read another quotation from Riley Young in the book Dingo Makes us Human, where he says: ... We been boming [in] this country. We been grow up [in] this country. We been walkabout this country. We know all this country all over . . . B1ackfellow been born top of that ground, and blackfellow-blackfellow blood [in the ground] ... This ground is mother. This ground, she's my mother. She's mother for everybody. We born top of this ground. This [is] our mother. That's why we worry about this ground. The Aboriginal concept of the Dreamtime-a fundamental metaphysical concept and a fundamental philosophical concept-cannot exist without the concept of land and land rights. For people to argue that it is simply an incidental matter for the Aboriginal people to have land rights, and for the injustices of the past in relation to land to be redressed, is quite mistaken. In my view it is a very narrow and mono-cultural view of our Australian society. Unless we redress this issue, which the Mabo legislation gives us the opportunity to do, we will not redress the fundamental injustice we have done not merely to the Aboriginal people as physical human beings, but to their culture. This is the point which the High Court recognised. It recognised that the Aboriginal people have a special attachment to the land, and although Western minds might have difficulty in interpreting and understanding that linkage, nevertheless, the High Court judges understood that it is of such overwhelming importance in the survival of Aboriginal culture that it had to be addressed. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) tried to throw cold water on the credentials of Mr Mabo. This is beside the point. Even if everything he said is true-and I do not believe that it is-it is beside the point, because the issue is much bigger and broader than that. It is the issue of addressing this historical injustice. If we do not address this historical injustice, we will be saying to life Aboriginal people, 'Never will you have the opportunity of regaining your culture which has been lost to many of you, or sustaining the culture which remains in these remnants of the Aboriginal society that still have that culture'. How can we, as a nation, accept that proposition without shame? We cannot. We must give the Aboriginal people the opportunity to restore their dignity and cultural strength. That also means restoring their spirituality and sense of identity-which many of them have lost because we have destroyed it. A lot has been written about the concept of the.Dreamtime. The fundamental issue is that it is quite different from Western religion. The earth, time and space are seen as a totality. That is a concept· which Western minds find a bit difficult to grasp but is, nevertheless, very important. The concept of the one totality is that on one level there is the physical presence of human beings and, on another level, the presence-through the Dreamtime-of everything that ever existed and will exist in the future. That kind of concept is hard for the Western mind to grasp, but that does not make it irrelevant or unreal. On the contrary, it is important when we are considering our philosophy as distinct from the philosophies of other peoples and other cultures. In that sense, the concept of the Dreamtime has to be taken into account whenever we are considering Aboriginal culture, It is the central concept which has bound that culture together in its basic philosophical thrust. We might ask what that has to do with land rights. The fact is that, in every anthropological account of the Dreamtime, there is a concrete reference to the land of the particular group of people. This is an interesting point because, although the concept of the Dreamtime is a generalised concept of the universe, it gains form, substance and reality only when it is related to the particular places of Aboriginal people. This point is made over and over by the Aboriginal people. It is why they object to the destruction of important sacred sites and things which to us may be unimportant, such as particular trees, rocks and pieces of the earth. To a Western person they may appear to be unimportant, but they may have enormous symbolic significance to the Aboriginal people because of the linkage with their philosophy and culture. Riley Young, in talking about the destruction of the land, is quoted in his book as saying: You know why? I'm sick of it. Too much! If I get out of the place, what's going to happen? What's going to happen to the place? They gonna damage the place. They going to damage the ground. They going to damage some tree, or they gonna smash all the rocks. What, only rocks? It's the Dreaming! Dreaming been walk [here]. This is the point I was making earlier. The Dreamtime is concretely established and related to the land. He continued: The rock might be standing up. What been happen, just standing up. Grader might push that lot. What been happen [is] standing up there. That [rock is] somebody, been stand up. That kind, we know. We been look. Everybody been tell you this Law. That kind. This one. This one. That Law is that thing come up. Because we know. Why don't you government think? The law referred to is the fundamental-the one-law that unites Aboriginal philosophy and culture. This law is referred to over and again in all the anthropological studies, literature and collections. It is the law which binds everything to everything else. It is the interconnection of the totality of the universe. As can be seen from this quotation, that law is directly tied to the concept of land and land rights. There can be no doubt that for the Aboriginal people who see all sorts of destructions of the land and important sacred sites, who see certain radical changes to the ecosystem they have been used to, they do not see something beautiful. What they see as beautiful, what they care about and give attention to, are the points of reference which their ancestors-and their ancestors-had seen; and were important to them. That is the historical continuity. Without that continuity in the land and the objects of the land, Aboriginal culture begins to dissolve. Unless we have an understanding of this fundamental point, we will not have an understanding of why it is of such fundamental importance that land rights and native title are granted. This process is long overdue. It should have been addressed by this parliament and the Australian people many years ago. It is not too late. We still retain some wonderful examples of Aboriginal culture, art and music; and we still retain significant sections of the metaphysics and philosophy of the people. We have an obligation not merely to restore the land but also to provide sufficient social justice to the Aboriginal people to enable them to have a decent life and rebuild, where it has been destroyed and where they so desire, those segments of their culture. Unless we do so, we will not really be able to redress the wrongs of the last 200 years. The anthropologist who wrote the book Dingo Makes Us Human, Deborah Rose, says: Yarralin people tell stories through which they to encounter others: not to draw others into their own Law, but to exchange equitably. Founded the belief that Law is everywhere, people hope that their words will connect with those of others, others will recognise the key events and find own strong stories which, as they implement in their own lives and places, will answer back affirmation. Why don't we all listen? Why do we not all listen to the cries of the Aboriginal people and recognise the sufferings of the last 200 years? Why do we not all redress those? This bill is a magnificent achievement because it goes a long way towards redressing the fundamental issue. It is important not just in terms of the physical reality of the Aboriginal people, their physical existence and Iifeand not just lifestyle in physical terms-but also, as I have tried to illustrate in my speech here today, in a much more fundamental sense, it is important to their existence in terms of their identity, culture, metaphysical beliefs and philosophy. In this way they define themselves as a people and culture. We must proceed with this legislation and do more to bring back and restore-wherever possible and desired-those elements of Aboriginal culture that have been destroyed.",94

149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"It may be your right so to do, but if it continues I will take action, which is my right.  Native Title Bill is one of the most significant pieces of legislation ever to come before the parliament. At the same time, it is also one of the most administratively complex, complihope cated and potentially costly pieces of legislation that we have ever seen. There is no doubt in that the High Court's Mabo decision is a that watershed in telins of both the history and the their future of our country. The High Court's dethem cision acknowledges that where Aborigines in have continually occupied land or can demon. strate a link to that land such people have a right to the land or to compensation where it has been extinguished. The coalition does not back away from the High Court's decision. We accept the existence of native title as proposed by the High Court and believe that indigenous people, as Australian citizens, have equal rights and are entitled to the protection and enjoyment of those rights. However, we are also concerned that Europeans who have settled in Australia have an entitlement to property which they purchased in good faith. Home owners and farmers, for example, are entitled to certainty that the fruits of their labour will remain in their own hands or in those of their family. It is largely because of these two factors that the High Court's decision provides the potential for division and discrimination. The challenge for government, therefore, is to find a solution which addresses the claims of Aborigines while providing security and certainty for all other Australians. At the same time, the government must provide certainty to industry, especially to the mining industry and farmers. The government's bill has failed to meet this challenge. Unfortunately, it does nothing to alleviate the potential threat to divide our nation or to provide certainty to the community or industry. But there are other problems as well. As I mentioned earlier, the bill is very complex. It runs to well over tOO pages and nearly 240 clauses. Even the explanatory ' memorandum has been divided into two parts. As John Prescott of BHP said, 'examining the proposed bill is like reading porridge'. He went on to say that the bill 'is far too complex, far too difficult to understand and fraught with the danger of leading us into additional uncertainty and unnecessary conflict'. By its very complexity, the bill is a bonanza for the lawyers and will do nothing to allay the fears of the ordinary home owner. Indeed, if major businesses need teams of lawyers to decipher what it all means, what hope has the average Australian got? The bill also proposes to create yet another unwieldy bureaucratic system. Bureaucracy, by its very nature, creates uncertainty and discourages investment. While it may create jobs at the taxpayer's expense, the bill will nothing to create new jobs in the private sector. The bill fails to remedy the uncertainty that has arisen about land titles. All valid leases of pastoral land made prior to 1975 may still be subject to native title claims. Moreover, claims for native title can be made in respect of land which is currently being mined or for which new mining projects are planned. It rides roughshod over the states by retrospectively seeking state responsibility over native title and seeking to manage state land systems. Indeed, this bill is yet another example of the desire of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to grab even more power from the states. There is no doubt that this particuto lar element of the bill will be questioned. Its constitutional validity will be the subject of a community. High Court challenge by at least one state Premier. Of course, this will only exacerbate the uncertainty already generated by other elements of the government's proposed Mabo legislation. The government, in developing its native title legislation, has gone way beyond the High Court's ruling by attempting to blend native title rights with reconciliation issues. The coalition is firmly supportive of the need to resolve a range of concerns with the Aboriginal population, but we do not see the native title issue as the best and most effective means of doing this. Indeed, we believe that reconciliation should be a separate matter, achieved by working closely with the Aboriginal community and its leaders. We are committed to eliminating the disadvantages facing the Aboriginal community, including the areas of health, education and housing. But we will do it by strengthening the national resolve and by bringing the nation together. We will not adopt a divide and conquer mentality. The government also proposes to set up a land acquisition fund. In doing this it is effectively writing a blank cheque. It is mortgaging the future of this country. Finally, this bill does nothing to ensure certainty. In fact, it is simply a recipe for further court challenges against mining companies and pastoralists in defending their land do titles against claim. Even if businesses do not get to the legal stage, they still have to negotiate their way through a maze of tribunals, panels and other government bureaucracies. Accordingly, the coalition will oppose the government's bill. Our decision to oppose the bill is not one that we have taken lightly. We do it after many hours of consultation with the Aboriginal community, visiting those communities, and in discussions with the business sector. Given the importance of the issue, it would be negligent of the coalition if it did not P!lt before the people of Australia. its own plans to deal with the High Court's decision. Unlike the government, we have accepted the challenge put forward by Mabo recognise native title, to give certainty to home owners and investors, and to unite the Our solution embodies the following principles. Any workable resolution of Mabo must validate past grants of land titles and prevent the invalidation of existing land titles where, at the time of the grant, the land in question was affected by the existence of native title. The most effective way of doing this is to allow the states to legislate to achieve these goals. Indeed, it is the coalition's view that the states should be free to develop their own individual responses to the challenge posed by Mabo. However, this must occur within broad parameters set by the Commonwealth. Such parametets would include a requirement to comply with the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act and the payment of compensation. A coalition government would offer an unequivocal commitment not to water down any of the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. The coalition would also enable the states to confirm Crown ownership of all minerals and petroleum and existing rights to places of public access, including parks, beaches and reserves. We also believe that the states should retain their land management rights and have responsibility for native title. This would maintain the status quo, avoiding the constitutional problems and uncertainty posed by the government's solution. Compensation would be payable on a just terms basis and provision made for liability. Disputes about the amount of compensation should be settled by a court of law. Government, rather than land-holders, would be liable for compensation payment. The Commonwealth would accept liability for any compensation paid for the extinguishment of native title associated with the validation of past grants. The coalition's solution has already proved workable. My colleague the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, has already presented his solution to the people of my state. In ou-lining his legislation to the Western Australian parliament, Premier Court advised that the bill had four basic objectives, all of which fit into the broad parameters outlined by the federal coalition in its approach. My colleagues the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the shadow special minister of state, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), gave their support to Western Australia's approach in this place yesterday. Support was given to the introduction of similar legislation proposed by New South Wales and Victoria. The objectives of the Western Australian legislation include: to ensure that policy and administration of Western Australian land and natural resources management remains in control of the state; to provide for certainty of land title; to vide for timely and orderly project approvals; and to be part of a wider approach to improve Aborigines' standard of living. Briefly, the bill provides for the validation of all titles granted since 31 October 1975; the replacement of any native title in existence at the time of commencement of the legislation with a right of traditional usage; the grant of freehold title, leasehold title and mining leases, except to the extent that any "" right of traditional usage is preserved; the payment of compensation in relation to the extinguishment or impairment of coexistent native title or rights of traditional usage; the protection of public access to beaches, parks and other reserves. Western Australia's approach has been endorsed by a wide range of interested parties. In addition to the comments of my federal colleagues-which I mentioned earlier-the Executive Director of the Mining Industry Council, Mr Lauchlin MCIntosh, said that Mr Court's legislation reflected the High Court's decision. He went on to say: ... the legislation would give aborigines some form of statutory right despite extinguishing common law native title. There is no excuse for the government's legislation. It is generally agreed that it is unworkable and will do more harm than good. The tragedy of the government's position is that a better solution is available-a solution which of course recognises the existence of native title, accommodates both the states and territories and eliminates uncertainty in the business community. Most importantly, a solution is available which will encourage investment and the growth of business, creating jobs for all Australians. The coalition's proposals would achieve all of these ends while, at the same time, it would unite all Australians and encourage them to work together for the good of this country. Surely that is the real lesson of Mabo.",97
150,Mr JOHNS,Unknown,"I have great pleasure in supporting the Native Title Bill which, I might say, is the result of a great amount of work by the government, including the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other pro- ministers. Unlike the opposition, the government sees this bill as an opportunity-an opportunity to build better relations between all Australians. It is not an opportunity to divide the nation with half truths and populist comments, such as those made by the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), in his address to the nation last week. Resolving the question of native title following the High Court's decision was never going to be an easy task, nor a task that could be undertaken overnight. The government recognised the need for certainty of the and present titles. This certainty was not going to be delivered unless the time was taken to work through all of the issues. The government could have taken the easy path and moved to abolish native title, as the opposition would have us do. Not only would this have been unjust-it would have resulted in greater divisions in our community. This is an opportunity for reconciliation not division. Importantly, it is an opportunity which will not solve all the problems that Aboriginal people face, but it is an opportunity and an issue that should be placed above politics. Instead, and unfortunately, the of the Liberal Party has been unable to show leadership and bring those on the extreme of his party into line. What we have seen from the honourable member for Wentworth is an attempt to gain a stay of execution of his leadership. What he has put forward was not a solution at all to the Mabo issue. It was a short-term solution to the problems within his party. In that sense, and because of those reasons, the opposition has no standing on this issue. The opposition sought to take a path that panders to party research. The address by the Leader of the Opposition to the nation last week was his equivalent to the One Australia speech on immigration made by the honourable member for Bennelong e Mr Howard). It was an address that played on untruths and misconceptions, with lines such as 'rights over substantial parts of Australia', 'other Australians want to be sure that they do indeed own their own home or farm and that they won't have to go to court to defend them', 'a lot of big city lawyers will be rubbing their hands together', 'a lot of other Australians will be worse off', 'a recipe for uncertainty and division', 'many farmers and miners will end up in court', 'our kids' opportunities' and so on. They are lines no doubt carefully chosen on the basis of research, but essentially it was an address that played on people's fears. As I have said, the issue of Mabo has not been an easy one to address. I do not pretend that we on this side of the House have all had identical views on the issue. There has been a great deal of debate within the government on the Mabo judgment-debate that one would expect on an issue of such magnitude. But the result we have arrived at is very different from that of the opposition. The result is a bill that will secure existing titles while at the same time recognising the rights of Aboriginal people as enshrined in the High Court's decision. It appears that the opposiand tion supports the rule of law only when it rules the law. The advancement of Aboriginal people in this country has been an issue that governments and the people of Australia have been leader grappling with almost since the time of European settlement. The issues involved are not easily solved with quick-fix solutions. The problems are not the types that can be solved with money alone. Money does not solve issues of discrimination. Money does not solve attitudinal and cultural changes in the Australian community-both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. The issues are not ones that can be fully solved through the granting of land, either under this legislation or under various land rights legislation. The government recognises that the awarding of land either through native title or other means is a further step in allowing Aboriginal people to fully participate in the Australian community. I think that many white Australians are confronted with somewhat of a dilemma on I the question of assistance to Aboriginal people. I believe that many Australians still . believe in the concept of a fair go. It is accepted in this country that we help those who need our help. However, many Australians do not extend this notion of a fair go to Aboriginal people. They have a stereotype image of Aborigines as a group of people who do not necessarily want to help themselves. Many Australians would say, 'Why should we give them any more money? They already get too much as it is'. Some would argue that Aboriginal dependency on governments has increased. This perceived dependency has resulted in a great deal of concern in the Australian community. But it must be remembered that, as a community, we do not leave the unemployed behind, we do not leave the aged behind, we do not leave the sick behind. The dependency dilemma makes the question of assisting Aboriginal people all the more difficult, especially as there are strong political and financial limits on what governments can do. But it does not deny us the role that governments have in assisting Aborigines. There are some who will argue of course that we will need more money to solve these problems. We need to ask what the limits on further spending will be on Aboriginal affairs. If we cannot achieve what needs to be achieved with $2 billion a year for 250,000 people, my question is: is money the answer or are there other issues, such as cultural change, that need to be addressed? Money will assist in addressing some but not all of the issues. We also recognise that land is not the panacea to all the problems that Aboriginal people face and consequently the problems that we as a nation face. Land can solve only part of the problem. Aboriginal people have had access to land in some parts of Australia-such as in the Northern Territory under the Northern Territory land rights act and through the purchase of other tracks of land, in particular, cattle stations-for some considerable time. In many cases, land has enabled Aboriginal people to .regain their cultural identity and to maintain a traditional way of life. But, in many cases, it has not delivered the economic development that is required if Aboriginal people are to gain an equal place in Australia. There are some contradictions between achieving land ownership, especially in isolated areas, while at the same time seeking to achieve economic and social equality with the rest of Australia. There has been an assumption by some that the granting of land to Aboriginal people will solve their problems. To quote Jon Altman from the Australian National University: It is often assumed that land rights ipso facto in improved economic circumstances for Aboriginal people reduced financial dependency on the welfar- state, and greater opportunity for self determination and self management. While acknowledging that in a number of cases land has enabled Aboriginal people to gain increased financial independence, this has been limited largely to those communities that have been able to directly benefit from mining or tourism leases. It must also be acknowledged that it has not always been the success that it has been held out to be. People who live in isolated areas face considerable locational disadvantage. Locational disadvantage cannot necessarily be overcome by endless expenditure on services, such as health, housing, education and employment programs. I think it is a pipedream to believe that one day those Aboriginal people who are living in some of the most remote areas of our country will ever be able to achieve similar economic, educational or health status to Australians living in urban centres because it is only in urban centres that certain high level services can be delivered. If Aborigines seek to maintain their traditional way of life in remote locations, that will have significant consequences for their standard of living. Their lifestyle will remain a rural one that will require continued dependence on outside assistance. No matter how much money is spent on providing services to them-there is a financial and political limit to funds available-th-ir standard of living may never be equal to that achieved by urban dwelling Australians, either Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal. However, those who have lived their lives in a traditional manner could well lose their cultural identity if they were to leave their land and move to an urban environment. This is a dilemma that some Aboriginal people face. But ultimately it is only Aboriginal people themselves who are able to address this dilemma. It is a decision that can be taken. only by them. It is these issues and others that must be clearly considered in the formation anq operation of the land fund to be established under this bill. The stated purpose of the land fund is to provide a benefit to the majority of result Aboriginal people who will not directly benefit from the Mabo decision. As honourable members are aware, the vast majority of Aboriginal people do not live on the land; they live in urban areas. Just as other Australians have, they have voted with their feet and moved to cities and towns. For 70 years, Australia has been experiencing a drift away from rural areas towards urban centres, both by Aboriginal and nonAboriginal populations. People have been moving from rural areas for a wide variety of social and economic reasons. Long-term changes in farm practices and the present rural downturn have significantly decreased work opportunities in rural enterprises and in small town centres. Small rural towns have given way to the major rural centres as road and other transport links have improved. A land fund should not seek to go ahead of the overall trend in the Australian community and put in place an urban-rural drift, placing people on land without a clear economic purpose. If we are seeking a method or a system through which Aboriginal people are able to achieve equal economic status, any land purchases must have a clear economic purpose. Land in itself will not raise the living standards of Aboriginal people. Experience has shown that, unless there is a clear and direct economic purpose, land in itself does not raise the living standards of Aboriginal people and overcome the myriad health and social problems that they face. The land fund must directly confront the question of Aboriginal economic development. Economic development is the way in which the non-Aboriginal community has raised its standard of living, and it is through economic development that the Aboriginal community will raise its standard of living also. If Aboriginal people are going to significantly decrease their welfare dependence, they must secure an economic base. That is not to say that the government does not have a role to play. It does, just as it has a role in ing any other Australian who needs help. In the long term, it makes better economic and social sense to bring people out of poverty and to have them participate fully in the community. No modern society can allow a large section of the community to languish. Recently, a report entitled Rural development skills on Aboriginal land: can we meet the challenge? was undertaken by a consultant to DEET. The report highlighted the fact that land of itself does not guarantee economic development. The study was required to examine and report on the training needs of Aboriginal people involved in pastoral operations and other land based activities in the Northern Territory. The report revealed that full economic benefits of the pastoral operations have not been realised. It found one of the major impacts on the operation of the enterprise to be as follows: The lack of development of economic, management and technical skills within Aboriginal communities commensurate with the development in recent decades of Aboriginal expertise and leadership within political, educational, health and community government. The majority of the pastoral operations that were examined were not being run in a commercially sustainable manner and required ongoing government grants to continue. The report called this 'grantsmanship'. When one community leader was asked how his cattle enterprise might require funds for development he replied, 'We make a submission and we push him through'. The report concluded: That aboriginal know how has enabled the development of political and negotiating/manipulative skills as a significant modus operandi for survival within the non-aboriginal world (skill in gaining access to resources rather than skiJJs in generating them through European-style productive activities). Grants and other assistance can contribute only so much to raising the social and economic position of Aboriginal Australians. If Aboriginal people are to achieve economic and social parity with other Australians, it will involve the development of the skills that are not found in abundance in their communities. It also involves a recognition of and involvement in the mainstream of Australian society. While there are obviously some assistcommercial opportunities in providing services to Aboriginal people, it will be the mainstream of society that will be the purchasers of goods and services from the majority of Aboriginal enterprlses. Economic development will also involve a great deal of cultural shift in the Aboriginal community itself. A recent Four Corners program demonstrated what kind of cultural shift can be achieved. The program profiled two Aboriginal communities in the same area which had two very different outcomes. One was stuck in the dependency rut, with poor living conditions and little opportunity. The other, based on a group that had left the original community, had begun to move ahead and had established a number of productive enterprises. The enterprises had and were receiving government support, through either direct grants or the community employment development programs. But what was important is that they had made a decision and a commitment to break the dependency cycle and to seek to assist themselves through the formation of productive enterprises. Some people argue against such assistance to establish Aboriginal enterprises, saying, 'White people do not receive it so why should Aboriginal people receive it?'. But the government does give assistance to many enterprises through state government based small business advice bureaus, export assistance, and loans through various government bodies. In addition, we help the unemployed re-enter the work force through the new industries enterprise scheme that assists them to establish their own business, providing them with ongoing financial support and advice. It is also important to recognise that there needs to be a change in attitude amongst some members of the Aboriginal community. If any people in this country want to enjoy the benefits provided by a productive society, they need to recognise the legitimacy of that society. That does not mean a policy of assimilation but it does mean that people cannot continue to attack the legitimacy of the society and then have the expectation that it will hand over part of the wealth that it has created. Just as non-Aboriginal Australians have been asked to recognise the legitimacy of the Aboriginal culture, Aboriginal people need to recognise the legitimacy of the mainstream Australian' community. The talk, by a few, of a separate Aboriginal state in Australia is way off the mark. The High Court's decision on Mabo was very explicit. The decision had nothing to do with sovereignty. The government has made it very clear that it will have nothing to do with such a notion. I believe that such talk harms the Aboriginal cause just as much as it was harmed by the wild claims that were submitted in the capital city districts after the ing down of the Mabo decision. Such action only fuels SuspICIOn in the minds of the majority of Australians and enables the extreme views from the other side of the debate to gain some degree of legitimacy in the community. It also further tightens the political constraints that governments face in seeking to assist Aboriginal people. Aboriginal people pressing their claims cannot operate in a political vacuum. As does any other group in the community pressing its claim on government, they have to be aware of the broader political consequences of their statements and actions. Achieving support from government requires not only convincing the government that their position is right but also the government's believing that its actions will be supported by the community generally. In conclusion, I would like to make the point that as Australians we should not feel guilty about our past. We have reason to be very proud of our achievements as a nation. Certainly, there were events in the past that were deplorable. But we cannot be held responsible for the actions of our ancestors, either as individuals or as a nation. The Prime Minister has acknowledged and apologised for the faults of the past. He has also acknowledged .the prior ownership of Australia by Aborigines. The High Court's Mabo No. 2 decision has acknowledged this and this is to be put into effect by the bill. For at least 30 years now, Commonwealth governments have worked very hard to advance the interests of Aboriginal people. There are no government barriers to the achievement of equality in Australia and, as the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody concluded, Aboriginal people are culturally disoriented. We should continue to help them to help themselves so that a greater number of Aborigines can make a contribution to our nation. I believe this is what the majority of Aboriginal Australians want.",99
151,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"I was in the High Court on 3 June 1992. I was one of only two members of parliament who went down to listen to the High Court's decision. handI must say, as someone who does not have legal training, it was pretty hard to understand what the justices actually meant in their decision, although I was heartened by the fact that afterwards there were huddles of lawyers outside the court trying to work out exactly what it meant. I moved from group to group, and the general consensus on that day was that it was a great symbolic victory for Aboriginal people but probably one with little practical significance. The symbolism was that the High Court had finally recognised in a legal sense that Aboriginal people have rights that predate European settlement and that those rights do, on the Murray Islands and perhaps in other places, still exist today. So, in this sense, the High Court has made a decision and there is no turning back. However, we have got into trouble over the last 16 or 17 months in that we have not known how to handle the other side of it-the practical significance-and that is what we are debating here tonight. The opposition is opposing the Native Title Bill and we have come in for some criticism in recent times for not having adopted a bipartisan position. Certainly, the debate in the community has been difficult. It is opening up very real divisions in our society that my Aboriginal friends tell me are impacting on their day-today lives. In coming in for criticism for opposing this legislation-such as appeared in today's Australian newspaper-I have to say that I personally find it disappointing that we do not have a bipartisan view. It would have been good if we could have had such a view. However, I reject the notion that the opposition should take 100 per cent of the blame for this position. I am someone who can stand in this House and actually talk about bipartisanship in the area of Aboriginal affairs. After the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), I would suggest there is no-one who has done more in recent years to achieve that. Bipartisanship is not attempting to stitch up a deal so that the Australian Democrats and Greens come on board, while assuming what the coalition mayor may not do. Bipartisanship is not one side of the debate putting up something and saying, 'Take it or leave it'. Had there been even the vaguest desire for a genuinely bipartisan deal, an informal approach could have been made to anyone in the coalition. It certainly could have been made to me. Not once was I approached by anyone to be sounded out in even the vaguest terms as to where the coalition stood-what we could support and what we could not support. I contrast that with what happened in 1990 and 1991 with the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. The then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, wrote to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and asked if there was any possibility of having a more bipartisan approach on Aboriginal affairs. This was debated internally in the party-in the shadow ministry, in the party room-and the Leader of the Opposition wrote back to the Prime Minister. Some months later, a further letter came from the then Prime Minister asking about the possibility of the establishment of a Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. We debated it again in the coalition. We decided what we could live with. We decided what we had problems with. I personally travelled the country and visited every Liberal Party and National Party state and territory leader in Australia. I discussed our position with them. I asked for their views, I argued, I cajoled and I begged. I took a submission back to shadow cabinet. We discussed it again in the party room. All the time, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and I would talk, discuss our differences, see where there was common ground and see where there were problems. I drank his whisky; he drank my red wine. Some time later, draft legislation came out. The coalition was given an advance copy. It never leaked: it remained confidential. We had numerous areas of difficulty. The legislation underwent substantial revision before it came into the parliament. I took the proposal again to every Liberal Party and National Party leader in Australia. I tramped the country for a second time. We had some more concerns. They were addressed. When the final legislation came into the House we still had some minor concerns. Some of these were picked up in the debate. We did not get everything we wanted; the government did not have everything it wanted. But after nine months of hard work, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and I stood in this House and shook hands over the table because we had achieved and worked for common ground-nine months of hard work that involved trust, openness and honesty. That contrasts pretty starkly with what has happened in the last 16 or 17 months. The Mabo decision goes to the heart of our relationship with the Aboriginal people. It an emotional issue and there are very strong emotions on all sides of the debate. It is worth putting the debate in the context of the original decision. I have been lucky enough to go to Murray Island twice. Both times I have been there I have beenwarmly and hospitably received. I have met two out of the three original plaintiffs, Mr Rice and Father Passi. I have seen their land. Father Passi has a couple of hectares of land. He is the senior custodian for his tribal group. There are a dozen or so houses on it. The people grow vegetables. The boundary is clearly marked out between trees. It goes up a hiIl, with a dogleg to left. Some of the boundaries between land are marked out in seashells. If they have the minor dispute with a neighbour as to the placement of a boundary, such as we would with a fence between two neighbours, there is a dispute settling mechanism. The elders get together and they adjudicate whether the boundary is a metre this way or a metre that way. As my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) said after having visited Murray Island With me, 'It's perfectly obvious that they have owned that land forever'. What the debate today is about is how and in what form that ownership of Murray Island translates to mainland Australia. I have been fortunate to visit many other places in Aboriginal Australia, including the central desert of Western Australia around Warburton, Wingelinna, Blackstone, and the Docker River in the Northern Territory. It is some of the most inhospitable country in Australia and miles from anywhere-at least 12 hours from Alice Springs. I have visited some of the Aboriginal people's sacred places there and I have been hunting with them. My experience in the central desert was similar to that of the honourable member for Barker on Murray Island. Seeing this inhospitable country and the people, and understanding their relationship with the land, it is hard to say that they have not owned it for ever. This legislation proper has been debated at length and I will not go over all of it. Rather, is I want to give a more personal view on two areas of concern. Firstly, I have real doubts as to whether this legislation is valid, and I have fears that in three years time, if it is knocked out by the High Court, we will go through this whole process again. It is agreed on all sides that it is absolutely essential that titles are validated in Australia. It is in the interests of everybody, including Aboriginal people, that there be some form of secure title. It is also in everybody's interests that we do not have something that is a field day for lawyers. To validate land title, the government relies on section 8 of the Racial Discrimination Act. This law is completely untestthe ed. Section 8 flows from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and most has to be read in conjunction with article 1, paragraph 4 of that covenant, which states: A special measure has to be for the sole purpose of the advancement of the group involved. Clearly, this legislation addresses various separate policy objectives. The government has wrapped the whole thing up and said, 'Just call the whole lot a special measure'. That is not the view of a lot of Aboriginal people who would be happier with a special measure that excludes validation. This legislation will be tested in the courts and it may very well fall on this point alone. My second concern is the manner in which this deal has been done with the Aboriginal negotiating team. The government spent over a year negotiating and consulting with Aboriginal people. I ask: what actually was done? When I travel out into Aboriginal communities-which I did all the time until March as shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, and which I have done with the Leader of the Opposition since March-and whenever we speak with Aboriginal people on Mabo we are asked what it means. The desire for information is enonnous; the knowledge minimal. There have been two key meetings of Aboriginal organisations: one at Eva Valley in the Northern Territory, the other here in Canberra. They made it quite clear that there would be no negotiation with the government. So what we have here is a negotiated deal between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and some Aboriginal people, painted as a negotiated position with Aboriginal Australia. I have the highest regard for the integrity the chairperson of ATSIC, Lois O'Donoghue, who was part of that negotiating team. As chair of ATSIC, she is a representative; but the others in the team actually represent very few Aboriginal people, and there is considerable disquiet in much of the Aboriginal community that this is actually being represented as a deal with Aboriginal Australia. It is nothing of the sort. I do not suggest that it is easy and I do not suggest that the Eva Valley meeting would have been happier with the coalition; but we should not pretend this is something it is not. We should admit the shortcomings of our political process attempting to negotiate with people who, by and large, think only locality. Quite frankly, there must be a better way than what has happened over the last 16 months. My third concern is the accusation that Aboriginal people have been sold out by the coalition. Unfortunately, any debate on Aboriginal affairs is so highly charged with emotion that it is almost impossible to have a discussion free of that emotion. Most of the concern relates to what Western Australia is doing. I have had several discussions with Premier Court before and after he became premier. There has been nothing in what he has said to me privately to suggest he is the ogre that he is painted in a debate where people tend to be painted in extremes. I can sleep at night with this decision that we have made to oppose this legislation because we are not selling out Aboriginal people. One of the three fundamental pillars of our approach is that the Racial Discrimination Act is totally intact, which ensures that Aboriginal people will suffer no racial discrimination. They will have their property rights and they will have the same rights as other Australians regarding development on their land. I became shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs 3 1/2 years ago. It was not a job I ever imagined having: I had no idea what to expect. Less than an hour after I was asked to do the job by the Leader of the Opposition, I got a call from the then member for Pearce, Fred Chaney, who congratulated me and told me I had a tough job which would change of me. I had that job for three years-longer than anyone in the coalition has had it since the portfolio was created. And, yes, it did change me; I accept that. It changed me in a way that probably makes me lose some objectivity because, in immersing oneself in Aboriginal society, one has to daily confront the fact that there are a group of Australians who are discriminated against day by day in Australia. One has to confront abject poverty in one's own country-a wealthy country. I concur with much said by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns). We have to confront a group of Australians who, until recently, suffered institutional discrimination. This is not guilt. I do not feel guilt. I feel sadness. It is the stark reality of Australia today. Aboriginal people feel bitter, and that bitterness is being passed from generation to generation-it is very real. The way this debate has gone in the broader community has, unfortunately, not helped the way expectations have been raised and, I have to say, the way expectations will not be met. I would have less cynicism in this debate-a word I rarely use and an emotion I rarely feel-as someone who has tried to look at the rights of Aboriginal people, if I had not been subjected to the National Media Liaison Service, and had not been subject to attempts to tum against me, for political advantage, the most minute nuances of anything I said. Not everyone in this debate wants to do that;. but much of this debate has just been a party political debate. In the end this country either faces up to Aboriginal hopes and aspirations or it faces up to a bitter underclass. This legislation will eventually be behind us. Fpr the reasons outlined by others, I support the coalition's opposition to the bill. When it is behind us we will then have to get on with the hard work of addressing Aboriginal disadvantage and the hard work of giving Aboriginal people a real say in the decisions that affect their day-today lives. I hope we learn from this by the time it is all over. I hope that the bitterness, division and absolute hypocrisy of recent times do not occur again. Overseas experience shows us that addressing Aboriginal hopes and aspirations leads to national unity; our addressing those hopes and aspirations does not divide Aborigines. I do not pretend we are 100 per cent right; I do not accept we are 100 per cent wrong. This has been a debate of false choices. It has been a debate where things have been painted in extremes-black and white'You're for me. You're against me. You accept this legislation or you don't care about Aboriginal people'. That is deeply offensive to a lot of people on this side of the House. It is humbug. We should get this legislation over and then work on what we really need to do.",103
152,Mr SNOW,Unknown,"Eden-Monaro) (6.49 p.m.)The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) spoke about symbolism in the Native Title Bill and said that it was of no practical significance. If he had listened to honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who is just leaving the chamber, he would not have thought that this legislation is symbolism. The honourable member spoke about the way in which British justice was overturned by the High Court-nothing like the language used by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and nothing like the humanity that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition showed in his speech. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition should look behind him when he is sitting in this House to hear what other people have been saying in this debate. The people sitting around him and behind him have shown nothing of the humanity that he has shown. This bill is not just symbolism, although even symbolism can be of practical significance. Symbolism can have an unknown, yet significant effect on the mind and therefore on attitudes, on action and on justice. This is far more than symbolism. Most of the world's great religions hold that quality of life is influenced by our personal attitudes, by human conscience and by integrity. Those who hurt others are-say Mohammed, Buddha and Jesus-themselves hurt. People develop a code of behaviour and attitudes. If that code is disrupted by the forced imposition of other values, the effect can be devastating. That is what happened to the Aboriginal people. Those who perpetuate the cultural assault are also hurt because they have usually violated their own code of interhuman justice. All this is considered to be airy-fairy, do-gooder stuff well away from the materialistic world that so many would call the real world. I am not talking about guilt at all. I know that people raise the spectre of guilt, but I do not think that is the issue at all. I think honourable members all over the House have generally agreed on that. In these days of modern science and of quantum physics, there is evidence that to close our minds to what happens in our minds and bodies as a result of the harmful consequences of our actions may be to ignore what happens in the complex chemistry of our minds or our souls, or whatever we like to call it. Now that science has stated that the the smallest of particles, or anti-particles, the neutrino, passes through our body, through the earth and out the other side without hindrance, we are again wondering about what used to be regarded as a lot of nonsense:-that is, the power of thought, the ability to connect with what has been called the spiritual and unknown links between ourselves, between people and animals and between people and the earth. Materialism has heaped odium on the spiritual. Materialism is supposed to be what you can see, touch, hear or smell. Where materialism did not recognise that there was an unknown, it was not being scientific; it was being very unscientific. Closed minds reflected the concern of Joubert in 1842: How many learned men are working at the forge of science-laborious, ardent, tireless Cyclops, but one-eyed. It is significant, though, that no-one in this debate has been prepared to deny the spiritual relationship between Aboriginal people and the land. Some imply rejection of that relationship, as did the honourable member for Parkes, by accusing the High Court of doing away with British justice. But they are not prepared to say it. When I visited the Wallaga Lake Koori community 14 years ago I was told, 'This land is not ours; we belong to the land; the land is our mother'. When the English invaders possessed areas of land, as invaders have done in Europe and elsewhere for thousands of years, there was a massive attack on that spiritual relationship. It did not put people their land, but it took a land off its people. Add the food which the people had no time to adapt to, and we have diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. Add the sudden onslaught of drugs without the time for genetic selection of resistance to people, and we have alcoholism. Add diseases of the eyes, venereal diseases and other foreign diseases, and we find little resistance among Aboriginal people. We would all be silly to feel guilty about it. Most Australians with ancestry new to the land came from nations which have conquered and been conquered over thousands of years. We would also be silly to allow the disease, the unemployment, the unhappiness and the spiritual harm to be perpetuated. To say that poor Aboriginals should have no more rights than poor whites ignores the high proportion of Aborigines who are sick, who die young, who are unemployed and who need to recover their spirituality. That is why we need to have a few years of-I am not afraid to call it this-positive discrimination; not because of any guilt and not because one group of humans is sorry for another group but because the poor quality of life for Aboriginal people will hurt a much higher proportion of that one group than is suffered in the other ethnic groups most of us belong to. The poor quality of Aboriginal life is hurting us. I do not just mean the moneyalthough that is real enough and will not stop unless we do something following on this legislation-but the assault on their spiritual connections has taken a quality out of life for all of us. Something happens to the quality of life of the murderer as well as the murdered, the thief as well as the deprived and the invader as well as the invaded. It is not as though the injustices occurred long ago. When I went to school none of the Aboriginal children in Mildura were able to attend school. None of them were permitted to go to the movies at one particular theatre. They could attend the other more derelict theatre if they sat in the first six rows. It is only recently that Newcastle University has prescribed places in medicine for Aborigioff nal people. Instead of saying that it will just take the top one or two per cent of people who have qualified, it has done two great things: it has said it will take a proportion of country people so that they will go back to country areas and, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, coming from that area, it will also put some places in for Aboriginal people so that they can go back to help and work in their areas. Full credit to Newcastle University. We must do something about the land, we must do something about Aboriginal health and we must do something about education. We must continue to do some of the things that we have started doing. We must do something about hunting, fishing and gathering rights. That is apart fromthis legislation. I have quite a large number of Aboriginal people in some areas of my electorate. I think it could be said that the native title legislation will have little impact on local people. Reforms such as education, health and food rights s-ould follow up the legislation in the spirit of the High Court decision. The legislation recognises that traditional land occupied by Aboriginal people or traditional land which have never been taken from those people is theirs. It is amazing that it took a High Court decision to achieve that recognition. The High Court also said that if governments took such land from Aborigines it was no longer theirs. So we need legislation. We need to secure land, though keeping the rights of governments to acquire land under the same circumstances as from landowners. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns), who is at the table, referred to this. In New South Wales this legislation will have little effect. Land rights have been operating and claims have been tested for some years. I realise that the situation is more complex in Western Australia. I express some sympathy for my friend and colleague the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) who, in a sense, is saying two things: the legislation is holding back development, and it is not doing enough for Aboriginal people. I have sympathy for him on that. I certainly feel that this legislation is not just symbolism; it is recognising a fact which is long overdue for recognition. We need to make sure that we take action not only through this legislation but also, as we confirm the validity of existing regimes covering commercial fisheries, valid freeholds, residential land, commercial land and leases, along the lines I have been suggesting in the areas of health, employment, education and gathering rights. I want to conclude by repeating what I said at the beginning of my speech: even symbolism can be of practical significance. I believe that this legislation will have the sort of effect of the referendum where J\ustralians voted in a very high proportion to support recognition of Aboriginals within the federal constitution. It gave the federal government a right to make legislation. I am sure that in those times it was an important symbolic gesture to many people. It may not have got the same vote in all states if it happened today, but it was seen then as symbolic. That symbolism has led to something that has been very significant. I include the action that was taken in the High Court, the land rights legislation which has occurred all over Australia, and this native title legislation. Symbolism can have an unknown but significant effect on the mind and, therefore, on attitude, action and justice.",107
153,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"I believe that the Native Title Bill is only a small part of the total picture that Australia needs to attend to in getting Australians to relate to each other and combine as one nation, as those opposite wish to point out. Instead of approaching this issue on the basis of the legalities of ownership of land, Australia should be approaching this problem as a totality of which land is only a small part and which this legislation fails to deal with almost completely. This legislation follows the government's directive and the penchant of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to strut the stage and pose himself as somebody who understands these issues but who fails dismally. The miIlions and miIlions of dollars that the Prime Minister has talked about which will be paid out in compensation to land owners will be directed towards five per cent of the Aboriginal community. The issues of education, employment and health, the crying needs of the Aboriginals, will go unattended, except for a package of some $20 million that we have yet to see. What a strange set of priorities this government has to be able to strut the stage and say, 'We are settling the Aboriginal problems with hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars directed to a smaIl proportion of the Aboriginal community', and then walk - way from the real responsibilities-the responsibilities that the Aboriginal people themselves would have the government attend to rather than the land issue. When we look at the Aboriginal community and what two Aboriginal representatives say, we see that they are really concerned about a new level of materialism, a new level of humanism and domination-not with white over black, but black over black. That is the conflict they see arising: the division of the black people one against the other as they claim, and are encouraged to claim, new areas of land and new opportunities in a materialistic way, which is not in their character at this point. This legislation fails right at the very core. It does not deal with the problems of Aboriginals. The Prime Minister is endeavouring to prove .that he is in control. The legislation does not deal with the education, employment and health problems, which is what we ought to be dealing with tonight if we are serious about doing something to bring Australians together. This legislation is a great disappointment for me because it fails to provide validation of titles and to accept the states pre-eminence. But those are technical factors when one looks at the whole gamut of things that .the legislation is supposed to do for the Aboriginal people. I have met and worked with Aboriginals for a long time in my life and I have had the opportunity recently of talking to Torres Strait Islanders about the High Court decision. The High Court has found in favour of three individuals in the Torres Strait. In fact, if the government were doing its job, it would say, 'Yes, we agree with the decision of the High Court and we will set out to provide some certainty in the rest of Australia and in the way in which this decision on the common law will work from now on'. The government should be moving on and encouraging self-reliance amongst the Australian Aboriginals that is obvious in the Torres Strait islands. I am pleased to say that a greater understanding between the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders appears to be emerging. The so-called leaders of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have not used the words of concern about a new materialism, humanism or domination of black person over black person; they have settled with the government and claim to represent the Aboriginal people. That is a great shame, because they have been played up to by the powerbrokers. In fact, they have given into what will amount to a new feudalism and a new collectivism, so well described by the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) earlier today. Let us deal with the legislation before the House. This bill puts the government's policies into action. I believe that the government's proposals are dead wrong for Australia. It says one thing, but the result of the legislation will be something quite different. When we analyse the legislation and look at the law rather than the words of the Prime Minister, we discover these things. People owning land or using land in Australia can be challenged for the validity of their title at time. The Prime Minister has said that. Anybody has a right to go to a court and issue a writ. The question is: will he or she be successful? The government is saying that they will not be successful. The fact that success and the wish to challenge can be unrelated haS not entered the government's head. The current claims over the Bowen Basin are likely to fail. The mere challenge to certainty of title and prospect of development and ownership of Australia's great exporting industries in the coal industry are enough to make those people who fear for the future of their investment reach a settlement out of court in order to make the problem go away. They want a quick conclusion and settlement of their problem. This legislation does not provide that certainty. Richard Court has found a way of providing that certainty, and I believe that it is a compassionate and thoughtful approach. I do not think Richard Court, the Premier of Western Australia, would want to be harmful in any way to Aboriginals or their traditional rights. He has found a way to provide certainty where this government has failed. Despite the statements of the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch), every case will be considered. The tribunals and the registrar will look at every case that arises. How will they be looked at? They will be looked at on the basis of the circumstances in Aboriginal law that existed at the time of the arrival of white man. That is what the legislation will say. The anthropologist becomes the king of the court or tribunal. It will be on the word of white anthropologists as to which black people inhabited that land and what area of land they inhabited at the time of the arrival of the white man. These are the practicalities of the legislation. Let us talk about them. In the court there will be expert against expert and black group against black group each paying for, or maybe the taxpayer will pay, the experts and trying to claim the land. These cases will be settled by white anthropologists arguing against each other in tribunals. Every case based on law will be somewhat different and so they will need to be examined carefully because, as I any understand native title, it will be the understanding we have of native laws, either at the current time or 200 years ago. I guess that has to be settled. Who is going to detenoine that? Who is going to listen to the variations between tribe, clan or group? Somebody has to make the decisions as to what was native law. 1Wo hundred years of native law of inheritance is going to be fascinating for the tribunals to work out. What about the changes that have occurred and the movement of Aboriginal people from place to place? Currently, it would seem that those who may be resident in an area could be asked to leave because there is a prior claim by a group living nearby. So a group that is currently inhabiting an area of land with a few friends from a different tribe living nearby may find that they do not have rights or title to that land which they have been living on and using. That is the conflict that will be set up. Current residents could be told to move on. This becomes even more complex when one considers the bundle of rights that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, talks about, or the sliver of rights may rest across pastoral leases or other types of land. It is perfectly well illustrated by simple story of a landowner with a right to establish a forest and native people with a right to hunt. If the game living in the forest that has been established for timber suddenly has its habitat removed by the timber being cut, who has pre-eminent right in those circumstances? Nobody has decided that. I cannot see in the legislation that there is a pre-eminent right in that situation, as circumstance changes, not today, but in 20 years time. Let me finalise my remarks by saying that I believe the Premier of Western Australia has moved to provide certainty. He has also moved to establish the traditional rights of Aboriginal people and he is establishing that by law. The Commonwealth needs to then deal with the great issues of education, employment and health so that Australians can walk together as one nation. The states' prominence in this role is completely overtaken by the Commonwealth because the Commonwealth said, 'If you agree with the rules we wish to establish for tribunals, we will approve the processes that you adopt, but not otherwise'. So there is a complete insertion of Commonwealth control over the process of land settlement in this instance. If the states are compliant, the Commonwealth will allow them to pursue whatever the Commonwealth wants for them. So the rules are laid out there for the states to be controlled by the Commonwealth in this process. In the matter of compensation, that is certainly the case. Settlement procedures, registration, tribunals and compensation are all controlled by the federal government in every state of Australia. That will only cause a problem in a few states, I guess, because New South Wales and Victoria, it seems, are prepared to accept the Commonwealth's proposal. We have yet to find out about Western Australia, maybe South Australia, and Queensland. So here is the second point on which I disagree with the legislation: I do not agree that it provides certainty. I do not believe that it provides validation of titles and I do believe that it that overtakes the role of state governments. A proper framework would involve one the where we do not have to roll back the Racial Discrimination Act, so that we can leave that in place. I believe that by using the processes established in Western Australia we will establish certainty of title. If there is then a process of compensation, I believe that should be undertaken. But I believe that that process would allow us, under Commonwealth law and under the articles of the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Fonos of Racial Discrimination, unstintingly to discharge our duties. I add one further rider that the government and the coalition need to consider: there must be a cut-off date. We must at some time be able to draw the line. As it stands, all states of Australia are applying different time scales. The facts are these: over the last 20 years the Aboriginal community has been paid something like $20 billion in additional benefits. I do not think many Australians quibble with that, but Australians would quibble with the results we have achieved with the payment of those funds. What I believe needs to be done in regard to land rights is that there should be a cut-off point. Those people in the Aboriginal community who want revenge should be told that there cannot be revenge, so that those-white and black-who want to walk together for a future, can do so. There is a point where we should say, 'That is the limit'. Ten years would seem to me to be a reasonable time. I believe over that period reasonable compensation in the form of services, land or payments to all Aboriginal people should be made as part of the compensation process-not necessarily on block after block of land, but so that all Aboriginal people have something which they can gain, not just those 5 per cent living in remote areas; otherwise more and more divisions are created amongst Aboriginal people.",109
154,Mr DUNCAN,Unknown,"I want to say at the outset that I see this as one of the most important debates that will take place during my time in parliament. As such, I intend this evening to address the issues in a positive way, as I see them. I do not intend to respond to the attitudes which have been expressed by opposition members. 1\vo hundred years ago, when Europeans came to this country, Aboriginal people comprised 100 per cent of the population. They now represent between 2 and 3 per cent of the population. When Europeans came to this country, they brought with them, or developed, a legal fiction that the land of this continent was vacant land. This enabled the land to be stripped from the Aboriginal people who owned the land without regard to their rights or the reality of their occupation and use of the land. Essentially, what was perpetrated was an invasion and dispossession, subsequently accompanied by genocide. In dealing with Mabo a very good analysis and explanation in effective English was given by the former Deputy Prime Minister, Jill} Cairns, in the Age of 23 November when he said: Is Mabo all that difficult? Is it difficult to see that once-upon-a-time there were no white people in Australia, but there were a few hundred thousand black ones? Is it difficult to see that the black people 'owned' all the land? Is it difficult to see that terra nullius-that the was not owned when the white people by force took possession of it-was wrong and unjust? You don't have to be a High Court judge or a Professor 81ainey to be able to see the evidence of all this. I think that amply demonstrates, as I said, in simple English, what the problem is all about. What the High Court did in the Mabo case was to put to rest once and for all this fiction. The court held that Australia, at the commencement of British settlement, was occupied and possessed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who had their own laws, customs and traditions and whose native title to the land survived the Crown's annexation of Australia. What has happened to Aboriginal people, irrespective of the terrible wrongs done to them, cannot be seen as a matter of guilt for this generation. It is, however, our responsibility to ensure that, in the future, opportunities for Aboriginal people are maximised and to ensure that the situation which history has now handed to us is righted-in the interests of Aboriginal Australians and of all Australians. While the High Court judgment recognises native title, it does not provide an effective and efficient means for determining where native title exists, nor who holds that title. It does set up criteria for determining such matters, and the matters to be taken into account are as follows: firstly, native title is ascertained according to the laws and customs of the indigenous people who, by those laws and customs, have a connection with a particular piece of land; secondly, native title is extinguished if the clan or group loses its connection with that particular piece of land. In my view, this will be the most important piece of legislation which will come before the parliament during this current term. I have been elected by the people of Makin as their representative in this parliament. They have placed their trust in me and I want to say that I. am personally able to support this bill, and what it seeks to achieve, 100 per cent in the true belief that I will be exercising that trust in the interests of the people of my electorate. I have read the bill from cover to cover and land I have read the explanatory memoranda. I can say frankly and honestly that there is no section, no clause and no word which should or need cause any concern or fear. The bill complies with our international obligations. It validates past grants of title by governments in this nation. No holder of a freehold title in this nation has anything to fear from this legislation. I can say with absolute confidence that every land title in my electorate of Makin will be valid on the passage of this legislation. Accordingly, it follows that Australians can be sure that they do indeed own their own homes. This is not a states rights issue, and neither it should be. Even the most dogged supporter of such so-called rights would concede that the native titles which existed in 1788 were in no way beholden to the colonial boundaries subsequently drawn on the map. Likewise, to properly facilitate the recognition of the native title where it still exists, we should have one set of principles applying across the nation and not a jumble of state laws. Mr Court, the Premier of Western Australia, wants to completely abolish native title rights in Western Australia. But why should Aboriginal Australians in Western Australia, who after all are Australian citizens, have their property rights expropriated en masse when other Aborigines, fortunate enough to live in the other states, have their rights upheld? Native title should not be a matter of division in our society but an opportunity to build the cohesion of our nation. Some mining companies have described· the issues and this legislation as extraordinarily complex. I suppose for people not familiar with parliament and itS laws they would no doubt seem so, but these issues are relatively straightforward when compared, for example, with the complexities of taxation laws which mining companies and others in the business community do not seem to have any particular difficulty understanding and complying with. The Native Title Bill does not represent formidable problems for mining companies and others in the business community. Through this legislation, we now have a workable scheme which provides security of title and which provides justice for those Aboriginal people who still hold native title, and justice through a compensation scheme for those Aboriginal people who have been dispossessed. I believe that the work done in putting together this legislation was groundbreaking. It was groundbreaking in many respects, but it was particularly groundbreaking because of the way that Aboriginal leadership, for the first time. I believe in the nation's history, was able to negotiate from a position of strength and not a position of weakness. I particularly want to note the grea- work done by my fellow South Australiafl Lois O'Donoghue who is the chairperson of ATSIC. She is a great South Australian and a great Australian. I think that she has shown not only Aboriginal people but the rest of the community how reconciliation and cooperation really can work. I want to congratulate her personally on the tremendous work that she has done. I am pleased to note that this legislation has wide community support. Decent Christians and their churches across the nation have raised their voices in support. Welfare groups, who well know of the terrible deprivation visited on Aboriginal people by our society, have expressed their support. The National Farmers Federation and other industry groups have shown that they are able to rise to the occasion and support this legislation. Any person of goodwill who has studied the Native Title Bill and the scheme it seeks to create will know that it does not stifle investment in the mining industries; it will not expropriate pastoral holdings; nor will it result in large tracts of land being locked away from future development. On the contrary, it will return certainty to the investment climate by validating existing titles. From that point of view, the sooner the bill passes, the better. I find it quite extraordinary that some of those groups in the community who were clamouring for certainty and the validation of titles are now suggesting that the bill ought to be delayed in the Senate or elsewhere. That seems to be a contradiction to their earlier position. Some people in the community will come across others using this bill and the Mabo judgment to preach fear and loathing. All people of goodwill in the community should reject such people and the immorality which underscores their attitudes. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has earmarked the 1990s as a decade of reconciliation between the original Australians and non-Aboriginal Australians. This is a quest for a higher morality and a quest in the national interest. The fruitful negotiations between the various parties which led to this legislation saw a recognition of the Aboriginal leadership negotiating as equals for the first time. It slur on this nation's history that it took over 200 years for that to happen. But it does provide a new beginning. We clearly need a whole cultural change by non-Aboriginal Australians in the way that we treat.Aboriginal Australians. This bill, when it becomes law, will go some way towards achieving that. But while the infant mortality rate of Aboriginal people is at Third World proportions, while Aborigines are gaoled at 25 times the rate of the nonAboriginal population, and while large numbers of Aborigines die in custody, this will continue to be judged as a racist nation. We will not remove that fact until we change our national attitudes. Mabo provides a beginning, an opportunity to remove the stain on our national character and to remove the shame of our nation's history. It is my hope that the amount of attention being paid to Mabo is a mark of a sincere, maturing community. With that hope, I ask the people of Makin and Australians generally to support this bill and the reconciliation that it underpins for in it, I believe, are the seeds of a true national selfrespect. Debate (on motion by Mr Nebl) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Duncan) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Veterans and War Widows",112
155,Mr NEHL,Unknown,"In the brief time that is available this evening, I want to raise a number of matters which are of some concern to veterans and war widows in my constituency. At the outset, I acknowledge that the Department of Veterans' Affairs, by and large, does an excellent job on behalf of the people I represent. However, there are holes in it like the holes in the Telecom net. One of the things that are of some concern to me is that where veterans are receiving automatic treatment for cancer-and they do receive free treatment for all cancer care-if they are going to a private clinic, they sometimes have a difficulty. The clinics forget to seek prior approval for the veteran to travel to a capital city for that treatment. Because that approval has not been obtained, is a the claim for travelling expenses incurred is rejected. I know of one case of an elderly gentleman in Coffs Harbour. He incurred approximately $1,700 in fares to and from Sydney for his cancer treatment. Unfortunately, he has had to pay off the debt incurred for the travel over many months. This has been done from his service and disability pensions. I realise that this is the legal framework, but surely there must be some grounds for a little discretion in these sorts of cases. I am also concerned about the provision of travel for veterans, not only in my area, but around rural and regional Australia. Where there is no public transport, the amount of travelling allowance paid is quite inadequate. For instance, the Coffs Harbour and District TPI Social and Welfare Club has told me that people living in its welfare area, which extends from above Woolgoolga to Nambucca Heads, Urunga, Macksville, Stuarts Point, Taylors Arm, Bellingen and Dorrigo, have great difficulty because of the infrequency of public transport. In most cases, there is hardly any public transport. They need a car, but many of them are not able to drive. Allowances paid are quite inadequate. I made a representation to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Senator John Faulkner, a couple of months ago on behalf of a constituent. I was very disappointed with the response from the minister. In ·one part, he said: Comparing travelling expenses payable to veterans with expenses payable to public serva:J.ts or other employees under taxation regulations is not realistic. I do not believe that 'realistic' is the appropriate word because when we are talking about veterans and war widows who have risked their lives, suffered and been part of a contractual obligation with this country, it is a question of equity and justice-not realism. The minister went on: On the one hand, it is an accepted principle that employees who, through no choice of their own, have to travel in the course of their employment should be fully recompensed for the cost involved. Why should not a veteran or a war widow be fully recompensed also for the cost involved? Again it comes back to a question of equity and justice. The minister said: On the other hand the allowances payable to veterans to help defray travel costs are just they are allowances. Why are they allowances and not the full costs? Just as a public servant is required to travel because of his job, a veteran in this situation, who has been wounded or suffered disease or injury during war service or subsequent to that, also needs to travel. I do not have time to go into all the matters raised by the minister, but it is totally inappropriate that he should take this frivolous view. I hope it is not his view; perhaps the letter has been written by somebody junior in his office who does not fully understand that this country has a great commitment, which must be maintained, to the war veterans and war widows who have served our country so very well. Government Purchasing Policy",114
156,Mr CAMPBELL,Unknown," Tonight I want to talk about the level playing field. As I have said before in this House, the level playing field is a flat earth policy. People in Australia should clearly understand that unless we get a return to import replacement manufacturing, there will not be enough jobs for our children. This is not a barren plea for a return to protectionism but a plea for some sensible government action. One thing the government could do; with very little effort and no cost-probably a saving-would be to institute a policy of purchasing on the through life cost of any product it buys, not on the capital cost. It could also demand of its public servantsremembering that a lot of purchases made by the government are made at a very low level in the Public Service-that they buy the Australian product and have to justify why if they do not. If we took these simple steps we would see a big tum up in government purchasing of Australian made products. No matter what sort of society we live in, the old Russia or the present United States, the government is always the biggest single customer. The Australian Army has just purchased sixtyeight 2'f2-tonne motor vehicles. What is annoying is that the army did not even ask the only Australian truck manufacturer in that category to tender. It was not even given the that; opportunity. It is true that the Oka motor vehicle, designed and built in Western Australia, would have been more expensive than the Mitsubishi truck that the army bought, but it is a much more capable vehicle and would have a much higher resale value. At the end of the day, the taxpayer may well have been better off had the government purchased on through life cost. I doubt whether 68 trucks make much difference to a multinational the size of Mitsubishi, but it is absolutely vital for a company such as the Oka Motor Co. in Perth. It is particularly galling that it was not even given the opportunity to tender. Whether the vehicles are two-wheel or four-wheel drive does not matter, because that company is quite capable of making those vehicles in any configuration. The army is also currently tendering for six 6x6 transportable recovery vehicles, the sorts of things flown into rescue tanks. There is a company in Sydney, RFW, which arguably makes the best large off-road motor vehicles in the world. It is interesting that the Brisbane City Council was recently in Switzerland seeking a machine for sucking sewers. When visiting the Swiss company Kaiser, the councillors said they needed to buy a truck while they were there. The Swiss company said that the best truck in the world for them to buy was made in Sydney. The problem is that the level playing field means that large multinational companies can and do cut the price to get their product in, knowing they can pick up money on spare parts and service. That happens all the time. The local company cannot do that because it has to sell at a profit. There is also the problem that in buying an overseas product-and these vehicles are in the $400,000 to $500,000 each category-it is very easy to offer the overseas trip for inspection. I have no doubt that it is more exciting to look at the night life of Stockholm or some German city than Sydney. That is an incentive to buy from some of these countries. We also must consider spare parts. Spare parts for these vehicles are not only expensive but often very hard to get. The Australian made vehicles are serviced here, parts are made here and are available very readily. This is a national disgrace. Unless it is addressed we will not get a return to full employment. It is simply dishonest for anyone, politician or anyone else, to tell people that there will be a return to full employment until we get a sensible, forward-looking and nationalist government purchasing policy. Essay Competition: Groom Electorate",115
157,Mr TAYLOR,Unknown,"About four or five months ago when the political agenda in this country was being dominated, as it still is to a certain extent, by such issues as Mabo, the republic, the flag and the general economic malaise, I decided, as did the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), who is in the House this evening, to listen to what the youth in my electorate had to say about where we were heading as a nation. I instituted an essay competition entitled 'Australia in the 21st century-My Vision'. As a result, we had a very successful competition, eventually honed down to about 30 very high standard essays from students anhe year 12 level. I want to take the opportunity to thank the 16 private and public secondary schools in my electorate, in particular the principals and English masters and mistresses, without whom this would not have been the success it was. I want to thank in particular one of my constituents, Mr John Harbison, and a small group of volunteers who honed the original list down to about 30, and who helped make the competition a success. I also thank the three final judges who made the decision to adjudicate on the winner. They were Professor Maurice French, the Dean of Arts at the University of Southern Queensland in Toowoomba; Mrs Annette Curnow, an official in the Toowoomba regional office of the Queensland education department; and, finally, Mrs Lin Boyle, a feature writer with the Toowoomba Chronicle. I congratulate the eventual winner, 17-yearold Sarah Davis, a grade 12 student at St Saviours Catholic College in Toowoombaand who is shadowing me in this parliament for the four days of this sitting week. Sarah is a very articulate young lady. She is intelligent and resourceful, and has a reputation, both locally and in Queensland, for her public speaking prowess. She is very interested in human rights issues both at the domestic and international levels. She is a very proud and very active member, with her mother, of the Amnesty group in Toowoomba. I would like to read a couple of the pertinent extracts from her essay: The most important part of Australia is the resource of the Australian people. Australia prides itself on being a multicultural nation, a country where equality is evident and where all Australians are equally and fairly represented. It appears however that Australian's eyes are covered as Aboriginal deaths in custody continue and indigenous people are faced with discrimination in the workforce and in other'sectors of life. She goes on: · ., racial difficulties still may be evident in Australia but direct action is required in order for there to be any improvement in the future in racial equality. In order to boost Australia's struggling economy the role of the Australian worker must be examined · .. In the 21st century, if Australia wishes to be economically successful, Australian entrepreneurs and business, industry and research, need the support of the Australian people. She goes on to say: · ., by purchasing Australian made products, Australians are able to support their fellow workers while boosting the economy. Most importantly Australia's population must be considered when the choice is made regarding our future as a Republic or as belonging to the British Commonwealth with constitutional monarchy. As Australia wishes to act in the future as an independent nation, it may appear that it is necessary to break away from old - ritish ties and pave. our own way in world affairs. At the - ame time, Australian traditions need to be recogntzed. When our nation is faced with many other problems, some may argue that Australia's least concerns should be that of changing to a Republic. Provisions must be made now to cater for the f-t-re ""greying population"" with room for. retirement villages, encourag-ment - nd. assl-tance enabling the elderly to contInue to live In their homes, and a developed health care system. Australia's role in human rights is in no way ---plete and in the 21st century, a greater role in trade and international relations should be planned. She finishes by saying: Most importantly ... we should take pride in our country as it has so much to offer. We are granted many powerful freedoms of speech and expression and in the future we must use our freedom to help others in our global village. Australia is an land. Australia is.a land with a history and beauty of which to be proud. EI Salvador",116
158,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"I draw the attention of the House to the fact that, in spite of the historic peace settle-ent in January 1992 in EI Salvador, political killings by death squads still continue in that unfortunate country. I cite three recent examples of prominent political leaders of the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front-FMLNwho have been murdered in recent times. They are Oscar Grimaldi, who was a member of the political commission of the FMLN; Francisco Velis, who was also a member of the FMLN political commission and the national council of that organisation, a candidate for the forthcoming elections next year and an electoral commission member-he was assassinated outside a kindergarten whilst holding his very young daughter-and Eleno Castro, who was also a member of the FMLN political commission and was the FM-N representative on the body charged WIth transferring land titles to rural workers in EI Salvador. This picture illustrates that the situation in El Salvador has not changed a great deal. Right wing death squads can still murder prominent political figures with relative impunity. We could well ask what that means for ordinary citizens and what this entails for their prospects of participating with any degree of security in democratic political activity. The killings are designed to destabilise the fragile democratic process which is unfolding under the peace accord in EI Salvador. Quite own clearly, with death squads still in action in that country, there is a fairly strong prospect that the elections, due in the first part of next year, will not be held in what .we would consider to be normal democratic circumstances. In EI Salvador, the United Nations commission on the violations of human rights determined that, although crimes had been committed by all participants in the struggles that have dominated that country in the past 10 or ancient 15 years, the predominant blame for violations of human rights does lie with the armed forces and the death squads which lll'e connected with the armed forces of that country. Australia should push from within the international community for the implementation of that commission's recommendations. I will detail to the House this evening some of the commission's major recommendations that have been put forward. These include the removal from public office of those guilty of human rights abuses; civilian control of the military; the enactment of a law allowing soldiers in the military to refuse to obey unlawful orders; the severing of ties between the military and private armed groups; human rights education at the military academy; further detailed investigation of the activities of death squads; dismissal of certain highly politicised judges in the supreme court; the general depoliticisation of the .administr-tion of justice to ensure that there IS a truly mdependent and unbiased judicial syste!D; the introduction of a range of human nghtswhich, in a country like Australia, we take for granted-relating to detenti-n withou.t trial, the right to legal representatIon, the nght to habeas corpus and the like; ratification of the various international human rights treaties; and compensation to the victims on all sides of human rights violations. Australia has a very important responsibility to push for implementation of these recommendations and also to pursue greater economic interaction with El Salvador and the rest of the region. This should be associated with political and economic pressure to ensure that the business environment in that country and the environment for political activity is one of stability, certainty and freedom. It is time that the West got a bit more serious about some of these societies, particularly those in the western sphere, where rapacious feudal elites have used devices such as death squads to maintain a very privileged position in their societies at the expense of the vast bulk of the ordinary citizens in those communities. It is interesting to contrast the past attitude of the United States government to circumstances in El Salvador, Guatemala and Haiti, for example, with the attitude it has taken to Cuba. I urge the House to give some serious consideration to the problems in El Salvador. It is clear that there is a long way to go before the true implementation of the peace accord actually comes into effect. Essay Competition: Fisher Electorate",117
159,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"Fisher) (7.47 p.m.}-Recently, I spoke on the adjournment debate about the Fisher electorate essay competition and read into the Hansard the winning essay in the primary section entitled 'Australia's future' by Tracey Close. Today Tracey and the secondary section winner, Joanne Page, are seated in the gallery. I would now like to read into Hansard Joanne's essay entitled . 'The Power of the Press'. It reads: The Power of the Press by Joanne Page In our power hungry society, every day it becomes clearer and clearer that the media are going too that they are betraying their responsibility to the public. It appears that the press care more for profit, and or power, than for people. They have lost respect for the right of privacy, while complaining loudly if any of their rights are inhibited. Surely the idealistic image of free press has been shattered. Our 'free' press is a natural extension of the basic human right to free speech. To be free is part of being a democracy, and as Thomas Jefferson said: ""Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost"" Yet surely we, the general public, are owed something in return for creating an environment and markets where mass media can flourish. The mass media was not always as it is today. Long ago it was in the form of bill posters and town criers who were the first to report organised news. Now, 1000 years after reporting to the public when these media first began, we live in a world of sophisticated communication techniques. We can view events taking place on the other side of the world-live-thanks to satellites. Faxes, mobile phones, highly advanced television and newspapers also contribute to the enormous influence of the media in this communication age. However, a pattern has developed whereby the facts no longer seem to be important. Sensationalism, sex and scandals are what create sales and ratings, and the media has been only too happy to acquiesce. This morbid attitude, and a penchant for reporting sickening details, has resulted in an increasingly low standard of reporting. The media are sacrificing their professional honour and betraying their responsibility to the public for that great corrupter-money. What is their responsibility to the public? I believe it can be summed up in four points. 1. To report events accurately and honestly to the public . 2. To be good society role models and not promote rebellion, violence etc 3. To respect the privacy of people who are in the news, and the rights of the same, particularly in the sphere of human tragedy 4. And above all to uphold with integrity the laws prohibiting libel, blasphemy and sedition. The reason that upholding their responsibility to the public is so important is that they wield enormous power. The media report news to the general public, they give us information. But is it safe to believe the barrage of words we receive from them every day? far, It is important not to underestimate the power of print. Many people believe, ""I read it in the newspaper so it must be true"". The information is rarely perceived as the newspaper's bias, or a journalist'S viewpoint, but as fact. Sensationalism is ever increasing, because there are very few limits to our 'free' press; and they often come close to abuse of our trust and our language. The news has become image oriented, especially by television's refusal to portray the world as it really is-instead glamorising undesirable jobs which are occupied by good-looking people with questionable ethics. In fact it has been estimated that an average child will see in excess of 2000 murders on television by the age of twelve. What effect do these misconceptions on life have on our young? Surely they are highly detrimental? This is an indication in itself that profit is regarded as more important than the welfare of others. One press baron to whom the profit motive apparently did not apply was Lord Beaverbrook, who once assured the British public, ""I run my papers purely for propaganda. I am not interested in profit"". Propaganda does seem to be the forte of our media barons. The phenomenal power of the press has meant that those who own our newspapers and television stations have tremendous influence on political decisions. It is commonly believed that you don't own a newspaper unless you want to exercise power. As Rudyard Kipling said: ""Words are the most powerful drug used by mankind"". The media can so easily twist the facts with skilful use of words, so that it is often difficult to know what to believe. They use our language to spread rumours and create scandals, continually participating in that questionable process-trial by media. I am sure the royal family would agree with menot content with continual hounding of the family, in the last year misleading, abusive scandal ridden journalism has reached a new high . . . . or low? What other profession can boast that they helped to bring down the British royal family? This brings me to my next point, the blatant disregard our media seem to have for privacy. They will stalk their prey until they have a story, often disregarding the fact that people may be distraught due to personal tragedy. Interviewers don't hesitate to ask upsetting or embarrassing questions-it's all in the cause of getting a good story. In conclusion I believe that we should live up to our civic duty and stand up to the media. We should make it clear to the press when their activities are unacceptable, and that if they wish to retain their liberty they must uphold their responsibility to the public. They should respect people's rights and understand when it is important to exercise professional restraint. The great danger in the present trend is that if we have come to the point of questioning the freedom of the press, because that freedom seems so often to be abused. This is indeed serious-it is questioning democracy itself, therefore we must convince the media to clean up their act. We can only assure their liberty if they adopt a more responsible attitude which reflects their position of influence in a free society. I thank you, Mr Speaker, for receiving both students in your office this morning. (TIme expired) Regional Development",118
160,Mr VAILE,Unknown,"I address my remarks in the adjournment debate this evening to the issue of regional development around Australia. Earlier this month I participated in the general meeting of the Country Manufacturers Association of New South Wales which was held in the Greater Taree City Council chambers in Taree. I felt that it was important for me to report back to the House tonight because the mood at that meeting was one of continued frustration towards the current government's approach to the issue of balanced state development and regional development. The Country Manufacturers Association of New South Wales has been looking into these issues at great length. I applaud its initiative and determination in putting together an informative and wel1-researched package. In particular, I congratulate the efforts of the task force members of the regional development support scheme including Ken Bryant, Managing Director of Britax Brylite; Goetz Bayer, Financial Controller of BTR Engineering; John Gaffarena, MIS Manager of Britax Brylite; and Warren Woods, Financial Controller of Nationwide Rubber. This task force performed an independent study into 33 companies which operate manufacturing industries around country New South Wales and came up with some astounding statistics. The results of its comprehensive survey into these 33 companies found that the estimated cost disadvantage for this sample of manufacturing companies operating from nonmetropolitan locations is an astounding $11.9 million per annum. In these 33 companies, this is the equivalent of approximately 1.8 per cent of gross sales, or the equivalent of a massive 9.3 per cent of the payroll or, even worse, the equivalent of 456 new jobs. This is all as a direct result of these 33 businesses choosing to operate from non-metropolitan centres. This is information that the government must take on board. These are independent people surveying independent companies and how the impediments to regional development affect them in their particular circumstances. It is accurately recorded information. In fact, the chief executive officer of the Country  was the manager of DEET in Taree for many years, so he has a reasonable knowledge of how the game is played and what is not accurate information. As Mr Fraser will gladly let you know, these worrying figures are the facts of life in regional Australia today. So therefore I must ask why, with much of the information already having been collected throughout Australia with regard to regional development, we get more· of the same from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths). What seems to be unfolding before us is a minister who is intent on over-bureaucratising the whole process of regional development. What we are seeing is a minister who is trying to reinvent the wheel and start doing all the research all over again. The minister must realise that many studies have already been done, just like the CMA study and the country mayors study from New South Wales. The minister must also realise that there many people with greater expertise in local economies than Mr Bill Kelty who could, if given the chance, have a valuable input into his task force. The minister must realise that there are already many established information outlets, such as business enterprise centres, that the government must begin to utilise as a valuable information source for specific regional activities. I am concerned at what the minister has done in his first eight months. He has set up a complex web of boards, bodies and consultancies that he thinks will provide all the answers. For example, under this minister we have an urban and regional development review advisory group which assists the urban and regional development review team, which in turn assists the task force on regional development. We also have under this minister an Industry Commission report on regional development coming out in Deceinber, which this government has already shown it will ignore by pushing through the Industrial Relations Reform Bill we debated in the parliament this week. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) also has his own rural and regional task force. Just recently we have also seen a $1.25 million regional study announced which will look into factors affecting business investment in the nation's regions. This plethora of opinion and advice has all taken place with very little state or local government consultation or coordination and very little rhyme or reason. It is argued that the information the minister is looking for is already available. The studies into the problems facing regional Australia have already been done. I therefore call on the minister to take a lead now and to start utilising all this existing information that is readily available to his department. I call on him to put a regional strategy in place so that regional. business is no longer faced with the ridiculous inequities that it currently faces when operating within regional Australia outside of the metropolitan areas. Media Ownership",119
161,Mr ALDRED,Unknown,"In this adjournment debate I wish to highlight the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to are the serious issue of media ownership, which signifies implicitly media influence, in Australia today. I would like to quote some of the Prime Minister's comments when challenged on the issue of his relationship with Mr Conrad Black. Early this year Mr Black acquired, with the government's assistance, an increased ownership level in Fairfax from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. When asked to comment on media reports ascribed to him that he had suggested that the Labor caucus would be more amenable to Mr Black's increased stake in Fairfax if re. - rting in the Fairfax papers prior to the federal election was more balanced, the Prime Minister merely dismissed the issue with a wave of a hand as 'hardly worth a mention' and 'just simply dust in the cracks of history'. The Prime Minister went on to describe his dealings in this matter as 'ephemeral day to day things' and contrasted them with the APEC negotiations, of which he had been so much a part and which he believed to be 'the biggest of the big pictures'. He went on further to say, 'The Black business is just ... not even a splash of paint on the picture'. I am dismayed that any Prime Minister could be so cavalier in attitude to, such an important facet of the basic fabric of our democratic system as the control of the media. It is particularly contrary to the professed standards of the Australian Labor Party, whose members have traditionally wailed long and loud on the topic of the control of the media being in too few hands. I notice that yesterday the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) issued a statement distancing himself somewhat from the Prime Minister's stance and assuring us that Mr Black's holdings will not be increased. That still leaves unresolved, I might add, the attitude of the Foreign Investment Review Board, which expressed very great concern in documents that I obtained under FOI about the movement from 15 to 25 per cent. I find it particularly disconcerting that the final recommendations of two advisory minutes to the Treasurer were deleted from the documents. I have instituted an internal review to seek exactly what those comments' were. I conclude by pointing out that now, faced with a Senate inquiry into media ownership, the government will not be able to protect its media mates much longer. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 8 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr MACKellar to move That this House, recognising the concerns expressed by members of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, in particular the Members for Hunter, Moreton, New England and Throsby: (1) notes, in this, the International World's Indigenous Peoples, that Friday, 10 December 1993 is International Human Rights Day; (2) recognises that human rights abuses continue to be a blight on a world where (a) communities who have lived for generations or even centuries are driven from their homes under programs of ethnic cleansing, (b) warlords dominate their societies with utter disregard for the good of the whole causing violence, starvation and anarchy, (c) torture, detention without trial and disappearances are common aspects of many legal systems and (d) minority groups are often forced to live under oppression, disadvantage and injustice; (3) asserts its belief in the universality and indivisibility of human rights as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reinforced in the covenants and conventions of the UN; and (4) encourages the Government in its efforts to promote and protect human rights through active involvement in international forums and through consistent bilateral policies which encourage other nations to develop and maintain the rule of law and respect for the dignity of the human person.
