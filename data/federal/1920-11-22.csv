COAL TRADE DISPUTE.. Mr WATKINiS - Can the Prime Minister make a statement regarding the effect of the negotiations concerning the dispute in the coal trade? MT. HUGHES - I have heen in communication with the council of the Coal and Shale Miners Federation, to whom I have made a suggestion which I hope will be the means of bringing the parties together, and settling this unfortunate dispute. .I am unable to say how that suggestion is viewed hy the federation, but, as Mr Baddeley has informed me that he will be in Melbourne tomorrow, I hope that a modus vivendi may be found.

5,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BORROWING,"T n view of the great congestion in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, will the Prime Minister fix a date for the proclamation of the Arbitration (Public Service) Act, so that the Arbitrator may take up his duties, and that the hearing of the disputes in which Public Service organizations are concerned may be expedited ?",19
6,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH BORROWING,"At the request of the publio servants, we are advertising for applications from persons wishing to fill the position of Arbitrator. It was suggested to us by the Public .Servioe that be public servants should be allowed to apply for the position, and as we thought that fair, we agreed with the suggestion. I am not sure when the time for the receiving of applications closed, if it has closed, but directly we have selected, an Arbitrator, the Act will be proclaimed, so that he may proceed MELBOURNE POST OFIOE.",19
7,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH BORROWING,"In view of the many fine post-offices, north, south, east, and west, will the Postmaster-General remove the abomination at the corner of Elizabeth-street and Little Bourke-street, and have the main Melbourne Post Office completed, as I am sure it would have been completed had it been in Sydney ?

8,Mr BLAKELEY,ARBITRATION OOURT,"In view of the congested state of business in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, unconnected with Public Service appeals, is it the intention of the Government to, appoint a Justice to that Court ?",20
9,Mr HUGHES,ARBITRATION OOURT,"The matter is a little complicated, because Mr Justice Powers is absent from the Commonwealth, and I do not know, officially, when he will return, nor am I aware whether he is prepared to continue as Deputy President of the Court. I am also unaware of the date on which Mr Justice Higgins proposes to resign. The appointment of new Justices is materially affected, by those facts. The Government is considering how. many 'new Justices will be required, and when it is able to satisfy itself on the two points to whioh I have referred, it will immediately make the appointments necessary, whether one or two.

Will the Minister see that the Victorian public is treated in the same way as the Now South Wales public?",20
11,Mr MASSYGREENE,ARBITRATION OOURT,"I do not think fact that sugar can be obtained in Sydney in the manner stated, because the last advice from that place was that we 1,800 tons short on deliveries of orders there. As I have said repeatedly, as soon as we have in Australia a sufficient tity of white sugar, which will be within a few days now, all orders will be livered to the full extent. NA COMMITTEE.",20

19,Mr SPEAKER,PEDERAL CAPITA L ADVISORY," The control of the grounds is under the supervision of the Joint House Committee, and I shall consult with Senator Givens, President of the Senate, who is Chairman of that Committee, in regard to the matter.

21,Mr SPEAKER,PEDERAL CAPITA L ADVISORY,"Unde r which it was proposed that a sum of money should be expended by the Commonwealth Government to put the ground in order, and to remove the present eyesore by converting it into an ornamental reserve.

Unfortunately, that proposi/ tion has not yet met with the sanction of the State Government, and under the terms of our ocoupancy of these premises, aU we are called upon to do is to maintain the grounds in the same order and condition that they were in when we en I are anxious to remove the eyesore referred to, and. if the State Government will take up an attitude different from that which they have so far adopted in regard to this matter, we shall, be very pleased to carry out the work of improvement.

WAR TROPHIES: QUEENSLAND.",22
30,Mr MACKAY,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"the Minister for Homo and Territories, upon notice I. What is the number of war trophies (a) allotted by the Queensland War Trophy Committee; (6) the number claimed? 2. If there are further trophies available, will the Minister request the Queensland Committee to consider applications from towns with a population of under 300 persons?  honourable member's questions are as follow : ' 1. (a) Allotments to 449 towns in Queensland, involving the distribution of 70 guns and trench mortars and 430 machine guns, have been made by the Queensland State Trophy Committee. (6) Notices were sent to all towns affected, but up. to date only 124 replies have been received. These have all accepted the trophies. To expedite replies, the Committee has now informed the other towns that their acceptanfce must be received by the Sth December, otherwise the trophies offered will be re-allotted. 2. At a meeting held at the beginning of this month, the Queensland Committee decided to offer one machine gun to each town in Queensland with a population between 300 and 150, and to any town with / a smaller population which applied. The towns interested have already been advised of this decision. I may add, for the honourable member's information, that 'the despatch of all trophies to towns in Queensland has hitherto been held up pending the acceptance by the Queensland Government of responsibility for transport chaiijfs after the trophies have been placed on board at Melbourne or Sydney, where they are now stored. The Queensland Government has now accepted responsibility, but has asked that all trophies go forward in one consignment. The Premier has been asked to agree to monthly consignments, in order that the trophies may reach allottees promptly, instead of being held up until the final allotment has been made, as would be necessary if the trophies are to go forward in one consignment.

35,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"ParramattaTreasurer) [3.20] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. of This is a little Bill , of only one clause, the with which I hope it will not take the House many minutes to deal. There is Philp, practical agreement on all sides as to the advisability of the proposed reform, which may be a little one to us, but is a big one to tire poor, unfortunate blind people. Under the circumstances, the - night well be passed without debate. It is a proposal to permit a blind pensioner to earn an amount which, together with his pension, will give him the basic wage as determined from time to time in any State, including the rate in - now paid in New South Wales, namely, £ 4 5s. per week. There is a distinction between these blind people and other pensioners, as Rabaul, shown by the fact of their being pensioners, who are more or less physically one day disabled, and are not able to stand up against the stress ana strain of lif e as other sections 'of the community are. - J am particularly referring to those penoffer, sioners who may, in some sense, be conwith sidered as alongside the blind peoplethose who are pensioners because of some disease or other from which they suffer. 10s. The blind pensioners, on the other hand, are healthy people who can and do marry, and have families. The marriage these people ought to be encouraged a country like this, if we are to increase our population. They do all the other things that normal men always do - indeed , they have no disability but Basic Wage Commission? their blindness. That furnishes a rearight son, I think, for treating gory by themselves. There are only about 400 of these blind people in the whole Commonwealth, and only about 100 of these are in the various Institutions of the States. Altogether, it seems to me that this is a concession which they well deserve. It will cost in a full year £15,000. and it will come to them as nice little Christmas box. I ask honorraised able members to pass the Bill without delay.",23
36,Mr RYAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"West Sydney) [ 3 . 2 4 ] am pleased that the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has seen his way clear to introduce this Bill , whioh, no doubt, w to an extent, relieve the disabilities which some of the old-age and invalid pensioners suffer. I am sorry that the jright honourable gentleman has not made ""the Bill wider; but I know he stipulated that he would not introduce the measure unless it was confined to this particular matter. For that reason, I do not probut pose to transgress in any way on the understanding, which, at all events, had in his mind when he introduced - Bill'. But I should like a little informato tion in regard to one portion of the sure. I should like to know whether amount that is not to .be exceeded saidis to be the amount tioned as £ 2 2 ] per annum, or such Royal other amount as is declared by any Act , living or by any authority constituted under an Act, to be a basic wage for the portion the Commonwealth in which the pensioner resides.

41,Mr RYAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"West Sydney) [3.27] about I think that, without ajppearing to be a unreasonable, I may press the-question I on the second reading. I do not do so with any desire to embarrass the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), but because, according to clause 3, the wage is - I fixed at a sum not exceeding £ 2 2 1 per annum, "" or such other amount as is declared by any Act , or by any authority ill , constituted under an Act , to be a basic under wage for the portion of the Commonwealth in which the pensioner resides.""",24
42,Mr MAXWELL,WHEAT FO RHOM E,That will always give the pensioner the advantage of the basic wage ruling.,24
43,Mr RYAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"I quite understand that, I wish to know whether the Government are going to stand by the finding he of the authority which was constituted the by themselves, and which was referred in the speech of the Prime Minister mea- (Mr Hughes) at Bendigo on 31st Octhe tober, 1919. The Prime Minister then here men- - The Government is therefore appointing a Commission to inquire into the cost of in relation to the minimum or basic wage. The Commission will be fully clothed with power to ascertain what is a fair basic of wage, and how much the purchasing power of the sovereign has been depreciated during the war, and also how the basic wage may be adjusted to the purchasing power of the sovereign, and the best means when once it is adof automatically adjusting it to the rise The Government at the earliest date possible, create effective machinery to give effect to these principles. be proI f I ami rightly informed, the Treasurer is aware that the Royal Commission has I made its report; we have been told so by the Prime Minister this afternoon. I do not know whether I am correct,, but n I believe that the amount recommended by the Commission is as high as £ 5 16s. If that be so, why should we to-dayvery day on which the report is prewage sented-giv e our imprimatur to the amount of £221 ? Tho matter may not strike some honourable - members as it strikes ine-, but, seeing that the Government have the report in their hands, and that it is available for the Treasurer to see, would it not be much better, in stead of fixing the amount at £ 2 2 1 which means the New South Wales basic wage of £ 4 5s. per week-to provide that it shall be the amount recommended by the Royal Commission on the basic Wage ?",24
44,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEAT FO RHOM E,It would be a good wav of finding it out.,25
45,Mr RYAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"I do not wish to be misunderstood. I think it would be very unfortunate if the action of this Committee in approving of an amount of £221, in the case of blind workers, should be used against us or against the Public Service of the Commonwealth.",25
46,Mr MAXWELL,WHEAT FO RHOM E,The £221 highest wage fixed at the present time.,25
47,Mr RYAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"But it is not as high, if I am rightly informed, as the amount recommended in the report handed by the Basic Wage Commission to the Governor General, which is now under consideration by the Government.",25
48,Mr MAXWELL,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"If the report of Basic Wage Commission is adopted, the blind workers will benefit to that extent. That is provided for in - the Bill",25
49,Mr RYAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,No .,25
50,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"Yes , if the of the Basic Wage Commission be adopted.",25

They may not the motion. introduce legislation to adopt it .

Perhaps the Treasurer would give an assurance that will be done ?'",25
52,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT FO RHOM E,I certainly will do so in connection with a Bill of this kind.,25
53,Mr RYAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"I am sure the Treasurer's long experience in Parliament will convince him that, merely as a precautionary measure, I am amply justified in bringing this matter up even in connection with this Bill , seeing that the decision of the Committee today in regard to the amount specified in this B i ll may be used as an argument against the acceptance of the amount recommended by the Basic Wage Commission.",25

55,Mr RYAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"I am not using the Bill for the purpose of furthering my own ends; but I do not propose to remain silent when the Government are doing something which I think they ought not to do. I think they are doing wrong when they are getting the approval of this Committee for the payment of a standard of £ 2 2 1 , when they have already an amount of £ 5 16s. approved by the Basic Wage Commission.",25
56,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"That is to say, that you claim the Government are playing tricks with the blind men.",25
57,Mr RYAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"I do not put it that way; but I think you want to get the approval is the of this Committee to a payment of £ 2 2 1 , when you have in your possession a recommendation for a much larger amount.",25

72,Mr FENTON,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"E very one recognises that the Bill confers a great benefit upon the blind. Whatever our political animus may be, we cannot accuse one another of being divided in respect to conferring a well-merited advantage upon a deserving section of the community, but the sum of £221 is mentioned in the Bill , whereas the basic wage will be nearly £300.",26

Perhaps a little persuasion might induce him to give the in formation desired. I understand that the contention of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Ryan) is that, although £221 is the standard wage at the present time, at some f u t u re time when we may be dealing with the basic wage, we may be accused of having given only £221 to the blind.",26
75,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEAT FO RHOM E,The member quite misunderstands the position. The honourable member for West Sydney suspects me of using this Bill as a means of fixing the basic wage.,26

When the Treasurer was in Opposition he used every endeavour to corner the Government on matters simi* lar to this, and I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was acting quite within his province in the query he submitted. At any rate, he was quite right in contending that the fact that £221 is set down in this Bill as the standard wage today should not be binding upon us when later on we come to deal with the basic wage.",26

81,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"Maranoa) [3.40]. - I aim' sure that the Government have made a very serious mistake in introducing this measure as an Immigration Bill . It is really an Immigration Restriction Bill . Every amendment of the principal Act which it proposes imposes some restriction upon immigration. U n der this Bill a person may be suffering fro m any disease whatever, but so long as he pays a first-class passage he can came to Australia; while persons who desire to come here under the provisions of this so-called Immigration Bill must undergo a medical examination by an officer of the Commonwealth at the port honourable of embarkation, and must answer a series of questions,some of which are outrageous. An intending immigrant, for instance, may be asked whether he has been insane within the last five years, or whether he has twice been insane during that period. I have never heard that any one who has been insane is willing to admit it after he has recovered.",26
82,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEAT FO RHOM E,Insane' .people often think other persons insane.,27
83,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"That is so, and a man might be forgiven for thinking that the Minister who could propose that an intending immigrant should be asked such a question must himself be insane. Honourable members will need to be very careful in the consideration of this Bill : We liave recently been at war with several European countries, and the subjects of those countries are to be excluded from, the benefits of this measure for twenty years, which practically amounts to the exclusion from Australia of subjects of those countries who are yet unborn. Sub-paragraph ge of clause 3 provides that the following persons may be excluded from the benefits of this measureFor the period of five years after the commencement of this paragraph, and thereafter until ' the Governor General by proclamation otherwise determines, any person who, in the opinion of an officer, is of German, AustroGerman, Bulgarian or Hungarian parentage and nationality, or is a Turk of Ottoman race.  said twenty years.",27

86,Mr JAMESPAGE,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"I am referring to the matter only incidentally. I people of these countries are well conofficials, ducted and of good character, why should we not admit them ?

89,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"This measure should be called an Alien Restriction Bill , because that is what it really is. Under paragraph d of the proposed new section 8A it is provided thatWhere the Minister is satisfied that, within three years after the arrival in Australia of a person who was not born in Australia, that person(<i) is a person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established. Government of the Commonwealth, or any State, or of any other civilized country* or of all forms of law, or who is opposed to organized government, or who advocates the assassination of public officials, or who advocates or teaches the unlawful destruction of property, or who is a member of or affiliated with any organization which teaches any of the doctrines and practices specified in this paragraph, 1 he may, by notice in writing, summon the person to appear before a Board within the time in the manner prescribed to show cause why he should not be deported from the Commonwealth. Twenty years ago the Minister for Home  himself have been called to account under that provision. I have heard him advof cating the overthrow of some of these and I have helped to do it myself. We are not natives of this country, and if we left Australia' at any time we might be prevented under the Bill from This is one of the rottenest Bills that was ever introduced into this House. It s purpose appears to be merely to impose all kinds of restrictions upon people I have no wish to see people who are anarchists, want to overthrow Governments, or who wil l not obey the Government of the tracountry when they are here, coming to but surely this House Avill not agree to such "" drag-net"" provisions as contained in this Bill to prevent i m migration. The words used in the parais or who advocates or teaches the unlawful f destruction of property, or who is a member or affiliated with any organization which teaches any of the doctrines and practices as the specified in this paragraphmay be construed in a thousand different ways to keep certain people out of this country. This is specially a Bill to deal with in Committee; but my purpose has been to direct attention to the necessity for its very careful consideration.",27
90,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT FO RHOM E," I must again ask the honourable member not to debate particular clauses in detail. He has himself out that this is a Commitee Bill, and in Committee he can deal with the various clauses in extenso.",28
91,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEAT FO RHOM E,Surely I can make a reference to the clauses!,28
92,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"An incidental reference only. The honourable member is not entitled to dissect and discuss the different clauses of the Bill on the motion for the second reading. In Committee, every opportunity is given for debating clauses separately and in detail.",28
93,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"What I am most concerned about is that we should get back to normal conditions as soon as possible. I remind the Government that in the Aliens Immigratio n Restriction Act they have all the powers that are necessary to enable them to exclude any undesirable person from Australia. Why such powers should be provided for in an Immigratio n Bill is beyond me. Under the Bill it is proposed that the Minister may appoint a Board to determine whether certain persons who were not born in Australia shall be deported from the Commonwealth. From the decision of this Tribunal there is to be no appeal. From my own knowledge of Boards that have been appointed by other Governments, I say, "" God help the man who hopes to get justice from the Tribunal which is here proposed ! "" The Board will merely reflect the views of the Minister. I should like to know whether it will sit openly as a Court, or whether it will adopt star chamber methods. Its proceed'ngs most certainly ousfht to be onen to the public. In Committee, I shall do my best to insure that an accused person may be afforded an opportunity of cross-examining his accusers and of being properly defended.",28
94,Mr MAXWELL,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"Fawkner) [3.53] Generally speaking, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) objects to this Bill on account of the stringency of its provisions. I have been looking through our immigration laws from 19&1 to date, and I find that every amending Bill brought forward has been in the direction of making those laws more stringent. I was quite astonished to discover that in the.Act of 1912, which was introduced by the party to which the honElliot orable member belongs, every provision is as drastic as possible, especially in regard to matters of health. pointed Mr JAMES PAGE - I say that we do not want unhealthy people here.",28
95,Mr MAXWELL,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"E x a c t l y . We dp not want in Australia people who have either unhealthy bodies or unhealthy minds. The result of admitting the latter class might be to subvert our government - I cannot understand how the honourable member for Maranoa can consistently oppose the proposals which are embodied in this Bill . I quite agree that the measure is chiefly one for consideration in Committee. But there are one or two matters connected with it to which I desire to direct attention. I - think that some definite meaning should attach to every clause in an Act of Parliament. In paragraph 6 of clause 3 of the Bill , it is proposed to amend section 3 of the principal Act by inserting after paragraph ge the following paragraph: (gd) any person who advocates the overthrow, by force, or by violence, of the established government of the Commonwealth, or of any State, or of any other civilized country, or of all forms of law. One can understand thei use of those words, because they are very definite. Any person who advocates the things mentioned in that paragraph ought to be regarded as an undersirable immigrant, and ought to be excluded from the Commonwealth. But my objection is to the inclusion of the words immediately following, namely, "" or who is opposed to organized government."" I cannot support the retention of such words in a Bill of this character. There are many persons who come into the country, and who are known as "" philosophic anarchists ""-me n who do not believe in any form of government whatever. If they hold these views, the Bill provides that they are to be kept out of Australia. But it will first be necessary to ascertain who they are. I can quite understand the exclusion of persons who advocate a certain course of action which is detrimental to the best interests of the Commonwealth. But it would be absolutely futile to attempt to deal with people who hold, theoretical views in regard to forms of government. Committee, therefore, I shall move for the exclusion of those words. I think that clause .7 of the Bill is also capable of amendment, but I shall not deal with that matter now.",28
96,Mr MCWILLIAM S,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"Franklin) [3.57]. - I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) that, to a very large extent, this is an I m m i gration Restriction Bill . I am one of those who think that there are two aspects to the question of immigration. Australia is in dire need of immigrants.  whom it is proposed to exclude from the Commonwealth would the member admit?",29
97,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"We should absolutely prohibit the introduction of undesirables. I go all the way with the Government in that matter. If honourable members will take the trouble to read the up-to-date history of the United States, they will find that American writers are pointing out that the influx of undesirables into the country during the past twenty-five years is creating a difficulty quite as formidable as is the negro question there. Whilst the. immigration to the United States for many years was of a desirable class, it is recognised by all American students and writers that, during the past quarter of a century at least, there has been an immigration into that country of a class which is wholly undesirable. We do not want that class here. I go farther and say to any person who is not satisfied with this country, "" There is an open world before y o u . "" Even at the risk of being misunderstood, I think that we are. too severe upon the Germans here. I have always understood that when a war was over the British race regarded it as a thing of the past. Take any two ordinary Britishers, whether they be English, Irish, Scotch, Canadians, or Australians, and if they have a fight it will not be later than the second Saturday when one of them will say to the other, "" Well, old fellow, it was a good ' go.' .Come and have a drink.""",29
98,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"That is a queer view to express, seeing that Australia lost 60,000 dead in the recent war.",29
99,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"It must be admitted that, before the war, in every [274]- 2 State of Australia, the German was reIn garded as a good settler. In Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania the Germans possess one great virtue in that they do not hang about our citiss. Most of them went into the country, carved out homes for themselves, and made the best of settlers. If . I had to make my choice between German settlers of a desirable class and some of these who were our Allies in the last war, I would take the Germans.",29
100,Mr FENTON,WHEAT FO RHOM E,Every time.,29
101,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEAT FO RHOM E,I say that even at the risk of being misunderstood.,29
102,Mr MAXWELL,WHEAT FO RHOM E,Y o u mean that you would rather take a good German than honourable a poor type of man from another country,29
103,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"Yes . We must have immigration in Australia. There is no question about that. The figures concerning the position in the far north are startling. If we draw a line from Cairns across Queensland to the Northern Territory and Western Australia, we would find that there had been an absolute decrease of from 25,000 to 30,000 white people since Federation in the very localities that constitute the weakest spot in our armour. I wae pleased to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), say the other day that immigration was to be one of the foremost planks in the new Goverument policy;.but I make the reservation that we must be extremely careful not to admit to this country people who are likely to be a source of danger to it . A f t e r such a war as that through which we have passed there is likely to be an exodus of undesirables from the underworld of Europe, and it is only reasonable to provide against their entry into Australia. There is not one clause in the Bill that I regard as too stringent in this respect. We can breed quite enough criminals of our own without allowing undesirables from abroad to enter the Commonwealth. F hope the Government policy in this matter will be rigorously enforced.",29
104,Mr FENTON,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"Maribyrnong) [4.5] I agree with the remarks made by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell) in the exception which he has taken to the words "" or who is opposed fco organized government,"" as applied to immigrants to be regarded as undesirables under this Bill . It seems to me that a certain number of words have been supplied to the Draftsman by the Prime M in ister and that a number of placards have been placed in the Bill .  American law.",29
105,Mr FENTON,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"We find the words "" assassination "" and "" the overthrow ""by for c e "" of a Government, and other catchy phrases applied to persons - who are looked ufjon as undesirables. These words are only so many placards intended to alarm some people, and to induce support for the measure. They are not necessary at all. Will the Minister affirm that we have no law to deal with any person who attempts the assassination of any public official or, indeed, anybody else? We have the Crimes Act, and a number of other Acts, to meet every situation that may arise. This Bill is merely a duplication of existing legislation; it is merely an advertisement suggesting that we have been neglecting to take these reasonable precautions in former legislation, and that the country is open to the ravages of the worse classes of individual to be found.  of the measure introduced by Mr Glynn last year.",30
106,Mr FENTON,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"The Minister knows that what I say is in accordance with fact. Under this Bill , any persons who assembled to discuss their grievances after the passing of such a Bill as the Coercion Act by the Irvine Government would be guilty of an unlawful act, and perhaps charged with attempting to destroy organized government. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) knows what happened in the eighties and nineties in Queensland. Every man who stood up for unionism in those days would, under this law, be regarded as opposed to organized government, and probably gaoled.",30
107,Mr WEST,WHEAT FO RHOM E,O r deported.,30
108,Mr FENTON,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"Yes , or deported. It might happen, if this Bill becomes law, that if a man says anything about those in power, his words will be construed as opposed to organized government, and he might be deported. I agree with the honourable member for Franklin (Mr . MCWilliams), that the outstanding trait of the British character is a desire to shake hands with an enemy after a fight. There may be many undesirables in Germany and Austria, just as there are undsirables in Australia; but because of this are we going to declare, in respect of the the 70,000,000 people in Germany, that simply because they happen to be of German origin they are to be regarded as undesirables, so far as our immigration policy is concerned? What would have been the result if this policy had been adopted with respect to the Boers? The first Boer War was fought with great bitterness, particularly on the part of the Dutch in . South A f r i c a , but after the second war the British Government magnanimously extended to the South A f r i c an Republics a full measure of constitutional liberty, with the result that today one of the greatest champions of the British Empire is General Smuts, and some of the most stalwart upholders of British law are to be found amongst the conquered Boers. I am not saying that - we should find just that kind of feeling amongst the people of Germany today; but 1 believe thousands of Germans would be glad to get away from their own country, and, if permitted to come to Australia, 1 would prove very desirable citizens. It is better to have those people here,- and to make them good fellowcitizens, so that some day, if it should be necessaiy, they might help us to defend their adopted country. . It is betiter, too, to have them here rather than 'that our great spaces should remain empty. S'ome of our most successful settlers, whose work has provided fine object lessons to all, are those who came here from Germany, or are of German origin. True, some of them allowed their racial feelings to get the better of their discretion during the war. But are we to remember that against them for all time? What did our soldiers do with their German enemies whom they took prisoner in the very heat of the fiercest days of the war, when it even seemed that the tide had turned against us ? Did our troops adopt any such policy of hostility as is displayed in this measure? It has been recorded over and over again that,""even in those worse days, our boys would take their prisoners back behind the-lines, and dispense their own comforts among them. They called them "" F r it z , "" and gave them cigarettes. If our soldiers were prepared to fraternize in the midst of war, why should not the Government display a little of that same spirit now that the war is over, and we are on the right side of it? This measure is, without doubt, au Immigration Restriction Bill . It ought not to have been given the title, "" Immigration Bill . "" Indications at present are that, as an outcome of the Geneva Conference, the Germans will be admitted to the League of Nations. Even if such should not be the case, I venture to predict that, before two years have passed, Germany will be represented in the League. sincerely hope so, for the safety and well-being of the world. What do the Government say in their Bill , however? For five years they propose to exclude all Germans, and Austrians, and Turks, and Bulgarians. What will be the feeling of the world at large five years hence if all that we hope for from the League of Nations has been brought about, and our former enemies are firmly at peace with us? Why should we shut our doors for so. long to desirable classes of new citizens? Should we not throw our doors open wide to the type of people we want ? I do not .advocate for one moment that we should offer a welcome to the off-scourings of the world. In the United States of America, numbers of undesirables have undoubtedly found their homes there; and the same may be said, to a large extent, of Britain . It was written of London, before the war, that the heart of the Empire had become a sanctuary for all the disaffected people of Europe; They had had to flee from their own country because they did not believe in the system of government existing there.",30
109,Mr WEST,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"And their views, in instances, were correct.",31
110,Mr FENTON,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"They were. Reviewing legislation of this sort, one would think we were still in the midst of the great conflict, and had no knowledge of what its end might be. I do not see the necessity for this Bill . We have laws to deal with every class of offence mentioned therein. We complain every week of the costly growth of Federal . Departments; but if we pass unnecessary legislation, we assist in building up Departments still higher. If , with our present laws, we are adequately safeguarded, why should the Government introduce this Bill? It only supplies more work for more officials, and adds to the size and expense of one or other of the Federal Departments. Do the Government know or fear that people are actually endeavouring to get into this country witli the object of assassinating the Ministry, or in the hope of overthrowing the present form of government? If they have reason to expect, anything of the sort, have we not already enough' laws to cope with the menace? I realise that Australia would be just as safe if this measure did not become law.",31
111,Mr BAYLE Y,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"Oxley) [4.20] - The honourable member who has just resumed I his seat, and other honourable members who preceded him , have regarded this Bill as of a restrictive character rather than one to encourage immigration; but I take it that it would be a very difficult matter for this, or any other Government, to frame a Bill which would be the means of increasing the number of immigrants coming to Australia. It is true that we need men and women in Australia, but we require men and women of the right type, and they can only be secured by reserving to ourselves the right to say who shall be admitted.",31

114,Mr BAYLEY,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), in a speech a few days ago, compared the results in America with those of Australia, and quoted figures to show how the many United States of America had increased her population on an average of 1,000,000 a year for some considerable time past. The honourable member, however, overlooked the fact that emigration to America has been carried out almost entirely by individuals or corporations, and the two principal agents were the shipping companies, on one hand, and the railway companies on the other. These commercial organizations had not the in terests of America at heart, and simply endeavoured to get the largest possible number in order to benefit their shareholders. The railway companies were anxious to secure the services of men for construction work as cheaply as possible, and nowhere else could they be more easily obtained than in the crowded cities of Europe. The companies sent their agents to Europe to obtain men, many of whom were of a highly undesirable type. On the other hand, the steam-ship companies merely sought to fill their steersufficiently age berths with passengers, and when once they landed them on Ellis Island, their responsibility and interest ceased. As a result, America is today suffering from many ills from which she would have been saved if she had sought to guard herself as we are doing, by passing a measure of this character. It is true, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) said, that many of the vernment people who flocked to America were of highly desirable type; but that was i earlier days of immigration, when only people with courage and perseverance would leave the land of their 'birth and LO out and blaze the trail in the wilderI ness. Later, emigrants went from Central and Northern Europe to America, i total ignorance of the conditions prelieve vailing, and they depended solely upon the information that was given them the paid agents of the steam-ship and railEnglish way companies. They landed in great cities, and it was from that source that the shops and factories obtained their labour. They were used as a means reducing wages, and I am sure we do want that type of immigrant here. We are in need of desirable immigrants are not anxious to settle in the cities, who are prepared to go on to our vacant spaces and develop the country. There room for people in all walks of life Australia, and it is far better that should obtain 25,000 or 50,000 a year of he could not the right type than we should throw open wide the doors and admit all and like sundry, regardless of whether their comtheir ing here would be for the good of Ausopposition tralia or not. I congratulate the Governthey ment upon having introduced this B i and I can assure them that it will have my hearty support.",31
115,Mr WEST,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"East Sydney) [4.27] The honourable member for Oxley (Mr . Bayley) has doubtless expressed opinion be gained during a cursory t r to America. If the honourable member will peruse the immigration laws of the legislation of this character. United States, he will find that the restrictions are very severe, because insane persons, or those suffering from diseases, are not permitted to land in America. close perusal of the Act passed by this Parliament in 1912 will show that it lows closely the American law, and, as mentioned by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), our 1912 A ct is severe. The Bill we are now discussing is doubtless based upon the feeling of hatred and revenge that arose during the recent war, and is intended to prevent the landing in this country of those people who were our enemies, aud safeof those who hold different views as to our for m of government. If we had not any immigration restriction law there might be some justification for the Gointroducing a Bill of this kind. a In 1912, when the Government of the day n the introduced an Immigration Restriction Bill , honourable members opposite di d their best to prevent it from becoming law, because they considered it too severe. am strongly in favour of undesirable immigrants being prevented from settling n in the Commonwealth, but I do not bei n adopting the measures suggested by the Government. The Bill , which by appears to have been copied from the Act, provides for the appointment of a Board' to decide such cases as may come before it . If this measure had been law a few years ago, .1 venture to for say that there are many of our most not valuable citizens who would have been .prevented from landing in the Commonwho wealth. I do not know whether I but would not have been kept out of the country. In the land of my b i r t h , is we were always proud of the fact that in if a man conducted himself properly, we and obeyed the laws of the country, be interfered with. In my young days I saw in London men Thiers and Garibaldi, who had left own country because they were in to its for m of government; but were none the worse for that, and l l , did not make undesirable citizens of Great Britain . Under the Bill a person might be refused admission to Australia who. was dissatisfied with the present Coalition Government of Great Britain . the Mr MAXWELL - To what part of the ip Bill does the honourable member object?",32
116,Mr WEST,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"I am entirely opposed to There is no need for the Bill , because the Immigration Restriction Act contains all the provisions needed to keep out undesirable A persons. iShould such persons evade the Act, and get into Australia, they could folbe punished if they subsequently disobeyed the laws of the country. This is panic legislation. T e t I know that I am wasting my time in objecting to it, because whatever is introduced by the Government will be passed by its supporters. The noble ideals of the nation from which we sprung are entirely ignored. I would like the Government, in this instance, to follow the example of Great Britain. Under the Bill an Irishman who proved a reformer, and since whose day the question has been a burning one in all parts of the world, would have been denied admission to Australia. Sir Henry Parkes, who had to leave England to save himself from getting into trouble with the Government there, would not have been allowed to land in Australia. The Government will be well advised if they let this measure be numbered with the slaughtered innocents of the session. Mr Laird SMITH,-'Do you think that the unrestricted admission of aliens into the East End of London was to the advantage of the British workmen?",32
117,Mr WEST,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"My honourable friend is as ignorant about that matter as a baby. It was the employing class, which is the class behind this Government, that brought the Poles and other cheap labour to England, where they lodged under conditions which, as a young man, it broke my heart to see; and I did my best to put an end to what was going on. The matter, however, is one which I cannot discuss now. 1 protest against the Bill as absolutely unnecessary. The community is already protected against the admission of insane and diseased persons. Indeed, the objection taken to the measure of 1912, while it was under discussion, was that it followed too much on the lines of the American immigration legislation. The Bill does not accord with the noble spirit of the Australians, and will interfere with the progress of the country.",33
118,Mr RYAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"West Sydney) [4.38] With the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West), Maranoa (Mr James Page), Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), and others who have spoken from this side of the Chamber, I am of opinion that the Bill is evidence that the policy of the Government is to restrict liberty as far as possible. I do not think that the Minister has shown that the existing immigration restriction law is not sufficient to k*op our population of the character that we desire it to be. This measure seems the result of a panic that has overtaken the Government, judging by the manner in which some of its clauses are framed. Some of these provisions have been referred to by previous speakers, and it is not my intention to reiterate their arguments, though I desire to endorse them, and more particularly the comments of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) with regard to the provision dealing with those opposed to organized government""- a very vague term.",33
119,Mr WEST,WHEAT FO RHOM E,Unde r that provision a single taxer might be kept out of Australia.,33
120,Mr RYAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"That is so. It would depend largely on the character of the Administration in office as to what persons would be refused admission to Australia. That observation applies generally to immigration laws. Much depends on the manner in which they are administered, and that, again, depends largely on the character of the Government in power. Some of the clauses of the Bill are too drastic, and I hope that the Minister will show his willingness to have them amended in Committee.",33
121,Mr WEST,WHEAT FO RHOM E,He will not alter a line of the Bill.,33
122,Mr RYAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"We may get him in an amiable mood, and he may be able to see matters less severely than he did when the measure was being considered by the Cabinet. The Bill provides that persons from the countries with which we were recently at war shall be prohibited immigrants for a period of five years, and for such further period as may be proclaimed by the Governor General in Council. That is too drastic a provision. I understand that in the United Kingdom the period fixed is only three years. Why should Australia be more restrictive than Great Britain in regard to immigrants from former enemy countries? The views of the present Government are too drastic, and, I think, do not meet with the approval of the majority of Australians. In my opinion, the Prime Minister is the chief offender. He seems to have a rooted hatred of our former enemies, which is reflected in this legislation. The Government is too secretive as to its policy concerning countries with which we have lately been at war. Ita views regarding trade with those countries are not in accordance with those of the majority of our population, and are not sensible views. Our commodities will pass from Australia to those countries, just as their products will reach us, whether we trade directly with them or not. Mr WEEHTHOT,T - What Great B r it a in does should be a good guide for us.",33
123,Mr RYAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"'Grea t Britain's legislation may be a good guide for us in this matter. We are too restrictive. From what I have heard from persons who have recently been in Great B r it a in and Prance, th3 policy of this Government in regard to trading with former enemy countries is, on the other side of the world, considered ridiculous. It victimizes our own people by enabling persons in what were neutral countries, and in other countries as well, to set up as middlemen, and make profits at our expense. Why should we prohibit immigration from the Central European countries for a period of five years, if Great Britain says that a period of three years is long enough? I rose mainly to protest against the generally narrow, restrictive policy of the Government concerning generally, and more particularly the immigration of people of the countries with which we have recently been at war. We might, with advantage to Australia, modify the provisions of the Bill , with a view to restoring those friendly relations which, I am sure, we all desire to see full y restored sooner or later. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 33. Section 3 of the principal Act is amended(6) by inserting after paragraph {gc) the following paragraphs:"" (gd) any person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth or of any State or of any other civilized country or of all forms of law, or who posed to organized government, or who advocates the assassination of public ofncials or who advocates teaches the unlawful destruction of property, or who is a member of or affiliated with any organization which entertains and teaches any of the doctrines and practices specified in this paragraph; (ge) for the period of five years after , the commencement of this paragraph, and thereafter until the Governor General by proclamation otherwise determines, any person who in the opinion of an officer is of German, Austro-German, Bulgarian or Hungarian parentage and nationality, or is a Turk of Ottoman race; "" (gf) any person who in the opinion of an officer is not under the age of sixteen years, and who, on demand by an officer, fails to prove that he is the holder of a passport- ' (i) which was issued to him by and on behalf of the Imperial Government or any Government recognised by the Imperial Government; (ii) which contains a personal description sufficient to identify him and to which is attached a photograph of him; and (iii) which is still in force; and "" (gg) any person who has been deported in pursuance of any Act; "".",34

We have already a very big population of settlers, originally from Germany, and their descendants down to the thir d and fourth generation. These people are naturalized, have made their home amongst us, and we now look upon them-at all events I do-as fellow Australians, l t may happen that the nearest relative of a small orphan boy or girl living in Germany, where there has been a heavy death-roll during the last few years, is a naturalized settler in Australia, and that the natural guardian here would like to bring that orphan to Australia. No doubt the Minister has had such cases brought under his notice. I do not want any harsh restrictions to be put in the way of such a child being brought to Australia, where the natural guardians desire it , in order that it may is op- be looked after, and become, eventually, one of our fellow citizens.  or dealt with specially. I have some cases of a similar kind now before Cabinet.",34

Opposition We understand that in June next there will be an Imperial Conference, when, doubt, legislation dealing with the war period, and post-war period, will be cussed. It may then be found that difposing ferent portions of the Empire have legislating on different lines subject. I agree that uniformity, as far as practicable, is desirable; and, instead of our trying to prove ourselves more British than the British at Home, I we should be erring on the right side, at all, if we fixed the period at three I see no particular virtue in five years for this purpose. True it is that we all desire, first of all, people of our own kith and kin as immigrants; but if there are others desirous of coming to this country, why should they not be permitted to do so after the lapse of three years? It is quite likely that one of the instructions from the Imperial Conference will be that legislation should tend to uniformity as far as possible; and no doubt South Africa and Canada will follow the British example. Should that be so, and we pass this Hill as it stands, we shall find Australia standing alone.  placed no limit at all.",37

I am afraid that responsible British Ministers will laugh at us If the for passing such drastic legislation. If the Government were suddenly to declare that this Bill was unnecessary, and withdrew it, I should sleep just as calmly tonight as I did last night. Is the Minister bound by a Cabinet decision, perhaps arrived at by a small majority? Surely after free and open discussion of the matter, and after the intelligence of the has been brought to bear upon it, a Cabinet decision should not prevent the Minister from consenting to alter the no Bill. We are all desirous of improving it. I would improve it out of existence disif I oould; but here we are simply proto go no further than the British been Government have done. Is the Ministei on the same still adamant ? ",37
155,Mr FENTON,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"The Minister is evidently attempting to pose as a strong think man; but, in my opinion, a strong man if would admit that the arguments put for years. ward from both sides were unanswerable and irrefutable, and would be prepared to concede a request that this legislation should be brought into conformity with that of Great Britain .",37
156,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"Batman) [ 5 . 1 8 ] do not propose to delay the Committee ; but as I did not avail myself of the opportunity to discuss the peneral question of immigration on the second reading of the Bill , I take this opportunity of registering my opposition to the general principle underlying the B i ll as embodied in the clause now under consideration. It is pretty clearly recognised that the crying need of Australia is a rapidly-increasing population, - and, indeed, upon this question rests our whole national well-being, as well as the White Australia policy, which is so very dear to the hearts of the people of this country. But as long as the present Government is in power, we do not ""deserve to have a White Australia, and if the people persist in returning to this House men of the type we have in this Ministry, we cannot hope to retain it . The maintenance of a Whit e Australia clearly depends upon the populating of the country by white men. If we are not prepared to use this continent in a sane way, we cannot expect for an indefinite series of decades to exclude the peoples of other races, whether they are at present pleasing to us or not. It is peculiarly germane to the consideration of this clause to note that Senator Millen is now at Geneva, taking part in a Conference under the League of Nations, discussing what our attitude immediate future will be towards those who havs recently been our enemies, and at war with us, and cussing the whole of the present day international problems, as' they present themselves to the representatives of the nations assembled at the Conference. Whatever is done there in the name of Australia may vitally affect immigration. Anything which tends to make us ridiculous or unpopular in the eyes of friendly, or unfriendly, nations will react on us in the matter of populating this great continent. Therefore, I am very sorry to see that Senator Millen is apparently among those reactionaries who want to carry on the deliberations of the Conference in accordance with the wornout and discredited practices of secret diplomacy-in the dark-and to notice also that he is likely to be among those who are persistenly opposed, two years after the war, to the admission to the League of Nations of those with whom we have recently been at war. Coming more closely to the purpose of this clause, - I I find that we propose to pursue an utterly foolish, and, in my eyes, malignant, vendetta against our late enemies, by preventing, for a period of five years, the admission into Australia of any of the citizens of those various belligerent countries. Already, under our White Australia policy, we have excluded millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, on the ground of colour- I am not attacking the policy-but , when we follow it up by excluding millions of highly civilized, efficient, and, on general principles, desirable immigrants from Central Europe, then, as I said at the beginning, whether we can retain a White Australia or not, we do not deserve it-unde r such conditions. The Minister has admitted that ou this matter he is adamant. I am well aware that, by what I have said in this House more than once in regard to what our attitude should be towards these belligerent nations, I have not made friends, either politically, personally, or in any other way. It has not been a pleasant task; it has not been a vote catching policy on my part; but I have felt it to be a public duty to declare (hat it is worse than folly to be pursuing this policy of creating and maintaining so long after the war a spirit of hate among the nations. That is what this of the legislation amounts to. It is only a policy of revenge. It is no safeguard. It is not put forward for our acceptance on dis- the ground that there is any real, special danger in admitting those with whom we last fought, any more than there would be in admitting those with whom we fought before we fought those with whom we recently fought. For, at one time or another we have fought them all and cursed them all. We are a fighting race, as our friends opposite are so f o n d ' of boasting, and. later on, if our friends of the International Labour party do not prevent it , we shall be fighting again. We shall be turning all our weapons of poisonous propaganda against a new race and a new nation altogether. The whole thing is absurd. Nay, it is worse than absurd; it is tragic. All that one can do, sitting as a member of a party which is in a minority, is to rise in his place whenever the occasion demands it , and protest against it . The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) proposes to l i m it the period of exclusion to three years. Seeing that it is impossible to break down the determination of the Government to have some measure of exclusion, the honourable member naturally contends that at least we should not pursue the matter further, or put ourselves in a more invidious position, than the British Government proposes to do. The truth is, of course, that in all this international hate-mongering, which has been so evident throughout the world, Australia has always led the way, even as against the British Government. That Government has at least shown that it possesses a much jus ter conception of what is desirable amongst the nations.",38
157,Mr WEST,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"He a r , hear! I am proud of my nation for that.",39
158,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"The honourable member is so far, at least, right. As a rule, in this matter, or in kindred matters, the British Government has set us an example which, if not a really good one, is one by comparison which we might have followed, but which we have not followed. I should be very glad indeed if this absurd restriction were removed altogether. A f t e r five years of blood and slaughter, and two years of the so-called peace which has followed after the signing of the armistice; after the declaration of peace, and the final ratification of it , T c-hould - be very glad to think that our Government really meant what it said when it declared that we were at peace with the world so far as it could make it so, or that, at all events, it proposed-it cannot be contended that there is peace in the world, because there is not;-officiall y and formally, as far as possible, to create a state of peace among those between wham' this tragic war has been going on for so long.

160,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"This foolish, absurd, and illogical barrier ought now to be thrown down. Our ports should be opened to decent men, good colonists, law-abiding people. We want such men here in all their numbers. I do not say that undesirable degenerates should be admitted.  was prepared to throw down all barriers and let them come in and take this country.",39
161,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"I never rise in my place to speak without discovering that if the Minister for Home and Territories happens to be at the table, and finds himself incapable of, or unwilling to, make a rejoinder which is logical, reasonable, or justified by the facts, he. is always to be depended on to make some incorrect and insulting observation. He knows that what he has just said is quite alien to the facts. Not very long ago I had occasion to require him to withdraw in this Chamber a similarly insulting observation. There is, however, always this advantage in saying that kind of t h in g: It is a passport to the votes of the class of persons from whom the Minister derives his right to sit in this Chamber. His interjection is circulated amongst his constituents, and the persons on his side who return ham to this Parliament will continue to do so so long as he says that kind of thing. It meets with no favour from' the people who return Labour men to this House, and, who believe in a policy of international justice. I am not in favour of admitting undesirables or degenerates into this country. Neither am I in favour of artificial barriers being raised against the admission of persons against whom no just objection can be urged. We are now discussing a particular aspect of the clause, but I am opposed to the whole of it . It raises barriers against persons who advocate the overthrow, by force or violence, of - the established government of the Commonwealth or of any State, or of any other civilized country or of all forms of law, or who advocate the overthrow of organized government. Of course, I believe that persons who are in favour of - the overthrow of government by force should get busy by force, and not bother talking about it .",39
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHEAT FO RHOM E," I remind the honourable member that the Committee has already dealt with that point, and he should confine his remarks to the amendment.",39
163,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT FO RHOM E,"V e r y well. The amendment proposes to reduce the period of exclusion to three years. It is all that we are likely to obtain, if , indeed, we are to' secure even that concession, and I hope that the Committee will at least go that far in removing these absurd barriers. Progress reported. NA Bill presented (by Mr HUGHES ) , and read a first time. SECOND READING.",39
164,Mr HUGHES,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [5.35] -(B y leave) - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will recall that on several occasions expression has been given to a desire that' the Wa r Precautions Act should be repealed. Speaking recently, after making some more or less flippant observations about the K i ng of Hungary, I said that I trusted that peace with Hungary would be ratified, and that the proclamation repealing the Wa r Precautions Act would then issue, or failing that, that legislation would be introduced by which the Act would be repealed. Siuce then Hungary has ratified the Treaty of Peace; but the essential preliminaries to the automatic repeal of the Act by proclamation having been delayed, the Government has introduced this Bil L Clause 2 of theB ill repeals the War Precaution's Act, and the Bill proceeds to make statutory provision to deal with certain matters over which the Commonwealth must still necessarily exercise authority. I shall endeavour to explain .those as shortly as possible. The first is coal. The War Precautions Coal Regulations comprised in the Statutory Rules set out in clause 3 of the Bill will continue in force. This is essential in order that the Commonwealth may still exercise that control over coal which is desirable, and without which, indeed, the award recently made would be of little, if any, avail. It is necessary in order that we may exercise during the transition period that con trol over the distribution of coal that some of the States of the Commonwealth deem to be essential until they are themselves ready to take over control of the matter. Clause 4 deals with wharfs, and prescribes that Statutory Rule No. 79 dealing with wharfs shall remain in force. Clause 5 gives authority to the Commonwealth to do all those things in connection with wheat and other primary products to which this House has from time to time given its approval. W it h out its authority it would be impossible BILL. for us to do our part in connection with the Wheat Pool, and to provide machinery for advancing the guarantee, and to make arrangements with the banks in regard thereto. It is proposed to extend this power of control, not only to wheat, but to all primary products. It may be necessary to take similar action in regard to the control of other things than wheat, and, if so, this clause wili give the Government power, subject to the approval of Parliament from time to time, to do so. Clause 6 deals with companies, firms and businesses. Honourable members are aware that for some considerable time past the Commonwealth has compelled companies desiring to register in this country, or companies registered here desiring to secure new capital, to obtain the approval of the Treasurer. The clause applies only to foreign companies, or companies whose shares are held by persons other than natural-born British subjects, or whose principal operations are outside the Commonwealth. In all such cases, the consent of the Treasurer is required for the issue of capital, for the disposal of assets in foreign countries, or the removal of the registration of a company from Australia to another country. Companies in which aliens have more than a one-third interest, are not to be allowed, without consent, to acquire a mine, or carry on a mining or metallurgical business, nor is an alien to be allowed, without the consent in writin g of the Treasurer, to acquire any share in an Australian company. All this, I think, is very necessary, and it is merely the continuation of a policy that has been in force for .some years. I come now to clause 7, which deals with an entirely different matter. This clause is designed to prevent the entry into the Commonwealth of disloyal and disaffected persons. An officer may require any person before he is permitted to land in the Commonwealth to make and subscribe an oath or affirmation in the for m set out in the schedule to the Bill , which reads as follows:I , A. B., do swear that I will be faithful, and bear true allegiance to the King, and will loyally as in duty bound uphold the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia established under the Crown of the United Kingdom. So help me God ! No doubt there is room for a difference of opinion upon this matter, but it is surely fitting and proper that the Commonwealth should have the right to exclude persons whose object is to stir up disloyalty, and to create disaffection amongst the citizens of the Commonwealth. An y person who is suspected of having that design will be required to take that oath. If he does not take it , he will be deported. If , having taken the oath, he is found by a competent tribunal to have violated it . he will also be deported. The next clause deals with unlawful assemblies, and. is designed to give statutory effect to those War Precautions regulations which were introduced some years ago, for the prevention of - crowds assembling within the precincts, and within the immediate neighbourhood of this Parliament, with the intention of overawing and disturbing its deliberations. It does no more than give the same statutory power to this Parliament that is already enjoyed by all State Parliaments. Por all practical purposes, clause 9 repeats the provision in the New South - Wales Crimes Prevention Act, No. 80, of 1916. It makes it an offence to incite by words or writing the commission of offences agaiust Commonwealth law. At the present time, it is not an offence to incite the commission of offences against Commonwealth law, although it becomes so if an offence is committed. person who, having incited its commission, may then be indicted as an accessory before or after the act. Clause 10 deals more particularly with the offence of sedition, and has been taken from the Queensland Criminal Code, which has been in existence for about twenty years. In order that honourable members may. better understand the matter, I take the liberty of reading the clause, all the provisions of which, save two, have been taken with such verbal emendations as to make the words apply to the Commonwealth in place of-the State, directly from the Queensland Criminal Code. It provides that(a) To bring the Sovereign into hatred or contempt; (B) to excite disaffection against reign or the Government or Constitution of the United Kingdom, or against either House of the Parliament of the United Kingdom: (c) to excite disaffection against the Government or Constitution of any of the King's Dominions; (d) to excite disaffection against the Government or Constitution of the 1 Commonwealth or against either House of the Parliament of the Commonwealth ; (e) to excite disaffection against the connection of the King's Dominions under the Crown; (/) to excite His Majesty's subjects to attempt to procure the alteration, otherwise than by lawful means, of any matter in the Commonwealth established by law of the Commonwealth; or (o) to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of His i Majesty's subjects, so as to endanger the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth. These things shall be evidence of seditious intention. The provisions which are new are those set out in paragraphs c and e. In order that honourable members may realise that this clause will not prevent that adequateventilation of grievances by l a w f u l means which is essential in a free country, I invite their attention to sub-clause 2 of this clause, which reads(2) It shall be lawful for any person(a) To endeavour in good faith to show that the Sovereign has been mistaken in any of his counsels; (6) To point out in good faith, errors or defects in the Government or the Constitution of the United Kingdom, or of the Commonwealth as by law established, or in legislation, or in the administration of justice, with a The view to the reformation of such errors or defects; (c) To excite in good faith His Maesty's subjects, to attempt to procure by lawful means the alteration of any matter in the Commonwealth as by law established; or (d) To point out in good faith in order to their removal any matters which are producing, or have a tendency to produce, feelings of ill will and. hostility between different classes of. His Majesty's subjects. These provisions will give ample freedom to the citizens of this country to obtain redress of all grievances, and to secure by l a w f u l means any reforms which they may deem to be necessary. The clause provides the usual penalties. I have not looked at the penalties imposed under the Queensland Criminal Code, and conthe Sove- sequently I am unable to say whether they are more severe than are those prescribed by this Bill , or whether in effect they are the same. Clause 12 deals with loans, and provides that public bodies and trustees may invest in Commonwealth loans. It also empowers banks to make advances to their employees for the pur.pose of investing in such loans. Clause 15 forbids the publication of statements' calculated to prejudice the raising of Commonwealth loans. Clause 16 continues the Council of Finance established by regulation, statutory rule 207 of 1910. ' This Council of Finance is now in existence, and it is desired, in the best interests of the Commonwealth, to continue it. Clause 17 requires the agents of oversea companies and firms to register certain particulars with the Comptroller-General of Customs. The remaining provisions of the Bill are of a miscellaneous character, and may be very briefly touched upon. Clause 18 provides that no person without the consent of the Treasurer shall deface or destroy, by melting or otherwise, _ any gold coins which are British coins within the meaning of the Coinage Act 1909. Clause 19 sets out thatAny person who is guilty of any offence against this Act for which no other penalty is provided, shall be liable to a penalty exceeding One hundred pounds, or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months, or both. Clause 20 provides that the Governor General may make regulations not inconsistent with this Act for the .purpose of carrying out the Act. I shall not detain honourable members at any greater length. The Bill speaks for itself. repeals the War Precautions and makes statutory provision certain War Precautions Regulations which are essential for the good government of this country. Upon a fair review of the measure, I think it will be admitted that it does no more than ought to be done either in repealing the War Precautions Act or barring the entry into the Commonwealth of those undesirables who wish to disturb the harmony and goodwill of our fellow-citizens or dealing with sedition. I commend the Bill to the House, and I trust that without any very protracted debate it will be approved. As it is a measure of some length, I have taken this opportunity to move its second reading, and I now wish to intimate that it. is not proposed to continue the discussion upon it today. I shall set its further consideration down for tomorrow. It may be reached tomorrow, but possibly Mr Hughes. it may not be reached until Wednesday.

His views are not shared by the soldiers of Europe. They resent his sentiments.

But these men fought throughout the war, and are pledged to use their endeavours to induce the people in every country of the world not only to forget the late war, with all its hatreds and prejudices, but also to get rid of all insignia and honours conferred upon them, such as the Legion of Honour, the Croix de Guerre, and every other symbol of merit awarded in connection with the war.",43

I only desire to say that if these men who fought during the war are now prepared to hold out the hand of friendship and to fraternize with their late enemies, the Minister's appeal' to the natural affections' of the mothers and fathers of Australians who were killed in the struggle should be ruled out of Court. Their feelings should not be exploited merely to secure the defeat of the amendment.",43
186,Mr MAXWELL,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Fawkner) [6.10] The bitter feeling that is evinced in this House every time the war is discussed' is, I think, the strongest argument in favour of a time l i m it being fixed against the introduction to Australia of erstwhile enemy subjects.",43
187,Mr BRENNAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,But why still cherish hatred ?,44
188,Mr MAXWELL,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The honourable member for Batman is one of the worse offenders in this House when any matter affecting the war is under discussion. His lips seem positively to d r i p gall whenever he talks about the attitude of Great Britain in the war. During the war feeling ran very high. We found workmen refusing to work alongside men of enemy origin. It was a source of constant trouble. And now we are told, by honourable gentlemen on the opposite side of the House, the war being over, we should allow erstwhile enemies to come to this country, and not insist on Germany making reparation. B are suffering the aftermath of the war. The consequences of the war will be felt for many a long day to come, and bitter memories will certainly be retained for a long time by people of German origin - If such men as the honourable members for Batman (Mr Brennan) and Barrier (Mr . Considine) resent Great Britain's treatment of Germany, how much more will German nationals resent that treatment? So, if we allow them to come to Australia, there will always be the possibility of trouble until, at all events, the bitter feeling engendered by the war shall have passed away. The honourable member for Barrier suggests that this Bill represents a spirit of revenge. It does nothing of the kind. It is purely a protective measure. - Mr BRENNAN - A littl e for revenge, and a little for votes.",44
189,Mr MAXWELL,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"It is not being submitted in a spirit of revenge at all. To hear this talk, one would almost imagine that the honourable member, and those who think with him, are full to overflowing with the mil k of human kindness, and that honourable members on this side of the House are animated by a spirit of hatred. I resent that. We have no feelings of revenge. This Bill simply represents an ordinary common-sense precaution in the interests of good government and peace. We say that, until the feelings generated by the war have died down somewhat, we must postpone the immigration to this country of erstwhile enemy nationals. I hope the > Committee will support the clause.",44
190,Mr BRENNAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Batman) [6.14] It is curious that the honourable member for Eawkner (Mr Maxwell) should have overlooked the fact that the amendment is designed to give effect to the policy of Great Britain , and with the object of bringing our law into conformity with British law. Though the honourable member is loyal to Britain to the core, and resents that my lips should be dripping with gall, as he described it , in respect of Britain , when it becomes a matter of prolonging ill-feeling due to the war, he prefers to foster Australian hatred of our late enemies, instead of following the B r i tish policy of conciliation. It is very curious that the honourable member should have taken the trouble to u t we' point to the ill-feeling that existed in this country during the war, the international hatreds that were developed, propagated, and maintained while the war was on, and should then have argued, as a consequence, that we should now give effect to a policy which prolongs the very thing that he pretends to deprecate in relation to the past. I hope I do not forget the precise purpose of the clause under discussion, because it is one which is closely related with the war, and with its consequences. During the currency of the war, we had to listen to outpourings of bathos such as has just fallen from the lips of the Minister (Mr . Poynton); and it is a fact that, as part of the policy of hatred, that kind of stuff was undoubtedly effective during those five long tragic years; and as the honourable member for - Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) says, it is effective even today. To-day this policy of revenge divides this House, and is responsible for recriminations among ourselves-reflectin g that greater measure of ill - w i ll which we are endeavouring to develop on the other side of the world, Because the war is past, I do not want to revive the unpleasant state of mind which necessarily followed from the performance of the duty which rested upon public men to express their views firmly and courageously. It is because the war is past, and long past, that one cannot help protesting strongly against the introduction of a measure which seeks to perpetuate this mental disease in time of peace. Therefore, while there is nothing by any means revolutionary in the amendment; while it is mildness itself-for if one to give effect to the real views of the Labour party in this matter it would be impossible to do so in the present temper of honourable members opposite-in the small hope that we may soon return to an equitable, and therefore a normal, frame of mind,- I shall, at any rate, support it . The mere bandying about of insults concerning what we did, and what honourable members opposite did, during the war, can carry us no further. We, at any rate, acted consistently - with our expressed opinions, and we did not sit in soft, safe places urging others to do the fighting while we did the talking.",44
191,Mr WIENHOLT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Moreton) [6.18],It would be, perhaps, an impertinence to suggest that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) has, to a certain with extent, missed the point. I thoroughly of the Public Works Committee. agree with the honourable member regarddid ing the danger of doing anything to keep alive ill-feeling. But his remarks, and  would be more appropriate if by this amendment we were proposing to wipe moved out the whole clause, or even the subwould clause. In such circumstances I could understand the Minister's speech; but are not proposing anything of the sort. The amendment is designed merely to turned bring our legislation into line with the British law. I personally repudiate remarks of the Minister when he says that one is apt to forget the effects of war such as that through which we have lately passed, and that one is prone to fail to keep in mind the very heavy losses which we incurred. The amendment does not propose to permit citizens of those countries with which we were lately at war to come into Australia unrestricted; but we should now lay down a perfectly fighting. good policy upon these lines, namely, that in regard to matters of trade, and everyEve thing else, that which is deemed good enough for the Home country should be accented as good enough for us. We foltwenty-five lowed the Home country into the war. of Surely, then, it would be rather anomat lous that those of us who believed we acted rightly by so doing did not believe also that we would be right in following the British example with respect not only to trade and commerce, but also in gard to restrictions upon immigration. Surely no suggestion of disloyalty could be reasonably levelled against us for consistency. The lionorable member for tried Batman (Mr Brennan), and the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), must, of course, be responsible for their own views upon the clause and the amendment; but I hope that the tone which the discussion has taken will not influence honourable members against judging fairl y upon the merits of the argument. Our desire is to bring the Commonwealth legislation into conformity with the British law; and that, to my mind, is the sole purpose of the amendment.  [6.21] - I regret that I did not hear the  sure during the second reading debate. As honourable members know, I have only just returned from Sydney, where I have been for the past fortnight in connection my duties as a member I hear him explain this clause, however, and his arguments failed to convince me. Tf his remarks today were in keeping with those which he uttered when he the second reading of the Bill , it seem that I did not lose much by my inability to hear them. The Miniswe ter has now said something to the effect that he would not be able to look a resoldier in the face if he were to accept the amendment. It is rather unthe fortunate that, after having expressed such an opinion, the second speaker a following the Minister should have been himself a returned soldier, and that he should have had to tell the Minister that he does not interpret .the true feelings of returned men upon the issue. However, it is not to the Minister that we look for an interpretation of the views of returned men, but to^ those who actually did the According to my reading, the clause does not l i m it the restriction to years. It may be possible for citizens of former euemy countries to be debarred from entering Australia for a matter of years. I draw the attention honourable members to the phrase, ' ' uni l the Governor General, by proclamation, otherwise determines."" If , by any conceivable chance or misfortune the present Government were to continue in office for another twenty-five years, this reimmigration barrier could remain for the same period, or for so long as the Government thought they could make use of the our restriction for political purposes.",45
192,Mr BRENNAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"They may be damning the French by then, and blessing the Germans.  Before then, one. of our late enemies might be our firmest ally, and one of our present allies might be our hated enemy. On the last occasion when I  speaking in this Chamber he was. addressing himself to the Nationality Bill. He then employed the argument, respecting the naturalization of aliens, that Commonwealth legislation should be framed in conformity with the British law. Now, however, he turns right round. It does not suit the convenience of the Government that our immigration . restriction legislation should coincide with the British Statute, which provides for three years. Both Great Britain and France have entered into trade with Germany. We stand alone in the Empire in our insistence upon keeping the sore open; worse than that, we are rubbing salt into the wound. We are the only people who are continuing to promulgate the gospel of hatred.",46
193,Mr BLAKELEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"But our hatred goes only so far as to refuse to buy things from Germany. We would not hesitate to sell anything that Germany would buy from us.  traders of this country-ou t for profits all the time-woul d not hesitate to trade with Germany, even in time of war, if they were free to do-so. Hatred is being perpetuated in Australia because we have at the head of affairs a gentleman who, for political purposes, does not want to lose this or any opportunity to trade to his advantage upon the passions of the people. A returned soldier in this  ton) that if the Government fall in line with the British Act their decision will not be cavilled at by returned soldiers.  opinions about that.  are not fanatics. They fought because they deemed it their duty to do so; but they do not believe in perpetuating a feeling of hatred.",46
194,Unknown,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 8 p.m.  not very much to add to what I said before the dinner adjournment, and, unless the Minister in charge of the measure is in a different mood to what he was then, it is practically useless proceeding. It seems strange that there are people who are quite prepared to trade with countries which, two years ago, were our enemies, but, at the same time, are willing to penalize the people of those countries by making the period two years longer than even the British Government consider necessary. Even the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), the other day, in reply to a question by the honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley) said that he was quite in favour of trade being again undertaken with) Germany, and would no longer offer any resistance to our cross bred and other wools being sold to that country. It is interesting to recall that, at the termination of hostilities, the Prime Minister said he would never consent, under any circumstances, to trade between Australia and Germany being reopened. But two years has evidently had an effect even upon the Prime Minister, and he now indicates that much of the old bitterness has died down, and he is prepared to reverse the decision he then gave. Purely for political purposes - I say it deliberately-h e is willing to sanction a clause of this character which will not permit those people who proved themselves to be admirable settlers to come to Australia within a period of five years. The amendment simply provides that the term shall be reduced from five to three years, which would bring the Bill into conformity with the British Act, which was a strong argument the Government used in connection with another measure recently passed by this Chamber. We are simply asking the Committee to do what the mother of Parliaments has already agreed to, and, if the British Government are satisfied, surely this Government should be.",46
195,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Maribyrnong) [8.5] I cannot understand why the Minister  is not prepared to accept the amendment. If Great Britain, which is so close to our late enemy countries, considers that three years is sufficient,' why should Australia, which is 12,000 miles distant, and part of the same Empire, insist on a longer period? It would appear from statements that have already appeared in the press that France is already becoming somewhat as to the action of the British Government at the Geneva Conference. following paragraph appears in today's Age:Mr Lloyd George, interviewed by the London correspondent of the Petit Parisien, for the purpose of removing the unfavorable impression in France regarding Great Britain's attitude to German}', declared that Great Britain would stand shoulder to shoulder with France in exacting reparations from Germany. French must not think,"" the Prime Minister said, "" that I have become their enemy because I pursue a business course. It is necessary to investigate to ascertain how much Germany can pay before the Allies fix the amount."" The following paragraph, from a special representative of the Sydney Sun at the Geneva Conference as to the division of nations assembled on the question of whether Germany should be admitted to the League of Nations, appeared in F r i day's issue of that paper: Behind the Scandinavian group who favour Germany will be found South Africa, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, most of the South American republics, and smaller States. Probably Britain will lend its support, and it is believed that Japan and China will follow Britain's lead. The French group, which is undoubtedly the strongest in the Assembly, is vigorously opposed to Germany's entry, and is supported by Belgium, Portugal, Poland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Czecho-Slovakia. That shows clearly that there is a great difference of opinion even amongst the Allies at the Geneva Conference. that is the attitude of Great Britain , I cannot understand why we should support such a proposal as this, as one would expect the same kind of prejudice there as exists here, particularly when they are so close to German territory. I firmly believe that the German Government with which we would negotiate would be totally different from what it was in the past, because I believe the Junker class has gone forever. I wish I could say the same concerning every other country in the world, because this class is responsible for all wars. I , too, believe that there are many people in Germany who would make good citizens if they came to Australia, and we should not restrict them' unnecessarily. The Minister seems adamant in regard to this proposal, which, after all, is a reasonable one, and is strictly in accord with what has been done by the British apprehensive Parliament.

As I object to the provision of the original Act, and as this clause, is de^ signed to give fuller effect to that provision, I am opposed to the clause. I do not think that an obligation of this kind should be imposed on the owner of a vessel or his agent, or on the vessel's charterer. I do not think that a person should be sent out of the country under the circumstances provided for, and I certainly do not think that it should be competent for the Government at any time within three years after a person has been brought to the country by a shipowner or charterer in good faith , and in the ordinary course of business, to i m pose on that ship-owner or charterer the obligation of taking him back to his own country.

For example, a provision of this kind would have applied to the Italian nationals who were here during the war if . a treaty existed between Italy and Great Britain .  have on this subject is that the amendment will give the Minister power to deport German nationals whose repatriation has already been decided upon by the authorities administering the colonies, and who are sent from New Guinea for deportation by the first suitable steamer.",49

200,Mr BRENNAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Batman) [8.35] Honourable members sitting in the Opposition corner, unfortunately, can never hear anything that the Minister (Mr . Poynton) says. I do not think he cares whether we hear him or not ; but it does make it unpleasant when one cannot hear his statements on a question of this kind. So far as I can understand the amendment now submitted, the object of it clearly appears to be to legalize future acts of the kind that were unlawfully carried out by the Government in connection with Italian nationals. It will be remembered that these men were seized without the form of law, and in breach of the general practice obtaining in British communities. They were sent overseas, readand many of them lost their lives; but, so far as I am aware, no compensation has been paid to their relatives or to any of the persons who were grossly wronged in connection with that sorry business. I wonder what is meant by the words in this amendment, ""- is liable to be returned to that country."" Apparently, any man whom the Government are pleased to designate an alien, whether he is an alien or not, is liable, if the previous practice is followed, to be returned to the country of his origin. That part of the amendment is to me somewhat obscure. I gather generally, however, that the intention is in the future to cover up with the form of law that clearly unlawful and wrongful course of conduct, which in the recent past was pursued by the Government. Public attention has been called to it , and it is sought now by a kind of ex post facto manoeuvring on the part of I the Government to give an appearance of lawfulness so far as any futur e acts of the kind are concerned to what is now recognised to have been an unlawful proceeding. I cannot take great exception to this belated recognition by the Government of its past wrong-doing. Indeed, I rather welcome it , in so far as it is clearly an admission, and take the opportunity to put on record my appreciation of the fact that arguments on this matter have evidently not been without effect.

201,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"No r t h Sydney-Assistant Minister for Defence) [8.49] -- I m o v e That this Bill be now read a second time. I ask honourable members to put this Bill through all its stages at this sitting. It is a very short and simple measure, which does practically nothing more than give power to frame regulations for the control of air navigation.",50
202,Mr BRENNAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,All will be done by regulations.,50
203,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,It will all be done by regulations.,50
204,Mr BRENNAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Goo d old regulations!,50
205,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,At the present time there is no law in Australia to control air navigation.,50
206,Mr BRENNAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Then why not submit a law?,50
207,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"That is what the Government intend to do later on, when we have gained some experience in civil aviation'. At present there is nothing to prevent persons flying any machine they like, no matter of what brand NOES. or make; there is no power to insure that the machines shall be, I cannot say seaworthy, and, therefore, I suppose I must say airworthy. Further, there is nothing now to prevent the owner of any machine taking hire from passengers for flights, and this, of course, is a real menace to the public; neither is there any law to PAIRS. compel the possession of certificates of competency by those who fly machines. The object of the Bill , as I say, is to take power to frame regulations for the control of all such matters, and it will be followed later on by a more comprehensive measure, dealing with civil aviation. The best man to be found in Australia will beappointed Controller of C i v il Aviation, with a seat on the A i r Council, with which he will act as general advisor. This Bill will not interfere in any shape or form with civil aviation enterprise. If ever Australia has to take part in defensive operations, an air service, in my opinion, will be one of the principal arms employed; and the encouragement of civil aviation will result in saving the country huge expenditure.",50
208,Mr RYAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Does the Minister contend that the Commonwealth has power to in terfere with other than Inter-State aviation?,50
209,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Yes ; at the recent Premiers' Conference, the Premiers, on behalf of their States, agreed that that power should be given to the Commonwealth.",50
210,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The power cannot be transferred unless the State Parliaments agree.,50
211,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The Premiers of the States have agreed to put measures through their several Parliaments giving the necessary powers, with two reservations. One reservation is ' that ordinary police powers shall be allowed to the State police, and the second, that the States may possess their own machines. The reason that the control of aviation is left to regulations is, as I said before, that we haA'e not had experience enough yet to enable us to frame proper laws; but the regulations to be adopted are those which were arrived at by a Convention held in Paris, at which the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) represented Australia. The following are the countries which have assented to the regulations then framed : - The United States of America, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, the British Empire, China, Cuba, Ecuador, France, Greece, Guatemala, H a it i , the Hedjaz, Honduras, It a l y , Japan, Liberia, Nicaragua, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Roumania, the Serb-Croat-Slovene State, Siam, Czechoslovakia, and ""Uruguay-practicall y all the countries in the world. If these countries are satisfied that these are the best regulations that can be devised at present, I think we in Australia may also be satisfied. Some of the regulations, of course, may not be applicable to this country, but that is a matter for f u t u re consideration. I shall not trouble honourable members by reading the regulations, but simply say that they provide for certificates of air-worthiness, and so for t h. There is nothing in the Bill to necessitate lengthy discussion.; and I ask honourable members to bear in mind that it will not in any way affect the A i r Force Bill which will be introduced, not this year, but next, to deal with our Military and Naval branches of the A i r Forces. Of course, the Military and Naval A i r Forces will have to conform to those regulations, such as flying at a certain altitude over crowds, and so on.",50
212,Mr RYAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Who will administer the Bill?,51
213,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The A i r Council will advise the Government, and on that A i r Council there will be an Administrator of Civil Aviation to be appointed by the Government. tions have been called for the position, and the desire of the Government is, as I said before, to obtain the services of the best available men in Australia, giving preference to returned soldiers and sailors.",51
214,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,What Department will administer the Act?,51
215,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The Dement. fence Department.,51
216,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Will that Department administer civil aviation also?,51
217,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Yes . Civil aviation will come more within the militar y than the naval sphere. The fact that the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) has introduced the Bill is sufficient answer to the honourable member's question. Those who saw what could be done by aeroplanes during the war realise that it is all-important that Australia should have an effective air force, and one way in which it can obtain it is by giving every possible encouragement to civil aviation. This Bill does not interfere with or restrict enterprise in civil aviation. It simply gives power Panama, to make regulations for the safety of the public. Accidents have occurred quite recently through aviators flying low over crowds, and unless air traffic is regulated in some way, there may be more serious accidents.",51
218,Mr BRENNAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Has the Commonwealth Parliament control over civil aviation?,51
219,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The only thing which would prevent the Commonwealth from having control over civil aviation would be the objection of the States; but they have all agreed to pass the neeessary legislation giving the Commonwealth control over aviation.,51
220,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Y a r r a ) [9.3] - The fact that the State Premiers have agreed to give us this power does not mean that we have the power. The State Parliaments must first pass the necessary legislation.,51
221,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,They have all promised to do so.,51
222,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"They promised a lot of things in the past that they have not carried out. Twelve or fourteen years ago they promised to pass unifor m industrial legislation, but they have not done so. They promised to give the Commonwealth increased powers, but they have Applicanot done so.",51
223,Mr MARRS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Without this legislation, there may bo a tragedy.",51
224,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I realise it , and I quite believe that there should be one controlling Parliament in this, as in other matters, and that that controlling body should be the 'Commonwealth ParliaI f the States are not likely to in terfere with our control, and . are prepared to pass the necessary legislation giving us this power, the sooner they do it the better.",51
225,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,We cannot operate this measure unless they give us the power.,51
226,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Every State Parliament is sitting at the present time, but some of them are about to conclude their business, and may not meet again u n t i l July next. If they go into recess with out handing us this power, we shall be in exactly the same position when we pass this Bill as we would be in without passing it . I hope the Minister (Sir Granville Ryrie) can let us know how many aeroplanes are owned by civilians in Australia.",51
227,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"There great number of them, but I do not know exactly how many there are.",52
228,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"No r do I . The M in ister surprised me, and I presume many others, when he said that at present a man can go up in the air without being possessed of a certificate of competency. The driver of a motor car is required to have a certificate of competency. I thought the Defence Department were issuing certificates of competency to air pilots, because when I was at Point Cook at the invitation of the late Mr Basil Watson, who wanted me to see his machine, there was a man qualifying for his pilot's certificate.",52
229,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,He was bably in the military service.,52
230,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,No . He was a civilian. Does the Defence Department issue certificates to civilians who are qualifying for military positions?,52
231,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Yes , if they endeavouring to get billets under the Defence Department.",52
232,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"In this case, I understand, the man had no intention of securing the billet under the Defence Department, but was merely anxious to let it be known that he had attended a course of instruction at Point Cook qualifying him to make a flight. He was a motor car driver, and I understand that, because of their knowledge of mechanics, motor car drivers make the best aviators. Unless certificates are issued, the public w i ll always be in danger. I am a frequent visitor to a seaside place about forty miles from Melbourne. Last year, the Melbourne Herald, partly to advertise itself and partly to allow visitors at Sorrento to get the Herald at night, which otherwise they could not do, sent an aviator right down the east side of Port Phillip Bay. One afternoon, when he was landing at Momington, the crowd overran the landing ground, and he, finding that he could not make a landing at the pre-arranged spot without injuring some one in the crowd, made for what he thought was a suitable ground on the other side of the railway linej but he came into contact with a telegraph wire, with the result thab the son of a prominent Melbourne man who was accompanying him was killed. That accident was occasioned by the crowd. One reason why we must have active cois a operation with the States is the fact that the control of crowds must rest with the State police. In another accident in Adelaide, which was not due to the crowd, th© propeller of a machine cut off a boy's bead. Other accidents have occurred elsewhere. Another reason for co-operating with the States is the necessity for providing landing grounds.",52
233,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,That is all provided for in the regulations.,52
234,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Unfortunately , I have not seen the regulations. I am game to say that 5 per cent, of honourable members have not seen them, or had an opportunity of reading them.",52
235,Mr MARRS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,They are very complete.,52
236,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I am prepared to admit pro- that they are, but we ought to know what we are doing. The conditions in Australia might differ from those obtaining elsewhere. However, I see no reason why we should not pass the Bill as early aa possible, and get active co-operation with the States, but I think that the Bill are ought to state distinctly what Minister is to control it . Otherwise, the control of aviation may be transferred from . one Minister to another, and honourable members may not know to what Minister questions or complaints should be directed.",52
237,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"F r a n k l in ) [9.10]. - This is a skeleton Bill , but we have become accustomed to government by regulations. However, I welcome the in troduction of the measure. Aviation is quite new to all of us; but every thinking person will admit that unless something is done to secure the control of the air, or what would be"" called on land "" the right of the road,"" we shall wake up some day and find that some terrific accident has occurred. We have been very close to it on some occasions, more often than some of us would care to think of. There is only one Department which can administer a measure like this, and that is the Defence Department. Necessarily it must have a Department to control its own air-craft, and no one would desire to create a second 'Department to deal with what, after all, will be a very small affair once these regulations are put into operation. We do not know anything about aviation, and it is well for the Minister (Sir Granville Ryrie) to consider whether it would not be wise to place a. time l i m it in this Bill , so that the whole subject will come up for reconsideration later on. I do not think there will be the slightest difficulty in getting the co-ordination of the States. A - small Bill giving the Commonwealth Parliament the control of the air could be passed in a couple of hours by each State Parliament, and as all the State Houses are now in session,. there should be no difficulty in this respect. W it h management and careful handling much closer co-ordination could be achieved between the Federal Government and State Governments in many directions. It only requires a little give and take to meet the requirements of the different States. The State Premiers have already promised to introduce the necessary legislation in regard to bestowing upon the Commonwealth Parliament the control of the air, and I do not see any reason for doubting their ability to carry out their promises. In fact, I do not think there is a single State that will not be only too glad to get rid of its responsibility in this matter. The defence of Australia from .aggression will largely depend on our air-craft, and the only way in which a country like this can maintain an efficient air-craft service is by co-ordination of the military side and the civil side. A great deal can be done in the direction of conveying mails to the interior of Australia by aeroplanes. In such districts as the north-west coast of Western Australia, where the mail services are very irregular, a fortnight often intervening between the deliveries, the mail service of the future will be carried out by air-craft. It is only by the use of air-craft for commercial purposes that Australia can hope to maintain such an air-craft service as will be necessary for defence. I hope that the control of aviation will be left in the charge of the Defence Department. It would take a very great deal to induce me to consent to the creation of a new Department for the purpose. I support the Bill cordially, with the expression of the hope that the Minister will see his way to im pose a time l i m it on its operation, because we are in this matter breaking new ground, and difficulties may arise which we cannot now foresee. If the course I suggest is followed, Parliament will then automatically be afforded an opportunity of reconsidering the position, and this Bill should pass after a very short discussion.",52
238,Mr MARRS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Wentworth) [9.17] I welcome the advent of this Bill . Ever since this House met I have persistently asked questions dealing with aerial matters. Commercial and civil aviation have been considerably hindered in Australia for lack of air regulations. Whilst other parts of the world have made great advances in aviation, Australia has been standing still. At last we have a Bill little before us which is based upon the report of a Conference at which Australia was represented, which was signed at Paris on 13th October, 1919. I have considered that report with expert airmen out here, and there can be no doubt that it is very full and very thorough.. Much of it , of course, applies to dividing lines between the great countries of the Old World, but a great deal of it also imay be applied to Australia. I may mention the provision suggested for the marking of aeroplanes underneath so that each machine may be distinguished. If an aviator flies low over cities his machine will have its private mark, and he can thus be identified and brought! to account. No aviator is allowed to go into the air, and no engineer is permitted to enter an aeroplane without a proper licence. More important than anything else, the regulations for preventing collisions at sea are adopted almost in to to. If honourable members will read the regulations for preventing collisions in the air they will find that they are almost identical with those for preventing collisions at sea. Two ships meeting each other port their helms and .go to starboard, and thus pass in safety. Aeroplanes, it is suggested, also must carry red and green sidelights like the port and starboard sidelights of vessels, and also a stern light. There are other regulations to be complied with in order to avoid serious collisions. U p to the present time we have been extraordinarily lucky in not having a tragedy occurring in oue of the principal cities of Australia. I have already directed attention in this House to low flying over the Randwick racecourse, and recently I have seen low flying over Melbourne and over Sydney. If , when an aviator is flying low over a city in that way, his engine should stop or misfire, a tragedy would be the result, because the aeroplane would probably fall into a mass of people. This Bill adopts the proposals of the Conference to which I have referred, and confers power on the Governor General to frame regulations controlling flying. The fear has been expressed tonight that the State Governments may be somewhat laggard in passing the necessary regulations to control flying, and may not leave the matter in the hands of the Commonwealth. But from what I can learn the State Governments are very keen about legislation controlling flying,' and their representatives at the Premiers' Conference have to be thanked for agreeing to hand over to the Commonwealth as the central authority the subject of flying legislation. foundation of the whole business must be - civil and commercial aviation. If we encourage private individuals and companies to undertake aviation, the Government will save an enormous amount of money in the supply of machines for defence purposes. But private individuals will not make a start u n t i l satisfactory regulations are introduced. It may interest honourable members if I give them a few facts to show what is I taking place in aviation in other parts of the world. We are considerably in this matter. Our expert aviators and mechanics, for lack of proper encouragement, are going into civil occupations, or to other countries, such as America and the Old Country, to join up with aerial com panies there. From the latest report from England, which I received two days ago, I find that some extraordinary figures are given in connection with the Paris-London air route. During teen months, up to 30th October of this year, 4,000 passengers had been carried, and ,£200,000 wortli of goods, whilst the distance covered in the fourteen was 300,000 miles. The official report says that the route is absolutely and the service conducted with the most wonderful regularity. In South huge commercial aviation schemes are in hand. The Dutch, doubtless inspired by the wonderful flight of Sir Ross and Sir Keith Smith, and by Parer and Mcintosh, have established in Java aerial mail and passenger services. The Siamese have done likewise. The TJnited States of America have, of course, made strides in aviation. From New York to Chicago, a daily service for mails and passengers has been established, ' charge of only 2 cents per letter is made Afr. Marks. for the mail service, whilst there is a saving of twenty-four hours on the transcontinental route. The official report for 1919 says that it is 95 per cent, perfect. This shows to what a fine art civil aviation has been brought in America. Without referring to other countries, it must be very clear t p honourable members that great advances have been made in aviation almost everywhere except Australia. Now that this Bill has been introduced, I can tell honourable members that we shall make great strides in this count r y. Many time-tables have already been drawn up, and aviators are only waiting to get a start. There are some conditions The essential to success in civil aviation and the carriage of mails by aeroplane. One is that there must be special machines' employed for the purpose. It is not a b it of use to try to carry mails or passengers with military machines. I can give honourable members one example in proof of this statement. Recently an experiment was made in India from Kurachi to Bombay, a distance of 600 miles. The Government used D.H.10 machinesthat are very expensive because of their large consumption of petrol. Notwithstanding behind the fact that these machines can carry 3,000 lbs., and that, on the trials to which I refer, they were used to carry only 48 lbs., the whole thingwas a colossal failure. A very big authority, in England, a man named Holt Thomas, who started the Paris to London flights, and, I believe, also the Paris to Amsterdam flights, that have been so successful, says that you cannot make a sucfour- cess of civil mail and passenger flights without building special machines for the purpose. In every case, you must build a special machine for the job you intend months it to carry out. I understand that in Australia we have reliable, machine? that can carry mails at an in expensive rate. Experts out here are Africa, rather timid about the experiments that are to be undertaken by the Defence Department. I managed to set their fears Smith somewhat ab rest by some weeks ago. asking the Minister in charge of this Bill questions on the subject. I understand that the Department do not propose to huge use D.H.10 or D.H.0 machines, but have other machines that will do the job. I hope they have, because if we make a and a mistake at the start, it will have a most injurious effect upon aviation, in Austrai lia. People must be given every encouragement if we are to make aviation a success. If we give the business a good start, it will go rigbt on; but if we make a slip it will take years to so far educate the public on this question that great business firms will be prepared to send their goods by these machines. I have already said that in fourteen months on the Paris-London route £200,000 worth of goods were carried; and why should we not be able to do that in Australia between Sydney and Melbourne, Melbourne and Adelaide, or outback to the people in remote districts? Another condition precedent to success is speed. I have been expecting to be asked by interjection if I have ever flown. As a matter of fact, I have never been up. I had about 200 invitations during the war to go up; but not on your life over the Belgian coast or over the lines during the war ! I preferred to be on my bridge. But I can tell honourable members that I have taken a huge interest in flight for many years, and I had a very big machine on order in 1914, before the war broke out. I have followed the matter closely, and have read up everything worth reading on the subject; and as I worked at sea with the Royal Naval Air Force on the Belgian coast and in the English Channel during the winter months, I feel justified in speaking upon any matter pertaining to flight. I have said that the question of speed is very vital. At 75 miles per hour you can carry 2 tons weight over 300 miles without landing. If you increase' the speed to 100 miles per hour, the weight which can be carried drops from 2 tons to under 1 ton. The more speed you get, the less the weightcarrying capacity, and, of course, with increase of speed there is an increase of expense. Another matter of importance is night flying - You must fly at night, because business men will not' fly in the day-time, when they need to be working in their oflices. A business man could go up at night in Melbourne and land in Sydney at daylight next morning in a very comfortable machine. I have seen machines for carrying fifteen passengers, with plush seats and little round tables for playing cards, and a man engaged to serve drinks to passengers. Another matter of great importance is that proper landing grounds must be provided, and these must be well l it up at night, so that if an aviator is compelled to make a forced landing, he will know where to come down by lights placed on the ground around an aerodrome. This involves expense; but I have heard with pleasure that when the Government begin to move in this matter, no less than 80 per cent, of the local councils have agreed to undertake the expense of laying out proper landing grounds, if the Government will provide the plans and an expert oflicer to superintend the work. That is an offer which should be clinched at once. The last condition, as T mentioned before, is that of public support. The public are funny creatures. Indeed, we are all funny creatures. We take everything for granted. In the matter of aviation the public need educating, notwithstanding what they have seen accomplished during the war. They must be worked up to the position gradually, and our business firms especially must give aviation their support, if it is to be made a success. There is just one other matter that I desire to bring under the notice of the House. It is a most important matter. .There is a young Australian engineer inventor, named E. H . Friend, of New South Wales. He has invented an aeroplane engine, which, in comparison with the Rolls-Royce-the last word in aeroplane engines-cost s only half as much, and is only one-third of the size. If a Rolls-Royce engine required to be dismantled about one-third of a day would be occupied in the task, whereas the engine invented by young Friend can be dismantled in an hour. The main point about this engine is that it possesses not only a petrol stroke, but also a steam stroke, thus having a doiible impulse, which gives it enormous power. Let me illustrate my point. In Australia today out of 106 points of power there is not a single engine which will give more than seventeen points. Mr. Friend anticipates getting a minimum of power from his engine of 45 points. Experts have seen the model, including Colonel Williams, Squadron-Commander Goble, General Sir C. B. White, and the late superintendent of Cockatoo Island, Mr King Salter, who wrote a strong report in its favour. Young Friend has offered this machine to the Commonwealth Government for its A r m y and Navy for nothing, if they will only defray his expenses to England immediately in order that he may take his model there, and compete for the £12,000 prize which the A i r Ministry have offered for the best aeroplane engine, and which he thinks he can win. This offer has been before the Commonwealth Government for the past twelve months, yet this young inventor is still in Melbourne, whither he comes from Sydney about once a week to see me in reference to it . If the Government do not want that engine, let them say so, because it will not then be many hours before a private company, or, perhaps, a foreign Power, will get it . I am told by exnerts that if the engine comes up to the claims of its inventor-and a number of them think that it will - it will revolutionize flying the whole world over. may be asked, "" Where does the inventor come in ? "" He will come in by sales to private individuals outside the Government. The Commonwealth, however, will get the engine for all its machines for the cost of this man's passage Homeperhaps an expenditure of £ 1 5 0 under this heading-and a few additional pounds to enable.him to carry on whilst he is dealing with the A i r Ministry there. I beseech the Government to look into the matter. I know that a report upon it was received in Melbourne a few days ago from a very junior officer at the Arsenal. But this officer had neither the inventor before him, nor the model, nor the specifications. His report was that he would not recommend sending the inventor Home, but that the papers relating to the invention might be sent to the A i r Ministry, if Friend were willing that that course should be followed. dently there is something wrong somewhere- I am afraid that it is the cursed system of red tape againand we are going to lose something which I think is a perfect marvel. appeal to the Government to allow this lad to go Home at once. There is no timet to lose if he is to be,in a position to compete for the £12,000 prize to which I have already referred. The following information is contained in a note sent to me by Friend:The petrol engines of Australia are annually wasting, through their exhaust and cooling systems, 34,000,000 gallons of the 52,000,000 gallons of high-priced petrol, mainly bought Mr Marks. from foreign Powers. The universal adoption of my motor would save Australia 10,000,000 gallons of petrol a year. In other words, his engine eats up every bit of power that is usable. It avails itself of the heat engendered by the petrol, and of the steam that it gets from tha water radiator, and it consumes all the waste, thereby yielding 45 per cent, of power. I urge the Government to look very carefully into this matter as early as possible, with a view to seeing if they cannot allow this young man to go Home and give Australia another big "" boost."" I welcome the activity of the Ministry in getting down to bedrock T>y bringing this A i r Convention into force, and by seeking to empower the Governor General to make regulations to deal with civil aviation. It Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE (No r t h Sydney-Assistant Minister for Defence) [ 9 . 3 7 ] - I desire to say a word or two in connection with this young man Friend who has invented an engine which it is claimed will revolutionize' the manufacture of internal combustion engines throughout the world. I saw the young man in question, and I was very favourably impressed by him . I think that he is a very smart, keen, good Australian. I understand, too, that General White and Colonel Williams 'have seen the models and specifications of his invention, and that they, too, are favourably impressed with them. At all events, I promise the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr . Marks) that I will place the matter before the Cabinet, and that I wilf* ask it to agree to a small expenditure on behalf of this young man. I asked Friend Evi- whether a first class passage Home would be sufficient for him , and his reply was, - "" I do not want a first class passage. I will go second class."" It is evident, therefore, that he is not out for a ""joy-ride."" I In conversation with me, he stated, "" I want to go Home to compete for the £12 000 which is being offered for the best ? engine for aeroplanes."" He is very anxious indeed to compete for this big prize; and I think, in all the circumstances, that we are justified in paying his passage to the Old Country. I told him that I was prepared to ask Cabinet to sanction an expenditure of £100 to enable him to live in England whilst placing his invention before the proper authorities, and he said that he would be perfectly satisfied with that amount. We should be foolish to miss the chance of securing an invention of this sort for the Commonwealth. Of course, it may prove a "" d u d "" ; but the risk is one which is well worth taking. W it h regard to what has been said concerning the imposition of a time l i m it upon the operation of the Bill , I do not think that any good purpose would be served by such a restriction. We do not know how long these regulations will run smoothly and satisfactorily. But the moment it can be shown that they are not. working satisfactorily fresh legislation will be brought down to deal with this matter of civil aviation. Question resolved in the afllrmativp.

The honourable member stated that this young man had been tiavelling backwards and forwards from Sydney for about twelve months, and that so far he had been unable to get anything done in connection with his request. I would like to know whether any reports have been obtained upon his invention.",57
241,Mr MARRS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,I said that one report had been received from a junior oflicer at the Arsenal.,57
242,Mr RYAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,A r e there not experts in the Commonwealth who could submit reports upon it for the guidance of the Minister ?,57
243,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I do not know that there are. We have a report from an officer at the Arsenal, but he had not the inventor before him.",57
244,Mr RYAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I have not a single word to say against the proposal to pay this young man's passage to England. But if his invention has been before the GovernHonorable ment for twelve months, and they have experts who could report upon it , their reports should be forthcoming.",57
245,Mr MARRS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"That is the whole trouble. There is no place to which a young inventor may go, to get the matter threshed out.",57
246,Sir GRANVILL ERYRTE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"If the invention is a new one, how can we get an expert to report upon it?",57
247,Mr RYAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"But the Government might get reports from those who are qualified to express an opinion upon it . I am not suggesting that this young man's passage to the Old Country should not be paid. But we ought to have some sort of prima-facie evidence that his invention is worth looking into. I attach a good deal of weight to what has been said by the honourable member for Wentworth, and I think the Minister would be well advised in giving effect to his suggestion.",57
248,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Occasionally , we s.end young men to the Old Country with inventions, and, in practically all cases, they find when they get there that there are already in existence inventions upon similar lines. - Mr Ryan - Whether there is any novelty in the supposed invention ought surely to be discovered from this side of the world, before the Government rush into the matter.

That the price of Australian carbide of calcium f.o.b. Hobart shall not exceed £30 per ton except with the approval of the Minister; and 2. That the Minister is satisfied that the price charged for Australian carbide of calcium is not excessive. members will recollect that some time ago I promised to remove the embargo against the importation of cer-. tain goods to Australia, amongst them carbide of calcium. Without the House at this hour with a the history of what has happened, I remind them that when the war broke out carbide of calcium was one of the modities that Australia became short of , with the result that before longacetylene the price began to rise rapidly, ultimately, I think, something like per ton in 1917-18. This price did not sives. last long, because the Japanese into the market, and quotations fell to about £60 per ton. Early in the war company for the manufacture was formed in Hobart, but at the outset they were confronted with all sorts of troubles, the principal being the difficulty of obtaining the electrodes for the prois duction of the carbide itself. ally, electrodes were supplied by a com- £40 per ton. pany operating in Scandinavia, but these - broke down. They would not stand up to the current, and as a consequence company could not manufacture of calcium at all. I shall have a word or two to say directly concerning the reasons, possibly, that actuated the company supplying the electrodes. However, the Tasduty ? manian company decided to their own, but at the outset they experiper enced great difficulty in acquiring necessary machinery, including large hydraulic press. Eventually tralian engineers came to their and, to their great credit, be it said, they were able to turn.out the necessary machinery, and to manufacture electrodes, though not until about the end of the war. Had these difficulties overcome in the earlier stages of the war, the company would, by this time, have protection. been on such a firm basis that the present difficulties would not have arisen. bide of calcium is now available at a duction. price which makes it impossible for this Australian company to trade, and unless we can do something to help them they will have to close down their works altocium gether. They have a capital of £100,000 invested in the industry, and came to the rescue of Australia at a critical period in the war. It was not their fault, at events, that they were unable to meet demand at the time.

I am satisfied, on the figures supplied to me by the company-and necessarily they are confidential-that £ 3 0 per ton only gives the company a fair profit and a reasonable amount for amortisation.",58

257,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,I have not the slightest doubt that they will do better.,59
258,Mr JAMES PAGE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Can the whole of the Commonwealth?,59
259,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I do not think there is any doubt about that point, but, if not, the Minister will be authorized, in the terms of this resolution, to make arrangements to admit further supplies of calcium from outside. There is no doubt, in my mind, that dumping of this product into Australia is being practised with deliberate intention of driving the Tasmanian company out of existence, and this dumping, I remind honourable members, is being done by the same company - that supplied the electrodes, which were the cause of so much trouble and prevented the Tasmanian company from manufacturing carbide of calcium in the early stages of the war.",59

267,Mr WIENHOLT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,' Why is dumping being done here if carbide is cheaper in Australia than elsewhere?,59
268,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"For the simple reason that ' the foreign company wish to get r i d of a rival, and a well-known commercial method is to attack and [275] crush a weaker rival out of existence in order, subsequently, to increase the price of the commodity.

270,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The fact remains that, if we do not come to the assistance they supply of this company, they will have to go out of business, 'investors will lose their money, and Tasmania an important industry. Until the company has been given a chance to get on its feet, we should grant this special form of protection. I ask the House to agree to the resolution, believing, as I do, that it is necessary to keep this company in existence.",59
271,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Y a r r a ) [10.1] - Since the introduction of this subject-matter tonight, I have examined the statistics dealing with the imports of calcium car-bide for the last five years available. Last year's figures are not yet to hand. In 1913-14, 288,195 cwt. was imported into Australia, and its value was £184,844-equa l to about £ 1 3 per ton landed here. In 1914-15-the first year of the war-234,92 3 cwt. was imported, and its value was £ 1 3 9 , 0 3 3; the value still works out at about £ 1 3 a ton. In cwt., and the value was £118,715. That price works out at less than £ 1 0 per ton . In 1916-17, the total quantity imported fell to - about 98,000 cwt., the value of which was £57,461. Again that works out at about £ 1 3 a ton. In 1917-18, i m portation totalled 74,570 cwt., and the. value was £135,000. That is to say, the value for that year worked out at £ 4 0 per ton.",59
272,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,And in 1918-19 the price went up to about double.,59
