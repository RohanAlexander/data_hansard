Again, let us talk about a conthe issue between high care and low care shortage in our area. I refer to one of my the media only a few weeks ago. Mr Carmody, a Hospital for 20 weeks.

I just wonder where these They are not there yet; they were allocated but are growing rapidly. It is a retirement area; the report that was sent to members that was demand in Paterson for aged care was far greater ties was far less. Let us move on to bulk-billing. Again, practice that bulk-bills. For pensioners this that does not bulk-bill it means they are confronted to apply for a Medicare rebate. But they live fice. Communities like Tomaree and Foster course, people can go to the easy care claim, where they have to wait for up to 20 working Medicare. To a pensioner, that is money out wait. We need a far better system. The immediate particularly for pensioners. Concerning doctors: I have communities and one-third general practitioners. It is families. Why can that community not get doctors? cation because next door to Medowie are Lemon Tree Passage-with similar numbers of and Tanilba Bay are classified as rural and they two practitioners.
