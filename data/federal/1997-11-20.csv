1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA Approval of Works Motion (by Mr Somlyay) agreed to: That, in accordance with section 5 of the ment Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 17 November 1997, namely: National Gallery of Australia extension, Proposed additional works. Approval of Works Motion (by Mr Somlyay) proposed: That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 21 October 1997, namely: Administrative Building, Lowering of parapets.",13
2,Mr MCMULLAN,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Canberra) (9.32 a.m.)It is unusual to have debate on a motion like this and it is particularly unusual to get opposition from the member for Canberra to a capital work in the ACT. Particularly given what this government has done to the economy of the ACT, you would think I would be on my bended knee, saying, 'Thank you. They are at least going to spend $185,000 in my constituency.' Everybody in Canberra agrees there are myriad better ways that $185,000 could be spent on refurbishing work on innumerable buildings in the ACT. Many public servants working in substandard conditions in the ACT could testify to a much more socially worthwhile use of the money in every building around town than that being proposed for this indulgence. To spend $185,000 to adjust the parapets of one of Canberra's most historic public buildings just to provide a more pleasant view for a few is ridiculous. At a time when tough decisions are being made-some correct tough decisions; some ridiculous tough decisionsthis is an indulgence that is not warranted. It is a clear example of wrong priority. It is just absurd to say in the difficult budgetary times Australia always faces-there is nothing unusual about them; we face them now and always-that to be prudent and rigorous in the expenditure of public moneys a priority for this government is to spend $185,000 on adjusting the parapets on the administrative building in Parkes in which people have worked without the parapets adjusted since the building was opened. This is not some new crisis. We have not just Parliadiscovered that the parapets are there. They have actually been there since the building was built. So, first and foremost, it is a case of wrong priorities. I do not want to take a lot of time on this because obviously there are more important things before the parliament and the real debate on this will take place in the Senate when it is subsequently presented. But there is another point: the Australian Heritage Commission is seriously concerned about the national heritage implications of these changes to this building. It contends that this is something which should not be done, and it has advised accordingly. I know that the National Capital Authority, the Dom-stic Property Group and their architects have sought to accommodate this concern. At least since July the Heritage Commission have been making their concerns obvious and apparent and drawing them to the attention of the government. At the end of the day, an unsatisfactory solution has been come up with. We cannot always accommodate the concerns of the Australian Heritage Commission. We have to look at, as the act says, prudent and feasible alternatives. In this case there is a prudent, feasible, $185,000 cheaper alternative, which is not to do the work, leave the building as it is. Prudent, yes; feasible, obviously. As to whether the building can operate like that, yes, it can-it has since the day it was opened. Clearly, this is a $185,000 indulgence. If the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay) would like to come to me for a series of 10 suggestions of a better way to spend $185,000 in my constituency, I would be very pleased to provide a list to him. The opposition is opposed to this motion.",13
3,Mr LEO MCLEAY,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Watson) (9.36 a.m.)The government ought to be ashamed of itself for what it is proposing here: as the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) said, $185,000 to improve the view of a few. He was being generous in saying that because it really involves only a couple. If the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay) looked at the photographs that his own department have provided, he would see from those photographs that this $185,000 is about improving the view from two end offices. If the minister went down and had a look at this building himself, he would see on the front and rear facades of this building that there are numerous rooms with views. In fact, he does not even need to go all the way down there to look at the building. He can look at the pictures that his own department have provided with the brief on this issue. Looking at those pictures, we can see that up on the top floor of this building there are 12 rooms with views. But the poor people who have the end rooms do not have a view, and the government is to spend $185,000 fixing it up. Mr Filing interjecting",14
4,Mr LEO MCLEAY,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"My colleague from Western Australia, Mr Filing, thinks that is right. He thinks the government ought to waste $185,000 on providing a couple of highly paid public servants with a view. And they would not just be ordinary little public servants; they might even be the minister's own SES people, for all we know. My colleague might want to have a look at this and find out what stupidity he is voting for here. As the member for Canberra has said, there are far more things in this city that the government should spend money on than this. In this city, the government is creating mass unemployment among public servants but, at the same time, it is willing to spend $185,000 looking after the bosses-sack the rest, but provide the precious two or three with a better view. This might be part of the government's plan, as we have seen in the papers in recent weeks, to try to prop up the Canberra property market by mothballing some office buildings and by knocking others down, but I have never seen anyone accept such stupidity from the Public Service. We have a report here in which the Domestic Property Group people say that the reason they have got to do this work is that people will not rent this very large fiveor six-storey building because two offices do not have a view. And they are going to spend $185,000 fixing up the view. This is government gone mad. The previous ministerMr Warwick Smith-Hello.",14
5,Mr LEO MCLEAY,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Hello, he is sitting there. Unfortunately, Minister Somlyay, the previous minister has sold you a pup. I have no doubt that he is sitting in here next to you today to make sure that this pup gets put through this place, because when he was the minister he was of a mind to run this proposal before the parliament but then he pulled it out at the last minute. While he is sitting there next to you he might want to tell you why he pulled it out at the last minute-because he realised that spending $185,000 for a view from two offices was very hot and very, very stupid. That is a lot of money. Minister Smith baulked at it. You had enough trouble on your plate, didn't you, Warwick? You were not going to be mug enough, Warwick, to run this all up the flagpole, so you waited and you gave it to poor Alex. And you did not tell Minister Somlyay what the real problem was with this little plan. You did not show him the pictures; you did not take him down there and say, 'Now, listen, Alex, this is a red hot issue. They're going to be on to the fact that we're spending $185,000 to fix up a couple of offices for a couple of very highly paid public servants.' There is a little bit of a story here from the property group that says it cannot rent the building. Don't go and ask any real estate agent whether he has ever been unable to rent a building because it did not have a view; that is a joke. If it happened anywhere else we would have a laugh about it. But, in this city where the government is causing mass unemployment and reducing services to people, coming up with a proposal like this is really stupid. I think that the best thing the minister could do is to have another closer look at this-to go down and give the people in the Domestic Property Group a nice little touch-up and ask them where they get this stupidity from. If a real estate agent cannot rent or sell government property which is in one of the best positions in this city because two of the offices have not got a view, they ought to get rid of the real estate agent. Any member who wants to actually go and do something about it at lunchtime today can go for a five-minute walk down the hill here and have a look at this building-it is a magnificent building on a beautiful site. This is a government that believes in free enterprise and giving the private sector a go. I would say that, in this case, they ought to go and ask the real estate people. But maybe someone is in a fix here, because if you cannot rent this building without fixing up these views you ought to get the sack. Maybe the people who are involved in this have got some ulterior motive, but I think that what the government is putting forward here is $185,000 worth of absolute waste. They are going to damage a building that is a rather attractive building. If the people who are renting the building want a view, all you have got to do, Minister, is to go down and have a look at it and you will see-it is a very nice building; there is a picture of it in your own brief-that up the top here there are 14 views along the front and 14 views along the back.",14
6,Mr SOMLYAY,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,Tum it round.,15
7,Mr LEO MCLEAY,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Do you want to see a picture of the other side? Your department were very helpful. If you had looked at the brief that you have got in your hand there, you would have seen that there is a view from the back too. But the poor people on the end have got only half a view.",15
8,Mr FILING,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Have you got a picture of John Curtin House? Mr LEO MCLEA Y-We will hear from you later on, muggins. You can tell us why you think we ought to spend $185,000 on a view. We have the echo from the spendthrift Independents here on my left-it will be interesting to hear what they have to say. The truth with this is that the government is only telling half the story. The fact is the occupants have got half a view and they can actually see some things. It is not as if these people are in a prison cell. They actually have a reasonable sort of view. But what you want to do is to have the government spend $185,000 on a better view. That is just absurd. It is absolute stupidity, absolute irresponsibility and an absolute waste of money. The minister ought to rethink this. He ought to have a talk to the people in the Domestic Property Group whose job it is to go and market government property and he ought to ask them why they are not doing their job properly. If this is an example of how they do their job, then the member for Fadden (Mr Jull), when he was minister, should have had a good look at it. Minister Smith certainly realised-Warwick, you have a good antenna, old son-that this was a problem. This was nearly as big a problem as the problems you have with nursing homes, Warwick. So you got rid of this real quick. You pulled this out; you did not put this up before the parliament. A couple of weeks ago, when this was supposed to come up, you pulled it out because you realised how stupid it was. You have been very wicked; you have come down here this morning to sit next to Minister Somlyay and watch him make a mug of himself. That is not fair and you should not have done it. I say to Minister Somlyay: have another look at this. What the member for Canberra said was right. This is an excessive indulgence. It is going to provide a room with a view for two, and the government should not go ahead with it.",15
9,Mr SOMLYAY,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Fairfax-Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government) (9.46 a.m.)-That was a very interesting contribution from the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) and the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), the champions of occupational health and safety! If you have suggestions about where we can spend $185,000 better, give them to me. Perhaps we ought to look at some cycle paths or something that we can refurbish for the same price! The facts of this matter are that under the Parliament Act works within the parliamentary zone must be approved by a resolution of both houses of the parliament and then go through conventional planning processes. This motion is to facilitate minor works on the parapets of the administrative building to increase the natural light into the fourth floor. The work follows on from the allocation by the previous Labor government of $2.9 million in the 1994-95 budget to fund design and feasibility studies into the refurbishment of the old administrative building. The major work will be funded off budget and will provide consolidated office accommodation for the two new tenants, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Finance and Administration. The feasibility studies, which, I emphasise, were carried out under the Labor government",15
10,Mr FILING,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Who was it, again?",16
11,Mr SOMLYAY,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"They were made under the Labor government. The feasibility studies made it clear that the fourth floor could not be rented to a standard commercial quality without an increase in the amount of natural light. The lack of natural light also presents a problem with occupational health. The refitting includes the removal of two layers of sandstone blocks. These blocks will be reused to replace decaying stone on other parts of the facade. The fourth floor has been used by a very high security area of Foreign Affairs and the parapets were left there for that purpose. It was a high security area and the windows had to be protected from intrusion from the outside. The Department of Finance and Administration, of course, do not have anything to hide.",16
12,Mr FILING,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,It is more open government.,16
13,Mr SOMLYAY,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"It is more open government, as the member for Moore says. The honourable member for Watson says that I should go down there and have a look. I would like to inform the House that I in fact worked in that building for three years back in the 1960s. When Senator Faulkner made his outrageous allegations in the Senate that this was John Howard's $185,000 view, I went to inspect the building, I walked over each floor, I had a look at the parapets and I decided that it was fully justified to remove those parapets. If I were the client, the first thing I would ask to be removed would be those parapets. That is the first work I would have had done. The cost of removing the two layers of bricks will be more than offset by increased rents and savings in the electricity lighting. For the opposition to oppose this gives the House and all Australians a further reminder of their curious approach to economics. For the saving of $185,000 in a multimillion dollar project, they would see the project itself potentially jeopardised. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 November, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Latham moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for: (a) withdrawing support for 18 to 20 year olds in families with incomes as low as $23,400 per annum; and (b) abolishing payments for 16 and 17 year olds while also slashing education funding, labour market assistance and job opportunities; and (2) calls on the Government to introduce education and training opportunities so that every young Australian has access to the education and skills needed for full participation in the workplace and society"".",16
14,Mr WAKELIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"At the completion of play last night I was commenting on the comments by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) on the Working Nation package and its relative merits to the great progress of the new government and reminding the House of the youth allowance and the various programs that it is replacing. It also replaces Austudy for students commencing study when aged between 16 and 24, as well as more than minimum family payment for secondary students aged 16 to 18 not receiving Austudy. The reform will reduce complexity and duplication by creating a single youth payment. It clears up confusion between DEETYA and DSS and reduces the huge number of payment levels. It recognises the obligation we all have to support our children until they have achieved financial independence. The reforms are to commence on 1 July 1998. Until now, the complexity of the youth payment system has been of significant disadvantage to parents and young people. What is more, the system has inadvertently led to significant educational and employment problems for young unemployed Australians. It is well known that those who leave school early are three times more likely to be unemployed than those who complete their education. It seems absurd then that past policy actively encouraged young Australians to join the dole queue rather than to participate in education or training. This contributed to a youth unemployment level that became quite intolerable during the Keating-Beazley recession, when 34.9 per cent of young Australians could not find work. This was at the same time as the number of apprenticeships and traineeships fell to its lowest level in three decades. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 sets out to remedy the problems associated with the previous payments system and, as a consequence, contributes to the solution of the scourge of youth unemployment in partnership with the government's other reforms in the areas of literacy, vocational education and employment services. By introducing a flexible, inclusive income support program for young people now, Australia will be better equipped to deal with future trends in education, training and the labour market. Under the youth allowance, youth aged between 18 and 20 who find themselves unemployed will be subject to a parental means test if they wish to obtain an allowance. Those young unemployed will be treated in the same manner as full-time students. As such, families will be required to support their children until they have achieved financial independence if they can afford to do so. The payments available to those under 18 years of age whose circumstances mean that they have to live away from home for work or study will be increased and rent assistance extended. Importantly, the youth allowance has been designed to overcome many of the failings of the past system that have impacted so unfairly on students in rural and regional areas. This has been an issue close to the hearts of all parents and students, particularly my own heart, representing the seat of Grey and having four children, much of their education away from home. It is estimated that around 70,000 young people from outside metropolitan Australia will now be eligible for benefits previously denied to them. The previous system's education leaver waiting period will be abolished. This move will ensure that young people in need of income support do not face delays of up to three months in the provision of that support. The independence criteria that waive the parental .means test will be made more realistic. In tum, new safety net criteria will ensure that young people over 18 who have work force experience are not disadvantaged. In a move that will benefit many parents and students, particularly those in my electorate, the minimum Austudy payment of $1,000 per annum will be abolished. To address the previous incentives to opt out of work and training, flexible activity test requirements are introduced in this legislation. These requirements will mean that young people are encouraged to stay in education, while still allowing for support for those for whom full time schooling not an appropriate option. Furthermore, the youth allowance is a genuine reform that will benefit the vast majority of young Australians. At this time about 560,000 young people are likely to claim youth allowance. Over 153,750 of those young Australians will receive more through the youth allowance than they do currently. It is estimated that another 358,600 will receive the same amount they did previously. Those numbers speak for themselves. 1 come to what the youth allowance is not. I would like to consider now what I believe is a very worrying development in Australian public life. It is a development that has been highlighted by debate on this bill. At a time when Australia faces some extraordinary challenges-the levels of poverty and unemployment that this generation has inherited from the Labor economic downturn, the slow death of rural Australia at the hands of native title and its ignorant defenders-this nation requires innovative and courageous reforms. Yet innovative and courageous policies, including this bill, are now regularly and bitterly attacked by the ALP, by some church employees, by trade unions and by journalists who are too lazy to believe anything other than what their fellow travellers tell them. There can only be one conclusion about opposition to this bill-those who oppose this bill, such as those members opposite, support young people dropping out of school and going on the dole. That is a plain fact. Labor believes that it is better to condemn young Australians, particularly young Australians from rural and regional areas, to a life of impoverishment and depression than offer them real choices, real alternatives, like education and training. That is a mindnumbing stance. After all, I can still remember when Labor at least pretended to have an interest in the welfare of less fortunate Australians. Perhaps there was a time when Labor regarded the seat of Grey as a safe seat. Today the ALP is simply the mouthpiece of the failed radicals and anarchists of the chardonnay set, unionists who have never stepped on to the factory floor in their life, and those whose genuine concern has long since been undermined by cynicism. Their opposition to this bill is entirely ideological. It has no basis in fact, just as the allegations about vocational education funding made by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) have no resemblance to truth. As the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) has already reminded the House, this government is not simply funding vocational education in a more central manner driven by the needs of young people rather than the needs of public servants, but is funding it to a greater extent. Funding is up $144 million compared with the last year of the previous government. Apprenticeships and traineeships last year alone were up to 98,000, 20 per cent more than under Labor. The youth allowance is not a savings measure. Additional program costs are expected to be around $25 million. The legislation does not pretend to have all the answers to youth unemployment. What it does promise is a new payment system geared to the needs of young people and their families which recognises that as Australians our first responsibility is to our children, that we all have the responsibility of ensuring that their needs are met. Further to the Labor Party's criticism of our reform process, I would remind them that in January 1995, when they were in government, they introduced the youth training allowance. Young people aged 16 to 17, either unemployed or in training, and certain 15-year-olds became eligible for the youth training allowance rather than the jobsearch allowance. There were three categories for the youth training allowance. There was the home rate, the away from home rate, that is, living away from home to undertake training or job search approved by the Commonwealth Employment Service, and the independent rate, including homeless. So back in June 1995 the Labor Party were already moving to this sort of process. Yet they stand in this place and criticise our legislation. To conclude, I draw on a few comments from a well-known overseas Prime Minister: The fact is that if we cannot solve the debt problem that we have inherited-the national debt doubled in the past six years-then those at the bottom of the heap will lose out just as much as everyone else. There, of course, I refer to the young people of Australia and the young people of the UK, because I am actually quoting Mr Tony Blair. Mr Laurie Ferguson-It was that bad under Thatcher, was it?",16
15,Mr W AKELIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Yes, well, she had a bit to learn. She was not perfect, Laurie. Mr Blair continues: Many people do not know that this year, as a result of the national debt doublingyou blokes only got it up to five times; Maggie only got it twicewe will spend as much money paying back the interest on our debt as we spend on our schools, as we spend on law and order and as we spend on defence. I say that is not a sensible priority for future, so cut the debt burden and we bring benefits to the country. That, again, we have done and a difference we have made. As I have said, this is from Mr Blair. I repeat to the honourable member opposite that, under Labor in Australia, it only went up five times; under Thatcher and Major it doubled. Another notable, quote I think worth mentioning in the time available, and related to youth allowance, youth employment and youth unemployment issues, again comes from Mr Blair: The crusade for competitiveness has to be a national crusade. It has to be one fought in every business in the country, with everyone in those businesses fighting together. My message to you is very simple. I want the trades unions and the trades union Movement to be part of that fight. Quoting Mr Blair again: We are not going to go back to the days of industrial warfare, strikes without ballots, mass and flying pickets and secondary action. You do riot want it, and I will not let it happen. So we have, in other parts of the world, enlightened attitudes. The final comment I will make this morning, quoting the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is: To pay people more money on benefit, rather than spend that money helping them off welfare dependence into independence, keeping them on welfare, is wrong. It is also unjust to those people. He continues: To insist on value for money and quality in our public services is not right wing; it is actually an indispensable part of securing justice for the consumers of those public services. To be the champions of opening up markets here in Europe and elsewhere is not free market dogma; it is the best chance that developing and developed nations have to help each other to more jobs, more trade, more wealth, more prosperity. It has given me great pleasure to make those references to the enlightened Labour Party of the United Kingdom. I would hope that my parliamentary colleagues on the other side might take particular notice of that, because that is the only true path forward. The more we delude ourselves with 'back to the future' type policies, the more we delay the progress that can lie before us. Therefore, it is with our great pleasure that I support the bill before the House.",18
16,Mr FILING,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I have never wanted to be critical of the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) because he is a good member, and I know he is very popular in his electorate. But I would warn him against quoting from Tony Blair, the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, in relation to employment or training programs, because Tony Blair is, in actual fact, quite an ardent supporter of Working Nation. Therefore, I would find his support as being obviously highly conditional. At some stage in the future, other members of the coalition may have cause to regret quoting or using Tony Blair as a role model. I certainly would because, as a fellow Old Granthamian, I am a very ardent fan of the former Prime Minister bar one of the United Kingdom, Mrs Thatcher, who did a good job. Tony Blair's government is building on the changes that were made during those periods of government-changes that obviously fundamentally altered Britain's structure and made Britain a more competitive and dynamic country and a country able to participate more fully in the world economy in that competitive environment. I will make a couple of observations, if I may, in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) enabling legislation. First of all, I would like to commend the government on this legislation. I think there are obviously a number of changed circumstances in our society. Yesterday, I was speaking in the debate on the Community Affairs Committee report on youth suicide, mentioning the most recent sociological research work of Hugh Mackay; his new book, Generations, looks at the three generations that comprise the majority of the population in Australia: the boomers; the predecessors of the boomers, what he calls the luckies; and, more recently, what he calls the options generation, who, of course, would be those who would be most affected by this legislation. It is interesting to note that one of the things Hugh Mackay points out when discussing these types of issues with people who are in the options generation, as he calls them, is the sort of impression they get that our generation-probably comprising the majority age group of parliamentarians-tends to look for solutions that we feel comfortable with to problems for the other generation; in other words, trying to make changes to social problems based on preconceptions and, in some cases, misconceptions that we may have had through our own particular experiences. As those in my generation would know, of course, in the early part of our working lives, in this country, there was full employment. So there was obviously far greater opportunity at that time. Then things deteriorated, more or less coinciding with the election of the Whitlam government, and have not got much better since-although in recent times there has been a marked decrease in unemployment. But the youth sector of the unemployed is the largest proportionally. For any person in public affairs, the fact that a section of the community carries such a disproportionate high level of unemployment is a matter of grave concern, and a matter that would require urgent remedial action on the part of any government. The previous government, the Keating government, addressed these problems with a plethora of training programs that, in many instances, were expensive, ill directed and often leading to the disappointment of the people concerned, the participants, finding that, after they had participated in a particular program, they suddenly found themselves back out in the wasteland of the unemployed. . That is the overwhelming perception of a lot of the programs that were in the Working Nation policy announcement and other predecessor programs. In this country education and training are obviously keys to higher employment rates. There is no doubt, as the member for Grey pointed out, that those youngsters who leave school at an earlier stage find themselves with proportionately higher rates of unemployment than those who complete their secondary education or go on to tertiary education. There is a need in this particular instance to look at a longer term solution. Short-term fixes such as short-term training programs, which prove to be expensive and in many instances counterproductive, do not offer a solution. In the short term they provide, perhaps, an immediate boost to employment figures or they may reduce the numbers of people registered as looking for work. But in the final analysis they lead to a greater sense of exasperation and lack of self-worth in those who were desperately looking for work in the first place and undertook those programs in good faith only to find themselves in a position where, at the conclusion of the program, they were unable to get gainful long-term, full-time employment. This particular bill is part of a comprehensive reform that is long overdue. On the face of it, it appears to have a number of protections and safety net provisions that go to addressing some of the concerns of those who are related to these young people or who are in the same position themselves. One of the problems we have to look at is the relationship between those unemployed youngsters and their families. Philosophically the coalition would like to see families support young people until they have achieved financial independence. That is all very well, but unfortunately in some instances we are finding that, in the practical application of government policy by the people responsible, policies can be counterproductive. I can cite a couple of examples in my electorate where the Department of Social Security has contributed to assisting young people to leave their families-in one particular case in circumstances that were quite distressing; in fact, it would lead one to conclude that the people responsible for making the social security payments in the circumstances that occurred were trying desperately to assist the break up of this particular family. The Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith), who is at the table, and the coalition government must ensure-and this is an effort-that there is a comprehensive integrated approach to these types of programs so that there is not a counterproductive effect. Yesterday, when talking in the Main Committee about youth suicide, I mentioned a situation where a desperate father with a suicidal daughter had sought psychiatric help for his daughter. He found that if he were to try to get Medicare, public funded health care or psychiatric assistance for his daughter he would have to wait nine months. In the private sector he would have to wait six weeks. He then found that he could not get medical benefit rebates for those sessions and that Medicare only paid for the first $110.11 of a program that would cost around $87 per hour. Here is a case where the government has good intentions in trying to address another facet of the problems of young people, the very serious problem of youth suicide-another problem stemming from the lack of self-worth and the feeling of exasperation and desperation with one's lot-yet the practical application of government policy was working against the family that loved the particular person who was susceptible to suicidal tendencies. They were unable to get that help without an extraordinary amount of expense. Here was a loving father desperately seeking help and finding the government was impeding the opportunity to address that particular serious and distressing problem. One of the most common complaints from parents is that the government has, certainly up until recent times, offered too much incentive for young people to drop out of education and training and go onto the dole. We have seen in recent times, in articles and in the sorts of vox pop programs you see in things like A Current Affair, continual examples of people who are looking at unemployment benefits as a career option. People see themselves as leading a life where they can pursue their own particular pleasures or pursuits, such as surfing or other things, in knowledge that they would have a guaranteed income through unemployment benefits or jobsearch allowance. This legislation is well thought out and it integrated into a package which should go some way to alleviate this problem-not all the way but some of the way. Young people who leave education or training early are three times as likely to be unemployed, as the member for Grey pointed out, than those who stay on longer. So I applaud the government's determination to try to remove disincentives for young people to further their education and training. I agree strongly with Dr Kemp that the income support system gives young people a misleading message that the unemployment benefit, the dole, is an automatic alternative to school or training. If the allowance does send the right message that the best way to a job is through education or training then that is an effective way of trying to create a shift in attitude. I do not understand, though, why the government has restricted the concept applied to the youth allowance to young people. The difficulty is that there is a feeling amongst young people that they are getting singled out for special treatment. Admittedly you could argue that that is because they are carrying such a disproportionately high level of unemployment. At the same time, if you were to look at Hugh Mackay's observations on the most recent generation's view of their position in the world, one of the things that comes through quite strongly in that work is that young people are looking to be viewed as independent. They like to be seen as independent and self-determinant rather than as being pushed around or directed into things that they feel compelled to do. That is something that governments should be aware of because any particular policy that acts as a big stick rather than offering incentives is obviously going to detract from the support of the very people it is trying to serve. I believe the basis for tying social security payments to seeking self-improvement or employment for young people is equally applicable to all Australians. There is good the cause to believe that many other Australians who find themselves unemployed would appreciate that particular direction in the application of social security payments to support people who are unable to find fullis time work. We are in danger of discriminating against Australians who are over 25 years of age by not giving them access and encouragement in the same way as we are proposing here for young people. Bear in mind that some of the people who are most heavily affected by unemployment are in my age group, between the ages of, say, 38 and around 55. These are people who also find it extraordinarily difficult if they lose their work to get back into the work force. It is another area requiring urgent consideration by the government. There were some programs established under the previous government. There is a particular organisation called DOME that has done some tremendous work in encouraging people of an older age group, in middle age, back into the work force. The new enterprise incentive scheme, a program that was designed to encourage people into their own small business, was another successful program of the previous government. Ironically, it was singled out for being chopped down at the time of Working Nation until there was a huge outcry from the people in the area of training and employment opportunities, who understood why NElS was so successful and how it was working successfully to get people into their own small businesses. The integrated approach between payments of the allowance and the.creation of additional approaches, TAPE places and training is a commendable strategy which should not be restricted to young people. I know the government hopes to break the unemployment cycle by concentrating on giving people the best chance of remaining employed throughout their whole working life, but they must do more for people who are past their youth. In other words, we want to try to give those people the opportunity of going back and getting training so that they are in a position to re-enter the work force in circumstances that allow them the best possible choice. A number of the main provisions of the bill go to the application of the new youth allowance. There is a requirement for satisfaction of the activity test. There is obviously a need for meeting the youth allowance age requirements: older than 16, or 15 if independent, and under 25.· This brings me to one of the problems which I think has arisen in the replacement of the Austudy provisions with the youth allowance, and that is this use of the 25-year age barrier for independence. That particular age was not singled out for any scientific purposes. It was not an age that people decided was a mean age for people becoming independent of their parents. The only reason they used the age 25 is because the ALP had used it in a previous incarnation and they thought they could get away with it. So there is no rhyme or reason to it and as an arbitrary age threshold it does not make sense. I know that members opposite, when they have constituents coming to them with particular concerns, will find themselves havit:lg to explain to their constituents, if they are members of the government, exactly why they have chosen the age 25. I can tell you of situations in my constituency, where there are a large number of people who operate market gardens or small farms or orchards, of people going down to the department and being told that they could not possibly live on the income that they had quoted as being their income for the purposes of qualifying for the youth allowance, and being told basically that they were liars. These are people who are thrifty and who are probably the sort of people you would want to encourage in the community because they look after themselves and manage to economise on their living arrangements, yet they were being told they were dishonest. They were distressed and were coming to me as their local member asking how it is that they could be told that, because they were actually frugal and able to live on a lot less than perhaps other people were able to, they were being dishonest in making their declarations of income for the purposes - f the income test. In relation to the arbitrary use of the age 25, I predict that there will be large numbers of people, decent people from middle and lower income backgrounds, who will come to the members of parliament in the coalition and ask them exactly why this arbitrary age was chosen and why it is that their particular circumstances are ruled out. This is a problem with having an arbitrary limit like that, that you will find large numbers of people who will make that particular provision seem unjust because of their own particular circumstances. I just hope that there is going to be some opportunity for rational adjustment here, because I can see this becoming a serious problem for coalition members in marginal seats. These will be people from the natural constituency of the Liberal Party. These are parents raising teenagers or young adults who are studying in tertiary institutions. They are people who are not on big incomes, and this is the great problem. I can recollect clearly from the days when I was in the coalition that when we were debating the Fightback program there were some changes made in Fightback version 2 which on the face of it appeared to be reasonable, but then suddenly you realised that they were going to make people who were on what I would call low or moderate income levels raising children, in many instances on single incomes, worse off. They are your natural constituency. The trouble is that they see themselves as victims of government policy because they are desperately trying to do the right thing-to make their sons and daughters able to participate in the work force fully, sacrificing all sorts of things that they otherwise have in their households to pay for their youngsters to go through university. They are looking forward to some assistance, because some of them are on such low incomes. Bear in mind that the threshold levels for the incomes are in area of the low $30,000s per annum. That is not a large amount of money; when you are feeding, clothing and sheltering two or three young adults, that is almost living on a subsistence level. This is a problem, and I advise members in marginal seats that they should start preparing themselves for the problems that will come as a result of the application of these tests. I assure you they will come, and these people who would normally vote for you might find themselves actually changing their minds if you are not careful. I want to make an observation about an area in my own electorate in which we are having some serious problems: that is, market gardening and small farming. My farmers, market gardeners and orchardists find it almost impossible to get a work force. It is incredible that, at a time when we have such large scale unemployment, when they advertise for workers to come and do the sorts of jobs that I suppose some might consider to be menial but which nonetheless are an important part of our concept of being a supermarket to Asia-because these are export industries; they are exporting vegetables and fruit to our neighbours in the Asian region-they cannot find the work force necessary to pick and pack it. Unfortunately, the disincentive for people to take those jobs is that they can just as easily get the jobsearch allowance. In some ways there is a slight contradiction in the direction of this policy. On the one hand, there is an encouragement for people to seek training and education as an alternative to being unemployed or to accepting unemployment payments but, on the other hand, there is perhaps a reinforcement of the concept that important jobs in market gardens in the supermarket to Asia program might be a tad menial or demeaning for people to take. I want to point out that it is critical that we could encourage people who are unemployed to look for these types of jobs as well, because they are important. They are part of our great thrust in providing valuable food exports into our region. (Time expired)",19
17,Mr MCDOUGALL,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I believe the youth allowance is much more than an income support issue. To explain, I have to go back 20 years, to November 1977, when legislation was passed in the House for school Ie avers to go on unemployment benefits at the start of the next academic year. This sounded like and looked like a financial kick-start; just enough to help teenagers make that important transition from can school to work. But for so many it unwittingly established a potentially destructive life pattern. That was, and still is, the reliance on an instant salary; a salary from an employer who asked nothing in return. The attraction of a regular weekly income without the need to have or to gain any skills offered many an irresistible option. It offered freedom from the discipline of study, for a start, and of course the chance to get out and have a good time with one's mates. When you are young and vibrant, this is an appealing option. For young people in my state of Queensland it means sun and surf. The ease in which young people could launch into their first year in the real world after nearly a decade behind a desk was made easier with a regular government allowance. There is no doubt that it has encouraged many young Australians to leave school prematurely. It has encouraged too many to avoid taking that first hard step into the work force. Some of us forget just how difficult that first year out of school was-going from a day which ended at around 3 p.m. with weekends free and long holiday breaks throughout the year to a job which would mean a straight 12 months without a holiday break and a longer day of concentrated effort. For many it meant standing up all day after years of sitting behind a desk. For many more it meant no sporting breaks, no interesting school excursions; it meant hard slog until body and mind adjusted to the new regime. That first unemployment allowance made available to young people who had never been in the work force was a means of putting off finding the first job. It also encouraged many young people to put their further education on hold, be it university, TAFE, an apprenticeship or a traineeship. As a result, the first skill so many young Australians were introduced to when leaving school was that of the art of filling out claim forms. Too few young people realise the value of education until they are well into adulthood. Not too many students are fortunate enough while still at school to discover a career path or an interest which they can develop into a career. The majority leave school with no idea what they are going to do with their lives. Many find it hard to get even the most basic job. Many do not have parents who can assist with their support, and many find it necessary to leave their homes and strike out on their own without funds or skills. Pensions and allowances are vital for these people. But I am concerned that over the past two decades we have also introduced thousands of young Australians to the welfare system-young people who had not asked for help. It is a well recorded fact that, within a decade of the introduction of automatic unemployment benefits to schoolleavers, the CES at Surfers Paradise on the Queensland Gold Coast produced the highest rate of unemployed on its books per capita in Australia. Leaving home to drop out in Surfers and/or Byron Bay has become a popular lifestyle option for the young. It is not a lifestyle to pave the way to long-term finan.; cial independence. It certainly no longer holds any social stigma to have no goal past catching the sun and the waves, and living on the scant unemployment allowance salary. Naturally, within a year or so, these young Australians lose their place on the skills pathway. They become professionally unskilled. In my own circle there is a 27-yearold single mother who, despite the urging of her concerned parents, chose to take the casual job-the casual job of unemployment allowance, the support route-and today is the unemployable due to the lack of a work history. She is one who found the allure of a jump in pocket money from $10 a week to nearly $80 a week irresistible. She is one of the many thousands who left school prematurely, not realising, until it was too late, that an unskilled career path would prove far more difficult than a working one. She is one who used that pause for assistance until it slid into a crutch for life. Now she bitterly regrets taking that course. There is no shortage of assistance for young people who leave school, but this government is creating more incentives to either stay at school or take on an apprenticeship or traineeship rather than a career of unemployment assi-tance. The government also says that it will always help young people who find it necessary to leave home and those who have trouble making the transition from school to work. That leads me back to this bill and the reforms it introduces. Now we are finally saying, 'Don't rush out of school simply because you can. Take full advantage of the education that is available to you for as long as you possibly can. Do not leave your family and your school in the belief that life is a ball if you are free from restraints and responsibility.' This bill shifts the focus from instant government support to the advantages of education and the advantages of staying close to the family during those vital years after leaving school. I was astounded to read the comments by the opposition spokesman on education, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who claims the danger of this bill fhat schools are likely to be swamped with extra students. I can think of nothing better. The member for Werriwa is not the only Labor member to be alarmed that this government's action might just result in hundreds of young people staying at school or going back to school to complete  that he believed the biggest losers will be young people, both those currently trying to study hard at school and those forced back to school. But let me assure the House: he is wrong, so very wrong. There are school principals and teachers who would be overjoyed if their schools were full to the brim with people wanting to learn. I have seen it in action in my Brisbane torate of Griffith, where the Principal of Coorparoo Secondary College, Bevan Brennan, has enhanced the curriculum by employing vocational educators. More than that, he has made teachers and classes available to those people who regret leaving school prematurely. The opposition spokesman on education, the member for Werriwa, should have been with me and the Premier of Queensland at the Coorparoo Secondary College speech night last week. He would have seen a celebration of not only final-year 16and 17-year-old students but also finalyear young adults who had come back to finish their high school education. Any young adult who cannot join the regular daily classes at Coorparoo Secondary College can attend night classes. This has been made possible by the dedication of the educators at that college. One of the features of that evening was that over half of those who had graduated from that secondary college were actually adult students. They make up over half of the population of that secondary school. I do not know why I am surprised at the statements by the members of the opposition condemning encouraging people to stay at school. After all, the Labor Party worked extremely hard to erode our education system to the point where a vast percentage of our students have trouble reading and writing. Now the Labor Party publicly opposes the is notion that young people are better off being educated and staying with their families than out on the streets and on the dole. If the introduction of the youth allowance forces young Australians to finish year 12 while staying at home with their parents, then I believe it is a worthwhile achievement. I their educa- support this bill.",23
18,Mr OCONNOR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I guess that was an honest attempt by the honourable member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall) to justify the measures in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997. It merely confirms the view of the previous Prime Minister that we now have in Australia a elec- government of the great punishers and straiteners of Australian society. The honourable member for Griffith talked about the benefits of education for young people and the importance of young people staying with their families. This is all very admirable stuff, and if you had one iota and one ounce of credibility to make those statements you could get up in this House in all honesty and make them, but let me just put on the record what your government has achieved so far. In education, it has achieved a massive drop in retention rates. That is your achievement. So, when you stand here and lecture us on this side of the House about what the Labor Party in government did to the education system of this country, reflect on your own record in barely 19 months of office. If you are going to stand in this place with some credibility on the issue of youth and the youth allowance, you have to stand in this place having not reduced funding for vocational education and training and having not reduced funding for education generally. As we know, this government has massively slashed expenditures in those areas in its two budgets. So, when honourable members from the government get up and try to berateLabor for everything from the failure of children to read and write to massive crime in society and then introduce a piece of legislation that seeks to punish and straiten youth, I think it is a bit rich. I heard the honourable member blaming the Labor Party for a massive increase in illiterathat cy among our youth. What else is he going to try to blame Labor for? The simple fact of the matter is that, over the last 20 years across the Western world, there has been an emerging problem of illiteracy in our youth. That is not a problem that is endemic just to Australia; that is an experience faced by all industrialised societies and developed societies. And there are many reasons for that, which I will not go into in this debate. Of course, in the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp), who is responsible for this legislation, we have one of the great punishers and straiteners in Australian society today. He wants to remove benefits to 16and 17-yearolds and he wants to send a clear message to them. He strides up to the dispatch box to send a clear message to the youth of Australia: 'We are going to punish you. We are going to straiten you and this is how we are going to do it.' It is the professor lecturing the youth of Australia about what he is going to do. This is one of the most dishonest ministers ever to inherit a portfolio in any government in the last 10 years. He is as crooked as a dog's hind leg. Mr Ronaldson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think that the expressions used by the honourable member are inappropriate in the context of this debate and I would ask him to withdraw those comments.",25
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,I think that it would assist the debate if the latter remark were withdrawn.,26
20,Mr OCONNOR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I withdraw any offensive remarks. The simple fact is that this is the minister who could not lie straight in He comes into this House day after day misrepresenting the situation for Australia's youth and misrepresenting statistics in his own portfolio, and people on the opposition side are expected to just accept this little punisher and straitener who comes to the dispatch box to lecture Australian youth about what they ought to be doing with their lives. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I know that the reasons why young people leave school early are very complex. There is a myriad of reasons. There may be emotional problems i the young person is going through. We! know young people are prone to depressionr at this stage of their lives; they might bel having quite extreme emotional difficulties. There might be parental conflicts in the home, and the home maybe a place where the young person cannot live out their life in security because of alcohol and drug abuse or perhaps violence in the home. It might be a case of sexual abuse and the young person has to seriously consider leaving the home. Of course, it might simply be that the young person has run their race at school; they are not suitable at that time of their lives for the sorts of narrow curricula that are being offered by schools which are under constant pressure from Liberal state governments and the federal Liberal government on the resource front. So there is a myriad of reasons why young people find it extremely difficult these days not only to cope in their home environment but also to cope in the school environment. That does not apply to all young people, it applies only to some, but what the punishers and straiteners are saying is that these factors do not exist-'We will force you back to school and all will be well.' It might be well if resources were provided to schools to enable them to cope with the sorts of problems that have emerged, but that is not the case. In Victoria the public school sector has been cut to pieces by a Liberal state government and the overlay on top of that has been a reduction in resources to those schools by a federal Liberal government as well. Given that situation, the minister is saying, 'We are going to send you a clear message'bed. and the honourable member for Griffith repeated the message here today-'it is better that you go back to school.' He misrepresents the shadow minister's views on this matter: we understand the pressure that these schools are under in coping with the myriad of problems besetting our youth. The schools of today are being asked to perform a task that can only be effected with any degree of efficiency and competency if they are resourced well, but under Liberal governments they are not being resourced well. It is with a great deal of concern that I jisten to members opposite criticising Labor tor our achievements in government and our attempts to come to grips with a very complex situation when in office. As far as this government is concerned, this Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill is the end of it alL Their very simple solution is to drive all the children back to school and make a grand assumption that everything is well in their homes. That is riot the case. The task of government is to respond in a compassionate and sympathetic way but in a way that is well-resourced and acknowledges the very complexity of the problem. We have criticism from all quarters:saying, for example, 'We admire the government's attempts to simplify this tion but, at the end of the day, it is not coming to grips with this complex situation.' Mr Martin Ferguson-Even the churches.",26
21,Mr OCONNOR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"As the honourable member for Batman says, even the churches are questioning the intent and processes of this piece of legislation. It is okay to say young people, 'Your best place is back at school', but, if you do not resource the schools, you have a problem. In schools in Victoria at the moment we do have a problem. They are under-resourced, morale is low and parents are working very hard to find the extra money to send their children to supposedly free schools. Teacher:student ratios have gone up, physical resources are declining and the experienced teachers have been pensioned out of the system. The problem with that is that the corporate memory within the schools has been lost, that vast bank of teaching experience has been lost, and you are leaving schools today with younger staff without expert guidance in winding their way through some of the complex problems our young people are experiencing. That is why morale in the teaching profession, particularly in Victoria, is very low. What of the management of the schools? They are not being asked to manage the curriculum now. They are asked to go out and get corporate sponsorship for the school. Mr Martin Ferguson-Don't they get plastic cards?",27
22,Mr OCONNOR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I wonder if the princi"" pals do get plastic cards, like the wife of the Premier of Victoria. If they did, perhaps they could perform this executive function with a greater degree of efficiency. But I think not. That great little punisher and straitener, the minister in charge of this portfolio, wants to turn all our schools into MCDonald's stores. He wants a MCDonald's in every Victorian school, so that the kids can whip over, have a burger, get a bit of expert training and whip back for the afternoon classes. That might be all right for the little punisher and straitener who claims to be the minister in charge of this portfolio, but schools are very complex institutions. They are different from MCDonald's stores and they ought to be legislafunded and treated differently. We ought to look at the record of the Howard government. We know what the record of the Prime Minister is in this, because the government is claiming, in this debate and in others, that they were left with a mess they had to clean up. That is a story to that conservative governments trot out when they will not even examine the facts. The facts of the matter are these: as far as youth unemployment is concerned, in March 1983, when the. Prime Minister was Treasurer, the then conservative government left Labor with 158,000 young people unemployed. They come into this chamber with this piece of legislation, crying crocodile tears for the youth of today. When we left office in March 1996 that figure was down to 91,400. You might say, 'That is not really a substantial drop.' I would contest that view: it is, in its own right. But it was done at a time of a massive restructuring of private and public sector employment in this country. We were left with an economic system that was ramshackle and run down. We had to refocus and reorientate the economy at a time when technology was being massively introduced and the entry level jobs for our young people were disappearing by the hour and by the day. The entry level jobs-in the banks and in the typing pools, for example-were disappearing for our youth. Over that decade, despite the massive change in the economic structure of this country, Labor in government managed to reduce youth unemployment in this country from the disgraceful figure of 158,000 young people out of work in March 1983 to the figure of 91,400 in March, 1996. Members opposite make great play of the fact that it is very important for young people to stay at school. We agree with you. We have no problem with that proposition-none whatsoever. But, when we look at your record when you were last in government and your record now in government, this is the picture that emerges: in 1983, under the Liberal government of which John Howard was Treasurer, only one in four stayed on until year 12. That was an absolutely appalling and disgraceful situation for an industrialised country that was trying to make it in the global economic environment. Under Labor, we managed to massively increase that retention rate to seven out of 10. What is the situation now? Under Mr Howard, who is no longer Treasurer but leads the government as Prime Minister, we have seen retention rates in our schools decline even further. I say to members opposite: if you want to have some credibility when you criticise Labor in government, come to the table with a record of some substance. Do not come to the table with the last Liberal government's retention rate record of one in four and do not come to the table with the declining retention rate of the current Liberal government. The crocodile tears that the government cries for our youth must be seen against the backdrop of what they have done to vocational education and training, what they have done to apprenticeships, what they have done to labour market programs and what they have done to expenditures on education generally. We have seen under the Howard government thus far cuts of 117,000 places in labour market programs that were servicing young people in this country. If you go back to the statistic that I quoted, you will find that Howard government has cut labour market program places for young people in excess of the actual number of young unemployed people-that.is, they have cut 117,000 places in labour market programs, and when we left office in March 1996 there were 91,400 young people unemployed. We have evidence emerging that over the last year apprenticeships have declined by some 2,000 places. When we go to the area of vocational education and training, the government has removed $270 million from that portfolio area. In addition to that, they have drastically reduced the expenditures in education generally. That is your record. That is the record that you come to this table and into this House to debate. Do not get up in this place, any of you, and talk about Labor in government and the problems of our youth, because, simply, all you had to do when you came to office, if you are talking about real education and training and real jobs, was two things. First, you had to maintain expenditures in areas where they were being effectively used-not cut $270 million from our T AFE institutions that were servicing our young people. The second important thing you had to do, as far as education, training and jobs is concerned, was to maintain the flow of full-time jobs to our youth. That was your task. Labor left you with an economy running at four per cent annual growth for four years. That is what we left you-the best scenario that could be achieved at the time that was creating jobs for our young people; that is, when they went through education, when they went through training, there was a job outcome there to some degree. What is your record? In your first budget you admitted defeat on the growth front and the jobs front for our young people. You admitted that you could not bring the Australian economy to a growth rate that Labor left you with. In your first budget you predicted around 3.5 per cent annual growth, and we know you did not even achieve that. Then when it came to your second budget you predicted 3.75 per cent, as I recall, and still the you could not even match the target that had been given to you by Labor. When you come to this table in this debate, be very careful of the criticisms that you make. Let me quote some opinions on this legislation from youth in Geelong. The Geelong Association of Students have expressed their view very clearly about this bill. They said: The proposed Youth Allowance claims to minimise complexities involved with gaining access to income support. In fact, the scheme will result increased family conflict, increased youth homelessness, and exacerbated youth poverty. For many young people, the proposed changes represent a complete withdrawal of government assistance. That is their view. The youth in Geelong in my electorate do not think very much of this particular piece of legislation. Of course, youth around this nation do not think very much of it either. That is why it is not being embraced by the young people of this country. That is why it has come in for such heavy criticism from all sectors of the community. It seeks to punish and straiten; it does not seek to come to grips with the very complex issues that are facing our youth today. (Time expired)",27
23,Mrs JOHNSTON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Canning) (10.57 a.m.)As usual, the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) seems to have forgotten where he is coming from. I just wonder how he can lie straight in bed at night after telling the sorts of stories that he has told us here today. He has absolutely no credibility. He seems to have forgotten that it was his government that had 11 per cent of our people unemployedand that includes a very large number of young unemployed. He also seems to have forgotten that it was his government that left us with a massive $10 billion deficit-a big deficit which, I might suggest, you should have looked at much more closely and much more clearly before you came into this House again after the 1996 election. The member for Corio talks about the retention rate of the 1990s, but the reason there was such a retention rate over those years was that there were no jobs because we had a massive recession on our hands. I seem to recall a certain gentleman by the name of Mr Keating who said that we had to have that recession. So let us not pussyfoot around and have the members opposite come in here and talk about credibility. Whatever credibility they might have had they lost a long time ago, and it is going to take them a long time to get it back. Mr Ronaldson-They haven't learnt their lesson, have they?",29
24,Mrs JOHNSTON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I do not think they will learn their lesson. All I can say to them is in that they are wrong because the youth of this country is embracing this piece of legislation that we are talking about today. I rise to speak in support of a coalition government initiative released as part of our first budget. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill is among a raft of other programs this government has instigated since coming into office in March 1996 and aims to ensure that all young Australians will have a better and a fairer deal. In practice, the youth allowance, to be introduced from July 1998, will apply to all 16to 20-year-olds and full-time students until the end of the year they turn 25. The youth allowance is part of this government's commitment to young people, whom I believe to be our greatest asset, and it is this government's greatest challenge. Therefore, I would suggest that it is our first priority to tackle youth unemployment and the issues that surround it. Young people need to have an effective voice in government, and we in the coalition want to improve the government's responsiveness to young people. It is therefore important that we as a government talk and listen to young people. That is a lot more, I would suggest, than the previous government did. That is why before bringing this piece of legislation to the parliament today the coalition made sure that those affected-and by that I mean young Australians-were given an opportunity to voice their opinions and to offer their advice on this initiative. In other words, we engaged them in a very wide consultation process. I welcomed the opportunity to address a youth consultation forum in my electorate of Canning, which I did very soon after the announcement of the youth allowance policy. It was a very valuable afternoon spent meeting and discussing this particular initiative with a group of young people. The intelligent and very thoughtful input that was offered by these participants provided me with some very useful advice on how to improve assistance to our youth and to of course pass that on to the minister. What has become ever more obvious to me during my visits to training centres, schools, colleges and job clubs in my electorate of Canning is the need for young people to be adequately equipped for a rapidly changing labour market. We live today in a world which is increasingly multi skilled, a world in which demand for unskilled labour is falling and the need for qualifications and training absolutely vital. I do not think this is a bad thing. With a new world economy becoming increasingly globalised and the rapid change in technology touching everyone, new ideas and new strategies will have to be forged to meet these challenges. However, I do find it of concern that such rampant changes in our labour market have been dealt with so poorly and so inadequately in the past 13 years of Labor government. This government recognises its responsibility to ensure that our young people become vital contributors to our society in both an economic and a social sense. We want our young people to have skills and confidence. We want them to have every encouragement to pursue their talents during and after their school lives so they are equipped for the modem work force. When we consider that only 30 per cent of teenagers are in the labour market, it seems obvious that the need to encourage young people in their training and employment skills is absolutely essential. The youth allowance plays a very important part in enabling young people to make that vital transition from school to work. A single youth allowance has a great number of real advantages. At the moment, many young people fall through the gaps due to the inflexibility of the system. The common youth allowance will be far simpler and far more flexible. It will cater for those people who do not fit neatly into the often confusing categories of various youth and unemployment payments that currently exist. Presently, young people who do not fit into traditional models of either full-time study or full-time employment are not having their needs met. They find themselves with no form of income support. I am sure we have all seen and heard the crazy scenario in which students can find themselves better off studying part time and claiming unemployment benefits because of the inadequacies of the present system. The current financial inequity which exists between Austudy and news tart payments can mean that unemployed people decide against taking up training or further study-not, I would suggest, a very good move. This is a simple but tragic decision for these young people as they cannot afford the loss of money they would experience if they were dependent on Austudy, particularly with respect to the lack of rent assistance. I have had many young people make representations to me about the dilemma they face in wanting to study but being unable to afford it, or in being unable to study part time and work part time because they receive no other assistance. This system, left for our children by the previous Labor government, obviously has to change. It is not flexible enough to suit young people's diverse needs. The Howard government understands that for some young people the patterns of the past where full-time study would immediately lead to full-time employment may not perhaps become a reality. According to 1997 figures from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, part-time employment of young people aged between 15 to 25 has grown from 23 per cent in 1978 to 29 per cent in 1996. The youth allowance will remove present incentives for young people to leave education. No longer will there be any discrimination for young people to invest in their future by choosing to educate themselves. I must have different types of people living in my electorate to that of the member for Corio, because many people, many parents, have young come to me and highlighted why it is-they cannot understand; indeed they question methat a person can be unemployed and get government assistance and not be encouraged to look for better rewards, better training or better skills, and yet people who do try to get themselves educated and do try to get training are actually penalised and do not get that sort of assistance. All I can say is that the member for Corio is very wrong and is living in some sort of fairyland that perhaps some of us have not yet discovered. Mr Ronaldson-In a time warp.",29
25,Mrs JOHNSTON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"In a time warp he may well be. To qualify for the youth allowance, a young person will have to carry out an approved activity, such as full-time study or jobsearch, voluntary work or another approved activity, or he or she will have to carry out a combination of approved activities which are equivalent to a full-time activity load or else be temporarily exempt from these requirements, such as through illness or caring for an elderly relative. Approved courses are generally evaluated in the same way as those approved for Austudy. This combination of activity load has a number of benefits for young people. It means that they have an opportunity to be flexible in their work and to study. Again, I think that is an admirable thing. Another measure of the new youth allowance is the introduction of the income bank. Full-time students will have access to the income bank. Through this, they can save unused portions of their fortnightly free area, which has been extended to $230 per fortnight up to a maximum balance of $6,000. This amount can be used to offset future income. The bank, therefore, allows for the changing financial circumstances many young people may find themselves in when earning income primarily during their vacation. This is yet another measure' which addresses the changing situations in young people's work and study lives, and again provides an incentive to work and to study. Additionally, for young people under 18 years of age who have to live away from home, rent assistance will be extended. Rent assistance will also be available to independent youth allowance recipients who are married or who have a dependent child and those dependent recipients who have an approved employment or study related reason to live away from home. Another aspect of the youth allowance will be the abolition of the education legal waiting period so that young people in lower income families-the ones whom the Labor Party were supposed to be looking after; the ones whom we are now looking after because the Labor Party has failed those people-will not now have to wait that three-month period after they finish school for their income. The Austudy minimum payment of $1,000 per annum will also be abolished. This will mean that a lot more young people are likely to qualify for payment than did in the previous situation. There were many cases where students who qualified for an annual payment of less than $1,000 received absolutely nothing. A typical example of this, of course, is that if you were just under the bracket at $999 you were not able to receive anything. Again, we are making sure that this does not recur. My colleague the member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd), when speaking on this bill earlier, mentioned the 13-week waiting period for a student changing between Austudy and newstart. This has been a farcical situation for young people, potentially creating very difficult financial situations for them. Under our proposal, this scenario will no longer exist because there will only be the one payment mode of the allowance. Due to the fact that the youth allowance will consist of only one payment, the complexity and duplication found in the current system of income support payments for young people will be reduced. What we presently have is chaotic. There are five main payments and 13 different rates of payments for young people to work through. It is no wonder that Centrelink's office and my office have been inundated by calls when people do not understand what exactly they should be applying for or how they should be working through that system. The effect of this current system is that, even when the most minor changes occur in a young person's lifestyle situation, they are faced with battling the unnecessary complexities that currently surround this particular payment. Often they will find that they need to deal with a completely new government department and new payment rates, adding undue complication and stress. When these young people leave school, they try very hard to find employment. The very last thing they need is to have another hurdle put in front of them which could create additional stress. That is certainly something that I would suggest has encouraged many young people to just give up, to not apply for the different processes and to not worry about trying to find work. It is sad that we have allowed that situation to develop. The new youth allowance addresses these unnecessarily complex situations by providing for a single payment and enabling a far more flexible income support system. In having only the one payment, the unclear divisions which have long occurred between the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the Department of Social Security are now being addressed. Such simplification of previous income support systems are already having an effect, as the new Centrelink initiative is showing. There is strong community support for increasing the flexibility and simplicity of government systems. Not only is the increased efficiency of simplified administrative ures beneficial to the taxpayer; in this instance, it enables those receiving a youth allowance to be more flexible in their approach to work, to study and to training. The youth allowance is a strong social policy of this government. We want to tackle unemployment. We want to ensure that our young people have a future. The Bulletin recently referred to Australia as becoming a 'welfare dependent society'. But you do not have to read the Bulletin to learn about this. In my electorate of Canning, I hear only too often how desperately people try to rid themselves of the circumstances which trap them in the welfare dependency syndrome. I know of young people who want jobs, who want training, but they find this hard to engage in because their parents and friends have equally struggled to achieve this. A life of social security benefits-the welfare from cradle to grave-is not what I want for Australian people. Indeed, it was the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) who referred to that yesterday during question time-not precisely in the context of this bill-when she talked about the 'cradle to grave' mentality. If that is what the Labor Party wants, fine, but it is not what we on this side of the House want. With families of third generation unemployed existing in Australia today, this government makes absolutely no apologies for addressing the issue of unemployment by using a wide range of strategies. These are aimed not only at improving employment but also at removing the mind-set of some people who, from a young age, make the assumption that unemployment payments are a viable alternative to work or to accumulating skills and training for employment. I make this point because it reflects a view that I have held for a long time: that there have not been sufficient incentives to go on to further study or training. Being unemployed from a young age makes it difficult for anyone to find work, and I feel extremely sorry for those people who battle with this concept and who put every effort into finding work and still find at the end of the day that they have not been successful. procedThe stigma of being unemployed and the feelings of no confidence and hopelessness can last for a long time and have a very traumatic effect on our young people. But this government believes in the potential of young people. We also know that people are far more likely to become employed if they are educated and skilled. The youth allowance sends a strong message to young people that training and education is the key to their future. Young people who leave school at the age of 15, 16 or 17 with little formal training or education will find it hard to get work. There is absolutely no doubt about that. The youth allowance seeks to maximise incentives for young people to study and receive further training on leaving school so that they will not fall into this very possible category of the long-term unemployed. We also see that parents have a responsibility to ensure that their children have a positive future. To this end, there will be a youth allowance parental income and assets test and means test which will be more generous than the test currently applying to Austudy. This will measure the capacity of parents to support their dependent children financially. We need to ensure that parents, as well as their children, are responsible for maximising the well-being of the younger generation. Indeed, it is the parents' responsibility. Of the 560,000 currently receiving some form of income support, 378,000 will receive the same amount they are currently receiving while 137,000 will receive more than they are currently receiving. The government is spending $25 million in the first year of introducing this scheme and is making this a very worthwhile and very positive investment for our future. Let me close by saying that I understand the Labor Party has been saying that this is a cost measure. This is not a cost measure to the government. The government is spending that additional $25 million that I just mentioned in introducing the youth allowance, and that is good for the future of our young people. This is a fine policy. It is a fine bill. It is a policy which is taking a proactive stance in encouraging the youth of Australia to view their future positively by providing incentives for them to develop the necessary skills and training to be far better prepared for our changing labour market and the changing world. I commend this bill to the House.",31
26,Mr JENKINS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"In rising to speak to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997, I indicate that I am in support of the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). It is a second reading amendment that highlights the way in which this bill does not address a number of the items that are really needed by Australian youth-the fact that this bill withdraws support from 18to 20-year-olds in families with incomes as low as $23,400 and the fact that it abolishes benefits to 16and 17-year-old unemployed people at the same time that the government has not introduced education and training opportunities that would fulfil the needs of those people. The government would have everyone believe that the only reason for this bill is it is attempting to simplify the existing system of payments available to those under 25 years of age. It claims that there is no ulterior motive or hidden agenda. It claims that this is not a savings measure. Indeed, the honourable member for Canning (Mrs Johnston) has just repeated that claim. But, if one looks at the explanatory memorandum, one sees that it indicates that distinctly for this bill there are savings. It tries to argile off that this bill is part of a whole package and that in some way overall there is a greater impact and perhaps additional funding, but it does not give precise details about where that comes from. The government claims that the existing raft of payments available to young people are just too confusing for young people and that this is the prime motivation for change. But, as with a lot of the legislation brought before this place, the government has failed to tell the Australian public the full story. With this legislation the government is abandoning a considerable number of young people. It has decided, for instance, that 16and 17-yearolds do not deserve to be supported financially if they are unemployed. This would mean forcing some 27,000 young Australians back to school if they wanted to receive support. I emphasise the word 'forcing'-the compulsion. The government has decided this without any regard to the individual personal circumstances or any consideration of appropriate measures to keep these young people at school. It has decided this without considering the impact of an additional 27,000 enrolments on the state school system. We should not delude ourselves that it would be predominantly into the state school system that we would find these people going. It has been said about the impact of these 27,000 enrolments that an additional $140 million in funding to the states and territories would be required, funding which the government will not provide. It has reached this decision without examining the effects that its own savage budgets have had on school education. For all the rhetoric from this government about its priorities, education and training have borne that the major brunt of the government's cuts. Obviously this has not been without its toll on young Australians. Of .course the OpposItIOn wants to see young Australians in education and employment. That is a point that needs to be emphasised because, regrettably, in this debate those opposite in supporting this measure have tried to portray the opposition as not seeing that as an aim, that we should see as many of our young Australians in education and employment. However, to just cut 16and 17-year-olds off benefits and slash the funding that provides them with education and employment opportunity is not the way to achieve that goal. The consequences of removing benefits from 16and 17-year-olds must be examined. Many leave school in the first place because of family problems, financial problems or social disadvantage, or because they are not suited to school. Throwing them off benefits does nothing to alleviate any of the issues I have mentioned. It means that they will be forced to deal with these problems without the income support that they previously enjoyed. If the government is really serious about helping 16and 17-year-olds to remain at school, it should encourage them by providing a supportive environment which addresses the difficulties they have in remaining at school. For example, the government could reinstate the students at risk program. This initiative the previous Labor government was specifically designed to identify and assist young people at risk of leaving school early. The government axed this program, yet the program did and would have continued to do more to keep 16and 17-year-olds at school than throwing them off benefits. Students require work oriented career education, work experience programs and expanded school-to work transition programs. That is without question. In that context the government must take up the pattern of growth funding for TAPE that had been established under previous governments. The government states that its jobs pathway program is one of the solutions. The opposition has no qualms about the job pathways program as a program. In fact, it is an extension and a rebadging of the jobs pathways guarantee program introduced by Labor in 1995. But, if a program like the jobs pathway program is to succeed, it must operate in areas where there is high unemployment. I have said before in this place that schools in my electorate, which has suburbs with some of the highest unemployment rates in Melbourne, do not even have access to the jobs pathway program-not one. The funding, I contend, has gone to the soft options, to schools in areas with strong labour market programs. I believe that for this program to be successful it must be targeted to areas of greatest need so that the government can show that it is serious about addressing these problems in the areas of greatest disadvantage. Another proposal that has been highlighted by some government members in the context of this debate has been the work for the dole program. The work for the dole program has that some serious deficiencies. It is seriously deficient in that it does not offer a training element. On that ground I have some reservations about the program. I was interested to analyse where the first rounds of funding for work for the dole programs had gone. The electorate of Scullin is part of the north eastern suburbs of Melbourne: the four municipalities of Darebin, Banyule, Nillumbik and Whittles ea. It is an area of high unemployof ment and high youth unemployment. How many work for the dole projects will be operating in the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne under the first round of funding of this much heralded program by the government? The answer is nil. I was interested to look at an analysis that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of 10 November, where against different electorates of this place and their youth unemployment rates were shown the number of work for the dole projects that were allocated to those electorates. I was particularly interested in a table that appeared in that article which indicates that the electorate of Cowper is alleged to have the highest youth unemployment rate, 29.6 per cent, but that in the electorate of Cowper, it is alleged in this article, there is only one work for the dole project. Whilst I understand that it would be contended by the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) that this is an electorate ably represented by a member of one of the coalition parties, it is an example of the imbalance between the rates of youth unemployment and the allocation of these projects. In the Labor held electorate of Newcastle, with a youth unemployment rate of 24.1 per cent, there are no projects allocated. In the Labor held electorate of Throsby, with 21.4 per cent, again there are no projects allocated. So I hope that the government will understand that, even if one is to disagree with the rationale for some of the programs it put in place, if members of the coalition, ministers and backbenchers come in and herald the value of things such as work for the dole, however we might contest that, or herald the advantages of the jobs pathway program, where we might get greater agreement, if it is not established that those programs are meetThe ing the needs of those areas with the greatest disadvantage, how do we then go back to people these 16and 17-year-olds who are being told ence. that if they are unemployed the best course action for them is to be in school and give them any assistance to get into employbasic ment? Why should they think that this type legislation should be lauded and heralded? In schools in my electorate, which try hard as all high schools would be trying to cater for students of varying abilities to learn and with varying levels of interest in their education, one of the observations that made about the types of students whom we are talking about here, the types of young people who are going to be forced back into school-forced back with great reluctance, many cases-is that they are attracted to types of courses that have the highest cost. The modem trend in the way state is going, especially in the state of Victoria, is that students are expected to pay for the accuses materials, trips and excursions for some of subjects. We are finding that those students whom we have been able to keep in schoolforcing when perhaps previously their motivation for staying in school would have been low and we have been able to keep that motivation by attracting them with courses that fulfil their needs and also create some interest for them-are being disadvantaged because they are doing some of the courses highest costs to them by way of materials and so-called 'voluntary' fees. Let us get back to these 16and 17-year-old young Australians who are going to be forced off benefits. If the government were really serious about helping these young Australians to get education and employment opportunities, it would not have cut the 117,000 places in labour market programs for young people; it would not have overseen the decline of case management for the young unemployed by the introduction of the new jumbled private employment service market. However, because the government is not really interested in any of these areas, it did all of these things. So why then the youth allowance? The explanatory memorandum gives the game away this time. It states quite clearly: youth allowance reinforces the government's . philosophy that families should support young until they have achieved financial independof The youth allowance represents part of this not government's moral agenda, which has the belief that young people should be at of home with their parents and should be financially supported by their parents. Whilst this as might be the case for the majority of young people and the majority of families, I believe it is a naive and romantic notion that this should be applied in 100 per cent of cases. In is some cases, at worse, it is dangerous. The government has completely failed to take the individual circumstances of many thousands of young people into account. It does not in understand that there are many young people the who, through no fault of their own, cannot live at home or cannot be financially dependeducation ent on their families. The conservative side of politics often this side of politics of being interestthe ed in too much social engineering. But what could be more socially engineered than some 27,000 16and 17-year-olds back to school without providing the necessary support mechanisms? This is all done to up suit the government's belief that parents should be financially responsible for 16and 17-year-olds, regardless of the individual's circumstances or the circumstances of the that attract the particular family. . It is perverse for the government to try to justify all of this on the basis of mutual obligation. This proposal represents the very antithesis of mutual obligation. It seeks to take away from 16and 17-year-olds without offering anything in return. This stands in contrast with the concept of mutual obligation, as displayed by Labor in government with Working Nation. Mutual obligation is about offering opportunity in exchange for the benefit-not withdrawing the benefit unilaterally. It has been claimed that there are some positive aspects to this bill. One of these undoubtedly is the extension of rent assistance to Austudy recipients. Yet, as is always the case with this government, the positive things it implements come at the expense of others; that is, 16and 17-year-olds on unemployment benefits being sold down the river to pay for rent assistance for Austudy recipients. The government did this in the hope that it could buy the support of organisations like the National Union of Students. Although the National Union of Students for many years has been calling for the extension of rent assistance to Austudy recipients, the NUS did not, to its credit, fall for the ploy. While welcoming the rent assistance expansion, the National Union of Students has stated quite clearly: The way that this government has configured the youth allowance constitutes a policy of 'divide rule'-setting some of the most impoverished sections of society up against each other as competitors for crumbs from the remainders of the welfare state. Many speakers in this debate have concentrated on the impact of the common youth allowance on young people. But we must realise that these proposals impact upon their families also. The parental income test that is to apply to 18to 20-year-olds living at home on unemployment benefits is another in the series of harsh and draconian tests that this government has introduced: for instance, the inclusion of the family home in the means test for nursing home care. Now there is the proposal that, if a 19-year-old unemployed person's parents earn more than $23,350 per annum, that person's benefit is affected. Furthermore, the benefit cuts out completely when that amount reaches $41,477 per annum. This is an effect not only on the unemployed person himself or herself but also on the family that will be required to support that person. For instance, a young unemployed 19year-old whose father earns $27,000 per annum and whose mother earns $15,000 per annum in a part-time job will get nothing. These people are by no means wealthy. These people are pretty much the typical battlers that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claims to champion. Yet this government now expects them to support totally their 19-year-old child. How can a family with earnings at these modest levels be expected to cope with the needs of a 19-year-old as well as everything else that is required of them? How will these battlers be able to feel relaxed and comfortable about their lives with this added burden? If the government were really serious about young people staying at school, it would offer them support to do so and offer them a variety of choices to reach their full potential. That is why part (2) of this second reading amendment is very important. It calls on the government to introduce education and training opportunities so that every young Australian has access to the education and skills needed for full participation in the workplace and and in society. It should not try to characterise these young people in the one mode. The government must realise that the needs of young people are diverse and that, therefore, the things it proposes should be diverse. Labor governments over the last decade have been very keen to see retention rates increase to year 12, and I think that has been very positive. Therefore, it cannot be challenged that the Labor Party does not wish to see as many young Australians as possible staying in education or going straight into employment, but it has to be recognised that those young Australians have varying needs for the types of programs they require. These young Australians simply should not be junked, as they are by this legislation, in the name of the Lyons Forum so-called family values.",33
27,Mrs STONE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I stand today to speak in support of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997. We are introducing the youth allowance amendments because the current system has failed us as a nation, and in particular our young people, over many years. The previous system facilitated early school leaving and a life on the dole as a viable career option for some young people who were having difficulty at school, who were perhaps not academically inclined, or who lived in areas of high unemployment. It is appalling to see the effects of this policy and tpe culture it created in places my electorate in regional Australia. There are many cases where we have second generation unemployed people. Some have never experienced the sense of contribution or status that comes with a job. They will spend the best years of their lives, their young adulthood, on the fringes of our society, dependent and often denigrated. These young and now not so young often come to be alienated from society. They have low self-esteem and they are trapped in poverty. In many cases the long term unemployment of these too early school leavers leads to self-destructive behaviour, making them even less likely to be accepted by employers looking to take on new labour. No 16-year-old should be allowed to be diverted from education and training in return for the dole, no matter how much of a hard time they give their teachers in schools. But that was the unintended consequence for too many under the old system. These amendments, coupled with our new training and apprenticeship policies, and our policies that are revitalising the Australian economy will change all of that. We have put many millions of dollars into making sure that Australia will be a skilled nation in the future; a nation will take its place amongst the skilled nations in the trading circles we now have to compete in. In an area such as Murray we cannot afford to have a single able-bodied person sidelined into the ranks of the unemployed. Our local employers in the agriculture, food processing, metal fabrication, hospitality and tourism and human services sectors are crying out for workers from entry level to skilled trades people, from technicians to people at the most senior management level. Our shortages of all categories of health workers is well known. This government has targeted Murray with initiatives to try to overcome these shortages. Too many of our young people who left school at 16 do not have even the basic literacy and numeracy skills they need to start a job. Our government has identified illiteracy as a major problem for this nation, and in our education policies literacy is the No. 1 priority to overcome. The illiterate and innumerate have always been handicapped in job placelike ment and advancement, and today in this information driven society this is especially the case. Employers want young people who are work ready, motivated, have some essential basic skills and are keen to learn and undertake further training both on and off the job. They want mobile workers who can be lured inland away from the seaboards where 80 per cent of our population lives. How will our amendments help? Under the youth allowance young Australians will for the first time have access to a simple system of income support payments that will act as an incentive for them to complete year 12 or get the training they need to maximise their job prospects. The youth allowance will also provide the flexibility young people need as they move from school to work. The youth allowance integrates the five current income support payments available to young people into a single income support payment regardless of whether that person is in education, training, unemployed or sick. The youth allowance will be available to full-time students under 25 and those over 25 who are still doing the course that they started before they reached that age. It is also available to that people under 21 who are looking for work, combining part-time study with jobsearch or undertaking any other approved activity, such as approved volunteer work. We recognise the significance of that volunteer work. We know that it often leads to employment in the long term and contributes a valuable service to Australian communities. People under 18 need to be in full-time education or training to receive the youth allowance unless they have an exemption. The exemptions take on board the fact that a lot of our young people are in family circumstances where they are disadvantaged. Young people who are not classed as independent will be subject to an actual means test on their family's means. There were some bedding-in problems in 1997 with the implementation of the actual means test, rural students. These have been resolved. Our actual means test will ensure that we have a fair system for assessing people's eligibility for payment based on their parents' income, assets and means. Over the years we have seen a system develop in Australia where parents have, to the extent of their means, supported their children to undertake further study, yet young people over 18 could leave school and collect unemployment benefits regardless of their parents' income, assets or means to support them. This was not a rational or equitable system, or one that helped the nation focus the funding available on the areas and individuals most in need. It created an incentive for young people having a hard time at school to leave school even though they knew that their job prospects were minimal. To say that the additional 27,000 students who might now be retained in the school system are going to be a problem is a rather incredible statement that we have heard too often from the opposition in this debate. How can an extra 27,000 students completing year 12 be a problem for a nation that has to become more skilled to compete? If the schools are not currently serving them well, then those schools must address those problems. We as a nation understand that schools need all the support we can give. The literacy programs, apprenticeships and training schemes that we have introduced are there to work with the traditional education system to make sure that for every student there is an education and training option that suits their intellectual, academic and life interest needs. The youth allowance reinforces parental responsibility to support children to the extent that they are able for a reasonable time. Of course it would be magnificent if every parent could be assured of the government bearing the cost of their children's education and support indefinitely. Unfortunately, no nation has those sorts of surplus funds. We have to make sure that the funds that are there are targeted to those who do need them. If people are unemployed until 21 or students unti125, we are expecting that parental responsibility to support those children will continue, if they particularly for have the means. The youth allowance also has a relaxed independence criterion for students. Under the current Austudy regulations, to be classed as independent before 25 students have to have worked full-time for three of the past four years, full-time being 38 hours a week. Under our new amendments, full-time will be classed as 20 hours a week. In certain situations, students can be classed as full-time if they have worked for as little as 12 months, provided they meet the specially disadvantaged criteria. This is a caring new policy. The bill provides for special safety net provisions in the case of homeless young people. The bill also abolishes the education leaver waiting period, which means that students who left study and were unemployed had to wait up to 13 weeks before becoming eligible for an unemployment payment. This was a very long time for a young person without any other means of support. This change will make it easier for students to move from study to job seeking. It will also help young people who have to leave or defer studies due to ill health. Almost 20,000 former students will benefit from the abolition of the education leaver waiting period. The youth allowance is a positive response to the educational disadvantage confronting many rural and regional young people. The amendments mean that for the first time ever rent assistance will be available to full-time students, bringing their benefits in line with the payments for young unemployed people. This move will make rent assistance available to approximately 70,000 students for the first time, including some 6,000 young people living in country Victoria. The estimated average gain for these students will be $31.30 per fortnight, with a maximum increase of $98.80 per fortnight, depending on the age of the student and the amount of rent that they pay. This change recognises the substantial additional costs faced by rural and regional students who have to live away from home to gain access to higher education. For students in my electorate of Murray, only two to four driving hours away from Melbourne, the cost of living away from home is a major factor inhibiting their chance to have a higher education. Unfortunately, local access to higher education, particularly at university level, is often not available close to the homes of our regional students. Figures compiled by the Bendigo Regional Development Board show that there was one local higher education place for every 140 northern Victorians compared to one place for every 40 metropolitan Melbourne students. Even in the one area that country students are overrepresented in-that is, agriculture studies84 per cent of university places in Victoria are in metropolitan Melbourne. As well as being forced to live away from home, regional students often also have to pay high rent for their accommodation because of the strong rental markets around the universities. Melbourne University, for instance, is located in the inner city suburb of Parkville, where students compete for rental property with professional people working in the city. This competition obviously pushes up rental prices and makes it even more difficult for students to survive. Rural students are already underrepresented in tertiary education. I find it appalling when I look at the figures-they serve as a constant reminder-that the one sector in Australia that continues to have declining access to and participation in higher education is young rural Australians. They do not need further financial disincentives acting as a barrier to their accessing higher education. Obviously parents and students in rural areas of Australia are grateful for the extension of rent assistance coming through these amendments, seeing it as relieving a substantial cost burden on them. These changes are long overdue. The system will now be simpler and more flexible for all of our young people as students, as trainees, as job seekers or as a combination of these. For too long we have had a system that inadvertently discouraged young people from continuing at school or in training. We do not do our young people any favours by paying them more to be unemployed than to be undertaking some kind of education program. We all know of young students in universities who have deliberately gone part time and claimed they were unemployed so that they could have more dollars to live on. Nor are we helping young people by allowing them to leave school and receive unemployment benefits rather than assisting them to complete their secondary education or to seek out the many thousands of new apprenticeships or traineeships that this government has helped to create. We must, as I have said before, help young people to develop the skills and the training that are going to give them a place in the modern Australian society. It is a difficult labour market for unskilled young people; it has been for decades in this country. However, in my electorate of Murray, which encompasses the GoulburnMurray-Loddon region, we have an unemployment rate on the eastern side of the electorate, in particular, of only 6.6 per cent. But the jobs that used to be around in local government, in the public sector, jobs where you could leave school at 16 and expect to spend your life with no further education and training, have basically dried up. We need our people in Murray to have continued to a point i? their education where they are highly lIterate and numerate, skilled, trained and work ready. Policies of the previous government left a number of our students in the opposite situation. In our area we have had some $400 million in investment in our agribusiness food industry over the last two years. We are major exporters. Having an unskilled labour force not only limits life opportunities for the unskilled people, who cannot get a job, but also cripples businesses that are held back because they cannot find the skilled work force to meet their move away from commodity production to high value added exports. At the moment, the harvesting of our fruit is reliant on approximately 4,000 international backpackers who arrive in the area each year-we hope-because they know they can earn very good money for work that they can learn to do very quickly. We cannot get the six per cent able-bodied unemployed in the area to do that work. But don't for a minute think that work that our pickers do is unskilled work. Increasingly, the way you pick affects the value of your piece of fruit when it goes to the high value added fresh markets inAsia. Fruit picking is not just a short-term working option; it leads to skilled pruning, to skilled irrigation practices, to pest control on orchards and to orchard management itself. We cannot get our young people to consider careers in orchard management or in dairy management because too many of them have said, 'I can leave school and go on the dole.' We are currently dependent, for example, on Albanians undertaking occupational traineeships on three-year visas in the Goulbum Valley to do the skilled pruning in the orchards. These people are only temporary entrants to Australia, and when they leave at the end of their traineeships they will take their skills back to Albania to develop Albania as a nation with world-class orchards. When they leave we could again be left with labour shortages. It seems incredible that, while our TAPEs are helping Albanians to become skilled, our own students in high schools and colleges have turned away from that work. We believe the changes in our policies will make students look hard at regional work opportunities. They will look at the traineeships and apprenticeships that are now offered by the Goulbum Ovens TAPE Trainee and Apprenticeship Services: the one-stop shop in Shepparton. Those who have had a hard time at school will no longer think, 'My 16th birthday is drawing near; it is time for me to start thinking about joining the unemployment queues, sitting on park benches down by the river and collecting the dole every fortnight.' The youth allowance will encourage people to complete or further their education by removing the undesirable incentives to leave education or training. The new allowance creates a genuine incentive for students to complete year 12 or its equivalent before leaving school. The investment in our fruit, dairy and wine industries is dependent on a skilled work force. This nation is seeing that need and is responding to that need. At the local level in my electorate of Murray, there are numerous examples of the commitment of industry and employees to work hand in glove with this government under the new vocational education traineeships. We now have in five of our colleges students who are undertaking metal fabrication courses, hospitality and tourism courses, and food technology courses. Those students are no longer teased by their colleagues who have left school a year ago as to why they are bothering. They know that there is a future for them. In the years that follow this amendment becoming law, we can expect that no student at 16 will look on from the sidelines of life. We will have all of our students participating. To establish the food sector, among other industries, as a major exporter in our region, we will have to put all of our efforts into having a trained and motivated work force. We are in the process of establishing the Murray region food export forum, as part of the Federal Supermarket to Asia Council. The first item on the regional agenda is a comprehensive investigation and analysis of ways to overcome the labour shortages across many industries. That export food forum is already welcoming the amendments that we are debating in the House today. The forum understands that they will make a major difference in how our young people consider their futures in regional Australia. In addition, we are looking to establish a Skills Centre as part of another new initiative in the region called The Food Experience. This will assist employers in the training of staff to industry standards and in line with the individuals needs and requirements of local industry. That was not happening two years ago; it is happening now. The official opening of the new Goulburn Ovens Trainee and Apprenticeship Servicestheone-stop shop-in Shepparton several months ago has brought a new lease of life to young people who now do not see work for the dole as a career option but as work for themselves, for their families and for the communities. The minister's recent announcement that the federal government will provide funding for 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in 1997-98 in high growth industries such as technology, hospitality and tourism, sport and recreation, finance, and in traditional trades is significant. While the opposition talks about 27,000 more students being made to stay in school and how that it is a tragedy, we say that there will be 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships for young people who can look beyond the traditional VeE-or year 11 and 12-to careers that will leave them as skilled technocrats. This is a government which understands the realities and the needs of this economy, and the alienation that goes with long-term unemployment. We are a government that cares. There is no doubt that schools will need some support when they first experience the students who traditionally would have left school at the age of 16, but I do not think any teachers that I know in my area regret the fact that they will be offering more students a greater life-time opportunity. (Time expired)",37
28,Mrs WEST,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I concur with my colleague the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) and endorse her remarks. Despite the predictable rhetoric from the other side, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 is not a measure introduced by this government to chuck kids off the dole. In fact, of the 560,000 young people currently collecting benefits, more than one-quarter will be better off and more than half will not be affected by these measures at all. Yet again, Labor have been left stranded on social policy, and their only response is to wage a scare campaign. We are seeing it with aged care, we saw it with industrial relations, and no doubt we will see more of it with this issue. What this government wants to concentrate on is the positive aspects of this initiative. We will not be a victim of the gloom and doom merchants on the other side. This is a positive solution to a growing social problem. What this bill is really about is ensuring that our young people have every opportunity to succeed once they leave school. It is about encouraging parents to live up to their parental responsibilities. It is about reforming the overburdened and complex welfare system and the already overtaxed Australian worker. The first issue I will raise is that of education. As a teacher, I have a great appreciation of the need for all students to get the best education available to them. For the majority of students this will mean completing year 12 and possibly going on to further education. This bill encourages students to do just that. One of the reasons this country has such a high level of youth unemployment is that it has been far easier to drop out and collect the dole than to continue studying. The real tragedy of this is that the former administration actually encouraged students to do this. By providing unprecedented levels of welfare to our youth, the former administration developed a welfare culture in this country that it is going to take some time to correct. For those who leave school early and try to .find work, their chances in a highly competitive labour market are diminishing. A student who finishes senior is far more likely to land a job over someone who left school after year 10. Of course there will be the safety net designed to catch those genuine cases where further education is simply not an option for various reasons. The idea of the apprenticeship system is also to be commended as an initiative to encourage those children who do not wish to continue to year 12 to get paid while they train. A four-year apprenticeship gives them a skill, a ticket for life. This is what welfare should provide: assistance for those who are unable to help themselves, not for those looking for an easier way out. An education is an investment in your future. Granted this does not have to mean a formal university degree. Education comes in many forms-traineeships, apprenticeships. Whatever form it takes, it all leads to greater opportunities in future life. The bill also encourages parents to accept responsibility for their children until they achieve independence. It is not unreasonable to expect parents to accept this responsibility. The youth allowance will be means tested that those families with limited means will still be assisted. Most parents relish having their children home, and it is quite often very difficult and emotional to let them go. Obviously this will occur at some point, but later rather than sooner under this bill. Again, there will be the exceptions-for - xample, when a young person is required to hve away from home to study or obtain work. This group will actually receive a higher rate of payment to assist with the added expense of pursuing their education or employment optIons. In fact, rent assistance will be availvisiting able to students for the first time. Another benefit of this bill is that simplify the system of payments. The current welfare system is cumbersome and confusing for the thousands who have to deal with it. The introduction of the youth allowance will - ationali-e five different types of payments mto a smgle payment. It will also signifiproperly cantly reduce the number of different rates payment. So you can see that this bill has clear advantages for the majority of our young people. This bill is another step forward towards reforming the welfare system in this country. This is necessary for a number of reasons. The most pressing of these is the fact that the gap between those paying taxes and those collecting welfare is narrowing at an alarming rate. What happens to society when the two come together? My children already face the prospect there being no age pension when they retire. Obviously this is not what I would be wishing for them, but it has always been there as sa-ety net. I - ill do all I can to ensure my chIldren provIde for their own I and my husband are doing and as my parents have done before me. lt is equally important to reform a system which outwardly encouraged young Australthis. ians to leave home, drop out of school and virtually drop out of society but remain very healthy benefits. While campaigning for the seat of Bowman last year, I was approached by several so traught parents whose children had left home and who could not get any information about where they were or indeed how they were. at These children had fled the family home despite the fact that there was no evidence of ab?se or even stricter than usual parental gUldance. However, it was being planted in the minds of these youngsters that they could make unsubstantiated claims about their parents and the government would pay them to run away. What is worse is that the department was actually out and about selling this fact to the kids in schools. Departmental officers were high schools to tell the students what their rights were and what the government co-ld do for them. If that is not irresponsible it will pohcy, I do not know what is. . To make matters worse, the parents were gIven absolutely no information about their - hildren. One parent simply wanted to know If her child was still at school and eating and had not ended up in a gutter of somewhere. This information was denied that parent. As far as I am concerned, this is unconscionable behaviour-even for a Labor government. The youth allowance will reduce the chance of this occurring in the future. Those who choose to leave home prior to reac-ing independence will have to satisfy a specI-1 safety. net c-iteria aimed at a person who IS especIally dIsadvantaged in terms of education or employment. For those who consider this to be harsh, take a look at what the current system has created. We have a confusing, complex and unfair system which of rewards people for dropping out. . This takes me back to the main point of this bIll: to ensure that every young Australian is a encouraged to further their education or employment opportunities rather than opt out retirement, as for unemployment. Much has been said in recent times about the appalling rate of illiteracy amongst our young. There really can be no good reason for Teachers are doing their best to provide the best education for their students, but they on are virtually bashing their heads against a brick wall in many cases. Studies have shown that 30 per cent of 14-year-olds have below disaverage literacy standards. The government, and in particular the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp), has set in place a strategy to correct this problem and has enlisted the help of various state governments. However, all these efforts will be for nothing if students are encouraged to drop out of school and take the easy road. Dropping out and living on the dole may seem like an attractive option now, but when the welfare dries up, as it inevitably will, where will these people be? I strongly commend this bill to the House. I can refer to examples in my own electorate, where initiatives which encourage youth to stay at school, to be employed and to be trained and which encourage the school to work programs are growing at a rapid rate of knots. I commend all the government services and providers for their efforts in ensuring that our youth have a transition education from school to work that really meets the criterion of a change for the better for their employment outcomes. I look forward to working with the educational institutions, the students and the youth in my area to promote these practices and to encourage training facilities at a local level so they can stay in the area to be trained to a level that meets the needs of a growing small business community. We have a vibrant small business community that has the capability of assisting our youth-those who do not want to go on to higher and tertiary education-and to see that the needs of the group that wish to go into traineeships and vocational education are met. I commend this bill to the House.",41
29,Mr ANDREW,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 and on the amendment that has been moved by the opposition. In common with most members of the House of Representatives, I am a parent, and I am old enough to be a parent of young people whose ages range from 25 to 15. I know something about this bill, I know something about the pressure that young people are under in today's society and I know something---contrary to the popular view opposite-about what is happening in the youth labour market. Much of what we have heard from those opposite has been nonsense, much of it predicated on the superficial view that the government is seeking in some way to make it more difficult for young people to be participators in today's society. That, as every government member knows; is absolute nonsense. With these changes the government seeks to give young people a sense of selfworth and real encouragement to further their education. As I said in my opening remarks, I am a parent. I am a parent concerned about young people and their job opportunities. But I know that the most positive contribution that my wife and I have been able to make in the parenting stakes towards the future of our young people has been to give them a sense of self-worth. I would not claim any particular credit for that. Credit for whatever sense of self-worth our children have ought to rest entirely with my wife, who always understood what it was to offer positive reinforcement. Self-worth comes out of feeling that you are needed in the community, that your contribution is recognised in the community and that the community is better because you are a part of it. That comes principally out of either a secure family environment or out of being employed. All the government seeks to do with this bill is to encourage young people to be employed, and it is almost beyond belief that we should be here encouraging young people to be· employed and having that encouragement frustrated by those opposite. What does this bill actually do? It says, 'We will make it more attractive for you to either be in employment or be in education.' And we are expected to apologise for actually encouraging young people to further their education. As I said in my opening remarks, what builds someone's sense of self-worth? It is knowing that they have an opportunity to contribute, and that opportunity to contribute is dramatically enhanced if they have an education. Of all of the parties represented in this parliament, we are the ones leastlikely to run some sort of academic line or to suggest that only the doctors and lawyers of Australia have a contribution to make, for we represent those who have been self-employed as farmers, plumbers and retailers, who know what it is like to be struggling for economic survivthey al, who know what it is like to be dependent on their own wits and resources and who know that education comes largely out of experience. The purpose of this bill is not to encourage young people to take up necessarily a tertiary education. Most young people with a capacity to be educated at a tertiary level will already pursue that option and recognise that they are doing so and making a contribution through HECS. Far from focusing on tertiary education at the degree level, this bill encourages young people who find school difficult not to opt out because unemployment has been so attractive but to opt in by picking up a TAFE course or an apprenticeship that takes some form of formal education with it. This bill sets out to ensure that young people stay in education. The simply reality and the statistical evidence is dramatic. The simple reality is that, if you are in education and stay in the education stream, you will have an opportunity to be employed but that you will lose if in fact you choose to leave school at 15 or 16. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), in introducing the bill, made that clearly evident. All of the information that he advanced in support of this bill indicated that those who leave school early walk into a much higher possibility of unemployment than those who stay to gain additional tertiary education. What have we in the government sought to do? We have said we will introduce an allowance which, frankly, will not be available unless you choose a lifestyle that will lead to employment. We are supposed to apologise for that and amend the bill and make changes to suit the purely political purposes of those opposite, ignoring what has been the dramatic problem of Australian society. We are attempting to address the fundamental problem of youth unemployment by encouraging young people to get an education, and the opposition expect us to be apologetic. Here we have the opposition running their usual scare campaign by suggesting to the mums and dads of Australia that the passage of this bill will mean that have to support their children for a longer period of time and that their children will lose employment opportunities. In reality this bill says, statistically and evidentially, that they will gain employment opportunities as a result of the passage of this legislation. This bill specifically encourages young people to be better qualified. In common with most on the government benches-including the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and you, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, with great respect-I have been and remain an employer. I know which people I want to employ, and my willingness to employ them has a great deal to do not with the number of tertiary degrees they have but with their willingness to work and learn. This bill says we will select those who are willing to either learn or work and we will set up the support systems of Australia in such a way that they will be encouraged to either learn or be employed. As an employer, I welcome that strategy. That is the strategy that ensures that the people who are in the work force are there because they will be productive Australians. All sorts of drivel comes from the opposition benches, from those who have never employed anybody, about what it is that motivates employers. Fundamentally, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I believe you know and as the member for Leichhardt is aware, as an employer I am happy so long as my employee is generating for me just a little more than he or she is costing. That is hardly selfish or greedy. There are employers around Australia seeking to employ people who will generate just a little more than it costs to employ them. This bill means that they will come into the work force better educated. As I said, they will not necessarily have degrees or formal qualifications from any of the major faculties of the universities around Australia. But, having said, 'Yes', we will pick up all those alternatives to school that involve greater depth of education, whether those be TAFE or some other support mechanism. We are expected to vote against this. We are expected to discourage this incentive to get young people into the work force better informed. On what grounds are we expected to do this, when even the statistical evidence proves that if they stay in the system, as this bill encourages them to do, they will be that much more employable? As I said in my opening remarks, I am a parent. I know what I want for my children. I want them to feel fulfilled in life and to feel they can make a contribution and have, as a result, a greater sense of their own worth. That is the healthiest atmosphere they can be in. I am not much fussed about how much they earn, because I happen to have observed an odd eccentricity in life which is that even those in holy orders who earn nothing can still be cheerful and see themselves as making a major contribution. The issue is not where young people are in status terms. The issue is not whether they will be employed as doctors, lawyers or, if working for me, fruit pickers. The issue is whether they will be more employable. That is the one thing this bill does. It encourages young people to be more employable or to be full-time students until they tum 25. Are we supposed to discourage that level of education, when most of us as members of parliament on both sides of this chamber have spent our time being inundated by parents who have said to us, 'It is a matter of real frustration that my little Johnny or my Jill', for example, 'earn less on Austudy than they would if they were unemployed and so they ask why they should be in SOme form of tertiary education.' They have been in my office saying it, and I have no doubt they have been in the offices of all the other members in this chamber saying the same thing. Why would we encourage a system that pays people more to be unemployed? That is, of itself, an absurdity. We as the government have done what I would have thought the mums and dads around Australia wanted done. We have set up a system that encourages people to be employed or, if they are not employed, to stay at school so that they will get employment. . I have heard the cntIcIsms from those opposite, suggesting that in some way this is an enormous penalty for the mums and dads of Australia and that they may have to support their children. If the mums and dads of Australia find themselves in a situation of financial stringency, they do not have to go on supporting their children under this bill. If you are a very low income earner, there is an opportunity for your children to be recognised as the children of very low income earners. But the youth allowance, structured as we propose, will be available, in one form or another and in one proportion or another, to all those who are part of families in Australia whose income falls somewhere under $40,000. That is hardly an unreasonable gesture. Let me hasten to add that I am very glad that I am not an Australian parent raising a family on $23,000 per year. That would be exceedingly difficult. The government recognises that. I am pleased and grateful that that is not a choice I have to make. It is also not a choice I am thrusting onto Australian families, because, between that figure and approximately $40,000, there are gradual rates of the allowance made available. I recognise that it would not be easy to be raising a family on that low income. So does the parliament and so does the government. The government has taken some steps-not as many as we would like-to alleviate the difficulty those families face. The point of the whole debate is this: if you are a parent of a child in Australia, you have some fundamental, inescapable responsibilities. I do not say that with any self-righteous air. If my children have not been a burden to the Australian community, it is only thanks to their mother and not their father. But parents have some fundamental, inescapable responsibilities to ensure that their children have a secure home and family life, have the opportunity for an education and are encouraged to seek work. Ms Gambaro interjecting",43
30,Mr ANDREW,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I thank the member for Petrie for her interjection. The reason this bill is in place is simply to ensure that Australian families recognise their responsibility to their children and if they are unable to meet that responsibility get government support and, so far as possible, deliberately encourage their children to further their education. Were the shadow minister at the table, the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), to interject that in some way the support had been inadequate, I would frankly be the first to agree. I wish it were much more generous. I wish the cut-off levels were set at a different spot, just as I wish the support we offer through Austudy was more generous as well. But that is not a choice that I have. It is not a choice that I have because, as a member of the government, I cannot escape the fundamental critical point that this government has faced for the last 18 months-that is, that the most important thing we must first do for Australian families, for Australian young people and for the Australian unemployed is to address the problem of an inherited deficit. We wish there were more resources to go around. We wish we had more money to make available to Australian families. But we are doing what we must do first-that is, putting the deficit before setting our family support mechanism at those attractive but unsustainable levels that would only increase our debt and increase our obligations to interest repayments. I think there has been far too much criticism of the government as an economically rationalist body and too many suggestions that in some strange way we have ignored our responsibilities to Australians in need. This bill shows that we actually want to meet those responsibilities, that we want to encourage young people who are from needy families to get education and that we want, first and foremost, to balance the books. I am a little tired of those opposite who come in here on a daily basis and suggest that they have some sort of monopoly on all that is decent in society and paint us as lean and mean in our approach to support mechanisms. What we are endeavouring to do through this legislation, and what we are endeavouring to do as a government, is first balance the books so that we have the sort of Australian economy that will generate jobs. If anyone wants evidence of the fact that the government is largely on the right track they need only look at the events of the last month and the currency crisis in Asia-the currency crisis that we are told may yet engulf some of our other neighbours in Asia-and how we have withstood that crisis, almost without hiccup, to get evidence of the fact that the government's economic management has been right on target. That economic management of itself has ensured that business in Australia has an opportunity to thrive. Thriving business in Australia is the one thing that will generate jobs for those young people that we seek to take out of unemployment queues and put into full-time employment. This particular piece of legislation is designed to encourage young people to remain at school, to remain in some form of education until they are properly qualified and able to be picked up by the work force. But, more than that, this legislation dovetails with the sorts of economic reforms this government has introduced to encourage small business in Australia to ensure that there are job opportunities for young people. Those job opportunities will only come out of a healthy economy, out of an economy where employers believe that the people they put on will be earning for them just a little more than they will be costing and where there are opportunities to sell the goods and services that are being generated. Too few Australians realise just how much the economy has turned around in the last five years. It would, in fact, be unfair of me not to acknowledge the role of the opposition in turning some of that economic base around. I am, as you are aware, critical of the debt that they generated in the process-a debt that we are now discharging-but it would be churlish of me not to recognise that much of our export performance has also been built on changes that they introduced. Too few Australians recognise that the most dramatic growth in export performance in Australia is in manufactured goods and that in every instance employers in the export market are employing the most young people. Every graph of employment around Australia categorically indicates that there are more job opportunities in companies involved in exports than there are in companies not involved in exports. The whole point of this legislation is that it allows us to encourage young people to be better qualified for those areas of productivity where we have to be at the cutting edge of world performance-those areas that involve us participating in exports and facing competition from round the globe-and ensures that we will have a work force properly trained and ready to make a contribution. The whole purpose of this legislation is to ensure that we have a properly trained work force, that employers around Australia know that they can take a punt on the Australian economy, that there will be employment opportunities and that there will be a pool of unemployed young people who are better qualified to be employed. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that young people are better qualified for employment. How could anyone-any Australian or Australian parliamentarian-vote against a piece of legislation that does nothing more than ensure that young people are better qualified to be employed? In the light of our present unemployment statistics, it would seem to be immoral to do anything other than support the bill before the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. NA Safeguarding the Future: Australia's Response to Climate Change",45
31,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-Since its election the government has addressed the critical issue of global warming in a way that effectively promotes Australia's national interests. Those interests lie in both protecting Australian jobs and Australian industry whilst ensuring that Australia plays her part in the worldwide effort needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. From the start, we have made it plain that Australia would not accept an unfair share of the burden. We have rejected and will continue to reject mandatory uniform targets which advantage many developed countries to the distinct disadvantage of Australia. We have also made it plain that we are not prepared to see Australian jobs sacrificed and efficient Australian industries, particularly in the resources sector, robbed of their hardearned, competitive advantage. Moreover, we have persistently stressed the need to involve developing countries as their participation is crucial to any lasting solution to the global warming problem. These principles have guided our approach to the greenhouse gas issue. There is now clear evidence that Australia's campaign for equity and realism has won wider support and so, far from our country being isolated on the issue, there is growing international support for the view that the approach of, say, the European Union is both unfair and unachievable. We have an obligation to defend and protect Australian interests, Australian jobs and Australian industry, and that is an obligation we will always fully discharge. We also owe it to future generations of Australians to play an effective role in the global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The government's approach to development and the environment has been balanced and far sighted. That approach is reflected in the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust. That trust promotes practical ways to rejuvenate the land, rivers and oceans and is the most profound commitment of any Australian government to the Australian environment. The same balanced approach is behind our regional forest agreements where the practical commitment to equally boost jobs and protect forests has resulted in 409,000 hectares of additional reserves through the two agreements so far signed. That balance is also reflected in the protection and management of our seas and oceans through the development of a national oceans policy. This will build on the $106 million already provided through the Natural Heritage Trust for restoring the ocean environment. This same consistent balanced and far-sighted approach has been applied to the greenhouse gas challenge. Today I announce the largest and most far-reaching package of measures to address climate change ever undertaken by any government in Australia. The package carefully preserves a unique environment and lifestyle for our children's sake, defends wealth creating efficient industries and promotes lasting employment into the future. It provides a durable framework to promote Australia's national interest towards the year 2010 and beyond. In a comprehensive manner, it replaces and far exceeds the random, disjointed projects of the former government. The world's climate scientists have provided us with a clear message-that the balance of evidence suggests humans are having a discernible influence on global climate. What is required is sober, sensible but forward-looking action to reduce greenhouse gases and this is the approach my government will adopt. Although Australia contributes only 1.4 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions we want to play our part in meeting this challenge. But pulling our weight does not mean carrying more than our share of the burden. Only with all countries working together, carrying equitable burdens, can we achieve an effective global outcome. This will require creativity, persistence and, in some instances, sacrifices-but the benefits of preserving our environment and quality of life for the sake of our children are too important to forgo. Playing our Part-New Domestic Greenhouse Measures For many reasons Australia is quite unique. Our economy has evolved on the basis of our abundant supply of natural resources and efficient production and processing of fossil fuels and mineral resources. Fossil fuels currently provide 94 per cent of our energy needs-far more than that of any other OECD country. Our population is expected to grow by 30 per cent from 1990 to 2020 compared to less than three per cent in Europe. We will continue to experience stronger economic and employment growth than most OECD countries. Our cities are decentralised and widely separated, resulting in high transport use per capita compared to the smaller, closely populated European Union countries. Our trade profile means that about 20 per cent of our greenhouse gas emissions are embodied in our exports (notably aluminium and agricultural products)-double the OECD average and the highest in the industrialised world. Our emissions profile is also unique among developed countries where the energy sector accounts for about half of our emissions, compared with an average of 80 per cent for OECD countries; and where land use and forestry account for around 20 per cent of Australia's emissions. This reflects the great significance of agriculture to the Australian economy. In addition, Australia has a responsibility to export the resources necessary to fuel the growth of her regional partners and to provide the food required for their people. For all of these reasons our emissions are projected to grow faster than other countries. Uniform target proposals that do not take these circumstances into account will place an unfair penalty on Australia and Australians. Reducing emissions growth is therefore particularly challenging and is more costly for us than for most other industrialised societies. But we are still committed to playing our part in cutting emissions. Without further action, Australia's emissions are expected to grow by around 28 per cent from 1990 to 2010. This is based on a comprehensive approach excluding land use change. Emissions from the energy sector alone are expected to grow by around 40 per cent. The package I announce today will achieve a dramatic reduction of a third in our expected net emissions growth from 1990 to 2010. These measures will reduce our net emissions growth from 28 to 18 per cent in that period, or some 39 million tonnes of emissions. This is comparable to the emissions from all the electricity used by households right across Australia. This is a realistic, even conservative, calcuations-in lation of the emission benefits. The benefits from plantations and land use changes, for example, could well be greater than we have estimated. With the most effective implementation of the package, the full support of industry and the community, and the best contribution of the states and territories we may well achieve even greater reductions. Taken with greenhouse measures Australia already has in place, the package will mean Australia's effort broadly compares on the same basis to what the United States and the European Union are proposing. Moreover, we are not waiting for others to act. None of us should underestimate the commitment required to achieve these outcomes. They will require hard work from all of us. The package gives the lie to those who make exaggerated but ultimately empty claims that fine sounding targets can easily be achieved. The measures have been developed against the background of our national circumstances and our national interest. They also have been developed against achievements by Australia to date such as reform of our electricity and gas markets, halving the amount of waste going into landfill by the year 2000 compared to 1990 levels and the efforts of particular industries such as the aluminium industry which will reduce emissions by more than 20 per cent over the same period. The government is seeking realistic, costeffective reductions in key sectors where emissions are high or growing strongly while also fairly spreading the burden of action across our economy. The package will allow us to improve the performance of our highly competitive energy-dependent sectors while also stimulating new sectors such as renewable energy. It will demonstrate we can improve the environment whilst generating new jobs and exports. Far from risking 90,000 potential jobs, as would be the case if we accepted some proposals, the measures I announce have the potential to create both wealth and additional jobs. They address emissions across many sectors-residential, industry, transport, energy, agriculture, forestry and government operan integrated, effective and, above all, fair way. We are prepared to ask industry to do more than they may otherwise be prepared to do, that is, to go beyond a 'no regrets', minimal cost approach where this is sensible in order to achieve effective and meaningful outcomes. The government is providing $180 million over five years for these measures. This package far exceeds the efforts by previous governments on addressing the greenhouse gas problem. Most of this expenditure will be spent on completely new measures, while some existing programs will be substantially expanded. Importantly, the level of Commonwealth spending does not represent the whole story. These initiatives will stimulate additional actions and investment by the states and territories, industry and, in some cases, consumers. Our measures build on those in the draft national greenhouse strategy. State and territory leaders have indicated their support for our greenhouse response and have agreed to work with us cooperatively in implementing it and in considering further action of their own. Let me outline some of the specific measures. Renewable Energy Renewable forms of energy currently contribute about six per cent to Australia's total energy needs, an amount comparable to the OECD average of 6.4 per cent. The government will be committing $65 million to ensure that this level is increased. By contributing $21 million, we will create a specialist renewable energy innovation investment fund to provide government and private sector venture capital for companies with high growth potential. So that we can capitalise on our skills we will provide a $30 million loans and grants program for the development and commercialisation of the renewable energy industry. This will directly support the creation of new businesses, jobs and exports. This funding represents a huge increase on the $4.8 million over four years spent by the previous government on the renewable energy industry program. And we will also provide $10 million for some leading edge renewable energy 'showcase' projects in areas such as tidal power, solar thermal power and photovoltaic technologies. The government will work with the states and territories to set a mandatory target for electricity retailers to source per cent of their electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. This will accelerate the uptake of renewable energy in grid based electricity and provide a larger base for the development of commercially competitive renewable energy. This enormous boost to renewable energy development is a huge improvement on programs such as the Energy Research and Development Corporation which had been overtaken by changes in the energy sector. Our new programs will stimulate innovative technologies and wealth-creating businesses and energy suppliers who provide power to communities, employ Australians and export to the world. It is, in every sense of the word, an action oriented approach. Energy Market Reform The possibilities for fuel substitution and innovation will be enhanced as we continue and accelerate the process of energy market reform. We will work with the states and industry to develop and implement by the year 2000 efficiency standards for fossil fuel electricity generation, including for brown and black coal and gas fired plants. This will ensure the adoption of best practice new technology in each fossil fuel class. Standards will also be phased into encourage emissions reductions in existing plants. The standards will apply to new electricity generation projects and existing generation. These initiatives mean that Australian energy suppliers will be able to stand tall when it comes to being clean, green and cost competitive. Automotive Industry In 1995, 10 per cent of Australia's net emissions were generated by cars, four-wheel drives and light commercial vehicles. We will implement an automotive industry environmental strategy, in consultation with the automotive and oil industries and other stakeholders, to enhance the industry'S environmental performance. This strategy will involve several elements an additional two including: 1. mandatory, model specific, fuel efficiency labelling; 2. harmonised noxious emissions standards with international standards by 2006; 3. a 15 per cent fuel efficiency improvement target by 2010 over business as usual through negotiation with automotive companies; and 4. bringing forward the phase-out of leaded petrol, taking equity considerations into account. The government will also develop a basic network of compressed natural gas refuelling stations ih selected metropolitan areas to encourage light commercial vehicles to switch to this more environmentally friendly fuel. These measures will reduce air pollution and improve the health of our cities as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Codes and Standards The government will also work with the states, territories and industry to develop energy efficiency codes and standards for housing and commercial buildings, appliances and equipment. For industrial and commercial appliances and equipment we will implement an improved labelling program and minimum energy performance standards. We will expand the nationwide house energy rating scheme by including a minimum energy performance requirement for new houses and major extensions and we will . work with the states, territories and industry to develop voluntary minimum energy performance standards for new and substantially refurbished commercial buildings. These initiatives will take us to best practice standards in these important areas. If this voluntary approach does not achieve acceptable progress within 12 months, we will work to implement mandatory standards. Tree Planting and Revegetation Plantations and revegetation are important means of soaking up greenhouse emissionsknown as greenhouse sinks. The government will work to remove impediments to the development of commercial plantations to achieve the plantations 2020 vision of trebling the plantation estate by 2020. We will establish a bush for greenhouse program to encourage corporate funding of revegetation projects to act as sinks. This will build on the $22 million for farm forestry and the massive $328 million revegetation program being undertaken under the bushcare initiative of the Natural Heritage Trust, which represents the largest revegetation effort ever undertaken with almost a tenfold increase on the funding of revegetation programs of the previous government--:which their successors in opposition did everything to prevent coming into force. Greenhouse Challenge Program The greenhouse challenge program is central to the partnership between government and industry to reduce emissions. This program currently has 100 signed agreements with businesses from a wide range of sectors. In total, companies that have signed agreements account for over 45 per cent of Australia's industrial emissions. Participants have committed themselves to reduce their forecast growth in emissions by about 22 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by the year 2000. The announcement today provides extra funding of $27 million to extend the program to smaller companies and to increase the c. number of large and medium company participants to 500 by the year 2000 and to more than 1,000 companies by 2005. Commonwealth Greenhouse Office In order to ensure this package of measures is delivered, a Commonwealth greenhouse office will be established within the department of the environment. This office will have responsibility for the coordination of domestic climate change policy. The office will be the lead Commonwealth agency on greenhouse matters. It will provide a mechanism to ensure domestic greenhouse matters receive the priority the issue deserves and the government intends. Other Measures Further measures as part of this statement include action to reduce emissions in urban areas, initiatives to work towards best energy practice in targeted industries, funding towards an ethanol pilot plant, the development of a national carbon accounting system, funding to support various national greenhouse strategy related measures, and additional funding to ensure commercial joint implementation projects in developing countries. We are also committed to reducing emissions from the Commonwealth government's own operations, including purchases of more energy efficient equipment and appliances. We will be setting fuel consumption targets for the entire Commonwealth vehicle fleet. Australia's Approach: Forward Looking and Global The government believes that, like our national effort, the international response to climate change must be effective in terms of meeting the environmental challenge, equitable in terms of the costs to be borne by individual countries and least damaging as possible to the living standards and employment prospects of our people. For these reasons Australia has proposed that individual targets for industrialised countries be differentiated according to national circumstances. Uniform target proposals based on a 1990 base year would impose a disproportionate, even devastating, burden on Australia. The cost to our economy of meeting a uniform target of the order proposed by the European Union would impose a cost on all Australians that other countries would not accept. Some industries fundamental to the health of our economy would be hardest hit. The non-ferrous metals, iron and steel and coal industries would be seriously affected, and future investment and employment growth would be significantly jeopardised. Even stabilising our emissions at 1990 levels would put at risk $68 billion of energy intensive projects and the tens of thousands of potential jobs for Australians that go with them. Significant regional dislocation would result in places like the Illawarra and Hunter Valley in New South Wales, the Bowen Basin and Gladstone in Queensland, Geelong and the La Trobe Valley in Victoria, Port Pirie in South Australia and the Kwinana region of Western Australia. Moreover, the European Union is not asking its own members to reach a uniform target. Portugal, for example, would be permitted to increase its emissions, under the European Union plan, by almost 40 per cent. We reject this approach of punishing Australian industries to carry a burden that other countries are not prepared to accept. It is far more sensible and responsible to improve the performance of existing industries and build new green industries to provide for both jobs and the environment. We believe the way forward is for all countries to playa fair part, with flexibility the methods used to reach the targets. We strongly support a comprehensive approach to setting targets which covers all greenhouse gases, emission sources, sinks and sectors. The wider the coverage the greater the flexibility to maximise environmental benefit and minimise economic cost. Australia also believes that an international emissions trading regime would help minimise costs of reducing emissions. We would support emissions trading on the basis of a satisfactory initial allocation of emission entitlements and a practical resolution of the administrative difficulties involved. Joint implementation measures whereby developed countries can work with developing countries on emission reduction projects can achieve worthwhile outcomes. Australia is looking to Kyoto to support joint implementation as a means of engaging developing countries in the global effort. All along we have argued that climate change is a global problem and all countries should contribute to the solution. Action by developed countries alone will be ineffective. Over time, developing countries must become involved-as by early next century they will account for over 50 per cent of global emissions. The Kyoto outcome should provide for procedures and time frames for negotiating targets by major developing country emitters. Australia's proposal for negotiated, differentiated targets is the best basis for a fair outcome which has a prospect of actually being put into practice and improving the world's environment. It is also the best basis for encouraging developing countries to take on commitments to reduce emissions. The government has said it would not agree to legally binding targets until their nature and content and implications for Australia are clear. We will not agree to any targets that impose substantial costs on Australia that are not faced by other OECD countries. Conclusions With the package of measures I have announced today, the government is not in posturing for negotiating purposes with theoretical targets but is already taking practical steps to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. It is a package that goes well beyond what any prevIous government has sought to do. It is a package that puts Australia at the forefront of international action. And it is a package that Australia will implement even if the international community fails to reach agreement at Kyoto. As I have demonstrated to date, my government will continue to stand up for the Australian national interest, jobs and economy in the international negotiations. We will not agree to an outcome that of burdens Australia and Australians manner. My government has had some success in our efforts to argue the case that an effective result at Kyoto will require an equitable approach. We have managed to shift the international debate. As a result of our efforts, there is greater recognition of the need to into account individual national circumstances if there is to be a successful outcome-as the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair, acknowof ledged to me in our recent discussions. There is also greater recognition of the need for flexibility to ensure countries can make a contribution to the global effort. At the South Pacific Forum and most recently at CHOGM we were successful in gaining acceptance of the need for global engagement by both developed and developgovernment ing countries. Nevertheless, let there be no doubt the Kyoto negotiations will be very difficult. Australia's environment minister, Senator Robert Hill, who will be leading our delegthink ation at Kyoto, will be doing his utmost to secure an agreement that will both be fair equitable to Australia and Australians and effective in reducing global emissions. Ultimately, the success of our domestic measures depends upon the goodwill, commitbeen ment and action by ordinary Australians, consumers, farmers, families, firms and industry groups, as well as governments the federal, state, and local. The greenhouse . accepted. challenge is theirs and quality of life of our children depends upon their strength of arguing purpose. Mr Speaker, I present a copy of the followsentative ing paper and appendix: Safeguarding the Future: Australia's sponse to Climate Change-Ministerial start Statement, 20 November, 1997 Motion (by Mr Reith) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Motion (by Mr Reith)-by leave-agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader the Opposition speaking for a period not exceedin an unfair ing 27 minutes.",47
32,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I thank the House for that extension of time. That was a modest, frightened little effort, witnessed by a very modest proportion of the government's back bench and ministry . We had more people in take this chamber to witness the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) than he bothered to have himself. Apart from the rostered ranks the myrmidons to sit behind him for the purposes of television tonight, there was nobody here. I have to say for the government's back bench that they exercised sounder judgment than we did. I will get to the dimensions of the domestic fig leaf contained in this statement a little later, but what is the central problem for this and this nation now? It is this: nobody internationally and very few people domestically believe that this Prime Minister and this government consider that greenhouse gas emissions are a substantial environmental, economic and social problem. They do not that because they have witnessed the deeds of this government and listened to the and words of this government for the last 18 be months; deeds and words which have gone into partial reversal during the course of the Prime Minister's statements. The deeds have the annihilation of just about all greenhouse gas related programs funded by this government. The words have cast doubt on science which is now virtually universally The only statesman internationally who is that way is the Prime Minister of this country. When he goes-or when his repregoes to Kyoto; he does not go himself-he carries the baggage of a massive philosophical handicap in the perception of Rethe people he will be dealing with. He will a long way behind; but, to protect the interests of this nation and to protect the interests of future generations, he has to go a long way ahead. He has been given a darned near impossible task. We have had 18 months of casting doubt on the science and 18 months in which we have been told about the loss of 90,000 jobs if this Prime Minister's objectives are not pursued. I think the time has come to analyse the figures and reflect on this. The loss of those 90,000 jobs, which are supposedly going to be lost over the best part of a decade, has been complained about by a Prime Minister who has managed· to knock off 50,000 full time jobs in 18 months. That puts it in some perspective: 90,000 jobs over the best part of a decade",53
33,Mr KERR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Potential jobs.,54
34,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Potential jobs-and 50,000 actual full-time jobs that have gone out the back door since this government has been in office over the last 18 months. That is the perspective. What is this 90,000 jobs study that we are all supposed to bow before? The automaticity of this has been asserted in the shorthand statements by the government. When you actually look at their figures, this ed by the most impossible set of worse case scenarios associated with it. The figure of 90,000 jobs comes from an assessment or a survey of all the state governments of all the projects over $100 million that might be in the pipeline over the period of time that we are considering-the next 10 years. We all know, from our own experience, the percentage of these projects that actually go ahead. It is the best case wish list to produce the worse case scenario. What do we get from this $68 billion? The final decision on whether these projects will proceed will be made in the next five years. If all projects proceeded-the whole darn lot-it is estimated that around 90,000 long term jobs 'may' be created, with additional short-term jobs in the construction phase. The assumption of this 90,000 has been waved like a banner before the Australian people. The problems that are going to be created by greenhouse gas emissions have not been waved like a banner; it is the 90,000 jobs that have been waved like a banner in front of the faces of the Australian people. The chances of those projects going ahead in all the best possible circumstances to produce that total is the most optimistic scenario. The notion that, if we sign up to any set of targets, 90,000 jobs would be lost is the most pessimistic scenario. But what we do know about this government is that its record of job creation has knocked off more than half of these full-time jobs in 18 months. Let us all get that in perspective. These are bogus numbers for the purpose of debate. They are there for the purpose of debate, not for the purpose of serious analysis. What is the circumstance in which all of these projects will disappear, or might all disappear, according to this? It is the adoption of the European optimal target. That is basically the circumstance which would create it. Not a single nation on this earth believes that whatever emerges from Kyoto is going to be the European optimal target. Not one nation on earth believes that-but it is an underlying assumption for the creation of this figure of 90,000 full-time job losses. Nobody in Europe believes that that particular European target is is surroundgoing to be the target created. What we have heard today is that Labor's programs on energy and the environment were the solution. We heard of the value of all of our initiatives with the states. There is no acknowledgment, but the negotiations with the states that he has announced have been going on for ages, and the programs associated with them for some considerable time. The Prime Minister acknowledges the efforts of business in relation to the greenhouse challenge. So do we-who set it up? That has been announced again witnout any accreditation. He acknowledges the significance of the regional forest agreements. Thanks a lot. When we were setting down the principles for all of that over the course of the last four or five years and we were arguing the case and the needs, including in relation to their potential impact on greenhouse gas emissions, what were they doing in opposition? They were saying that we were trying to destroy jobs-that is what they were doing. They were opposing what we were doing on regional forest agreements, and now he wraps himself in the flag of regional forest agreements to give himself some ice to skate on as far as this agreement is concerned. Finally, we come to the extraordinary admission that, after all the scaremongering about 90,000 jobs, the greenhouse abatement measures can create jobs. Here we have a new logic. All of the Labor Party's efforts on the regional forest agreements and on the research programs and everything else, all of the Labor Party's efforts in what produced much greater business efficiencies as they took up greenhouse challenge opportunities, did not create jobs. But when the government does the same, they do create jobs. That is the new logic of this government for the purpose of debate. What we have here-and I suppose we ought to be grateful for it-is that, in building on the programs that we put in place and that he destroyed, the government has created for itself a fig leaf. It is a fig leaf of which the Prime Minister was inordinately proud in his presentation here today. Here, in this issue, a defining challenge for world political leadership. Greenhouse gas emissions do not respect national borders. The problem resists easy solution; it requires energy, unity, purpose and courage. The Prime Minister and this government have greeted it with their customary withering incompetence. There are two problems here: the Prime Minister's manifestly inadequate effort on a domestic abatement strategy-I will get to that later-and his incompetence in international negotiations. The government's onechord symphony on greenhouse for over a year has been differentiation. We have no problem with that as an idea-but differentiation from what? Where is Australia's target? We have a weak and sneaky position here on a target. The restored Labor programs can cut growth in emissions by a third by 2010, he tells us. Indeed, he tells us a lot more and we would agree; they would cut them by an awful lot more than one-third if those Labor initiatives are properly implemented and followed through. But he will not sign up to any target. And he has only announced this reinstatement nine days before the Kyoto conference. The problem is that the government cannot walk away from a target. They are on the record. The Prime Minister himself said, on 6 October this year: To deliver that outcomethat is, a good greenhouse resultrequires different targets for different countries in different situations. Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment, and Mr Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, are also on the record. Senator Hill said: Obviously it requires differentiated targets. Our prop?s- is to negotiate individual country targets. RealIstIc targets are part of the Kyoto negotiations. They help ensure compliance which in tum leads to better environmental outcomes. Mr Howard said that to deliver the outcome of a good greenhouse result requires different targets for different situations. What is the target that you can discern in all of this? Targets have not really been set in this statement. There is no comparison against another is proposition and a statement, 'I will take that forward and that will be the argument I will be presenting.' The best you can do, looking through all of this, is that Senator Hill will go to Kyoto and state, 'We do not have a view on an international target and our contribution to the massive problem that you are all confronting is to increase emissions by 20 per cent. That is our target.' That is a good starting point for the discussions to establish and restore credibility to defend the Australian national interest as he sits himself down with his colleagues! . Where is the government's target for the mternational position? It does not like the European one. Fine, we do not like it either. It does not like the Japanese one of a five per cent reduction on 1990 levels by 2010. It does not endorse the US target of 1990 levels by 2008-2012. It does not like the opposition's one, which is very similar to that of the US: stabilisation at 1990 levels by 2010. So what target does it want? A small tip: if you are going to negotiate a target, you had better have one by the time you tum up there. It is not a bad idea. Commentators hint sagely that the government is protecting its negotiating position for Kyoto. The government nods, similarly sagely, and says, 'Yes, that is what we are doing. We are protecting our negotiating position for Kyoto.' Sorry, we sit opposite the government every day, we have an opportunity to observe it at play and we know it better than that. It is always a safe assumption with this government that if its speech bubble is blank its thought bubble is blank as well. So often, even when the speech bubble is overflowing the thought bubble is still blank. I said before that the Prime Minister is clutching for a fig leaf with this announcement today. Having happily shed greenhouse programs in the last two budgets, just as the international debate has been intensifying towards Kyoto, the Prime Minister has been a man desperately in search of cover. This is why we have seen the spectacle, whenever anybody softens their position on greenhouse by the slightest amount, of the Prime Minister out there with a pathetic claim that somehow or other they were influenced by Australia. Where has Australia's dignity gone when the Prime Minister has to drag himself around the world like Orphan Annie, pleading with people that we should not be flogged? He sent Australia begging to the South Pacific forum; he had us begging at CHOGM. While all of this pleading has been going on, where has the groundwork been to lock in a decent international regime? For the first time the Prime Minister included in a speech a number of the elements of a decent international regime, which are actually critical to this country but which other people do not necessarily hold as an appropriate course to be followed by countries that are making a contribution because they, in many ways, reflect that differentiated and unique Australian contribution and possibility. They are utterly critical for us to get up at Kyoto. If we are going to meet any set of targets, mandatory or anything else, then if these issues are not accepted we are going to be in diabolical trouble. There is a very important negotiating task to be done by the Prime Minister in this regard. The Prime Minister is evidently determined to put the Minister for the Environment in a position where he is going to do this very difficult negotiating with only fig leaf protection to start his bargaining position. Where has the groundwork been on the inclusion of carbon sinks, for example, in the global abatement equation? We must have the opportunity to address our target by reafforestation programs, like Labor's one billion trees. These are programs which can also provide valuable employment opportunities for our young unemployed, control of soil erosion and relief of pressure on our native forests by providing an expanded timber resource stream to ensure continuing opportunity for our forestry and timber industries. The Prime Minister indirectly talked about those sorts of things. These are not issues that the Europeans will regard as appropriate and I do not think the Americans are all that interested. Certainly nobody in Asia, where they want to chop the trees down, is too keen on having these things credited. But if we do not get them credited, we are in trouble. There is no useful global agreement which does not include developing countries. We agree with the Prime Minister on that. They can be brought in by allowing joint implementation of greenhouse reduction measures in developing countries, funded by developed countries like Australia, where we can claim recognition against our greenhouse gas reduction targets for undertaking such measures. The whole effect of the Prime Minister's posture on this point has been to note that no agreement works without the Third World being brought into the process in some way, but his stance internationally has been to encourage them not to think about it-to encourage them not to arrive at conclusions. Where are we going to go when we want the credits for that? We also need credit for our highly efficient production processes, particularly in energy intensive industries such as aluminium smelting. By locating this kind of activity here using efficient processes rather than offshore using less efficient processes, we should get credit for the global emissions we save. What sort of credit are we going to get for this vitally important argument if we tum up in Kyoto and say, 'We've sort of got a target, team. It is sort of to increase by 20 per cent. While we are increasing by 20 per cent, will you kindly recognise the carbon sinks? Will you please recognise our capacity in regard to other people's energy intensive production here? Will you kindly recognise that, if you produce aluminium in Australia, you are going to put yourself in a situation where you get a bit of a credit for that exercise?' I do not think so, I am afraid. This is a negotiating strategy which beggars belief. In fact all of John Howard's posturing has encouraged developing countries to try and stay out. That is a recipe for failure at Kyoto. Let there be no mistake about what the Prime Minister has done here today. He is just announced that he will fill in just under half of hole he dug himself in his two budgets. Here is the simple equation: $400 million dollars of Labor's programs cut; $180 million back in-the John Howard greenhouse equation. To mix a metaphor, we all know what happens when you get only halfway through a backflip, you land on your head. we think that the ideas he has offered up today are perfectly laudable. They are good ideas and there is a reason for my saying that-because we recognise with them some pride of authorship. Let me go through what was cut out before anything was replaced today: the abolition of the Energy Research and Development Corporation, a cut of $37.7 million, seriously threatening the development and commercialisation of innovative new and renewable energy projects, and I might say a direct breach of a coalition election commitment; the slashing of funding to the national energy efficiency program to the tune of $14 million over four years, which meant substantially less money for the raft of energy efficiency programs and the termination of the enterprise energy audit program-audit program reinstated; cutting funding to the national greenhouse research program by $1.6 million and the national pollution inventory by $600,000; slashing funding to the cooperative research centres by $10 million over the next two years, leaving the future of centres like the renewable energy CRC in Perth shaky; and abolishing the Labor government's one billion trees program. Together these cuts represent a direct cut of $100 million from Labor Party's greenhouse abatement and related programs. In addition, the government abolished the LEAP program and thereby abandoned the chance to train young people for jobs that assist in greenhouse abatement. That was a cut of $300 million. Let us look at what has been put in place in just a couple of areas. We have a total of $13.5 million in energy programs on greenhouse. One is accelerating energy market reform. Thanks very much; we started that in 1991. How much did John Howard cut out of Labor's national energy efficiency program? Fourteen million dollars-$14 million out; $13.5 million back in. We have $61.4 million on renewable energy programs-very laudable measures. We know because we set up the Energy Research and Development Corporation, the ERDC, which John Howard abolished, cutting $37 million. Now he has incentives, loans and grants to get into renewable energy. But how many of those research projects will have survived in the interim? The research base has been all but stripped away and we are back to square one. All those loan schemes and the others related to them are to develop decent research, but you cannot develop a darned thing if you actually have not done the research to start off with. If the research base has been stripped away, all that loan money sits out there marking time waiting for somebody to do it again. This government has put in place $40 million into its Green Corps. Put that in the context of $300 million ripped out by abolishing LEAP. The better cities program and all its associated programs on encouraging public transport were cut out by this government. This document does not mention public transport once. This government re-announces a $2 million program for an ethanol pilot plant, the same government that abolished the ethanol bounty in 1996-a $21 million dollar cut. Ten steps backwards; one step forward. There is one new thing in their propositions which is genuinely new and with which we agree, and that is the mandatory targets for the uptake of renewable energy in power supplies in which they talk about electricity retailers and other large electricity buyers being legally required to source an additional two per cent of electricity from renewable or specified waste product energy sources. That is a good idea. It is a new idea, but it is a small idea in what is proposed to be its targets when compared with others who have taken up something similar. Contrast that with the operations established by the New South Wales government along those sorts of lines, where they estimate over the next few years that 7 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emitted material will be taken out of the atmosphere by CEDA's project-an operation headed up by a person who was once Clinton's environmental adviser and is very good indeed. Apply that around Australia and you get 30 million tonnes and start to address some of the sorts of problems that they are talking about here. This is a bagatelle in comparison to that. Much is made of the fact that we are highly dependent upon fossil fuels, and indeed we are. But some are more dependent on coalwhich is the most problematic of the fossil fuels in relation to this-than we are, for example Denmark, which gets a bit of a guernsey under other headings in the Prime Minister's statements about the performance of Europe. They are much more dependent on coal than we are. What is their target in relation to new renewable energy sources? It is 10 to 14 per cent over the same period, not two per cent. What has Denmark done? Denmark has made use of technologies in which we should be streets ahead of them such as the effective use of wind power. What is the consequence of that? It is that the export of electricity generated by wind power from Denmark now exceeds the value of their fish exports. That is a very interesting prospect and possibility. So it is a good idea, but not ambitious enough in terms of the objectives set for it. We have said that Australia has to go to Kyoto with a target and we have proposed one. We do not agree with the EU position. We think it is unfair and self-serving. Bill Clinton has announced the US will sign up to a target of 1990 based emission levels by 2008 to 2012. Everyone knows that Kyoto will not produce a consensus less stringent than that one, if it produces one, particularly as the other majors, Japan and the Europe Union, are pushing stricter targets still. Labor believes that Australia should go to Kyoto with a starting point negotiating position which accepts an international target to which we could agree of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2010. But the opposition has said all along that differentiation is a fair argument for Australia, but differentiation must have a target to argue for. We see no imagination from this Prime Minister, only borrowed imagination from Labor. Where, for example, is there some decent thinking on tradeable emissions permits? Professor Warwick MCKibbin, an Australian working out of the Brookings Institute in the US, has proposed the development in each country of a domestic system of tradeable emission credits designed to encourage the most economically efficient developments to meet internationally determined greenhouse reduction targets. The volume of credits issued in each country would be determined initially and over future years within each country, but would clearly need to be within the parameters set by the international community. If mandatory targets are set at Kyoto, it is important that we have a considered economically credible, environmentally sustainable method of achieving the goal. I do not endorse every element of Professor MCKibbin's proposal. It needs to be rigorously examined and explored to consider some very practical concerns about new investment, particularly investment in new greenhouse efficient industries. We do have to be prepared for the possibility that agreement might fail at Kyoto. There are vast disagreements between the parties and this is an environment now where international negotiation is proceeding slower than it was some years ago. It may well be, therefore, that all that is set down at Kyoto are further processes to take the matter forward. If that is the case, it will be sad. If that is the case, we will have made a contribution to that particular outcome in the way in which we have behaved over the last 18 months, and that is no point of pride. It may be a matter of some satisfaction to the Prime Minister, but it will be no matter of satisfaction to his kids or mine and, if that occurs, it will be a disaster for their kids, our grandchildren. We should have gone to Kyoto as a proud country with a real appreciation of the needs in this particular area; we go to Kyoto with a minor fig leaf and a bad reputation. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Abbott) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",54
35,Mr ENTSCH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I rise today to lend my strong support to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997. This is yet another example of our government's common sense, practical agenda for reform and long-term vision. The youth allowance will replace the youth training allowance, the newstart allowance and the sickness allowance for 16to 20-year-olds and most 15-year-olds currently covered by these payments. It will replace Austudy for students aged between 16 and 24 and older, if students commence a course prior to turning 25 years. This legislation reflects well the government's position on social security. This government stands for social security, as distinct from welfare. As a member of this government, I am a strong advocate of state responsibility to be taken for the welfare of those who are in genuine need. As a parent, I support this government's philosophy that families are the glue that holds our society together and that parents, not the state, should be primarily responsible for the welfare of their children. The government's role is to provide a safe environment where people are not forced to resort to crime to support themselves in desperate times. The role of the family is to provide for the welfare of its young. The government has made it clear through the youth allowance legislation that it intends to hold to this principle. This government aims to help families. The parenting means test will encourage families to support their children until they have achieved full independence. Under the c.urrent system, the minimum rate family payment is paid to eligible families only until their children's sixteenth birthday. Under the youth allowance system, families who meet the income test for the family tax initiative and the minimum rate family payment, but whose income excludes their children from receiving youth allowance, will be able to claim both the ""family tax initiative and the minimum rate family payment in respect of those children until they tum 18 years of age. It is our families that teach us core values like responsibility, that nurture our sense of self-esteem and engender a strong work ethic. When people receive support from parents or their family they are more inclined to appreciate the sacrifices made for them and they are more keen to give something back. The same compulsion unfortunately is not at work in our extended family, the Australian community. I believe that there is a core of social security recipients who do not want to be part of that group. Unfortunately, there is an increasingly large pool of young people who do not appreciate the sacrifices made by their providers, the taxpayers, and who have no qualms about withdrawing from a seemingly bottomless pit of government funds. Through having no direct contact with their sponsors, welfare recipients do not appreciate to the same extent the link between the taxpayer and consolidated revenue. They are not learning to do all they can for themselves before seeking assistance. They will not be able to look back with the same sense of pride"" of their achievements if this situation continues. This is surely no way to raise our youth and moreover will spell their financial"" as well as spiritual bankruptcy in decades to come. Families can nurture young people, whereas the state can only sustain them. One particular case in my electorate draws this distinction between sustenance and nurturing extremely well. Quite a number of very distraught parents have come into my office at different times complaining about the fact that the process at the moment actually encourages youngsters to leave home. These parents really have no control over whether or not this happens. It causes a great amount of grief and concern to the parents involved and, as a consequence, causes a lot of damage to a lot of these children-they are only young children aged 14 and IS-who leave home. In a lot of cases they leave home because they are not happy with the family imposing what are not unreasonable restrictions in accordance with their age and in the best interests of the children. One particular case I would like to highlight is that of a 15-year-old lass from my electorate who had developed a relationship with a young man. The parents did not approve of that relationship, given her age and the problems associated with the young man in question. They put fairly severe restrictions on her access to that fellow. She objected to this and actually spoke with a school counsellor to complain about the restrictions that were put on her at home. She was looking for options that may be available to her. In this case there was no suggestion that child was in any way being abused or neglected by the family. She came from a very loving and caring family that was really working very much in her interests. They were concerned very much for her future. Through access to this counsellor she was given advice that she could leave home and apply for social security so she could be independent. She was assisted in finding accommodation. So she left her home to continue the relationship with this young man. Away from the home this girl soon got herself into very serious trouble. She was involved in drugs, her schooling certainly deteriorated significantly and unfortunately she fell pregnant. She also got herself into trouble with the law. She then went to what I would call her surrogate parent-the counsellor who had been assisting her with her independence-and asked her for advice on how to deal with this problem. The advice that was given to her by this caring counsellor was that she should have an abortion. This went very much against what this girl had been taught by her parents, and it was something that bothered her immensely. As a consequence, she refused this option on moral grounds. This girl was then told by the counsellor that there was no more that she could do and the best thing that she could do was, in effect, go back to her parents. She went back home and spoke to her parents. They of course accepted her back. She had a drug problem and she was pregnant. She had no hesitation whatsoever in going back but it certainly was a very painful lesson to this young lass. She learnt about the caring nature of her family and the difference between dealing with the welfare counsellors as such and being in a caring and loving family home. I think it highlights very much the difference between the two. Fortunately she went on and had the child. She kept the child. She has beaten her drug problem. She is now working towards a full and meaningful life. Quite frankly, this situation may never have needed to happen if there was something in place that could have allowed the parents to ensure that that child stayed in the home and the also if there was no mechanism allowed in this case to encourage her to leave and try to have some sort of independence to do as she chose. Labor provided financial incentives for many young people to leave school and go on the dole. Youth unemployment increased a staggering 32.2 per cent, to an employment figure more than five per cent higher than when they first came to office. Under Labor the number of apprenticeships fell to the lowest level in some 30 years. In 1972-73 spending on social welfare was 7.6 per cent of gross domestic product. It is now more than 15 per cent. Independent studies by the Australian Council of Social Service found that 20 years ago 12 per cent of our adult population received benefits or pensions. Today the figure is a staggering 23 per cent, or over 3 million people. Nearly one-quarter of all Australians are solely dependent on government welfare to survive. Quite frankly, this welfare alliance is totally unsustainable. For Australia to advance as a productive and internationally competitive nation, we must instil in our children a sense of mutual obligation. The government is obliged to support young people who make the effort to work towards their long-term independence through training, higher education or simply through looking for work. The youth allowance measures will build on the good start we have made. Under the coalition there will be 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships. We will provide income support to young people, including students, those looking for work and those who are sick and not capable of doing so. Young Australians must accept that they will not be able to leave education or training easily just to yet the youth allowance. This government will give support to people who strive to support themselves. This legislation gives greater flexibility to students to take advantage of opportunities that exist for young people today to study and work part-time to a greater extent than students of my generation. To be eligible for the youth allowance, young people must be engaged in one or a number of activities: they must be looking for full-time employment, studying full time, undertaking a course of vocational training or undertaking an approved combination of part-time activities. Those who must move away from the home to pursue higher education will be paid rent assistance, as will those 10,000 young people who are genuinely homeless or totally independent. These young people studying full time who are eligible for Austudy at present will receive a level of youth allowance equivalent to what they receive now. Many others will also receive rent assistance in addition. A young person of 18living away from home can be eligible for a maximum of $264.70 in Austudy per fortnight at present. Come 1 July next year the benefit will be significantly increased with the addition of rent assistance. The maximum rent assistance payable is $98.80 per fortnight. This is particularly good news for those families who live in remote and rural areas such as Coen, Laura, Cooktown and the Torres Strait, which constitutes a very large portion of my electorate, and depend on schools miles away from their homes for the education of their children. The youth allowance will certainly be a significant plus area. Rent assistance will make their children's accommodation far more affordable and enable them to concentrate on studies and improving their grades. This in turn will be a big relief for their parents, many of whom are really struggling to get by. Furthermore, people in regional areas who are currently excluded from certain university courses because there is insufficient demand at their local campus will be assisted by the federal government to study at larger campuses where the demand does exist. People in remote areas therefore will be afforded opportunity more equal to those for students whose family homes are in urban areas. I was able to pass on this particularly good news recently to a constituent who had informed me about her son, who wants to study law after leaving school but could not do so in the Cairns campus of James Cook University because the faculty was not available. It looked like he would not be able to take up that opportunity because of the financial circumstances of his parents. Under this new allowance they will certainly be able to access the appropriate university and the courses that will enable him to fulfil his ambitions. I think there is still a lot more that we have to do with regards to support for regional, remote and rural students. There are still quite a number of significant areas that have to be addressed. I am confident that in the passing of time we will continue to expand on these areas to ensure that we afford the students in these areas of Australia the same opportunities that are being offered to students in metropolitan areas where there is far greater access to a much broader range of services. We will be abolishing the $1,000 minimum payment because we appreciate that there are a lot of young people out there who should get our help but who may not be entitled to more than $1,000. To people with solid full time employment, this sum may not seem much, but I can assure the House that it will be of tremendous benefit to a great number of people in my electorate. Students will no longer need to work for three years to be classified as independent. The criteria will now be a person who has lived independently in this from their family home for more than 18 months. I believe that this is certainly far more reasonable. The measures implemented by the youth allowance legislation will not affect those young people who are in genuine need of living away from parents because of personal danger, nor will it affect the level of support given to existing recipients. On 6 November I announced that the Cairns Centrelink call centre in my electorate of Leichhardt was to benefit from the creation of some 45 new positions as a result of the government's program for expanding this service in a number of call centres around the country. Under the direction of Peter Doutre and Kris Vleeshouwer, the Centrelink team has had great success in serving Far North Queensland across a whole range of social security programs. Given the positive response to the establishment of the one stop shop concept for social security, I am anticipating that the simplification which the youth allowance brings to the social security system will be met with equal enthusiasm. The youth allowance will remove the necessity for young people to change the type of income support system that they rely upon when their circumstances change. At present there is a great deal of public concern about the current fragmentation of income support for young people between the departmentsconcern which will be removed by centralising the system of income support into one system. It is clear that these are very positive measures. Parents in this country should be pleased that the government has focused on family based social security. Young people should be relieved that the system is finally being simplified. All Australians should be optimistic that the changes are being introduced to ensure that our young people have the appreciation of the mutual obligation so crucial to their long-term prospects. These measures will also encourage young people to maximise their opportunities in the education field. A previous speaker commented on the fact that there is not always a need for highly qualified tertiary outcomes and there is a whole range of other skills that are appropriate and needed within the community. As an employer myself for many years, I looked at the actual hands-on skills that people had when assessing their suitabiliwater ty to work with me. I find that these measures are going to give a lot of our young people opportunities and an incentive to continue to access services, be they TAFE, apprenticeships or any other form of training, to give them the best possible opportunity of obtaining long-term and meaningful employment and contributing to our community as a whole. I certainly commend this bill to the House.",59
36,Ms GAMBARO,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I am very pleased today to be speaking on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997. Since this government came to power, families in the Petrie electorate have benefited across a wide variety of areas. More effective student assistance has been offered through the maintenance and strengthening of the benefits available to families. The bill concerning youth allowance will follow on and, in some cases, act in parallel with the package of measures this government has already introduced. It will build on measures put in place by the Howard government and will give hope to young Australians who for 13 years under the previous Labor government were promised much but delivered very little. The Labor Party deserves the scorn of young people, as it lengthened the CES queues and brought the merry-go-round of all those wonderful Clayton's training programs which they dished out. The family tax initiative gave families a real break, and we have lowered interest rates which has been a major bonus for mortgage payments. We also have introduced things such as work for the dole, school to industry links, apprenticeships and the Green Corps, which have been extremely warmly welcomed throughout my electorate of Petrie and the whole of Australia. The Green Corps project has been a huge hit, particularly in my electorate of Petrie. It was recently my very great pleasure to congratulate those who were involved in the first Green Corps project in the Petrie electorate, which was launched in the Bracken Ridge area of my electorate. The Green Corps project at Tinchi Tamba Wetlands and DeepBend was one of the first projects to be chosen under the Green Corps program, and I was really pleased to be there the other day and to see that the participants had developed some amazing skills, particularly in - eas such as occupational health and safety, first aid, plant identification including native and exotic plants, environmental auditing, weed control methods and vegetation restoration techniques. A further Green Corps project linked to the Petrie electorate is the mountains to mangroves project, which is running in conjunction with Peter Armstrong at the Downfall Creek Bushland Centre. I am hearing terrific reports about those involved in this program, and I look forward to congratulating the trainees very soon. I raise the benefits of this program because I wish to make the point that it is one of the decisive outcomes that has arisen out of the Green Corps program, and out of that has come something really special: the hope and opportunities which it has given to the participants. There has been a huge improvement in these young people's confidence and selfesteem. In fact, the changes in six months were overwhelming. I attended a presentation by them only last week and it was absolutely inspiring. The trainees are now talking about going on to university or TAPE courses. They are talking about careers in environmental science, in park preservation, in landscaping and as park rangers. Those young people had absolutely no opportunities open to them before they started this program. It has made them much more focused on their futures. It has given them a chance to see beyond the greater realm of things, to achieve something and to aspire to greater things in the future. Nearly all of these young people will qualify, and they will benefit from the government's foresight and particularly benefit from this youth allowance. The bill gives legislative effect to a new social security allowance, commencing on 1 July 1998, which is an income support payment for young people who are in education, in training, unemployed or sick. It allows young people to have a real choice and to have a better overall understanding of the entitlements and guidelines which exist. The youth allowance, in essence, takes away the inconsistencies which exist in the present system, and it allows a far more flexible approach. It is a much simpler system than has existed in the past. One of the most important features of the proposal is the consistency of payments if circumstances alter slightly. Previously this would have meant cancelling one allowance, applying for another allowance and having to wait in between. It was very complicated. There were delays, frustration, consternation and confusion, all of which will be alleviated by this legislation. It is important to reiterate that the youth allowance will replace five existing, but different, payments. It will replace Austudy for students under 2S years of age-and older if the student commences a course prior to turning 2S-and IS-year-olds currently covered under the Austudy arrangements. It will replace youth training, news tart and sickness allowances for under 21-year-olds and, more importantly, the minimum rate family payment for secondary students aged 16 to 18 years. Youth allowance provides better support for families, and it will provide a much simpler approach to the payment of these allowances. It also provides clarification of the range of payments that exist between Centrelink and the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. I believe that one of the most important aspects of the bill is that it will encourage more young people to complete further education and training, particularly those young people who thought that they would never really have a chance. The government has given people a real chance and a real opportunity. The importance of good and thorough education should never be underestimated. I refer to not just the knowledge attained but also the wonderful things that come from education and knowledge, such as social and interactive skills and the people who we meet throughout the education process. Education is something that stays with us throughout life. I meet many people in the course of my day-today activities in my electorate who have never finished high school, and it is really quite tragic when you talk to them. Many of them are filled with regret. A lot of them go back to the school system as adults, and it is pretty courageous of them to do that, particularly when they are a lot older than the students who are there. They undertake studies with young teenagers because they want to get on in life, they want to go further and they realise how much they missed out on by not completing grade 12. I think it is really courageous of them to go back. What we are doing here is encouraging young people to stay at school, and what is wrong with that? It is so much harder when they have to go back as adults and do night school. There is nothing more demoralising. The people I meet who do that do brilliantly, and I am absolutely thrilled when I hear the great success stories when I meet up with them a few years down the track. The youth allowance will encourage young people to look at options in education and training. There will be real incentives for young people to complete year 12. The world is changing. We have changing technologies and increases in new areas that we never thought were possible. The industries include IT, tourism and finance, and new skills are needed for these-skills that were not needed in the past. It saddens me to see many young people who are not in education or training living in game and pinball parlours. There is nothing worse than seeing young teenagers while away their hours in game parlours. It is a waste of talent. Now there is more direction for them and more scope for them to go on to school and training opportunities. The youth allowance will keep families together and discourage young people from leaving home. Today the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) told a very tragic story about how a young woman's life was changed by making the wrong decision and leaving home. That decision impacted on her and caused her severe grief in many other areas. We need to work towards alternatives to the inactivity in our society: young people who drop out of school for nothing and live a life without purpose and without direction. It is very important for this government to stop young people from choosing to go on unemployment benefits over education and training. We need to encourage them to stay at school. Why do we need to do this? We need to do it because, if we do not, the threat of intergen'erational poverty will hang like a cloud. It has to be dispersed. We have to break that poverty cycle. That is what we are on about, and what is wrong with that? What is wrong with giving kids an opportunity? Education is a way out of poverty, and we all know that. In order to escape this, we need to educate our young people. The Howard government is trying to rectify this situation. The encouragement of apprenticeships, the school to industry links program and opportunities provided through the youth allowance are now coming together and forming a package which will be seen as very fair, equitable and just. It is important to note that the youth allowance has been brought forward by this government following concerns expressed by young people, their families and the general community. They were all calling for reform. For the last 13 years, under Labor, their voices were lost. They were not heard. It has taken a coalition government-the first Howard government-to listen and to act to ensure that another generation is not lost but grows and prospers on their achievements, ideas and goals. At this point, I wish to note for the record some of the positive aspects of the bill. To qualify for the youth allowance, young people aged 18 and over will need to be undertaking full-time study, training, jobsearch or a combination of these activities. For those under 18, youth allowance payments will depend on them participating in full-time education or training, unless they meet the criteria for special exemptions, such as being ill, homeless or unable to secure an appropriate education or training place. Youth allowance will be calculated on a daily basis and paid fortnightly. It is not until you hear the figures-the people who will benefit from the youth allowance-that you begin to get a clear picture and an appreciation of the importance and impact of this legislation for young people right across Australia. The extension of rent assistance will benefit 70,000 students. It will help people in rural and remote communities to have access where they did not have it before. Today I discovered that rural students have the lowest take-up rate of further education places of any group in the country. The abolition of the $1,000 per annum Austudy minimum entitlement requirement will benefit 41,200 students, and changes to the Austudy independent rate will assist upwards of 16,600 students. The maximum rate for students aged under 18 who are away from home will rise, benefiting over 19,500 students, and 9,300 students over 25 who will be continuing study will benefit from the alignment of these rates. The youth allowance is a commendable decision. It will benefit young people in the electorate of Petrie enormously, and it will support the many other initiatives which assist young people in this important age group. What is more important is that it is giving y,?ung people an opportunity. It is giving them a chance. It is about families taking responsibility for their children's lives. It about encouraging them to go on and further their education. It is about giving them a real opportunity and it is a positive step. It is a step that will shape the future of this country and give our young people opportunities that they had before and never dreamed about. It will give them so much more to look forward to, particularly in the changing technologies that we face leading into the future. The technologies of the past are changing and the way that work is structured is changing. People today will need more sophisticated skills and they will need to benefit from training programs. This is what this is all about. It is about giving young people a chance, it is about giving young people an opportunity and it is about them looking forward into the future. It is about giving them hope where they never had that hope, and it is about providing some future for them that will enable them to lead meaningful lives. I want to reiterate that it will get them out that intergenerational poverty of which we spoke a moment ago. I am very pleased to speak to this bill. I pleased at the initiative the government is taking. It will be a very pOSitive step for Australia, it will be a positive step for families, it will encourage our young people, it will lead them to continue well into the future and it will provide a very prosperous future for us all. Debate interrupted. NA",62
37,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) will act as trade minister from today until 23 November. I also inform the House that I will be absent from question time next week; I will be in Vancouver attending the APEC leaders meeting. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) will act as Prime Minister during my absence. NA Native Title,65
38,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed is to the Prime Minister. Is it not a fact that the Prime Minister complained to Tuesday's coalition joint parties meeting that the churches were lining up against him on Wik? Is it not also a fact that the chairman of the Prime Minister's native title committee, the member for Leichhardt, has his tacit approval to call for a boycott of churches on this issue? If the Prime Minister claims not to support a boycott of churches, why did he not do something about it as soon as the member for Leichhardt had told his office he was calling for one? Why has the member been allowed to continue his call today? Is this another case of: who will rid me of this turbulent priest?",65
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Naturally, I do not comment about matters that take place in my party room-any more than you do. Can I take the opportunity, because the Leader of the Opposition has raised an important issue, of saying something about the role of the Australian churches in the native title debate. of Over the past few days the role of the churches has been commented upon, and there have even been some suggestions that I do not am believe that church figures should participate in the debate about amendments to the Native Title Act. Those suggestions are completely wrong. I have a very deep respect for the role of the churches in Australian society. Personally, I have very strongly identified, since I have been Prime Minister, with expressions by church figures on important social issues such as euthanasia, domestic violence and excessive gambling. And I have always defended the right of church figures to speak out on issues they choose beyond those of a strictly religious character. The Leader of the Opposition may recall that, when I addressed the national Anglican conference at the beginning of this year, I in fact encouraged church leaders to participate in debate on important national issues. However, the right to speak freely on a broad range of issues carries with it the obligation to speak in an informed, objective and constructive fashion. It also involves the right of others in the community to freely criticise the views of church figures if they do not accord with the facts or if they display undue bias. Importantly, there is also an obligation on church figur,.,s who do enter the debate not to allow the impression to be created that they speak on behalf of all adherents to their particular church or denomination. The truth is that the remarks of some church figures in the native title debate, particularly those suggesting racial motives on the part of the government, have given very, very deep offence to many active churchgoers throughout Australia. The Native Title Bill represents a fair compromise achieved by the government after months of negotiation with interested parties, including Aboriginal people and people of Torres Strait Islander descent. Mr Crean interjecting",65
40,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham!,66
41,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Many claims made by church figures on this bill are completely wrong. The bill is not racially discriminatory. Mr Crean-Oh!,66
42,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hotham.,66
43,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It does not purport to extinguish native title or common law rights. Those who oppose our changes, for example, criticise the removal of the right to negotiate. The right to negotiate is not a common law right; it is a procedural right conferred by the Keating government under the Native Title Act. If the amending bill of the government is passed-and I want the Australian public to understand this very clearly-it will still be possible for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to make native title claims on 79 per cent of the landmass of Australia. At present, indigenous people, who represent two per cent of the population, own or control around 15 per cent of Australia's landmass. Additionally, there are native title claims over approximately 45 per cent of the landmass of Australia. When you add the other area over which native title claims can be made, you get to the figure of 79 per cent. Additionally, under the Keating government's Native Title Act, Australian taxpayers are providing $1.3 billion to the Indigenous Land Fund to enable indigenous people who cannot make native title claims to purchase freehold or leasehold land. Like any other Australians, of course, individual indigenous people can purchase freehold land. In these circumstances, it is difficult to conceive of the factual basis on which some church figures, and indeed others, have variously attacked my government's legislation as being racist, discriminatory or immoral. My government remains strongly committed to the reconciliation process. We have clearly identified the removal of the profound disadvantage suffered by indigenous people in the area of health, education, employment and housing as the priority area on the issue of reconciliation. The attempt made by many to portray native title issues as the only element of reconciliation is both dishonest and neglectful of the true needs of indigenous people. May I say of my colleague the member for Leichhardt that I understand his sense of frustration-and the sense of frustration of many people in rural Australia-about the way in which this debate is being conducted. I do not support a call for a boycott of church attendance, but I can understand the sense of frustration he feels. Greenhouse Gases",66
44,Mr ANDREW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, what action will the government take to reduce Australia's emissions of greenhouse gases? Is this approach consistent with protecting Australian jobs? Is the Prime Minister aware of any other proposals for dealing with greenhouse?",67
45,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The statement made by me on behalf of the government in the parliament today represents a balance between the obligation of the government to protect jobs, promote the interests of Australia abroad and protect Australian industry. It also represents a massive contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia so that Australia can, as I promised, play her part in a worldwide attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike alternative plans, to which I will come in a moment, this package, which adds to the massive investment in the environment contained in the Natural Heritage Trust, represents a balance between protecting Australian jobs-something the Labor Party will never do-protecting the resource sector of Australia and also making a very significant down payment on Australia's environmental future. Under the program we are providing $180 million, which will lift the performance of existing industries while also generating new green industries in renewable energy. It builds on existing initiatives like the $328 million bushcare program under the Natural Heritage Trust. It builds jobs while protecting the environment. I want to say, in reply to the member for Wakefield, that when earlier this year I began to speak out strongly on behalf of Australia on the greenhouse gas emission issue I was met with nothing other than criticism and derision from the Australian Labor Party. When it comes to defending the Australian national interest on things like the greenhouse issue the Labor Party is always clamouring to promote the views of other countries. The Labor Party was perfectly happy to embrace the sort of approach that would impose a crippling burden on Australian industry. It is very interesting that within minutes of the release of my statement today and the response of the Leader of the Opposition there was a statement released by the Electricity Supply Association of Australia. This is what the association had to say: The electricity supply business would be faced with a bill of between $500 million and $2 billion over 10 years to meet the centrepiece of the opposition leader's greenhouse proposal. The director went on to say-and it gets even better: The proposal was the equivalent of imposing a carbon tax of $3 to $12 per tonne of C02 emitted on the electricity generation business. A carbon tax of between $3 and $12. I trawled around and thought to myself, 'I wonder what the origin of that wasT In my loose leaf file I came across a statement made on 1 December 1994: If you were to do something like a low-level carbon tax, something like maybe $6 a tonne, you could save something like $320 million. That was uttered by Cheryl Kernot on 1 December 1994. I am very pleased to say that the balanced, far-sighted statement. I made on behalf of the government has already been very strongly supported not only by the electricity association, which I quoted earlier, but also by the Business Council of Australia, in which they said they lent strong support to my statement on Australia's response. Mr Buckingham, the Executive Director, went on to say: The measures now proposed put Australia at the forefront of greenhouse gas action and should put to rest any accusation that Australia wants a free ride at Kyoto. Let me say again, as I will continue to say between now and the Kyoto meeting, my first responsibility is to look after Australia and Australians. My first responsibility is to promote a balanced protection of Australian jobs and Australian industry whilst ensuring that our country makes a contribution to the worldwide effort to reduce greenhouse gases. The package that I brought down today meets all of those goals and in a balanced, far-sighted way will give great international credibility to Australia's position. Greenhouse Gases",67
46,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the am Prime Minister on the matter. On 9 July 1997 the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, Australia's negotiator at Kyoto, said his speech to the American Chamber merce in Australia. OUf proposal is to negotiate individual country targets ... Is it not a fact that greenhouse reduction Wills. targets for 2010 now on the table for Kyoto include: the EU proposal for 1990 levels less 15 per cent; the Japanese proposal levels less five per cent; and the US proposal for 1990 levels? Prime Minister, on the basis of your statement today won't Australia's emissions at 2010 have increased by 18 per O'Connor. cent on 1990 levels? Is the Prime Minister seriously suggesting that Senator Hill go Kyoto with Australia's individual country target: 1990 plus 18 per cent? If that is Australia's Kyoto target, what is?",68

48,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Has the Attorney General received advice as to whether comments being made in the public arena could jeopardise the extradition process and any subsequent court action in respect of Robert Dunn?,68
49,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I informed the House yesterday that there is need for great caution in discussing this matter because comment could have an adverse effect on either the extradition proceedings or on a subsequent criminal trial. It is not with any pleasure that I advise the House today that the official of the Department of Justice in the United States handling the case has advised that public comment on this case is complicating matters and is not helping with the extradition process. The official has advised that it is not unprecedented for extradition matters to be compromised in United States courts because of media coverage in other countries. In fact, I told that Australian media coverage itself has in the past been used in US court proceedings. By continuing the campaign that in they are engaged in, Labor is putting the of Comwhole process at risk. Mr Kelvin Thomson-If you are so worried about that, why did you get 60 Minutes",68

51,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are applying your policy of scoring any political point and doing for 1990 whatever it takes. Mr Tuckey interjecting,68
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for,68
53,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I indicated yesterday to and I indicated the day before that I would not comment on police operational matters. not But, that remaining the case, there is one matter on which I am able to offer some clarification. Labor has made claims about government welfare payments being made to Mr Dunn overseas. In fact, Senate Bolkus said interthis yesterday in an interview: For some 10 months he was allowed to live in Honduras on taxpayer funded assistance. This is false. Mr Beddall interjecting",68
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Rankin.,68
55,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Department of Social Security advises that no overseas payments were made to Dunn and that his government pension ceased in August 1996; that is, some months before the alleged sighting of Dunn in Honduras. In addition, the department has advised that information was provided to the New South Wales police at all about Dunn's pension payments. As the law enforcement authority seeking Mr Dunn, the New South Wales police had authority to seek that information, and when they did it was provided promptly. With respect to New South Wales, I add that I am authorised by the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Nick Cowdery QC, to express his deep concern about the effect of public comment on the determination of the Dunn case by the New South Wales courts. So we now have a situation where both United States officials and a New South Wales official have called for caution on this matter so that proceedings are not jeopardised. Labor, take note. International Funds Transfers",68
56,Mr MEL HAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Attorney-General. Attorney. Is it not the case that the Australian Federal Police have direct access to international transfers of any amount on any account performed by a financial institution on behalf of a client?,69
57,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Australian Federal Police have access to financial information if they are the relevant law enforcement authority. I have just pointed out that in the case I have spoken about they were not the law enforcement authority with responsibility. But the question from the member for Banks does give me the opportunity to put in a plug for AUSTRAC. AUSTRAC receives reports from financial institutions and others regarding cash of $10,000 and over, matters which are believed to be suspicious, cash of $10,000 taken into or out of the country and international funds transfers made by financial institutions on behalf of their customers. These reports are of very considerable assistance in the investigation of crime, particularly in relation to the transfer of proceeds of crime such as in drug dealing. AUSTRAC does not receive reports from the Department of Social Security regarding payments made either domestically or internationally. Therefore, on the basis of that information alone, the AUSTRAC database would not be of any assistance in tracking benefit recipi-nts. All Australian Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement agencies have access to the AUSTRAC database as an intelligence resource, which allows them to make inquiries directly of the database in relation to their investigations. It is available for use in all serious criminal matters. But, due to the types of information held in the database, its usefulness in individual cases depends on the circumstances of the case, including the overall intelligence known to the investigating agencies. AUSTRAC is not an investigating agency and therefore encourages investigating agencies to use the database themselves so as to obtain as much information as possible from the information holdings in the database. In this case, access by the AFP to AUSTRAC would have yielded no information of relevance at all. Asia: Currency Instability",69
58,Mrs GALLUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the implications for Australia of the currency instability in Asia in light of today' s reports regarding South Korea?,69
59,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. As is, I think, well known, there has been substantive currency instability in the nations of South-East Asia over recent months. Those economies which are most affected include Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Thailand and Indonesia are currently on adjustment programs with the International Monetary Fund. In response to some instability in South Korea, the trading ban limiting movements of the South Korean won was expanded to 10 per cent either side just recently. This morning, when trade opened on the South Korean won, it fell to the limit after 15 minutes of trading. I am aware of speculation about the possibility of the Korean government requesting IMP assistance. There has, however, been no official statement made either by that government or by the executive board of the IMF about this possibility. The events in South-East Asia demonstrate again the importance for countries to ensure that they get sound economic fundamentals: a sophisticated and well-regulated financial market, a currency which is open for trade and a monetary policy which emphasises stability. One of the things we can say in relation to Australia is that Australia has weathered this storm as well as it has because of this government's determination to get the economic fundamentals right. One thing we can say, even though we do not yet know the full extent of the volatility in the South-East Asian region, is that Australia faces that much better with a budget now coming back into balance, with a plan to retire debt, with the lowest inflation since the 1960s, with interest rates down at 20and 30-year levels, and with a sound basis for improving competition in our domestic economy. In relation to both the Thai and the Indonesian packages put together by the International Monetary Fund, Australia has been a participant in each. In relation to the Indonesian package, Australia is part of a second tier of financial accommodation which will be made available if the first tier put together by the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank needs supplementation. In relation to that and in relation to Thailand, Australian government's contribution is by way of loan. The money is made available in return for structural adjustment packages in those countries, and after those structural adjustment packages have been put in place the money will be repaid. Developments in relation to the four countries of ASEAN will have an effect on the Australian economy, as I have already said. I have also said that, if the instability moved into North Asia, that would have a further impact in relation to the Australian economy. It is important to emphasise, however, that the ASEAN economies most affected by this instability take only around 10 per cent of Australia's exports. There will be a meeting of ASEAN finance ministers, together with those countries participating in the Thai package and the United States, in Kuala Lumpur in about 10 days time which I will be attending on behalf of Australia. It is expected that the finance ministers will discuss developments in the region and put in place surveillance mechanisms which will enhance surveillance and regional cooperation. Australia is part of the IMP packages in relation to both Thailand and Indonesia not only because it is in the interests of those countries but also because it is in the of Australia. It is in the interests of Australia to see the countries in our region stabilised and returned to growth. Growth in our region aids Australia, just as a downturn in our region will have an adverse effect on our economy. The Australian government continues to monitor the developments in South Korea and will look at any requests or any involvement which the IMP may make if such a request is forthcoming. Pharmaceuticals",69
60,Mr WILTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and concerns pharmaceuticals. Prime Minister, are you now aware that your health minister has today been forced to announce that anti-depression medication has been removed from your plan for higher drug charges because these SSRI drugs are not of equal clinical value? Do you the now admit that you were completely wrong when you dismissed these concerns as being insubstantial only two days ago?",70

65,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I invoke standing order 304A in respect of the member for Grayndler. The honourable member for Grayndler thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,70
66,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of recent comments about the prices of drugs under the government's therapeutic group premiums policy and of claims in relation to clinical equivalents of drugs? Can the minister advise the House as to whether these comments are interests based on objective evidence?,70
67,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am pleased to inform him and the House that the government is in a position now to finally release the prices under the therapeutic group premiums policy and dispel some of the inaccurate information that has been deliberately circulated to confuse and scare elderly people. The fact is that this policy applies to around 118 preparations out of a pharmaceutical benefits system of 1,800. So it applies to about six per cent of medications. I am pleased to ensure honourable members that the process for the drug companies putting in prices has been exceedingly competitive and better than expected. Half of the drugs have come in at no premium whatsoever. The other half of medications have come in at a price whereby no single medication is over a $5 differential and only two medications are at a differential of $4. I would expect these products would be savaged in the marketplace in the near future. The fact is that across all products the average price differential is 63c-not $18, as was previously claimed by the shadow minister for health. The effect of this policy so far has been to take $467 million of identifiable savings. That will come off the profit of drug companies and return it to the taxpayers. Nearly half a billion dollars returned to the taxpayer: that is great news for taxpayers and great news for consumers. I am further pleased to be able to inform the honourable member and the House that this morning I was phoned by the President of the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, Rod Unsworth, who told me that, after a telephone hook-up this morning, his association is prepared to support the policy and will back the government in implementing it for the benefit of consumers. So we now have all five peak bodies associated with pharmacy-the Pharmacy Guild, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia, the pharmacy distributors and the pharmacy manufacturers-backing this policy. There has been a lot of comment, which is unfortunate because it leads to concern in people's minds. We had the shadow minister earlier this year confusing sugar pills and cholesterol lowering drugs. I am pleased to inform him that the prices that have come in on cholesterol lowering drugs are all at the base price, so no-one on cholesterol lowering drugs will have to change their medication or pay a cent more. The taxpayer is the one who benefits. The shadow minister was also raising the possibility of what will happen to people in nursing homes in their confusion. Clearly he has not spent much time in nursing homes or he would know that all medication is given under supervision anyway by the nursing staff, so his issue is completely facetious. The third point the honourable shadow minister has been making, as he made in the House the other day, relates to the issue about certain chemical beta-blockers for treating high blood pressure being safer for people with cardiac failure. He asked whether it was correct that my expert advisory group had told me there was a problem here. I asked the expert advisory group, and the advice I got back yesterday-I will read it word for word as I wrote it down over the telephone-was, 'The shadow minister's question doesn't make sense. We can't understand the logic behind his question,' and they went further to say, 'He's probably confused the medications.' Again! The point of all this is that the pharmaceutical benefits system is an important scheme, as previous health ministers have conceded. Unless we have the costs under control, we will not be able to afford to keep it. It is at $2.76 billion this year. We will be spending about $300 million more this year, even after all the changes, than we would have otherwise spent. Today we have the final announcement of a 63c difference. That is incredibly to the benefit of the Australian taxpayers, the pharmaceutical system and the consumers. Pharmaceuticals",70
68,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Government members-Apologise!,71
69,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Remember how everyone said they supported the nursing home changes? Remember all the organisations who supported your nursing home changes? Minister, is it not the case that mark IV of your pharmaceutical changes will still leave more than 850,000 Australians paying more for the medication that their doctor believes they need? Do you stand by your claim on the John Laws program that these changes affect only drugs which are-and I quote youyears. 'absolutely the same'? If so, Minister, how do you justify charging patients more for a like Norvasc when your own expert advisers, in the document from the PBAC, have told you, 'It may also be safer with patients cardiac failure'? Minister, when a doctor prescribes Norvasc to patients after 1 Februagot ry, does your policy not boil down to patients a review. having to either pay five bucks more or risk a heart attack?",71
70,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I forget, will table the price premiums covered by the therapeutic premium policy for the benefit the House. The shadow minister should stick to things that he understands, not things does not understand. The simple fact about this is we have relied on scientific evidence, not people with a vested interest, not people who stand to make money from it. We have taken expert independent advice from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, from the Royal Australasian College of What Physicians and from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. The simple fact is that the advice that from them is that these products are therapeutically equivalent. You can try to scare as much as you like; the fact is you have It also says: flopped on this one. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table this document.",72
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is leave granted? Leave is not granted. Resume your seat. Small Business,72
72,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Has the minister seen reports alternative approach to small business policy? Can the minister outline the benefits for small businesses by being given high priority by the Howard government?,72
73,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for The Bendigo for his question. As is well known this parliament, he did a fantastic job as chairman of our small business committee, it which delivered for the small business combetter munity what many in the small business community described as the best news to come out of Canberra for small business in 20 I have seen these reports. I go back to drug August last year, when the Labor Party announced that their policy for the small business community was to have a review. with Remember that one? They had 17 reviews in government and did nothing, and when they into opposition their policy was to have The next thing was that in May this year they announced that they had seven princiI ples-they were on one page, would you believe. The only other thing from the opposiof tion about small business was from the member for Cunningham, who got up to reply to he my statement on the government's policy for small business, and he had to say it was actually a pretty good statement. I must say I was knocked over this morning when I saw a report under the heading 'Labor woos small end of town with Bill changes'. this report contains is a series of statements and descriptions about Labor's attitude to the small business community. The report I have received this morning says: ... Labor plans to integrate small business conpeople cerns into other platform areas . . . . .. integrated, one-size-fits-all small business policy packages are not the way to win support from the sector . . . The Labor Party have announced that they have decided not to have a small business policy. They have decided to downgrade policy priority for the small business community. They have decided that there will not be an overarching policy commitment to the of an small business community. Let me take you to some of the propositions that they have announced this morning. They say it 'will contain only a short statement of broad principles of small business policy'. obvious explanation for that is that we in are the small business party, we have announced the policy and you have decided that is so hard, you are so far behind, that it is to put up the white flag and not have a policy at all. The statement this morning says that Labor 'will avoid getting into a small business policy war'. In other words, they will simply not even contest the basic policy issues relevant to the small business community. On the question of industrial relations, this is a truly incredible statement for you to make. You say 'it is nonsense to package industrial relations as a core area of concern for small business' because more than half of small businesses have no employees. They can have an industrial relations policy for the ACTU executive, but they cannot have an industrial relations policy for the two million employees who work in small business, of which there are 500,000. Do you know what their explanation is? They say, 'Oh well, more than half of these small businesses don't employ anybody.' I ask people just to think about the consequences of that statement, because what they are saying is that for those 400,000 small businesses industrial relations is irrelevant. Mr Latham-They don't employ anyone.",72
74,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'Now they don't employ anybody,' says the member for Werriwa. That is an interesting point and it does rather show the differences between the government and the Labor Party, because we not only have a policy for the small business community but also have a vision for the small business community, and part of that vision is that those 400,000 small businesses go out and give somebody a job. That is our vision for the small business community. Your vision for the small business community is to pretend that they do not exist, and you then say-or whatever you are going to not say in a sort of Clayton's statement on small business-that small business is exploited by big business and that, whatever you are going to say, it will cover finance, education and access to justice. But we have already brought down policy responses to those issues and the Labor Party have publicly acknowledged the worth of those changes. Just to cap off what is a quite incredible statement from the Labor Party, they say that their plans are to 'integrate small business concerns into other policy platform areas, but break them out for marketing in the campaign'. This is the most incredibly cynical approach to one of the most important parts of the Australian community. Your policy is that small business is to be downgraded, you are not going to have a policy, but-wait for it-when you think there is a vote to be counted, just for the purposes of winning a few votes in the next election campaign, you are going to break them out for marketing in the campaign. This is a sad day for the small business community when the other major political party in this country, now in opposition, has publicly decided not to have a policy for the small business community. Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, I seek leave, as the minister was quoting from a newspaper story about this issue, to have it tabled for the benefit of the House so that members can in fact see for themselves the sort of information which has been disseminated. Leave not granted.",73
75,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask that the minister table the document from which he was quoting. Nursing Homes,73
76,Mr HOLLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, now that you have been forced by a backbench revolt to cancel your second ministerial statement in a week on aged care, when can older Australians and their families expect to know how much they will be forced to pay for essential nursing home care? Minister, older Australians know that they must still pay an annual fee in advance, but when will you tell them exactly how much it will be, what regional variations will affect the annual fee and to what extent it will be capped both in total and the number of years?",73
77,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the honourable member's question, I have indicated that I am considering the matters and I will continue to do that. There is in place an agreement that was met by the whole sector, the consumers and the providers sector, last Thursday-and they meet again tomorrow to discuss these matters furtherand that is that the accommodation charge (the entry arrangements) has been set; and you would know the details if you have been following this matter. We are determined to consult fully, as I have said, about a plan for the future aged needs in this country. These are matters that are requiring, because they are complex, detailed study. We are giving it detailed consideration, and I have to say to you that the sector-that is, the aged care sector, both the providers and the consumer interests, including carers and the Alzheimer's Association and others-believe that what I as minister am doing is the correct way to proceed, and I enjoy the support of all my colleagues to get a detailed plan for the future of aged care in this country. Budget Outlook",73
78,Mr MCDOUGALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of any threats to Australia's pending budget surplus? What dangers do such threats pose to Australia's financial stability and the continuing welfare of all Australians?,74
79,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Griffith for his question. I am aware of wanton and irresponsible policies that are now being put out by the Australian Labor Party to try to jeopardise Australia's economic future. Why would they do that? They had 13 years to destroy the place and run it into debt. A government comes in, pulls out the scooper and cleans up the Labor mess, and the Labor Party are working again on throwing things into reverse. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Unless this answer is premised on the assumption that Labor will win the next election, it is clearly a hypothetical question and answer and, as such, out of order. Is that the assumption on which the Treasurer is proceeding?",74
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is well aware of my views about frivolous points of order. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, on this point of order, there is a standing order against hypothetical questions. If the question is premised on Labor winning the next election, that is fine. Let us hear it. Otherwise, is a hypothetical question and it is out of order.",74
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,74
82,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can't you see why we love him, Mr Speaker? We really love him! I happened to read in the Courier-Mail on Thursday, 20 November the following statement from the Labor member for Jagajaga. She promised a Labor government would restore $5 million worth of funding the government had taken out of nursing homes. She produced a draft policy in which Labor would dump nursing home entry fees-that is another $1.5 billion over the next 10 yearsand said, 'We won't be raising taxes to pay for it. There is no need to raise taxes to do this.' No need to raise a tax to raise $2 billion! We have the member for Kingsford-Smith out on an aid policy. He is talking about getting aid to 0.4 per cent of GNP by the year 2005, which is $5 billion to $7 billion between now and then. But there is no need to raise taxes! In fact, as was said in the Courier-Mail, federal Labor is set to campaign on no new taxes. That took me back to the last election the Labor Party did win, in 1993. Do you remember the 1993 election? Do you remember Mr Keating said there was no need to raise taxes? They remember it very well. Let me remind them what happened after the Labor Party won that 1993 election. All wholesale sales tax rates increased by one percentage point in August of 1993-no new taxes! All wholesale sales tax rates increased by another one per cent from July of 1995-no new taxes! There was a proposed excise increase on wine, cider and alcoholic beverages-from 20 per cent to 31 per cent. Excise on petrol increased by 3c a litre from 17 August 1993, and there were further increases of 2c a litre for leaded petrol. And who could forget those income tax cuts before the 1993 election? Labor said they were not a promise, they were l-a-w. And they disappeared after the 1993 election. My mind went back to the increase in the wholesale sales tax, to the increase in the petrol excise, to the l-a-w tax cuts and to all it of those things, when I saw that promise made again. And I was taken back when I heard myoId and dear friend the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on ABC Radio National on 17 November 1997. He said it all: There are all sorts of elements of continuity between the kind of government that we were for the last 13 years and the kind of government that we will be in the future. We would be utterly implausible if we tried to present ourselves as a different kind of outfit. Touche. I could not have said it better myself. Department of Administrative Services:",74
83,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and follows the recent abolition of the Department of Administrative Services and the reported sacking of its secretary, Graham Mellors. How do you respond to media reports which have suggested that this decision was an act of vindictive retribution after the resignation of three ministers and two members of staff over the travel allowance issue? Is it true that Mr Mellors first suggested late last year that the travel allowance system required fundamental review and yet this advice was not acted upon, despite your public speech last night acknowledging the need for responsive, relevant advice from the Public Service? Finally, can you assure the public that the decision to abolish DAS was taken solely in the interests of improved public administration?",75
84,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was not taken as an act of vindictiveness. The decision taken by the government, in my view, is not only defensible but entirely appropriate in terms of better public administration. I think it made an enormous amount of sense to take the ceremonial and honours sections out of the old Department of Administrative Services and to locate them in the Prime Minister's department, along with other like functions. I thought it also made an enormous amount of sense to locate in the Department of Finance what are in relation to many activities of government straight accounting functions. I think the new administrative arrangement whereby you have a Department of Finance and Administration with the Minister for Finance, the man who has enabled the greatest ever employee acquisition of shares in a public company float-92 per cent-as the senior minister and Senator Minchin, a very competent new addition to the ministry, as junior minister makes eminent and impeccable administrative good sense. Job Security",75
85,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Is the minister aware of claims that job insecurity is on the rise? Can Abolition the minister inform the House whether such claims have any basis in fact and, to the extent they do, what sorts of workers perceive themselves to be most insecure? Also, what does the minister believe to be the best way of building job security in Australia?",75
86,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. It is true that there are some commentators and others who think job insecurity can justify substantial changes by way of further regulation of the Australian labour market, as if this were a cure for what they claim to be problems in the attitudes, to reflect the concerns of Australian workers. We have done some work on exactly what attitudes there are in the Australian community about job insecurity. I must say, they are quite different from what you would be told if you listened to any member of the front bench of the Labor Party. In fact, you can only conclude that most of what they say when it comes to job insecurity is just a political stunt. If you look at, for example, a survey by Clemengers-my shadow colleagues always refer to Clemengers-done in March this year, the question of job security did not even rate in the top 40 issues. We have some international evidence available to us from the OECD. The latest OECD employment outlook looked at job insecurity. They concluded that, in terms of job insecurity, Australia had the third lowest level. In fact, we were doing a lot better than just about anybody else you would care to mention-better than the UK, the US or even somewhere like Japan, which you would normally associate with job security, or Germany and France. We were only bettered by Austria and Norway. If you look from the international to the result. domestic evidence, AGB MCNair did a survey on this in May and October of this year, with very interesting results. Only 14 per cent of respondents reported feeling insecure. But was virtually unchanged when the same question was asked in May. In fact, they reported that 86 per cent of those surveyed felt secure, very secure or reasonably secure. They said that 29 per cent of workers felt more secure than they did a year ago and per cent reported no change. Lastly, we do have some interesting evithe dence on this from the Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey that looked at They came up with this conclusion: as berepresented? tween union members and non-union memer bers, it was the union members who felt more insecure. What that means is that the Labor Party's policy on industrial relations, is basically written by the ACTU executive, is to coerce people back into the union movement-everybody knows people have been leaving unions because they have not been providing a service-to force people back into the trade union movement, which would add to levels of insecurity. Lastly, I want to make this point: to the extent that there is some insecurity-and I consideration. have reported that 14 per cent figure-it is a bit much that the Labor Party should be attempting to somehow place responsibility on the government in that respect. My authority for that is none other than the member for Melbourne, who had quite a lot to say about the previous government's economic policies and what it meant for security. This is he said after they had just lost office about why they lost office in 1996: Many voters reacted against the enormously destabilising wave of change that has swept through Australian society. Jobs are no longer secure. In other words, at the end of Labor's 13 years, when we saw many people lose their jobs-the highest level of unemployment able since the Great Depression-the reality is that that was as a result of Labor's policies. they stand opposed to all the sensible meastoday ures that we have introduced that really do give people job security, the security of a real job and the prospect of higher wages as a World Expositions",75
87,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is that directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, are you aware that on Tuesday of this week the Premier of Queensland told the Queensland parliament that your government's decision not to participate in World Expo 2000 in Hanover risked our being voted 52 down by World Expo nations when it came to Australia's bid to host the 2002 Expo on Gold Coast? Is it the case that the government has missed the boat for the 1998 World it. Expo in Lisbon where 134 nations will be Will you now urgently reconsidyour government's decision not to participate in Expo 2000 in Hanover, where already 127 nations and organisations have indicated which they will be represented?",76
88,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did have some discussion with the Queensland Premier about this matter at the COAG meeting the week before last. Subsequently, I had some discussion in Sydney about it with the Premier and the Treasurer of Queensland. As a result of that meeting, some further information was tendered to me. The matter remains under close Private Health Insurance",76
89,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health and Family Services, and is of a matter of great interest to the people in my electorate of Moreton. what Can the minister inform the House of any current data relating to private health insurance membership? What is the relationship between membership levels and the government's good policy of providing incentives for people to take out and maintain private health insurance?",76
90,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourmember for his question, and I thank him for his interest and support in this area. I am Today pleased to inform honourable members that the Private Health Insurance Advisory Council released the health insurance figures for the September quarter. For the first time in seven years it has shown a small increase. We put this in the context of what has happened in the last seven years under Labor when we lost two per cent of the population per year out of private health insurance. We put it in the context that since the March 1990 quarter there has been a drop-out from private health insurance every single quarter. We put it in the context that 5,591,000 Australians now have private health insurance and 1,230,000 Australians have the benefits of government incentives. In the end, I concede that that alone is not all our task is. There is certainly a substantial task still to do on informed financial consent. There is a substantial task of trying to make people fully aware of what they are going to be able to pocket, not having a large number of bills turning up after a procedure and not having large gaps. We are making progress on that as well. The full picture will not emerge for some quarters because it will take time to get some idea of the full effect of the high income surcharge and the full effect of the drop-out rate or otherwise from the incentives. But the fact is that, on the basis of a two per cent drop-out each and every year under the Labor Party, this is a good first result. It is encourthat aging, it will take some pressure off the state public hospital system and it is something the previous government could never even have dreamt of achieving. Private Health Insurance",76
91,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. I refer the minister to those same private health insurance membership figures, which indicate that the government's tax rebate and also the Medicare levy surcharge, costing $1.7 billion, has delivered that microscopic 0.1 per cent increase. Minister, why won't you now concede that Jeff Kennett, the AMA and the Industry Commission were right and that you should have spent that money directly on patient care, or are you so desperate to save face on this discredited policy that you claim that spending $50,000 of taxpayers' money for each additional member is good value?",77
92,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have a substantial problem on this because there are 1,230,000 Australians that you are going to rip the benefits off. You have form on this. In 1984 you took away the incentives that then existed, and you are going to do it again. You will hear from us again and again that pensioners and families who are getting $250 a year or $450 a year are going to lose it under you. The other thing is that the decline under the last government from 39Y2 per cent to 32 per cent-a loss of nearly seven per cent of the insured population-has brought the public hospital system to its knees. It was your abject neglect in government that led to this happening. I would much rather try to treat the cause of a problem rather than only the symptoms. What you are proposing is just treating the symptoms. If we keep losing another two per cent of the population out of private health insurance every year, which would have happened under you as it happened for the best part of 13 years, you are not treating the cause of the problem. If you want to look at the net effect of today's result, look at it against the background of a half a per cent drop every quarter you were in. That was a disgrace. Not only have we turned that around; we have also had the first small increase in seven years. It is something that you were incapable of doing. Industry Policy",77
93,Mr LIEBERMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Has the minister seen recent reports detailing the alternative approach to industry policy? Can the minister inform the House how these policies compare with the government's achievements in this area and its policies for opportunity, security and jobs?",77
94,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad the member for Indi has raised this question and made the observation he did because, while the government has had this year a remarkable record in the development of new and innovative policies for industry, particularly in the areas of TCF, automotives and pharmaceuticals, and is very shortly to respond to the Mortimer report, I have to say that I, too, noted the comments put out by the member for Hotham-which were leaked so that no-one would really know he did it. Two particular comments in the press caught my eye. One was in the Age, which quoted someone as saying, 'Most of the platform resembles the industry policy Labor pursued in office.' The second observation I made was in the Sydney Morning Herald, which notes: 'Light on detail' and 'with no explanation of exactly how Labor will tailor its assistance to individual industries.' I am not surprised those comments come from the newspapers when they read these proposals because they certainly are light on detail and they reflect completely past failures of policy by the Labor Party in all respects. Let me take just two examples of what is proposed in these industry statements-firstly, action plans for all industries. No detail. No costing. No example of how much extra paperwork goes into all this. Nothing that will progress industry whatsoever. The second area was specific targets. Unless you agree to Labor Party targets for jobs and for exports, you will not be eligible for assistance under their industry program. I you, therefore, to the great success of their steel plan, where hundreds of jobs were lost, and to the great success of their car plan, where hundreds or thousands of jobs were lost. So those two things were completely irrelevant. Surely we have learned something from the 1970s and 1980s. Prescriptive policies, frankly, do not work.",77
95,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So your ideas about cars and TCF were wrong?,78
96,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What you should be doing requires a bit of leadership from you and more sophistication in your approach-less yelling, a bit more thinking. Do you know what they say about you in the Republican magazine? A bit short on ideas. That is what they quoted you as being. The new policies of Labor are complete rehashes, re-runs of the past. There is no inspiration in them whatsoever. They are the sorts of things which voters will not buy. They are the sorts of things that will not do one thing for Australian industry, and they should be rejected by all Australian voters. Bank Fees and Charges",78
97,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, do you recall your Treasurer saying last year that red-hot competition would work to keep bank fees and charges in check? How can you then explain today's report that the five biggest banks in Australia have grabbed an extra $617 million in fees and charges in the last year, which is up 10 per cent on the previous 12 months? Will the government now reverse its decisions to embrace the Wallis open slather recommendation on bank fees and charges, and immediately direct the competition watchdog, the ACCC, to begin formal monitoring so that ordinary Australian families get a fairer deal?",78
98,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not think I would finish the week on this one. Of course, redhot competition in the banking system is terrific. It is red-hot competition that has brought housing interest rates to their lowest level since 1969. It is the red-hot competition of RAM, Aussie Home Loans and all those other organisations that the Wallis reforms take will in time promote in other sectors of Australia. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr SPEAKER ",78
99,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is not a point of order; this is a blatant interruption.,78
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question is not how the banks have lost their profits on lower interest rates but how they have been regaining it at the expense of ordinary Australian families by a bit ripping up their fees and charges.",78
101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,78
102,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We really do love you, Gareth. You are a bonus. You are opposition plus! As far as we are concerned, the truth is that the average Australian family-all of those people who worry from day to day not about the intricacies of microand macroeconomic policy but about how they are going to pay off their housing mortgage-is $262 per month better off under the Howard government, and it is largely due to the very red-hot competition that the Treasurer spoke about. You can ask all the questions you like, you can quote all the newspaper reports you like, but you cannot deny the fact that since we have been in government there has been a record drop in housing interest rates, and money has gone straight into the pockets of Australian home buyers. That is a direct result of competition. Far from repudiating the recommendations of Wallis, we ought to have more of it. Thanks, Gareth. Food Labelling Mr mCKS-My question is directed Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs. Is the government aware of the concerns of pork and citrus producers that imported products are being labelled 'Made in directed, Australia'? What action is the government going to take to address this issue?",78
103,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable country member for Riverina for his question and acknowledge his particular representations this issue. Consumers and manufacturers certainly have a right to clarity in this issue. The issue was far too hard for the Labor government, but we have acted promptly. Yesterday, we announced a new labelling regime that recognises both the structure of Australian manufacturing and the needs of consumers. The government proposes to amend Trade Practices Act to set out a two-tier test which a product will have to pass before claims to be made in Australia. The test is Paper. that the product passes a substantial transformation test and that at least 50 per cent of the cost of production of the good had been incurred in Australia. Under this proposed test, consumers can be confident that the majority of the value of a good carrying label 'Made in Australia' is from activity undertaken in this country. As the minister, I will have a new power under the Trade Practices Act to regulate how the substantial transformation test should applied in particular circumstances and regulate special industry logos where industries choose to set higher standards than those laid down as minimums in the act. The products that have 100 per cent Australian content or near to it will be recognised, as in the past, through the 'Product of Australia' description. Origin labelling for food products is a particular concern. The proposed amendments that to the Trade Practices Act will not allow goods that have undertaken only minimal processing in this country, like ham made from imported pig meat or citrus juice that has just been converted from imported concentrate, to carry an Australian origin claim. The government will direct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to to the enforce the new test vigorously. In addition, we recognise that there are special needs of the food industry. The Australia New Zealand Food Authority has been as a matter of urgency, to examine what additional regulations may be required in order to ensure that there is effective of origin labelling in that sector. I am pleased to be able to report to the on House that these new announcements have been warmly welcomed by industry and by all of those who are associated with this process. The government has taken leadership in this area, where the previous government was unable to make any progress for 13 years. I thank the member for his interest in this area. I am sure that all Australian farmers, manufacturers and, indeed, consumers will be the pleased by this new initiative.",79
104,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that it further questions be placed on the Notice NA",79
105,Mr LEE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",79
106,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable the member claim to have been misrepresented?,79
107,Mr LEE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I do, Mr Speaker.",79
108,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,79
109,Mr LEE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I would be hopeful that the be Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr to Wooldridge) would be man enough to admit he was wrong and apologise after I have explained the error. In question time today, the minister was referred to a question about a calcium channel blocker that I asked of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on Monday. The minister said this afternoon that I was raising an issue about treating high blood pressure. The minister is walking out-scurrying. Minister, please come back. I would have been grateful for an apology from him, Mr Speaker, but he is leaving.",79
110,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The member for Dobell will move to where he has been misrepresented or resume his seat.,80
111,Mr LEE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The minister said that I was raising an issue about treating high blood pressure and about certain chemical betablockers being safer for people with cardiac failure. He went on to say this afternoon that my question did not make sense and the minister-who has left the chamber-said that they said, 'We can't understand the logic behind his question,' and they went further to say, 'He's probably confused the medications.'",80
112,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,We are not debating the issue. Where have you been misrepresented?,80
113,Mr LEE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am able to point out where the misrepresentation is. Mr Speaker, all I have said so far is what the minister has said. In fact, the question which was asked on Monday asked about a calcium channel blocker. The minister refers to beta-blockers, which are very different to calcium channel blockers. Clearly, the reason the department could not find the information that the minister had requested was that the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, does not understand the difference between a calcium channel blocker and a beta-blocker.",80
114,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Where have you been misrepresented?,80
115,Mr LEE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Finally, if the minister is confused, I would refer him to page 3 of the document that he tabled this afternoon which refers to Norvasc at the top of the page. That way he might understand the difference between calcium channel blockers and betablockers. NA House Practice",80
116,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question to ask of you, Mr Speaker. I wish to clarify procedure in the House. When people come into the observer boxes and they take their place, that is understood, but is it practice for people wanting to bring messages into signal from outside the door and then have the attendants take the messages or do they come in and deliver the messages?",80
117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"It is a combination of two factors. There is a method whereby a signal can be sent to an attendant. But senior ministerial advisers occupy the ministerial advisers boxes on both sides of the chamber for the opposition and the government. They are enabled frequently to move in and out of the chamber. But under no circumstances are any of the ministerial or opposition advisers enabled to approach any of their representatives in any way, other than through the ministerial media advisers boxes. They cannot under any circumstances approach the member personally. NA",80
118,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"On 28 October the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) raised as a matter of privilege allegations of unauthorised disclosure in respect of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. In accordance with the practice of the House in such matters, the honourable member was required to have the matter considered by his committee. The committee was required to take steps to try to ascertain the source of the disclosure and to consider whether substantial interference had occurred. On 18 November the honourable member for Leichhardt reported on the matter. In summary, first, he stated that his committee had considered the matter at a private meeting. Secondly, he identified five points concerning apparent disclosure of information. Thirdly, he stated that the committee considered that substantial interference had occurred. The honourable member for Leichhardt has also informed me that the committee has taken steps to try to ascertain the source of the disclosure. On Tuesday I allowed the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) to speak on the matter in circumstances not dissimilar to those in which I had allowed the Attorney General (Mr Williams) to speak in October: The honourable member for Banks posed a number of questions. He queried a meeting said to have taken place on 27 October and raised detailed points about meetings of procedure and so on. I have examined the honourable member for Banks' remarks and the papers he presented. But I consider that in such matters it is neither desirable nor practicable for a Speaker to try to make an assessment of the validity of any preliminary assessment reported to the House. The procedure adopted by Speaker MCLeay followed by that of Speaker Martin was that, where a committee reported that substantial interference had occurred as a result of unauthorised disclosure and that steps had been taken to try to ascertain the source, precedence would be allowed to a motion. In accordance with this practice, I am willing to allow precedence to a motion on this matter. Motion (by Mr Entsch) agreed to: That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges for inquiry and report: whether there was unauthorised disclosure of the report or the minority report of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, or of correspondence or other information concerning the committee's inquiry.",80

121,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The crisis in Australian sport surrounding the appointment of Dr Ekkart Arbeit to head coach of Athletics Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",84
122,Mr MARTIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I do not think there has been an issue that has captured the minds of Australians to the extent that this has in such a long time. Day after day since this particular issue broke we have seen headline after headline-headlines calling for Dr Arbeit, the former East German athletics coach, not to be appointed as the head of Australia's athletics regime in this country. And well might those calls be made, because what we have seen systematically as over a period now are the cosy little arrangements in the world of athletics and in the world of sport: 'Forget credentials. If somebody is going to be appointed to a job, we will do it; but we will not bother to go and investigate the circumstances of that appointment.' Earlier today I mentioned to the Minister for Sport and Tourism (Mr Andrew Thomson), who is at the table, that this is not a matter that is critical of him. He has been in the job for only a short period. But it is critical of the process. It is critical of the fact that comments have been made by the present minister in respect of what may happen or may not happen if Dr Arbeit has to be paid out, and that has implications for Athletics Australia and for sport in this country. It is with some sadness that I report to this House today that, in endeavouring to get information on this matter from the government, the government used its numbers at a Senate committee meeting this afternoon to gag further questioning on the appointment of Dr Arbeit. Government members of the other place used their numbers to gag any debate and any questioning by Labor senators to ascertain some information on the process of the appointment of Dr Arbeit. But some questions were asked earlier today, and they were quite revealing. In questions put to Mr John Boultbee, the Director of the Australian Institute of Sport, it came to light that the reason Athletics Australia was searching for a new head coach was that in about December 1996 or January 1997 the incumbent resigned. In March of 1997 the Athletics Australia organisation advertised for a replacement, seeking to have applications closed in April, some few weeks later. It came to pass that, when the due date arose, 18 applications or thereabouts were received. Guess whose application was not there? Dr Arbeit's application came three months later, in August. Dr Arbeit's application came after-according to Mr Boultbeean applicant from Britain said he really didn't want the job but he reckoned there was this former East German who would fit the bill. He said to Athletics Australia: 'You should get in touch with him.' John Boultbee happened to be overseas at the time and Athletics Australia said to John Boultbee: 'Could you go and have a chat with this Dr Arbeit character that we have heard about? He might be the bloke for the job in Australia.' So Mr Boultbee did; he went and had a chat with him. But Mr Boultbee, when questioned about the nature of that discussion, said that it was a 'cursory' examination only, it was something which he undertook on behalf of Athletics Australia but it really wasn't an in-depth, fact finding mission. That is quite significant, because one of the criticisms that has been levelled at Athletics Australia in regard to the appointment of Dr Arbeit has been the process by which this particular individual was chosen and whether that process threw up the information about him. I know that the Minister for Sport and· Tourism, who is at the table, has been concerned about that and has expressed those concerns. I know that his predecessor ultimately came to the view that that process perhaps was not right. That is why a threeperson committee of very influential and very significant former athletes has been put together to investigate that process. But the simple fact is that Mr Boultbee, who formed this rudimentary opinion, as he told the Senate estimates committee this afternoon only, subsequently saw an application for the job come forward by Dr Arbeit. Yesterday, the minister told a press conference that there had been no contract signed between Athletics Australia and Dr Arbeit. The minister said that there had only been a letter of offer exchanged between the two parties. In that respect the minister is suggestand ing, therefore, that there is no compulsion on behalf of Athletics Australia to payout any of the moneys-$400,000, I think, was the actual amount being offered to Dr Arbeit to come here--or any compensation because there is not a firm contract. Of course, Dr Arbeit thinks there is. Doctor A reckons he has a contract. He reckons that he could have gone to South Korea-I think it was South Korea-to coach. But unfortunately he can't go to too many other places. On the wires today there is a comment from Professor Werner Franke, who is the independent scientist who has been doing the inquiries into the drugs in sport programs in the former East Germany and who says about our good friend Dr Arbeit that he was not 'a pill distributor but a decision maker' and: . It's clear that he was a top gun at decision making level. He uses the word anabolic steroids and says this person takes too much, this person needs more. Who is more involved? The person who gives the order to shoot at the border or the person who shoots? That is the point. Athletics Australia has been saying all along, and Martin Soust said yesterday on the AM program: We've always said that if there was any hard evidence that would link Dr Arbeit with the administration of dlUgS to athletes, he was personally involved in the administration of those drugs to athletes, then of course we would consider our appointment of him to positions for coaching. That is the point. Mr Soust, who is the executive director of Athletics Australia and still championing Dr Arbeit as the person to get the job, said that if there were any hard evidence they would not give him the job. Today we have reporting back from Germany the chief scientist, the investigator doing the inquiry, saying: 'He was a decision maker. He knew about all this.' But wait. There is more. As we know, not only is this particular individual involved in doping and looking after athletes under his care in terms of their drug program but, in the true tradition of 007 James Bond, he is a spy, or was a spy. There have been revelations that he worked for Stasi, the East German secret police, and reported on the athletes in his care and control, reported on their sexual habits sexual preferences, on what they had for breakfast, on whether they were taking enhancing drugs or not in their performance and, if they were, on whether they should go to Western countries to perform in case there were drug testing procedures that might find them out. This is a man who was being sought by Australia to look after our efforts. Minister, I said this the other day. I wonder now whether, in looking for an out. Athletics Australia might go back to the application form. Have a look on that and see, okay, 'Dr Ekkart Arbeit'. Where did he come from? 'Former East Germany' . Look under 'Previous occupations' and see whether 'spy' has been listed: 'Previous occupation-spy.' If it is there then you could probably say: 'Okay. He has told us all about his previous occupation.' But if it is not there, clearly that might be out for Athletics Australia. Then go and have a look at the list of referees that he has probably advanced as well. You would probably find John Le Carre, Sean Connery, Sir Anthony Blunt, Maxwell Smart, Peter Wright and, at the end, Inspector Gadget. All of those would have been good referees for this bloke, who is supposed to come in and look after Australia's elite athletes as they prepare themselves for the next Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games. Minister, you were dead right yesterday, and I commend you for saying it, that this man should be cut loose now. However, not only are you saying it. Editorial al, either today or in recent times, has called for the same action to be taken: the Australian, 'Arbeit choice discredited by Stasi files'; the Sydney Morning Herald, 'Sack Dr Arbeit'; the Daily Telegraph in Sydney, 'A bad sport'; the Herald-Sun in Melbourne, 'Stay home, Dr Arbeit'; in the Courier-Mail, 'No place here for Stasi informer'; and, finally, in the Age Melbourne, 'A coach we won't abide'. The simple fact is that not only are people who are opinion makers saying this but so too are people who should know-the people in the sports themselves. Have a look at the list of people, starting from administrators in the Australian Olympic movement, and in the international Olympic movement. Have a look at people like Raelene Boyle, Melinda Gainsford-Taylor, any of those athletes, and see what they have said in the past and what they are saying now. I saw Melinda Gainsford-Taylor on TV last night, She is one of Australia's real hopes to win gold in athletics next year at the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games. She said that the non-appointment of a head coach is affecting the ability of her own coach to get appointment and her preparation. Raelene Boyle has been out there in the media also saying that these people who in the past administered drugs to the East German athletes cost her gold medals in Olympic Games-and that is right. Yet Athletics Australia is standing firm and saying, 'Well, show us some hard evidence that this bloke being a spy for the former East an German secret police is going to be a worry for Australian athletes.' You ask any of the present athletes, 'Excuse me, would you mind if we were to employ this guy and, look, his track record is that he used to spy on people's sexual preferences; have you got any worries about that?' and see what those athletes today say. If it was not so stupid,· it would make you laugh. But the other interesting problem that the minister has now identified for Athletics Australia goes to the funding issue. The minister has said-in fact, he has given a categorical ruling on this-no public funds will be used to payout Dr Arbeit if in fact after editorithat has to happen. Minister, I refer you to the annual report of the Australian Sports Commission of 1996-97. That annual report lists how much money is allocated by the Sports Commission to each sport that they look after in this country. Near the top of the tree, one of the super seven sports is athletics-and it is on page 77. How in much went to Athletics Australia? It was $3.1 million approximately. You have said that no taxpayer funds will be used to payout Arbeit, but the major source of funds for Athletics Australia is taxpayer funds. They come from your Australian Sports Commission. I think, therefore, that will be a matter you will have to pursue. I agree that they get funding from other sources, external sources, but is that funding anywhere near the $400,000 it may be necessary to give the good Dr A his marching orders? I am concerned that, if Athletics Australia has to find $400,000 to pay this joker out, it will mean that there will be less money for athletes in this country, less money as they prepare themselves to go to Kuala Lumpur next year, less money as they prepare themselves for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney and less money overall for the development of Australia's elite talent. You know as well as I do--because you have been singing the same tune as I have for years-that Australia is a proud drug-free country. Yet Athletics Australia, by taking absolutely stupid and naive decision it took months ago to appoint Dr Arbeit to this position, has thumbed its nose at what Australia has stood for. Can you imagine us in Kuala Lumpur next year and in Sydney 2000 going to the games and saying, 'Look, we want stronger drug testing, we've put more money into drug testing, we've done more tests this year than we have ever done; but oh, by the way, we have a former East German spy who is a drug pusher as the head of our athletics coaches.' What an absolute nonsense that is. It is an absolute joke. As the editorialists of major dailies in this country wrote today, 'It's time that Dr A be given the big A.' Minister, you have to ensure that that happens. Your words give me comfort in this, I have to say, and I commend you for it. You have been saying, although a little bit at arm's length, it is a decision for Athletics Australia. But, let me tell you, according to the ASC, you give them the bulk of their money. Use that as a leverage to say to Athletics Australia, 'Boys and girls, cut your losses, stop making yourselves look like a bunch of geese, and get rid of Dr A.' It is time he went. It is time that we got somebody who Australians can work with. What is wrong with Australian coaches? We have to go around the world finding ex-spies and putting them in. There must be somebody in this country who can do the job. Minister, I implore you to use your good offices to ensure that Athletics Australia does the right thing. The matter is not going to stop here. We will continue to ask questions about this. I would also like to know what your predecessor knew about this appointment: was he informed by the Australian Sports Commission about any of this? I would have thought that, in the broader scheme of things, he would have been given advice. Did he sign off on it? I wonder if you might be able to respond to that particular question. Did Minister Smith know about that? Dr A should go now. (Time expired)",84
123,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"WentworthMinister for Sport and Tourism and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (3.35 p.m.)-This MPI is the the first that has been called on since I assumed this job and, I must say, it has surprised me a little. As far as the government is concerned, and the taxpayers are concerned, the affair of Dr Ekkart Arbeit finished yesterday when we made it very. clear that, in order to protect the country's reputation in the matter of sport and drug-free sport and the perception that is necessary therein, especially for a country that is hosting an Olympic Games, no taxpayers money would go to fund any payout of this man were his proposed appointment to be rejected, as we all hope it will be. And, in the extraordinary case were Athletics Australia to persevere and employ him, likewise I would take the necessary steps to make sure that no taxpayers' funds would be used in his employment. But, that said, what I find somewhat disturbing perhaps are not only the allegations in the newspapers but also the fact that one of the opposition frontbenchers is here in the parliament commending me. It reminds me of that old phrase of Chairman Mao: when the fox seems friendly, put another lock on the chicken coop. It is not often that the two sides in the federal parliament agree on things. But there are some things, plainly, on which we do in this case. All that said, what is important, I think, is that due process and priorities be observed in these contentious matters-although, as I said yesterday, the issues raised to date are very disturbing. We have these sorts of allegations of apparent, although unsubstantiated, facts being reported in our news media. They are coming out of these files that have been released from the former Republic of East Germany's internal secret service-the Stasi, as it is known. Things that go to the alleged activities of Dr Arbeit while he was acting as a senior coach in East Germany make it quite clear to me that his appointment, should it go ahead, would be quite contrary to the government's determination to keep Australia's reputation in this matter as pure and wholesome as possible. It is clear, likewise, that Athletics as my opponent the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) said, is the custodian, primarily, of our good name and he alluded to the preposterous notion that an Australian athletics team could go next year to the Commonwealth Games, let alone to the Sydney Olympics, with a man with the apparent history of Dr Arbeit as their head coach and that this would go directly to our international reputation and is not something that the government, the taxpayers or the athletes of Australia would ever tolerate. I should make it clear that this is not an appointment proposed by government; it is an appointment proposed by a national sporting organisation. As tempting as it is in some of these cases to rush in and purport to exercise powers that one does not actually legally possess, in this case I did my best yesterday to make it clear that the appointment would be unacceptable to the government. As the honourable member for Cunningham points out, the federal government is the majority sponsor or funder of Athletics Australiathrough the grant Athletics Australia receives through the Sports Commission-and therefore the sort of person appointed to coach our very precious athletes is of direct national interest. On the question of compensation, the legalities and these sorts of things, as I said yesterday, there is no formal contract between Dr Arbeit and Athletics Australia and therefore no question of termination ought to arise. If they choose not to proceed with the appointment, as I am fairly confident they will choose, and if in the extraordinary case litigation was on foot here in Australia, I am advised likewise that the termination clause of this letter of offer provided to Dr Arbeit specifies a period of only one month. In that unlikely case this would result in an amount being paid of about $8,000, not $400,000. I wonder whether the honourable member for Cunningham has suspected this from the beginning but has been led astray perhaps by people who persuaded him to quote a higher figure in order to generate a few headlines. Mr Martin-I was nice to you!",87
124,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am giving Australia, you the presumption of innocence. Mr Martin-I was conciliatory.",88
125,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I commend the zeal you have displayed in this matter. There is no doubt about that I do not doubt your zeal. Mr Martin-Wasn't the contract for $400,000, though?",88
126,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The termination clause is more relevant to the issue of compensation than is the total value of the contract. In any case, as I said yesterday, I do not believe that there is one on foot. Therefore, this question should not arise. There are other things I should traverse. One, of course, is the honourable gentleman's press release of yesterday, 19 November, entitled 'Sports minister and Arbeit: too little too late' . I suppose that this was issued before question time. I give you that presumption of innocence too. Had you issued it after question time. I would have to deliver you a rebuke. But, if you plead innocent, we will just go over some of the matters raised in the press release. I will gently dismiss them in the same tone that you have spoken to me.",88
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And gently refer your remarks through the chair as well, please.",88
128,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will gently follow your instruction, Mr Deputy Speaker. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and always through you, in his press release the honourable member for Cunningham raised three questions after quoting some of the remarks I made in question time yesterday. First of all he says: If there is no contracton footwhy does the Australian taxpayer have to pay for a review whose findings are unlikely to result in the appointment of Dr Arbeit? That is not so. We will not pay for a review. I think you know, having served as Speaker, that when these grants are made and they are acquitted by invoice, as it were, or receipt for money spent, one has the opportunity to say, 'No, that acquittal is not within the guidelines for which you were given the money and therefore you will not receive any compensation for incurring that expense.' But it would be, frankly, laughable if they came to the taxpayer for some sort of underwriting commitment for the expense of a review. Mr Martin-What-a three-person review?",88
129,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes. I am not sure really that is at all an issue, given that it was their decision at first to mount the review in responseMr Martin-I think your predecessor had something to do with it.",89
130,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I wonder. But, that said, the taxpayers will not be asked, let alone burdened, with the cost of this review. The second question that the honourable gentleman raises is: What is the process for appointing coaches Australia, that is, how did we end up in this in the first place? That really is covered in the terms of referfor ence under which this review was established. The first of them is that the review will 'consider the steps already taken and informaother tion gained in the selection process'. second is that they will 'determine what, if any, additional lines of inquiry can be follads. lowed about Dr Arbeit'. The third one is that· they will 'ensure that those lines are followed case here. thoroughly'. And, as I said yesterday, the fourth element of that was the taking into account of any 'substantiated evidence about Dr Arbeit coming to light' and recommending to Athletics Australia whether or not he would be an appropriate person to fulfil the position of the director of coaching. So, in my mind, those terms of reference go to that second question: that the process of appointment this case would be examined by the review. I look forward to reading very carefully the conclusions of this review. Mr Martin-Is that going to be made affairs public?",89
131,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is an interesting question whether or not the written conclusions of the review are to be made public. It is something for Athletics Australia to decide in the first instance. Plainly, given that the government and hence the parliament have through the budget process given their imprimatur to funds flowing to Athletics Australia, I think it is proper that such conclusions are made public. I was asked a similar question last night on the ABC when the interviewer asked whether I expected that there would be some explanation of what happened, and I said that yes, I thought we would be given that explanation shortly. That, I imagine, will be the release of the conclusions of this review. Finally, the third question of the press release was this: Will the Minister now make taxpayer funding of Athletics Australia contingent upon a comprehensive and transparent process for appointments? That goes without saying. There has been difficulty with a particular national sporting organisation-there have been plenty in the to past, I gather-where grants have been given mess and the budget either has been misspent or has blown out and so forth, and the purpose which the grant was made is not achieved. Of course, the next time they come back to the Sports Commission for funding for anyear, ipso facto the board would say, The without any written instruction from the minister, 'Well, last year wasn't too terrific, How are we going to do it this year?' It is pretty obvious that this is going to be the Lastly, let me say a few things about my feeling about the role of sports minister and sport generally and the position of the government in relation to it. I have always been wary of excessive government interference in the lives of citizens. There were some things in my professional life before I was elected to parliament that so irritated me that I put aside in what I thought was a terrific job and sought election to this place. So I have always had a philosophical position that the presumption should be in favour of citizens managing their without the ex cathedra intervention of a minister, especially in a federal government. In the case of sport it is very difficult. There have been some issues raised by senior figures in sport, Herb Elliott for one. I heard him on the Grandstand program on ABC Radio last Saturday or two Saturdays ago talking about the pressure for medals-this issue of how much should the nation expect of our athletes and to what extent must they go to win gold with the pressure that is on them. Sometimes this is given as a reason or even, sadly, an excuse for people who resort to drugs in sport. That is something that we can all dismiss very quickly. Plainly, people who take drugs to enhance their sporting performance are cheating. It is as simple as that. It is just not fair to the others in the sport and therefore, if I may use the phrase, it is quite un-Australian. Sport, especially for young Australians-it certainly was for me as a young fellow-is something to look up to and something you look to for an example of good behaviour. The qualities of persistence, grace in defeat and modesty or magnanimity in victory and what we would call fairness or good sportsmanship are qualities that are important to preserve. Therefore, there is the question of using the great mechanics of federal government, agencies such as the Sports Drug Agency and the powers you grant to them under legislation, to take tests, and even we have to do to make sure in future that our Sports Drug Agency is legally empowered to do certain things that will allow it to detect new forms of cheating. Blood tests are given as one example of what might be necessary in the future. That is a very touchy thing, and in a way it is very upsetting to think that in the future, to keep sport free of drugs and fair to all, you would have to take a sample of someone's blood. It seems a very repellent notion. But, sadly, there are methods and I suppose there are substances that are not detected in the other bodily fluids which are the medium for detecting people who cheat with drugs but are really perhaps only detectable in someone's blood. Well, if it takes that much, with the agreement of people who participate in the sports, with the consensus necessary for such a serious step to be taken, we may have to amend the powers of the Sports Drug Agency to take such steps as that. I suppose we will look back on this case of Dr Arbeit in a few years and have a good chuckle. Serious matter though it is, it has really reached a level of farce that I think none of us quite expected when it first reared its head. If people in positions of authority in national sporting organisations think that it is a reasonable thing to ignore these basic proprieties, I ask them to reflect very seriouslyon that. (Time expired)",89
132,Mr DARGAVEL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I firid it difficult to be quite as generous as my colleague the shadow minister for sport, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), in the assessment of the performance of the Minister for Sport and Tourism (Mr Andrew Thomson) over this debacle. Within my electorate the Australian Institute of Sport is located, and many past and hopefully future Olympians and other sportspeople find themselves there from time to time. It is those people who motivate me to speak today, because it is those people who essentially find their reputations sullied by a growing perception, domestically and internationally, that Australia is soft on the issue of drugs in sport. The Minister for Sport and Tourism yesterwhat day refused to intervene to stop Athletics Australia appointing its proposed appointee, Dr Arbeit. That is despite the defiant position taken by Athletics Australia. The minister made overtures to Athletics Australia that it perhaps should not proceed with that appointment. He spoke about that yesterday, and his sentiments were commended by the shadow minister. But the fact remains that it changed nothing. Athletics Australia is proposing to proceed with its investigation. It is vacillating over this issue, and this issue needs to be resolved by the minister. The Executive Director of Athletics Australia, Martin Soust, said that Dr Arbeit's spy links were not relevant to their investigation of the appointment. He insisted that only hard evidence of Dr Arbeit's involvement in administering drugs would force them to withdraw their appointment. I think such an arrogant position taken by Athletics Australia requires the minister to intervene, because it affects the high standing of Australia as a drug-free sporting nation and the high standing of our athletes. There is written evidence that there was a doping program in the GDR at the time that Dr Arbeit was the director of sport in that country, yet the minister still refuses to' intervene. He claimed in his recent address to the House that he did not have the power to do so. In my view, he clearly does. He has a lot of leverage, as the shadow minister has pointed out to him. If he finds himself without the power, he can come into this place and ask for it. Instead, he has asked them to continue with their investigations. Athletics Australia are defying the minister, and yet the minister continues to vacillate over the issue. At best, Dr Arbeit knew about doping and there is scant evidence that he combated it in the GDR. At worse, he actively promoted drug use to gain unfair advantage over Australian athletes and athletes from other countries. Quite frankly, the innocence of Dr Arbeit or otherwise is essentially irrelevant. This is not a debate about natural justice being afforded to Dr Arbeit. His contract has not been signed, according to the minister. We do not owe him natural justice in the normal course of events that you might owe to a party to which you have contracted. Whatever the level of Dr Arbeit's involvement in performance enhancing drugs, the international perception will be that Australia is soft on drugs in sport if the appointment proceeds. That is the concern. That is very clear; it is very clear even to this minister. This is about the reputation of our athletes, a reputation which will be sullied if this minister continues to be weak on this issue. Australia will be hosting the Olympics in the year 2000. The eyes of the world will be upon us and our attitude to drugs in sport. Yet we may be hosting the Olympics with a head coach who has a past in the perception of the world firmly and squarely footed in an active support for performance enhancing drugs in sport. As Melinda Gainsford-Taylor, the world indoor 200-metre champion, said last month: I totally detest drug cheats. lam clean and proud of it. I have worked far too hard for the public now speculate that I take drugs. This is a concern shared bymany athletes. It was described by Lee Naylor, the 400-metre world championship bronze medallist, who said: If he does come out here, i'in sure that athletes and coaches alike will try and distance themselves from him. And why would they not? The battle against drugs in sport is only a matter of science. For every new test that we develop to catch new performance enhancing drugs, new drugs are developed to evade those tests. It is a never ending cycle. There remains, despite the advances in drug testing, doubts about the effectiveness of that testing. So the perceptions about the seriousness of host nations and nations involved in sport are quite critical. It is all very well to pick up medals at the Olympic Games and other sporting events, but if the perception is that you have cheated the value of that vie:tory is enormously devalued. Dr Arbeit presided over an organisation that. had a doping program. Athletics Australia have described him as the medal messiah. We are left with a perception that the drive for gold has blinded their commitment to play by the rules. Athletes are now increasing their training effort for the 2000 Olympics. The concern is that our efforts at the Olympics will be tarnished by this rather sordid debate. So huge has been the concern that many athletes have spoken out. We have heard from Raylene Boyle, Jane Flemming, Darren Clarke, Nicole Boegman, Kieren Perkins; Lee Naylor, Steve Moneghetti, Melinda Gainsford-Taylor, Kyle Vander-Kuyp and Tim Forsyth. They have all spoken out. They are all proud athletes and athletes of which this country should be proud. They are asking that we reciprocate some of the effort that they have put in on this country's behalf. IOC member Phil Coles summarised the situation when he said last month: If that's the way the athletes feel there is nowhere for him to go, even if he is cleared, because he doesn't have their support. to Frankly, by refusing to take action, the minister compromises not only the reputation of our athletes as drug-free athletes but also their chances of winning at the Olympics and every other sporting event. If the athletes under the chief coach-the boss of the show-cannot work with him, it defies imagination how our chances at the Olympics will be improved. In my view, the minister has little regard for the efforts of these athletes, because their reputations are being sullied by the ongoing drama surrounding the appointment of this gentleman. These are people who have trained endlessly for years; they have made huge sacrifices for their sport in order to represent this country. They have set back their nonsporting careers. They have suffered all the things that people have to compromise when they spend inordinate hours in one obsessive pursuit. And their country wants to appoint a boss who spies on the most intimate personal details of athletes' lives. This is a bloke who, figuratively speaking, hovers at the keyhole, filling out reports on people's personal lives, on their sexual preferand ences and files them with political masters. Is this the sort of person we want representing our sporting heroes and champions? Is this the sort of person that our sporting heroes and champions should have to work under? How many workers in this country would cop a boss carrying on like that? Is that the Australshadow Ian way? Perhaps it will be in the future under this coalition's approach to industrial relations, but I do not think our sporting champions should have to cop that kind of behaviour. I think the coalition, in refusing intervene aggressively in this matter, is creating an image that perhaps they are quite relaxed about that sort of behaviour. Quite frankly, it comes down to a decision of providing natural justice to a former Stasi spy on the one hand or backing our athletes on the other. But this is not a debate about natural justice, as I have said. If it comes down to backing the athletes on the one hand or spies on the other, I and all my Labor colleagues will back the athletes any day of the week. It is about time the minister came in here, intervened and stopped Athletics Australia's carry-on.",90
133,Mr RONALDSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"BallaratParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (4.00 p.m.)-It is unfortunate that the first two speakers were followed by that last speech by the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel). I am afraid he has shown his political immaturity and, regrettably, his age and maturity. To address this debate in the manner that the member for Fraser did in the last two minutes of his speech does him no good at all. I would be very surprised if his colleagues agreed with the sentiments he expressed in the last two minutes of his speech. The first speaker, the shadow minister, quite rightly indicated to the House that the Minister for Sport and Tourism (Mr Andrew Thomson) had done what was required of him. I am pleased that he has adopted that attitude in the last three or four hours. I think he would admit, if questioned about it, that that certainly has not been his view in press releases over the last 24 hours, wherein he used expressions such as 'biting the bullet' 'clearing up the mess' and called on the sports minister to intervene immediately and stop the appointment. The shadow minister-I will give him his dues-has had a chance to think about that. His speech today indicated that he is acutely aware of the fact that this minister cannot sack Dr Arbeit. Indeed, the minister acknowledged that he can make moves which are supported by the minister to ensure it. I would have thought that it was very clearly indicated that this man will not be to paid by the taxpayers if he is sacked, under whatever contractual regime it might be, and that he will not be paid from taxpayers' funds if he is employed. It is a very clear lean-on. If indeed the member for Fraser, who has left the chamber, is telling the House that government ministers should, at whatever stage of a debate, take on matters such as this and preempt the role of appointed sporting bodies in this country, then I think that that would be a very dangerous precedent. The House should be aware that there are three coaches from the former GDR who are employed by the Australian Institute of Sport. If the implication is that this man's background automatically makes him guilty of a series' of offences, which the honourable member for Fraser tried to imply today, then I think that is a very dangerous precedent for the honourable member to pursue. I would be very surprised if those sentiments were shared by his colleagues. I think the great bulk of honourable members in this House would believe that due process should be followed. It really is a very basic and fundamental right of the community and something that this parliament should support. Due process has been followed. The shadow minister quite rightly acknowledged how quickly this new minister became involved. The announcement from AA was made on 2 October; on 3 October there was some criticism from Australian athletes; there was criticism at an annual meeting of Australian track and field coaches; there was a crisis meeting of AA, with a vote to stand by Dr Arbeit; and on 8 October the federal minister ordered a review of the decision. I will read out the terms of that review because it is very important for it to be put on the public record just how far this review went into it. A decision can then be made about the appropriateness or otherwise of that review. The document states: The review will: - Consider the steps already taken and information gained in the selection process for the Director of Coaching; - Determine what, if any, additional lines of inquiry can be followed about Dr Arbeit; - Ensure that those lines are followed thoroughly; - Taking account of any unsubstantiated evidence about Dr Arbeit coming to light, recommend whether he would be an appropriate person to fulfil the position of Director of Coaching. If there is one thing that is pivotal to sport in this country-I would be very surprised if the shadow minister does not agree with me-it is that Australian sport should be run by Australian sport. I suspect that if there is one group in this country that would suffer the most from inappropriate government intervention it probably would be the elite athletes of this country. I need to differentiate between the comments made in the last hour by the shadow minister, who acknowledges that the role played by the minister has been an appropriate one, and the immature comments of the member for Fraser, who I hope will go back and have a look at his speech and at the shadow minister's comments and then decide whether guilt by geographic association, which he effectively alleged, was an appropriate course to undertake. I do not think that on reflection he will believe that it is appropriate. The shadow minister has taken a bipartisan approach on this matter. I do not think he would want any minister for sport to rush in where fools fear to tread, and it would be totally inappropriate. History will show that this new minister has very much bitten the bullet arid has done everything that is required of him. The shadow minister knows-the member for Fraser should know; if he does not, he ought to be very careful about what he says in this place-that the Australian Minister for Sport and Tourism cannot remove Dr Arbeit from his position. If you accept that as fact, which it is, you then review what this minister has done. I am a little annoyed that the tag team from the opposition today has been led by the shadow minister; he has taken the responsible position. But one of his backbenchers has been running with the principle that where there is smoke, there is a bit of fire. I do not think that is appropriate in the circumstances. People need to make a decision about whether they believe a minister for sport saying that no taxpayer funds will be used to buy this man out if that is required-I think the minister quoted a figure of $8,000 in a worse case scenario. If those in the House and those listening to this debate reflect on the minister's comments, they will know that the minister quite specifically alluded to a termination agreement, in writing, of four weeks. It is not $400,000; the maximum is $8,000. The minister has quite clearly said in this House and on the public record that it will not be paid for by the taxpayer. I repeat: he has quite clearly said that, if Athletics Australia employs this man, the Australian taxpayer will not be funding it. If it looks like a duck, moves like a duck and quacks like a duck, there is a fair chance it is a duck. This minister-and this has been acknowledged by the shadow minister-cannot force Athletics Australia to sack this man. He has no power at all to do anything in a contractual sense. If you accept that is the situationthe shadow minister has accepted that, to his credit-I do not think there is much more that could have been done by this minister on this matter. (Time expired)",92

Second Reading",94
135,Mr WILLIAMS,SENATE,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill will amend the Judiciary Act 1903 to establish the Australian Government Solicitor, AGS, as a statutory authority separate from my department, so as to enhance its position as the government's legal firm in providing quality legal services to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth bodies. It will also provide a framework for greater contestability in the delivery of legal services to the Commonwealth, in particular to enable private law firms to compete for the first time for significant areas of Commonwealth litigation. The coalition's law and justice policy for the last election included a commitment to undertake a review of legal services provided by the Attorney-General's Legal Practice, including an examination of the possibilities 1997 for government departments and agencies to use private legal firms for litigation. To fulfil that commitment, in November 1996 I commissioned a review of the Commonwealth's legal services needs and how those needs could best be met. The review committee, which comprised an experienced businessman, a prominent barrister and the then secretary to my department, 1997 undertook an extensive review of these issues. The committee consulted with departments and agencies about their legal services needs, as well as holding discussions with the Legal Practice, departmental legal units and private sector lawyers about the delivery of legal services to government. It also commissioned a survey of the Legal Practice's clients and a detailed business analysis of the Legal Practice and invited public submissions on the issues being examined. The committee's report-the Report of the Review of the Attorney-General's Legal Practice-was delivered in March 1997 and made 16 recommendations for reform of the Legal Practice. The committee found that the Legal Practice had made considerable improvements over recent years in its efficiency and the quality of its services-reflected in the generally positive responses to the client survey. However, significant further improvement was possible and desirable, particularly if the government solicitor was to continue to provide high quality, cost-effective legal services in an increasingly competitive environment. One of the fundamental questions examined by the committee was whether the retention of a government owned Legal Practice was justified. The committee found that maintaining government ownership of the Legal Practice was in the public interest. The reasons for this included the ability of the Legal Practice to meet the legal services needs of the Commonwealth-which could be put at risk if the Legal Practice were sold-its abilities to meet the legal services needs of departments and agencies because of its particular focus on government work, its ability to maintain a 'whole of government' approach, its strong corporate memory and the need for a government legal service provider to meet the unique role and needs of the Attorney-General in providing legal services which are core to government. Accordingly, the report recommended retention of the Legal Practice as a government authority, albeit greater contestability. The government considered all options, including the possible sale of the commercial parts of the Legal Practice, but has firmly concluded, for the reasons outlined by the committee, that they should be retained within government ownership. However, the government also considers that, without further reform, the AGS will face a serious risk of not being competitive the marketplace. This is principally because of the current limits on the AGS's business structure and operations, by virtue of its status as part of the Attorney-General's Department. These limitations are not shared by the private law firms with which the AGS is increasingly being asked to compete. Establishment of the Australian Government Solicitor The government has, therefore, accepted the thrust of the committee's recommendations, and in particular has decided to restructure the AGS as a new legal services provider. The bill will implement this decision by amending the Judiciary Act 1903 to establish the AGS as a new statutory body. . The AGS will be structured in a way that maximises its ability to provide legal services and conduct its business operations on a commercial, competitive basis. Its separation from the Attorney-General's Department will facilitate its operation as a government business enterprise. Consistent with the usual approach for government business enterprises-and the position enjoyed by private law firms-it will also be able to employ staff and consultants outside the usual public service regime. Further, it will be able to charge fees at market rates in relation to the legal services it provides. The AGS will not be established under the corporations law but will be set up as a government owned statutory authority, headed by a CEO rather than a board of directors. The CEO will be responsible for the management of the AGS and will otherwise have responsibilities similar to the boards of other government business enterprises. The AGS will be able to provide legal and with related services to a range of government departments, agencies and officers, including to state and territory bodies if they request it to do so. Constitutional limits mean that, unlike private law firms, the AGS's potential client base is largely limited to the Commonwealth government and its agencies and a small range of persons who are acting for the Commonwealth. The bill makes it clear that the AGS will be able to provide advice to the full range of clients within the constitutional in limits. This more focused client base will enable the AGS to deliver a unified, specialised and nationally coordinated approach to government legal services. The AGS is not, and cannot be, the same as privately owned law firms. Its unique value to government is based on its government ownership and its expertise in delivering legal services to government clients. In line with this role, some limited core areas of government legal work, primarily cabinet, constitutional and national security matters, will be reserved to the AGS and not be available to private law firms. The public interest served by having the AGS undertake this role is not inconsistent with having the AGS operate at the highest level of efficiency and make a profit as a government business enterprise. As a government business enterprise, the AGS will have, in effect, me, as Attorney General, and the Minister for Finance and Administration as 'joint shareholders'. Consistent with this approach, the bill gives joint responsibility to the Attorney-General and Minister for Finance and Administration for the business operations of the AGS. This will not interfere with the legal professional functions of the AGS nor with the Attorney General's responsibilities as first law officer in relation to these functions. Competitive neutrality The government is committed to ensuring that, as far as possible, government owned businesses are placed in the same position as the privately owned businesses with which they compete. In most areas of work, departments and agencies will be able to use private law firms to carry out their legal work. In particular, litigation other than that in the reserved categories will be contestable. This opening up of most categories of litigation completes the process of providing choice to government clients that was commenced in 1995. Prior to the proposed commencement on 1 July 1998 of the new system, approval for untying of litigation will be possible on ad hoc administrative basis. The bill contains several measures to ensure that, consistent with the government's competitive neutrality policy statement, the AGS will not enjoy any competitive advantage over private law firms by virtue of its government ownership. Thus, the bill will establish a mechanism to require the AGS to pay to the Commonwealth, in respect of each financial year, an amount equivalent to the total amount of any taxation liability that would have been incurred by it under Commonwealth, state and territory laws if it were a firm of legal practitioners. While the AGS will not be subject to state and territory taxation laws unless they are specially prescribed, requiring the AGS to make a tax equivalent payment will ensure that it enjoys no net competitive taxation advantage over private law firms. Further, I will be empowered, together with the Minister for Finance and Administration and after consultation with the CEO of the AGS, to determine corporate governance arrangements for the AGS. The corporate governance arrangements will enable the AGS to be required to make other payments where this is necessary to achieve competitive neutrality in respect of costs incurred by private law firms. As with other government business enterprises, the AGS will be required to pay to the Commonwealth a dividend analogous to the return of profits to the partners in a law firm. Most importantly, the power to determine corporate governance arrangements will enable the arrangements that apply to the AGS to take into account the particular structure of the AGS and its function of providing legal services to government. In addition, the AGS will be subject to the reporting, accountability and financial requirements of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. Legal services directions The bill also gives the Attorney-General power to issue legal services directions relating to Commonwealth legal work. These directions will be capable of applying to departments and agencies in receipt of legal an services and to their legal services providers, including the AGS, private legal firms and 'in-house' legal units. The directions will provide a framework for the conduct of the Commonwealth's legal affairs but wi11leave prime responsibility for the effective and efficient use of legal services with departments and agencies. Directions will bejlble to be made on the full range of issues affecting Commonwealth legal work, including what work is to be contestable, reporting arrangements in relation to legal work and compliance by legal service providers with the obligation of the Commonwealth to act as a model litigant. This power to issue directions will ensure that, as Attorney-General, I will be in a position to manage risks that could arise from the provision of legal services that are inconsistent, that lack coordination or that do not identify and appropriately deal with whole of government and public interest issues. This is necessary in an environment where an increased range of government legal work will be contestable by private sector firms which are providing a significant proportion of overall legal services. However, I am determined to ensure that minimum restrictions are imposed on the way legal services are provided to departments and agencies, consistent with the aim of ensuring that departments and agencies should be fully and directly accountable for their decisions in relation to legal services. In line with the recommendations of the report on the legal practice, the government approved the establishment within my department of the Office of Legal Services Coordination to assist me in discharging my first law officer role, especially in relation to litigation. The office is now operational and will assist me in the preparation of legal services directions and in consulting with departments and agencies, as well as the private profession, about their content. It will also advise on Commonwealth litigation policy, both in general and in relation to particular cases. In this regard, it will have an important role to play in advising departments and agencies on their obligations under the legal services directions, and on the purchase and delivery of legal services, so as to achieve maximum efficiency and appropriate risk management. The power to issue directions is designed to enable the Attorney-General of the day to fulfil his or her first law officer functions in relation to the provision of legal services to the Commonwealth. Compliance with directions will therefore not be enforceable other than by the Attorney-General, and only the Commonwealth will be able to raise the issue of non-compliance with directions in any legal proceedings. Conclusion The reforms introduced by the bill will give the AGS the structure and flexibility in its business activities and legal services work to enable it to continue to provide high quality legal services to government in an increasingly competitive market. While public interest considerations require that a small number of core subject matters be tied exclusively to government legal providers, for most matters departments and agencies will be able to choose where they obtain their legal services. The bill's reforms will ensure that the AGS is well placed to compete for this work. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. NA (No.2) 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",94
136,Mr WILLIAMS,COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is a further demonstration of this government's commitment to copyright reform, and it is a demonstration of this government's ability to deliver on our reforms. This bill is a measured, fair and practical response to the problem of unduly high prices for music sound recordings in this country. At present, the provisions of the Copyright Act can be used by the owners of copyright in sound recordings to stop anyone else importing copies of their sound recordings. In this way the act can be used to control the Australian market for imported copies of recordings. This is significant as imported recordings constitute the overwhelming percentage of recordings marketed in Australia. The bill will exempt the importation of pirate copies of a sound recording from infringement of copyright in either the sound recording or the works recorded on the recording. It will thereby remove the ability of copyright owners to control the market for each imported copy of a sound recording. Concerns have long been held that the importation provisions of the Copyright Act have been used to obtain higher prices for records and CDs than those prevailing in some other countries, notably the United States of America. The concerns were raised in an inquiry by the copyright law review committee, on which it reported in 1988. This was followed by an inquiry into the prices of sound recordings by the then Prices Surveillance Authority, PSA, in 1990. The PSA found that prices of sound recordings were unreasonably high in Australia and recommended either partial or full removal of copyright control over importation of legitimate copies, thereby introducing direct competition as a mechanism for reducing prices. Unlike the Labor government, which lacked the resolve to implement the PSA report, changing its mind repeatedly over four years, we have acted decisively on those recommendations. But we have not done so precipitantly-or without regard to possible changes in the market and market behaviour since 1990. In our election commitments we stated that we would consult industry and the community on the most effective means of lowering prices for music CDs, and we have done so. Views were sought from a wide cross-section of the Australian music and copyright industries, including representatives of performers, record producers and music publishers, and from consumers. Our decision to follow, in essence, the recommendation of the PSA reflects this government's conclusion that insufficient effort had been made by the recording industry to embrace competition and provide world competitive pricing. While the estimates of the amount of the reduction vary, all the economic advice obtained suggests that allowing importation of legitimate CDs will lead to a reduction in prices. It also has the potential to expand availability of overseas nonrecordings in response to consumer demand, and will give retailers freedom of choice in sourcing supplies. If expected price reductions· lead to increased sales, artists receiving royalty income from sales may well achieve a net gain. Of course, we are aware of the industry arguments that allowing importation will reduce returns and allow greater potential for importation of pirate copies of sound recordings into Australia. The bill responds fully to those concerns, so far as they are justified, in the following way: It maintains all existing copyright owners' rights to take action against pirate copies of sound recordings. It limits permitted imports to legitimate copies, that is, copies of sound recordings made in conformity with the copyright law where they were made and with the consent of the maker of the original recording. It gives very substantial procedural assistance to sound recording copyright owners in civil actions by shifting to the defendant the onus of establishing that a copy that was imported without the copyright owner's consent is not a pirate copy. And it increases and simplifies the penalties for all primary copyright piracy offences in the act. Importation of legitimate copies of sound recordings The bill largely achieves its effect through excluding what are defined as 'non-infringing copies' of sound recordings from the rights to take action for unauthorised importation. The crucial provision is therefore the definition of 'non-infringing copy'. Such a copy must have been made without infringing any law in the country where it was made protecting copyright in any musical or other work used in the sound recording. In addition, it must have been made with the consent of the producer of the original sound recording or other person who is the copyright owner. If the country where the copy was made does not protect sound recordings then the law of the country where the original recording was made comes into play. The definition of 'non-infringing copy' is explained in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum. It is important to note that the definition is designed to ensure that the copies allowed to be imported will be legitimate copies only, while avoiding prejudice to Australia's general trade relations and obligations. Increase in copyright piracy penalties As has been mentioned, the bill will also boost and simplify the primary penalty provisions in the act. We are committed to a copyright system that works. The bill proposes to amend the act to provide that all primary infringement offences-not just those for infringement of copyright in sound recordings-will be subject to fines of up to $55,000 for individuals and $275,000 for corporations. This is a 10 per cent increase over existing maximum penalties. The maximum term of five years imprisonment that may currently be imposed as an alternative, or in addition, to a fine for some copyright offences by individuals will apply across all the primary infringement offences. The language and form of these penalty provisions will also be adjusted to reflect current usage for imposition of penalties. The act presently limits the discretion of courts by restricting the maximum penalty for each infringing article, such as a book or a software disk. However, the value of the copyright carried on the disk or in the bo-k may vary considerably. The amendments wll1 remove maximum penalties for each infringing copy. The maximum will apply whether there is one or many infringing copies. The current distinction between the maximum penalty for a first offence and that for a subsequent offence is also removed for these offences. And last, the setting of maximum penalties for infringements - ela-ed to films at different levels to those for mfnngements for other copyright subject matter is no longer justifiable or necessary, and is also done away with. These changes, while primarily aimed at modernising these penalty provisions, also send a clear message to the courts, as well as would be offenders, that copyright piracy offences are serious matters. The new approach provided for in the bill will emphasise to the courts the importance of their giving due weight to the gravity of the offences before them-having regard to the possible maximum penalties. The increase in maximum penalties will extend to offences against performers' rights, such as making 'bootleg' recordings-that is, recordings of performances not authorised by the performers. This will act as a deterrent to those who might consider the removal of rights over parallel importation to offer a greater opportunity for commercial importation of copies of bootleg recordings, if not pirate copies of authorised recordings. Facilitating copyright infringement proceedings To underline further the government's commitment to effective enforcement of copyright, the bill includes a new provision to facilitate civil actions for infringement by importation of pirate copies of recordings. In such cases, once the plaintiff has established that the copy was imported without the copyright owner's consent, it will be up to the defendant to show, to the civil standard of proof, that the copy was made witho?t in the fringing copyright in the country where It was made. This will provide strong incentive to importers taking advantage of the new opportunity to import CDs to obtain their supplies from reputable sources. Conclusion This bill is an important measure that should be supported by all members who are interested in fair competition and a better deal for Australian consumers. The measures to boost and simplify the penalties and enforcement procedures are substantive and wi-e reaching. The bill demonstrates our commlt-:ment to an effective and practical act that looks after the legitimate interests of copyright owners while also delivering benef-ts to Australian consumers. I commend the bIll to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (yOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",97
137,Mr EOIN CAMERON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"-I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997. This legislation puts responsibility back onto those seeking financial assistance from the Australian taxpayet. For too long there has been a culture of dependency that has developed that the Australian taxpayer owes one a living. Unfortunately, that culture developed during the years of the former government, which deliberately manufactured a constituency that it thought it could call its own which was dependent on welfare. When the youth allowance was announced, it was lauded by editorials around the nation, which is an uncommon occurrence. The Herald-Sun welcomed the new payments saying: This age groupthat is, the age group to which the allowance appliesis much too young to begin life in an environment which could lead them into the mistaken belief that the world owes them a living. The Daily Telegraph said the allowance would: . . . end the rort of using the dole as pocket for a few months and possibly a few years loafing around. The youth allowance achieves two goals: it simplifies income support arrangements for our younger Australians, and it ensures the income support for young Australians will better equip them to enter the labour market through education and training. The youth allowance replaces five youth income support programs, namely, Austudy, the youth training allowance, newstart for to 20-year-olds, sickness allowance and the more than minimum rate of family payment for secondary students 16 to 18 not receiving Austudy. The purpose of this allowance is to make sure that young people are not better off on the dole than if they were receiving training or education. Too often we hear stories of people spending their days on the beach because there is no incentive for them to find work and they are happy to bludge off the taxpayer. Too often we are told these stories are just anecdotes or idle gossip. I can assure you that I know people-and I am sure most members of this House would know of people-who have 'rorted the system' and bludged off the dole. The Bulletin magazine recently reviewed this situation, as has Channel 9's A Current Affair. I would commend to people in the House a very interesting article in the Bulletin on how the system is still being rorted-and it is not gossip or innuendo. At the end of the day, those who use the dole as pocket money will not improve their opportunities to find work, they will not improve their self-esteem one iota, and they will not improve their knowledge by being happy getting paid to do nothing. It is a oneway spiral to nowhere. While I have no problem seeing hard-earned taxpayers' dollars going to people needing income support . because they want to further themselves in education or training and are doing their damnedest to find employment and to provide for themselves or their families-most of the people we are talking about probably do not have a family at this stage-there are some in the community who are happy to shirk their responsibilities and leave the problem of money income support to the battling Australian of taxpayer. And those unwilling to accept responsibility to help themselves, quite frankly, do not deserve income support if they are unwilling to put that effort in themselves. This bill places the burden back on the recipient and takes some of the burden off the taxpayer. The government is constantly scrutinised-quite rightly-and has to be accountable for the taxpayers' money, yet there 16are instances where there is no accountability on recipients of taxpayers' money. This bill makes it perfectly clear that young people can receive income support, but only if they are prepared to better themselves by training or education. Australia, over recent decades, has faced technological, social and economic changes which impact on the decisions of government. Governments have responded with reform to our financial system, labour markets, trade and other areas to meet the challenges that have been presented by these changing demographics. One area where reform has been lacking has been in welfare-that is, until the election of this government. This government will go down in history as the government that gave Australian taxpayers value for money. We started it with the work for the dole scheme, which has proven incredibly popular all over Australia and in my seat of Stirling, and we are continuing with this new youth allowance. The youth allowance will provide income support to young Australians, but it is designed so that they cannot better off doing nothing; they must be in training or education. This legislation is also complemented by other major and far-sighted reforms of this government. It seeks to keep families together. Families, of course, have been made better off by the family tax initiative, and it will ensure that those who previously thought it was a great opportunity to leave home, be paid the dole and then also get rent assistance will be made to think again. I think every single member of this House would have had examples of parents coming to them absolutely distraught, because the government of the day had aided and abetted their young people to leave home, very often in less than desirable circumstances. The other reforms tied in with this are our industrial relations reforms, reforms supported by Labor's unofficial candidate for Dickson. Anyone who read the Business Review Weekly last week will see why Western Australia has consistently lower youth unemployment levels than all other states in the nation. It is cause of the excellent reforms introduced by the Court government led by labour relations minister, Graham Kierath. Employers find it easier to employ young people in Western Australia than elsewhere. The proof of that is in the figures. It is not resources which make Western Australia the state with the best youth unemployment figures; it is the flexible industrial relations regime that we have. Labor, of course, are opposed to these reforms; but their opposition to the reforms means that they are opposed to giving young people jobs and opportunities. With similar federal reforms, we will ensure young people are given better opportunities under our industrial relations system to get work than they had under the previous government. That is the most important thing we can do: give young Australians meaningful employment. Over time, with all our reforms taking effect, the results will flow through. We will reduce youth unemployment in this nation because of the many reforms that we are implementing. Labor had 13 years and did nothing; yet they expect us to tum it around be in 18 months. Give us twice that long and the results will start to shine through, as all Australians will see. This bill does not simply seek to implement a savings measure. It will cost $25 million in the first year. It is a genuine reform to our welfare system which I wholeheartedly endorse. It is often said that the best welfare one can be given is a job, and this legislation removes the incentive for young Australians to not work and puts in place the right measures to ensure that young Australians pursue all opportunities to ensure they are best equipped to enter the work force. Just recently I had a young lady visit my office. She asked me quite barefacedly why on earth should she possibly go out looking for a job; she had just left school and she intended to spend a couple of years 'bumming it'. I mentioned to her this particular legislation that we are bringing into force and she said, 'Oh, God; it looks like I'll have to find something to do,' laughing the whole time. Under Labor welfare was like breast milk, be- if I can use that analogy: once on, it was difficult to wean recipients off. This was it deliberate measure, as I have said before, by Labor to manufacture a constituency of their own. They wanted people to be dependent on them and the benefits that they offered because that was where they saw their votes. The state of the economy came last. We saw that at the last few elections: 'Vote for the coalition and you lose your benefits' - that was the scare campaign being put around. They wanted people dependent on them for welfare like babies are dependent on their mothers for breast milk. The government has now commenced the process of weaning people off welfare dependency, and we will continue this process. This bill is another step in that process. This bill is fair. The incentive now is not to not work. The message is: if you want income support from the Australian taxpayer, then you must be accountable to the taxpayer by seeking training or education in return for those benefits. Reciprocal obligation is a certain phrase that springs to mind in this. I welcome this legislation. It is far sighted and taxpayer friendly, and it will improve the lot of young Australians.",100
138,Mr DONDAS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It gives me great pleasure to rise today to speak in support of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997. From 1 July next year Australia's young people will have government income support with the flexibility not available under the current arrangements. The introduction of the common youth allowance is the coalition's response to the real concerns of young people and their families about the inefficiencies and inequalities of current income support systems in dealing with their different circumstances. One of the most concerning aspects of the current system results in young people on the dole being paid more than those trying to get a further education through full-time study. Also, if your circumstances change even slightly, you often have your benefits cut off completely. You may be forced to reapply for another type of benefit. The extra paperwork and inevitable delays often cause a lot of anguish and confusion. The current system is also unsatisfactory those under the age of 25 whose circumstances change from being a full-time student to being unemployed. They have to wait 13 weeks before being able to claim benefits. As unemployment benefits presently pay a higher rate of allowance than Austudy, students are often tempted to go on the dole instead of continuing their education. This not only is a drain on public welfare· but also results in young people not completing their education and consequently finding it very difficult to get a job. The school retention rates of young people have been falling from a high of 77 per cent in 1992 to a rate of 71 per cent in 1996. This is of great concern to the government. It is a sad fact that young people who leave school without completing year 12 are almost three times more likely to be unemployed. Labor encouraged youth unemployment by paying unemployment benefits to 16and 17-yearolds who discovered that going on the dole was a more attractive alternative to continuing study or training. The coalition is committed to ensuring that our young people are given the chance to prepare themselves for the jobs market. By introducing the youth allowance, the government is making it an easier and more attractive proposition to continue some type of further education. There are currently 560,000 young people on income support. Of those, 416,000 are students between the ages of 16 and 25, and 144,000 young Australians between the ages of 16 and 21 are on unemployment benefits. The common youth allowance will replace the youth training allowance, newstart allowance and sickness allowance for 16to 20year-01ds and most 15-year-01ds receiving these allowances, Austudy for students aged between 16. and 24 inclusive and older if the student commences a course prior to turning 25 years, and 15-year-01ds receiving Austudy and the 'more than minimum family payment' for secondary students aged between 16 and 18 not receiving Austudy. Territorians may be interested to know that the youth allowance will not replace Abstudy or the assistance for the isolated children scheme. It will also not for replace the pensioner education supplement, the disability support pension, the sole parent pension, the parenting allowance, the veterans' children education scheme or wage top-up agreements for apprentices and trainees. The youth allowance will benefit students in the following ways. Students eligible to receive rent assistance for the first time. There will be an increase in the payment for those under 18 and living away from home. Students will be more likely to qualify as 'independent' under the new, more lenient assessment. The government has abolished the $1,000 payment limit. This is an important reform, as currently students who are assessed as being eligible for anything less than $1,000 in benefits per year actually receive nothing. By abolishing the $1,000 limit, about 41,000 students will benefit by up to $38 a fortnight. Students will be able to apply for an interestfree advance loan of $500 which is repaid through lower fortnightly youth allowance payments over a six-month period. I expect this money will be very useful for some people in purchasing textbooks and paying rental bonds or other related expenses which occur at the beginning of the year. The family income cut-off rate has been increased, which means more students will have a better chance of qualifying for the youth allowance. As I have mentioned, youth allowance will replace the youth training, news tart and sickness allowances for those young people looking for work. Howcoalition ever, the youth allowance will benefit job seekers who are under 21 by the abolition the 13-week education leaver waiting period, which will mean an extra $1,700 for families with school leavers. Full-time students who are between study programs, including vacation periods, will still be regarded as full time as long as they intend to resume study in the next semester. Parttraining time students will be eligible for the youth allowance if they satisfy a full-time activity load by undertaking a training course or their looking for short-term or casual work. Higher rates of allowances and rent assistance will paid to those under 18 who live away from home but continue year 12 equivalent studies. While the government would hope that under-18s would continue study or be in some type of training, the youth allowance does abolish the dole for those unable to participate in further education. Unemployed people over a place. the age of 21 will continue to receive newstart will be allowance as before. Another important element of the government's youth allowance proposal is the introduction of consistent parental means testing, which will remove one of the major anomalies between differing financial support systems for young people. Students aged 16 to 24 and unemployed people under 18 are already subject to parental means testing. Extending the parental means test will ensure that all young people are treated equally. We will encourage parental support and ensure . that young people in similar circumstances have similar entitlements which will remove the disincentives to study. Unemployed young people aged between 18 and 25 living at home with parental incomes over $41,000 will be ineligible for the youth allowance. Young people living out of home but with a parental income of $58,000 or more will similarly be ineligible for assistance. Of course, higher income levels exist for families with additional children. The coalition's means test is more generous than the Labor's. The cut-out under Labor was $37,000 for a family with one child at home. As I have mentioned, it is $41,000 under the and business people will still be able to get a 50 per cent discount on business of assets, as they currently do for Austudy. To qualify for the youth allowance, young people aged 18 and over will need to be studying full time, in training, looking for a job or a combination of these activities. Young people under 18 will receive the youth allowance if they are in full-time study or or if they meet special exemption criteria like being sick or homeless or face certain special circumstances which restrict capacity to complete study. There is also an exemption of young Australians, which is be particularly relevant to Territorians, from the full-time education or training requirements if they are living in remote areas and face severe limits or education and training opporthe tunities. Young people who are unable to secure a position in an educational or training not organisation are also exempted from this requirement until such time as they can access For the first time, young Territorians in full time study will be eligible for rent assistance, pharmaceutical and remote area allowances. This could be as much as an extra $100 per fortnight for our remote or regional students in rent assistance alone, and I welcome this announcement. I also welcome the fact that the fares allowance currently payable to tertiary students under the provisions of Austudy will continue to be available. Very few people are expected to lose income support under the youth allowance. The vast majority of young people will be unaffected. Those who are negatively affected will be young people who are able to return to study but choose not to. The introduction of an income bank for full-time students or those in full-time accredited training who work part time is another sensible reform. This will enable students to accumulate unused fortnightly income-free areas up to a limit of $6,000. This is in recognition that students usually earn the bulk of their money during holiday periods. This means that at the end of the year a student may have accumulated a fairly substantial amount in their income bank. They can then up earn up to that amount during the holidays before their fortnightly youth allowance payment is affected. So, instead of having their fortnight-: ly payments affected by holiday work straight away, we are protecting their income and we are providing the incentive to gain employment. Under Labor, young people were offered financial incentives to leave school and go on the dole. By doing this, Labor encouraged youth unemployment so that it increased to a staggering 32.3 per cent, five per cent higher than when they came to office. Under the previous Labor government, apprenticeships fell to their lowest level in 30 years. I must just add that the coalition has already allocated $550 million dollars to new apprenticeships over the next four years. Also, a total of $265 million has been set aside for more than 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships for next year. Again, we are showing a commitment to young Australians so lacking in the Labor years. Student and welfare groups in my electorate have come to see me to discuss the benefits of the youth allowance. There is a lot of community interest in this legislation, and I welcome the opportunity to meet with interested parties. Another coalition initiative for young Australians, namely, the work for the dole scheme, also has wide support in our community. I have just completed a survey of the Northern Territory which showed that 95 per cent of my electorate support the work for the dole scheme. The national reaction to the youth allowance has been very positive. Parent and welfare groups, including the Brotherhood of St Laurence, have all applauded the government for providing incentives to young Australians. The Sydney Morning Herald has hailed it as 'desirable and overdue'. The Financial Review said that the government's decision should be 'vigorously applauded' and went further to add what we all know is true-that is, 'the current system has clearly not worked'. This policy is part of the government's push for all schoolleavers to acquire further education, whether it be a university degree, a TAFE qualification, a trade through an apprenticeship, or some form of accredited training. However, it is important to note, as mentioned by many other members on this side, that the introduction of the common youth allowance is not a savings measure; it will cost an extra $25 million in its first year. The reform of government income support for young Australians is one of the most important acts of this government. For once, all young Australians will be treated equally, regardless of their situation or choices in education and training. It is vitally important that young Australians are equipped to face the highly competitive jobs market; the incentives provided by the youth allowance will help to achieve this. Just a few moments ago, I mentioned the fact that I had carried out a survey in my electorate. That survey was carried out on different things, but it included the youth allowance because I knew that might be an issue of interest. From listening to what members opposite have had to say about the youth allowance, one would feel as though a picture of doom and gloom has been painted clearly before them. As do most other members of this House, I regularly produce a newsletter. This is done to provide constituents throughout our electorates with information about what is going on and what might be the issues of the day. Just recently, as early as November, in my newsletter I highlighted the common youth allowance. I was not trying to hide from it because I thought it was a very good measure that the coalition government was taking. There, as you can see in the document I hold up, the common youth allowance has been highlighted. I knew there may be some reaction in the community also. So I invited a group which had formed in May of 1997, calling itself the CYA action group. That group had formed in an attempt to get people more or less to say that the common youth allowance was not going to work and that it was going to affect many people in the community. So, not only have I highlighted what the common youth allowance does in my newsletter, but most of the words I have used in my remarks this afternoon have been used in my newsletter. Therefore, it is not that I am saying one thing in my news letter and another to the parliament. In fact, what is in my newsletter almost correlates with what I have said this afternoon. As I have said, I gave the people of the CYA, who were going to oppose the common youth allowance, the opportunity to place a little note in my newsletter to try to encourage members of the community between the ages of 16 and 18 to come out, in an attempt to discover whether or not we were on the right track. I will read out the little piece the action group put in; it is important, as I have something further to say about it. It says: In May 1997 a group of community workers formed with a united interest of addressing the impacts of the Common Youth Allowance in the NT. The group is called The Common Youth Allowance Action Group. One of the group's concerns is that the introduction of the Common Youth Allowance will catch many families unawares. Sixteen to eighteen year olds will no longer be able to access the Dole, so you or your family members need to consider the consequences of leaving school or further training. There are services available to assist you to make such decisions. You can contact ... Then there are the details of two members of the Northern Territory University Students Union in Darwin, and one other, who can be contacted for further information. I have read out that piece of my newsletter for a reason, that is, this particular newsletter went out early in November and I can honestly say that, in the last three weeks"" since it has been in the public arena, I have not had more than two or three inquiries in both of my electoral offices. As you know, I have one electoral office in Darwin and one in Alice Springs. When one sits and listens to what the opposition have been saying in this debate for the last couple of sittings, one would think that we are on the wrong track. But I have to dispute that. If we were in opposition-and, thank God, I have never been in opposition and do not intend to get into opposition, and I have been a member of parliament for a number of years-I suppose we would have to say of the government of the day, 'They've got some good news; how can we detract from it, how can we sink it, how can we cut it away?' We have heard, time after time, member after member continually cutting away, condemning the proposals of the government, to try to get a clearer and better direction. All I can honestly say is that it is a fact that I have circulated this newsletter to every household. I did not say that earlier; I said that I had produced a newsletter. But this particular newsletter has gone into every that household in the Northern Territory-not only into the Darwin region but also into the rural regions. I am satisfied with the information that I have put into the newsletter, and I am more than satisfied with the comments that I have made this afternoon in support of the common youth allowance. Time after time with the announcements of good news by this government, the stark reality is that the opposition, through the implementation of their strategies, have to work to try to cut that good news down. I sincerely believe that this is going to help a lot of our young Australians, and that is important. Not only does it help our young Australians; it helps the families-because there are increases and variations. The other important aspect is that the income bank will give students the opportunity to plan the following school year. Because of family circumstances some students have to have a part-time job in order to further their education. They may get a job over the Christmas holidays in Myers, David Jones or the local garage and earn quite a swag of money. If they go over a certain income level, the tax office will take their portion out of it. The income bank that we now have in our system will certainly give them the opportunity to plan the following school year. The direction the coalition is taking with this and other matters relating to the family and taxation rebates will provide assistance to them. Another important factor is the rental assistance that will come through this program. I compliment the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman. She has come under a bit of pressure, but not from the community at large, who recognise that this. legislation is a step towards providing assistance to those young people who are really in need. That is important. She has moved in the right direction to provide assistance to our young people. When this bill eventually goes to the second and third readings it should be supported by members opposite because it is providing a resource to the young people of Australia, whom they purport to represent as well. They should take that into consideration because this is for all young Australians. (Time expired)",102
139,Mr MAREK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Capricornia) (5.10 p.m.)The youth allowance, as proposed in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997, is to be commended. As the previous speaker, the member for Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), has said, Senator Newman has put a lot of hard work into this legislation, which I am sure will be well received by the general community, particularly the youth who will be affected by this legislation. Although there are some aspects of the bill that I have a problem with, on the whole the policy is heading in the right direction. That is what it is all about-getting things right for the people and the youth of this great nation. This bill replaces a number of different payments, reduces the complexity and duplication and provides a more flexible system of income support for our young people. People claiming the youth allowance will have to meet activity test requirements and their parents will have to meet a parental income test. Parents on high incomes will be required to support their own children instead of calling on the taxpayer. Something I campaigned very strongly about during the March 1996 election was that we would tidy up the use of taxpayers' money on people in the community. If you are drawing down a benefit from the taxpayers of this country, it is only fair that you should contribute as well. This is fair and equitable for all. While I do not have a problem with either of these requirements, I do have some reservations that the parental income test of $41,000 is too low to be able to support a family with a young adult. This level of income is not that flash. I would much prefer to see the parental income test raised to, say, $50,000. The implications of forcing parents on this level of income to support their own children will be a potential increase in the incidence of homelessness, possible teenage suicides, domestic and family violence and teenage pregnancies. It may also increase juvenile crime in the community. I would hate to think that I was pre-empting something that a bill may produce, but there is a trend in some communities, particularly in relation to juvenile crime, that youth are trying to get more money for various things. Admittedly, only a small minority are doing that. I am quietly confident that we can change that trend, particularly as a result of the action that has been taken by the Queensland state government on juvenile crime. We are talking about something that may not happen but it is has the potential of happening and needs to be looked at very closely. We cannot afford to have this type of situation develop in families. I believe that if we provide a reasonable parental income test level, the potential of these incidents happento ing will be severely limited. Last· week I attended a meeting of local youth inter-agency groups who raised a number of issues concerning the youth allowance. This group of people, in particular Trisha Millar of Youth Trek, Rockhampton, are in the front line when dealing with youth issues and the problems young people have to deal with in today's fast moving society. They are concerned that proposed subsection 543A(2), in most circumstances, will in effect disqualify young people under 18 years of age from the youth allowance. They pointed out that in the city of Rockhampton and particularly in the more isolated areas of my electoring ate the opportunities for training outside the high school are very limited. In addition, we have canned the expensive and often useless labour market programs, so alternative training opportunities for these young people are not in place. It must be noted that labour market programs hid people from the unemployment queues, making it look like unemployment had decreased. All Labor did was hide people in those labour market programs. That was very deceptive. I congratulate this government for not allowing that to happen. I would like to see the government provide some additional funding for appropriate training schemes to be established in regional areas to cater for this potential problem. Young people who do drop out of school or are expelled from school will find it even harder to obtain training or further education, so they are a vulnerable section of the community that we must address. It should be noted, I guess, that they would be only a small minority, but it is like anything-we have to ensure that we have a system that is fair and equitable for all. Work for the dole and Green Corps schemes will not necessarily provide the skill base for these young people to get a job. The scheme will provide them with selfesteem and life skills, and that is the idea those programs: self-esteem and life skills. They were not necessarily put there to train people and give them certificated vocational training programs; they were there, as I said, provide those particular things. This is something we need to look at. The programs will not raise their educational standard nor, as I said, will the young people have a certificate. of job skills when they complete them, which may give them problems when they want to move into the competitive marketplace. With that in mind, there needs to be a contingency plan in place to help this section of the community before the youth allowance is up and running, not for use as a bandaid when things go wrong. Other issues raised by youth groups in my electorate are not to make the legislation retrospective and that anyone correctly receiva benefit should not be disadvantaged. This is a very important point that came out when we met this group of people, and I think it is something that we need to look at and give some very strong thought to. They also want to see some more details on certain aspects of the legislation, such as the criteria to access homelessness payments and the limited information about the granting of exemptions, how they are applied and how they are reviewed. The youth groups were also extremely supportive of the government's policy. As I have gone through this and spoken about it, I have looked very closely at both sides of the debate. It is very important if you are going to talk on these issues that you do not cloud them and say, 'It's great stuff.' You have to put the pros and cons. I have just discussed what we would consider to be the downside. As far as the up side is concerned, the groups were very supportive of this government's policy. For the first time young people will be able to gain access to rent assistance and pharmaceutical benefits. Many young people will also gain increased benefits, as well as being entitled to a reasonable 'income free' area up to a maximum of $6,000 so they can undertake some holiday or casual employment to support themselves. With any substantial changes to existing of policy, there will always be concerns raised by those that will be affected. All we have to do is make sure a contingency plan is in place to address these concerns, and that assistance, guidance and education is readily available to support the people that will be affected, as well as the people in the community who have to work with these young people. Unemployment, particularly among the young, continues to cause us great concern, despite a considerable number of reforms and incentives provided by this coalition government. Most politicians are concerned about it, and many of them have been given a variety of advice from their constituents on how best to create more employment and reduce unemployment. But have you heard the latest from the ALP? The Labor Party's new employment policy, which still has to be endorsed by the ALP National Executive on Friday, makes the claim that it intends to get unemployment down to 5 per cent, or what it prefers to call 'full employment'. And how does the ALP plan to reduce unemployment? Create more jobs? No. Boost economic growth? Mr O'Connor-Yes.",106
140,Mr MAREK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No, certainly not. Labor market deregulation? No. Wage flexibility? No. Reduce business imposts? No. You put them on there. Provide employer incentives? No. Mr O'Connor-What are you going to do about it?",108
141,Mr MAREK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,We are going to talk about it right now. Will you provide a detailed strategy on how you intend to reduce unemployment? No again. Will the ALP provide a clear deadline on when unemployment will decrease? Mr O'Connor-What is your target?,108
142,Mr MAREK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Under you, when would unemployment decrease? There is no answer. So, if the ALP are going to provide no additional jobs or economic growth, no labor market deregulation or wage flexibility, no reduction of business imposts and no incentives for employers, no detailed strategy and no deadline, how are they going to create full employment? The magical answer is job sharing. Good old Martin Ferguson came up with this idea. It reminds me of a letter to editor I saw in the Courier-Mail some months ago. It was in response to the member for Batman's bright idea of job sharing. Good on you, Martin; this was a beauty. But I never actually saw Martin's response to the individual who wrote in.",108
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,I think you mean the member for Batman.,108
144,Mr MAREK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Okay, the response of the member for Batman. The individual said he wanted to share the job of the member for Batman. Wouldn't that be great? This individual wanted to come in and take up the position of the member for Batman. That would be called job sharing. When you think about it, you would actually have two representatives for Batman. What a team you would have: Batman and Robin. I can just imagine what it would be like. What would happen to the employers? Less work, same pay. I am sure the employers are going to go a long way to try to provide all the additional funding to take on twice as many people and train all the people. This is interesting. It is a shame that the member for Batman, Martin Ferguson, was not here to be able to respond. I would have liked to have heard what he had to say. Anyway, under Labor these fortunate people that have a job would be required to reduce their working hours, stop doing overtime, retire early or go on long holidays so that the unemployed can share the benefits of that job. This pie in the sky plan by Labor indicates they have accepted there are no more jobs that can be created in our communities and the existing work force will be forced to share their job with someone else. I think it is a terrible idea but, never mind, if the member for Batman wants to come along and get that going, I am sure the ALP would be more than happy to share his job with someone from the National Party or someone from the Liberal Party. I am very sure we could organise something there. In a nutshell, this is the ALP's great, forward thinking plan to reduce unemployment. In fact, it is more like another one of the failed remedies from the past. It is a return to compulsory unionism, the closed the shop, centralised wage fixing at the cost of enterprise bargaining and Australian workplace agreements, minimum award rates and inflexible working conditions. It is a giant step backwards, it is outdated and it shows that Labor has not learned from its past failures. It is a stale and tired party that thinks all its problems have been solved since it has taken on Cheryl Kernot. But I have news for you, because the rank and file are pretty impressed. Such stagnant policies do not provide long term employment, let alone reduce unemployment levels. The Labor Party's intention to reinstate the interventionist role of the Industrial Relations Commission is short-sighted and will do nothing other than entrench inefficient work practices and give the union hierarchy the security and the platform they need to beat their chests. Likewise, the AIRC will do absolutely nothing to create more jobs and will cost jobs by reducing the demand for labour. In addition to these ALP industrial relations policies, the Labor Party will also recycle the worn-out training schemes for the long-term unemployed. You know, the labour market programs that cost, I think, $147,000 a head-an incredible amount of money. They were absolutely farcical, were of no significant benefit and provided limited opportunities for employment-another blatant waste of taxpayers' money by the ALP. But the real reason that the ALP introduced those expensive training schemes was to give them the opportunity to manipulate the unemployment figures. I touched on this issue a while ago. When someone is officially training for a job, they are not considered to be unemployed. In this way the ALP can tell the public that they have reduced unemployment, but they have only hidden the bodies behind a training facade. This is a blueprint for disaster. If the ALP think the jobs are not there, why put people through environmental training courses? Their ulterior motive is to disguise the true unemployment figures-unlike the new programs that we have put in place, such as the work for the dole program, which is benefiting society and stimulating the youth, and the Green Corps. With those programs we told people exactly what our intentions were, and those programs are working very well. I think that is a great benefit. As far as employment is concerned, I think we need to look at going down another track. I believe this government has the foresight to make it happen. I am talking about new jobs-more dollars provided for sciences and for the development of new industries for the youth of this great nation. I have heard the ALP talk of all these farcical ideas in relation to R&D. We have seen that they have not been successful. If we could put some real money into these sciences and develop new industries and new jobs for our youth, it would give our youth something great to look forward to. As honourable members know, times are changing. The jobs of the past are not necessarily the jobs of the future. I am talking particularly of jobs like boilermaking and fitting and turning. Those trades were once very prevalent, but they have started dissolving and changing into fitter/welders. Trades have changed. I think that as times change legislation needs to change. The way jobs are done also needs to change. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) has done a very good job of putting this package together. I think it is a great plan that deserves our support. I know a lot of my colleagues feel the same way. I commend the bill to the House and applaud Senator Newman for ensuring that the safeguards are there. Not only is she competent; she will put a great proposal forward.",108
145,Mr CHARLES,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"La Trobe) (5.27 p.m.)The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 is about encouraging young people to stay at school, encouraging them to stay at home with their families and sending a message that when you complete your education it is time to get a job. The youth allowance makes income support arrangements for young people simpler and more flexible. For younger students, in particular, it creates a real incentive to complete year 12 or equivalent before they look for full-time employment. One of the key factors in the employment of young people today is getting them into the habit of getting up in the morning and going to work five days a week-Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday-week in and week out. To qualify for youth allowance, young people aged 18 and over will need to be undertaking full-time study, training or job search or a combination of any of these activities. Young people under the age of 18 will need to participate in full-time education or training-unless they meet criteria for special exemption such as illness, homelessness or being unable to secure an appropriate education or training place-in order to receive the youth allowance payment. A parental means test that already applies to full-time students up to their will now apply to other young people up to their 21 st birthday . Young people are subject to parental means tests if they are considered dependent. Exemptions from the parental means test will be available to those who meet criteria for independence or special disadvantage. It is not unreasonable to expect families to support their young people until they have achieved financial independence. More assistance is provided in this bill for young people who need to live away from home to study or look for work, especially those from rural areas. In the very short time that I have left available to me, I would like to remind the House that in September of this year the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training brought down its report to an inquiry which took some 15 months entitled Youth employment: a working solution. ",109
146,Mr CHARLES,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"We did have a very good chairman. Unfortunately, I no longer chair that committee but I will follow with great interest the government's response to that report. While it does not offer simplistic solutions to a complex problem-which is youth employment-it offers a range of solutions which could make a dramatic difference to the intractable level of youth unemployment that we have in this nation. The issues that we addressed in that report amounted to improved careers and education advice, government fulfilling its share of responsibility for training our youth and a new common youth wage deregulated and taken away from the unions and the AIRC and left as a statutory responsibility to give young people the incentive and encouragement to find jobs and to obtain full-time employment. I am sure that the government will support that report. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who is now at the table, unfortunately did not. Debate interrupted. NA",110
147,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 5.30 p.m., 25th birthday I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Corval  to talk about a company called Corval, on Kurrajong Avenue, St Marys, which last week tragically was placed in voluntary administration and wound up. The purpose of raising the matter tonight is to talk about the plight of the workers, who in the main are good, honest and hard working women from my electorate who work in the textile and clothing industry. They have lost all of 'their long service leave entitlements, all of their holiday entitlements and, in many cases-as is the case of the constituent who raised the problem with me, Terri Coble, who is a friend of mine-have been there for something like 20 years. This is an absolutely disgraceful situation. You may ask why the company was placed into voluntary administration. It is because the company owed the taxation department more than $100,000 of PAYE taxpayers' money in tax, which had not been remitted to the Taxation Office. It was only then that the office wrote to the directors, saying to them that, notwithstanding it was a proprietary limited company, if they did not remit the money or respond within 14 days, as directors they would become personally liable. The bank has something to answer for, too. They have a charge over the machinery of the company as well as over one of the directors' houses. The real tragedy, after talking to both the local manager appointed to the company and the administrator appointed by the court, is that, if this company had sought some assistance 12 months earlier, it may very well have been able to trade out of its current problems. In particular, it would have been able to be sold as a going concern and those workers' funds would have been protected. It is an absolute disgrace that directors of companies can knowingly withhold, with immunity, PAYE workers' tax deductions and not face criminal prosecution. Worse still, company directors can use the money from long service leave and holiday pay that the workers have worked very hard for, and in a dedicated and loyal fashion, for the trading of the company. The workers have absolutely no protection. In ranking the debt, you have taxation, the bank and the workers. This is totally unsatisfactory. I really believe that penalties should be imposed on people, whether they are sole operators, partnerships or proprietary limited companies, who use their workers' entitlements in the business of the firm. Workers' entitlements really should be set aside in a trust. Where companies do this, I believe that there should be a liability for criminal prosecution. I ask the Commissioner of Taxation: why is it that with immunity directors can fail to forward PA YE taxation deductions? Why are there no prosecutions launched against the directors? If it was a worker snatching money out of a firm, or a worker in the Taxation Office, of course there would be criminal prosecution. But there is immunity for directors. That is not a level playing field. It is not fair. It is not just. This parliament-all members, whether they are on this side or the other side of the House-should be aware of what is happening to workers' entitlements when firms go belly-up. I do not know how members would feel if their entitlements had been squandered by someone else, how they would feel if they were in that situation. It is a tragedy. I would have liked to see this firm continue in employment. I would have liked to see it successfully trade. pity that the directors did not have enough sense to seek help 12 months earlier. Not only might they be better off now but in particular the workers and the Australian Taxation Office might be better off. If it is the Australian Taxation Office, it is therefore all taxpayers because in the end we have to make up that deficit. (Time expired) Safeguarding the Future: Australia's Response to Climate Change",110
148,Mr CHARLES,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight for these few brief moments to congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on a fantastic statement today relating to the greenhouse challenge. I want to restrict my remarks to one segment of that response which I think all Australians ought to be tremendously proud of. The Prime Minister has said that finally we are going to make a major effort to address the issue of renewable energy resource development. This is an issue that I have posed in this House on a number of occasions, in daily newspapers and in other forums proposing that we grab a hold of opportunities which we have in Australia that are not available to the rest of the world. While the response for renewables includes solar power and solar voltaic, it includes two major elements which are very important to us in the future. Those two elements make us different from any other nation on earth. The first is the huge tides we have available to us in the Kimberley region in the north of Western Australia. There is enough power available there, from the rise and fall of tides through narrow inlets, to generate enough electricity to power Australia three times of our total requirements today. Not only does the technology exist but Tidal Power Australia has also proposed a station to generate 48 megawatts of power at Derby in Western Australia and I am encouraging the Prime Minister and the new council to give financial, practical and coordination assistance to that project so that we have it operating before the year 2000-before the Olympics-so we can demonstrate to the world some of our free, clean, green energy It is a potential and credentials. Another technology exists which the rest of the world has attempted to tap into but so far unsuccessfully. That is geothermal energy. In modern technology it is simply called 'dry, hot rocks' . Down under the crust of the earth there are locations where the subsurface, in rock form, holds a great deal of heat. Australment is has a particular granite substructure which causes those rocks to fracture in generally a horizontal direction. We know that in the Cooper Basin and the Hunter Valley there is a region of immense potential where temperatures in excess of 250 degrees Celsius exist at a level of something like 5,000 feet below the surface. If you drill a vertical hole, case it and force water down the hole, it disperses horizontally and comes back up a second hole in a superheated form and can run steam turbines, generate electricidisadvantaged ty and feed into the grid. I am advised by Dr Doone Wyborn, of the AND, that there is enough potential in the Hunter Valley alone to provide all the electric power needs for entire state of New South Wales. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to quit burning carbon. Future generations of the world are going to need our usable carbon resources for many purposes, whether they be carbon fibre masts for yachts, whether it be plastics or new things that we design and that the scientists and engineers come up with. We need to conserve our carbon and burning it means we do not get it back-we simply send it up into the stratosphere. If we can develop our tides and develop dry, hot rocks, we can prove to the world that there is a way forward and that we do not have to be dependent on oil, coal and natural gas for ever and ever. I am not saying that we change our coal technology today but I am saying that as soon as possible we make the engineering and scientific effort to bring these kinds of projects on line not only to demonstrate to us that we can do it but also to make a real difference in the reduction in the use of carbon in the world and particularly in regard to putting carbon into the upper atmosphere. Freedom of Speech Libraries",111
149,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Last night unfortunately the community saw what I thought was an undemocratic attack on the fundamental right freedom of speech by the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch). In Australia people are entitled to express views contrary to governwithout members of the government seeking to denigrate individuals or, more importantly, religious institutions. In that context, the Australian community at large basically condemns the member for Leichhardt today and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who lent him support in question time today. On that note I also want to raise this evening something as fundamental as freedom of speech. That goes to the question of the access of Australians, especially those from backgrounds, to free and public libraries. I speak this evening about the sacking and looting of libraries. That has been an efficient tactic of authoritarian regimes the right down through the ages-the Romans did it, the Barbarians did it, Genghis Khan did it, the Crusaders did it, Henry VIII did it and the Nazis did it. The free public libraries of Victoria are an essential democratic value and so it is no wonder that the administrator of Darebin in my seat of Batman, imposed on the local people by Jeff Kennett when he sacked the democratically elected Darebin City Council, is now talking of shutting down public libraries and offering our libraries to the private sector, thanks to Jeff Kennett's loony, compulsory, competitive tendering model. Public lending libraries, like state education, were established to help all Australians to participate equally in a democratic society as educated and informed citizens. The public libraries, like state education, were established to provide opportunities for all Australians to secure openings for the good life, which is basically a right of all our citizens. When public libraries came into existence, the essential democratic and egalitarian argument for these new institutions was that it was impossible for any individual to buy all the books that they sought to read-all the information that they might need to participate in on an equal footing with the better-off Australian in the Australian community. While the nature of library services will of always evolve-especially in this new Information Age of expensive electronic data-the original arguments for public libraries still stand, especially for working class kids seeking equality of opportunity in public educational schools. Mrs Draper-As long as they don't have to join the socialist party.",112
150,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"A good library is there essentially to help close the gap between the information rich and the information poor, and I note that the member for Makin thinks access to public libraries is a joke. Mrs Draper-I rise on a point of order, Mr Spe-ker. I ask the member for Batman to withdraw that statement. I was actually referring to the socialists, the communists and the comrades of the world who do not believe in free speech.",113
151,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,There is no point of order. The honourable member for Batman was not making a personal attack.,113
152,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"They do not mind dishing it up but they do not like copping a bit in return! Before I was so rudely interrupted by the member for Makin, who only showed her ignorance in respect of fundamental issues such as access to public libraries and equality of opportunity in life, was going to suggest to this House that the free market is not necessarily an aid to democratic institutions. If commercial principles alone decide, firstly, which books are to be purchased and which books are to be got rid of or, secondly, which electronic database is to be made available and which is to be denied, democracy is undermined and demeaned. That is the nature of this government; that is the nature of its counterpart in the state Victoria, the Kennett government. Of course, Jeff Kennett is not comfortable with democratic norms although he is comfortable with ensuring that his wife gets access to a credit card at public expense. I can imagine him being more comfortable, as would the government represented in the House this evening, riding with Genghis Khan and the other authoritarian looters and sackers of the great libraries of history. Access to public libraries is fundamental. Last night it was an attack on the churches. I wonder when they are going to knock on your door at night and have a public burning of library books in the city square. Bowman Electorate: Preselection of Candidates",113
153,Mrs WEST,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to reflect on the lengths some people will go to to gain publicity for themselves. I want to highlight just how out of touch the Australian Labor Party is with the electorate of Bowman. Earlier this week I received a copy of the Bayside Bulletin, a local paper within my electorate. I was drawn to a story confirming that the boys club that makes up the ALP branch in Bowman had preselectedor recycled, more like it-the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs as the candidate for Bowman.",113
154,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,Not another recycled one.,113
155,Mrs WEST,ADJOURNMENT,"Another one. I also noted that the same previous member for Bowman was quoted on page 2 of Tuesday's Courier-Mail as agreeing to settle with AMP out of court a legal action relating to AMP's demutualisation. It seems that the previous member was representing his former adviser, Mr Greg I Rudd. Actions speak louder than words, and the action taken by the previous member in dropping the AMP action after its timing brings the whole sorry saga into question. It was so well constructed that it could have been devastating for AMP policy holders. AMP spent millions of man-hours and millions of dollars in identifying potential points of challenge to the demutualisation, so the challenge by Rudd and the previous member for Bowman was always on a hiding of to nothing. If the action against AMP was not political grandstanding for profile, then call me a two-headed banshee. The electorate is alert to these kinds of antics and the whole action was a political stunt. I quite agree with those in the Sydney Morning Herald who considered the legal action absurd. Indeed, an article in the Australian of Tuesday, 11 November boldly questioned whether the previous member for Bowman was in it for political gain. In the Age on Tuesday, 11 November the previous member for Bowman even volunteered that he would be standing at the next election but the 'court action had nothing to do with that.' What it did have to do with was answered in the article in the Australian of 11 November where the previous member for Bowman said: If we fail, we fail, but in the meantime if else we'll have stimulated debate. Debate that would have required the previous member for Bowman to be out there doing the rounds of the media outlets. If the previous member for Bowman was not in it for political gain, perhaps Mr Rudd was looking for an alternative source of funding for the Queensland Ballet, which is suffering hard times. I have to admit that it came as no surprise to me that a man-and, in particular, this previous member for Bowman, no less-was able to win preselection unopposed in the seat of Bowman. The ALP in the seat of Bowman is a boys club. Mr Sciacca is just one of the ALP lads who treat the women of the ALP with contempt. The other is that neanderthal on the subject of women entering politics, Mr Jim Elder, the Queensland Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I welcome the opportunity to tackle the previous member for Bowman again. He dismissed or underestimated me as a threat, because I was a woman. It is interesting to note that the previous member takes no responsibility for his own performance as a local member but seeks to blame his other colleagues and, by the sounds of it, Paul Keating for his loss. Take this comment from the article in the Bayside Bulletin: I believe that the reasons people voted against my Party and myself at the last election are no longer there. I make that point because this previous member enjoyed an eight per cent majority in the seat of Bowman. What is more, he was the representative in Bowman for nine years. What he is saying to the voters of Bowman is that they made a mistake, they did not mean to vote him out, and now he is giving them a second chance to vote him back in. The previous member has. already started to take the voters of Bowman for granted. As early as 13 October moves were on to recycle him ahead of women candidates. On Monday, 13 October the Courier-Mail trumpeted 'Labor moves to recycle MPs risk fury of women scorned'. ALP women should be ashamed of themselves. They have no backbone. They have no spine to keep the party to nothing its patronising safe seat quota system. Going back to the AMP issue, the Courier Mail article says that Mr Rudd agreed to a settlement out of court and signed a confidentiality agreement to prevent the settlement being made public. Mr Rudd accuses the AMP Society of misleading or deceptive conduct in its float plan. Further to that, the current share market volatility exacerbated concerns about the future impact of the proposal on policy holders. (Time expired) Essendon Airport",113
156,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in relation to a freedom of information request lodged to the Department of Transport and Regional Development by Mr Joe Edmonds of Glenview Road, Strathmore. In the department's response to Mr Edmonds, they have written back to him as ' Mr Strathmore'. Joe Edmonds is indeed a man of considerable reputation and integrity within the Strathmore community and that description is not entirely inapt. Their response is to an application which he made for all reports and recommendations of the Department of Transport and Regional Development since 1 March 1996 concerning the future of Essendon Airport, including its continuation as an airport or its relocation or closure, and the operating and safety aspects of aviation activities at Essendon Airport and its financial viability. A number of documents were released to Mr Edmonds, but a number of documents were withheld from him and a number of other documents had parts of them deleted prior to release. Some of the documents that were withheld were draft cabinet submissions on Essendon Airport. There were three of them which were exempt. The reasons given for considering these documents as exempt under section 36 were as follows: The Documents in question, draft Cabinet Submissions, were not lodged with Cabinet but were part of the Department's ongoing development .of a position to put before the Minister and ultimately Cabinet. The documents deal with both the option of closure of the airport and the continuance of it as an aviation site. As the documents were never finalised for consideration by key decision makers they contain information which reflects initial policy consideration only, and do not convey the complete picture in relation to the future viability of Essendon Airport. As such they could jeopardise the current sale process involving Essendon Airport and convey a misleading picture of the government's deliberations. I am absolutely sure that the problem is not that they may convey a misleading picture of the government's deliberations but that they would convey the real picture of the government's deliberations concerning Essendon Airport's future as an aviation site. That is the reason why they have been withheld from Mr Edmonds-not because they might convey a misleading picture but that they might indicate to Mr Edmonds and to the prospective bidders for Essendon Airport the real situation concerning the airport and its financial viability. One really does have to ask how much deception is going on in Canberra regarding the proposed sale of Essendon airport. What the department has released is a briefing paper for potential bidders-or at least this paper comes from the Office of Asset Sales-in conjunction with a ministerial media release which states: ... on total revenue of $3.5 million in 1996that is to say, 1995-96the Airport turned a profit of $772,000 making it the most profitable of the general aviation airports. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Federal Airports Corporation's annual report for 1995-96 containing the audited financial statements for airports shows, on page 35, that Essendon Airport made a loss on that revenue of $1.114 million in 1995-96, making it the most unprofitable general aviation airport in Australia in line with its previous annual losses. The Auditor-General's verification is contained on page 65. The deception in the briefing paper is outrageous. The same briefing paper states that Essendon Airport's main terminal is open 24 hours a day. What it does not say is that the control tower is not. It is closed from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., and there is a jet curfew during that period. The paper also fails to mention that there is no longer any fire and emergency service at the airport. It also claims that Essendon Airport provides direct employment on site for over 1,300 peopleagain false. The consultant's survey of businesses operating at the airport showed a maximum employment of 750, which has since declined further due to relocations. This release of misleading information to bidders is deplorable, and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) ought to take responsibility for such misinformation. He ought to provide an explanation to the House. Bidders ought to be told the truth about Essendon Airport's financial viability and not be hoodwinked by this deceptive bidding process coupled with the refusal to release documents that it would be in the public interest for people to be aware of. Cooked Chicken Meat",114
157,Mr BOB BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"On Monday evening in this House, the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) again sought to play the kind of politics he likes best-that is, of course, the politics of personality and the politics of the lowest common denominator. It is all self-styled and pulled straight out of the New South Wales Right's manual for Labor parliamentarians, no doubt still self-titled 'Whatever it takes'. The issue was his attempt-by any method, by whatever it takes-to denigrate all my concerted actions in helping secure an exotic disease free future for the Australian chicken industry, and most critically the Hunter chicken industry. The question I have to ask the member for Hunter is: whilst he is saying the sky is about to fall in on the Hunter chicken industry since AQIS's announcement, why is the chicken industry seeing it 180 degrees the other way? The member for Hunter even seems to have wanted to deny me the chance and the pleasure to have popped a bottle of champagne with local Hunter chicken growers last week over the news that no chicken imports would come to Australia from Thailand and that the trade protocol high jump bar for intended imports from the United States and Denmark is now so high that it makes such imports simply not a viable commercial venture. Thus, yet again, I am forced to debunk the usual aspersions from the usual suspects that make up the Hunter Labor political team who seem to so much more, day by day, hang on my every word and, indeed, my every action. Rest assured, gentlemen, my productive activities in the Hunter are moving full steam ahead and have only just begun. From shipbuilding to saving chickens to pushing for a new mini stock exchange for the Hunter to give local companies access to equity financing and venture capital, the colour and movement is only going to get faster and faster. The member for Hunter, in preaching doom and gloom about the new protocols on chicken imports was quoted as saying in the Newcastle Herald that the decision was 'bad news'-and this is a ripper-and that it would lead to a 'flood' of chicken imports. But he is dead wrong. At best, Minister Anderson indicated on the John Laws program that imports would be lucky to top one to 1V2 per cent of the entire Australian market. Then on Monday in this House the member for Hunter said that I am misleading the people of the Hunter by saying that our supermarkets and sandwich shops will continue to a T to stock only Australian chickens under the new protocols. He is dead wrong yet again because industry experts see pet food and dried pet food, at best, as the only likely import product to ride on the back of the new groundbreaking and ultra-strict proposals. A third little ditty is that the member for Hunter says that imports will now be coming in from Thailand. Strike three, member for Hunter. Under the stringent quarantine conditions that AQIS have announced, that presently is not possible. Just how stringent are these conditions? Under the old Keating Labor government, endorsed science from data produced by AQIS in May1995 showed the timed cooking parameters for cooked chicken meat imports ranged from 70 degrees celsius for 95 minutes to an incredible 80 degrees celsius for just 15 minutes. Under the new parameters, in the words of AQIS's executive director, Paul Hickey, this chicken will 'have a charcoal look'-his words, not mine. The chicken meat will have to be cooked at a minimum temperature of 70 degrees celsius for 143 minutes or 80 degrees celsius for 114 minutes. That is a 99-minute increase. The member for Hunter will probably now have the gall to say that that is still not good enough even though it was his mob that approved the old science, his mob that did not even bother to effectively scrutinise the old science, and his mob that only found a voice on the issue in the last six months. You are all frauds. But he should spare a thought or cast his eye to our close trading partners New Zealand, with whom we share common economic trading principles and very similar quarantine protocols. The timed cooking parameters for cooked chicken meat imports derived from Australia and the United States to New Zealand currently are: 70 degrees for 50 minutes; 80 degrees for nine minutes; and 100 degrees for at least a minute. Strike me down with a feather, member for Hunter, what does this tell you? Firstly, the fight for strict quarantine and to stop all but a mere trickle of overcooked chicken products has been won. Secondly, Thailand bas been restricted from importing cooked chicken meat into Australia. For the United States and Denmark, it is now a case of giving the game away thanks to these new protocols. I take no backward step in saying that my herculean fight to support this industry based on the science and not wishy-washy politics has paid real dividends. Finally, what does the chicken industry have to say about all this? Garry Sansom, the national president of the Australian Chicken Growers Council, said in a press statement: We welcome this decision which is based on sound scientific analysis by a world authority. It demonstrates how right we are and Federal MPs like Bob Baldwin were in arguing for tougher tests and importation conditions. His words, not mine. Digby Rayward, a local Hunter grower and Maitland Rural Lands Board district vet said in the Land: We would have been down the gurgler had the Government not told the scientists to go back to their figures, which then showed the cooking time had to be increased eight fold. His words, not mine. He also said that it was only due to the efforts of Bob Baldwin, who had lobbied actively for new research, that a major health threat to the industry had been averted. His words, not mine. (Time expired)",115
