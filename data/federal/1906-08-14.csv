1,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs whether, in view of the proximity of Australia to countries which are sources of infection in regjvrd to plague and other diseases, and having regard to the varying provisions of the laws of the Stares relating to quarantine, the Government are prepared to make arrangements for the exercise by the Commonwealth Parliament of its power to make laws with respect thereto?",13
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It is the intention of the Government to deal with the matter at the earliest possible date. Bill has been drafted; but it is not yet quite ready. POPULATION STATISTICS.,14
3,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister of Home Affairs whether he has observed a professed correction of the population statistics of Victoria, which is said to affect the representation of New South Wales to an extent disentitling the State to another member? Has he noticed that the correction has been arrived at by adding to the population of Victoria the percentage which has hitherto been deducted for unrecorded departures, and that no such addition has been made to the populations of the other States? Will he promise before using anv statistics such as those which the Statistician of Victoria has prepared on this new basis to see that the calculations made in respect to all the States are on the same footing? .",14
4,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I do not know why the figures referred to should be used by the Commonwealth. I saw it stated in this morning's newspaper that; certain figures have been prepared, and reference was made to another set, appearing in an earlier issue, which I have not yet seen. I shall look into the matter, but can assure the honourable member that figures' used for Commonwealth purposes will be prepared on an absolutely uniform basis. only such figures have been used as may be used according to the definite rules laid down by the Representation Act, and no figures will be used by the Department in this connection unless they are authorized by law. PAPER: ADMINISTRATION OF PAPUA.",14
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [3.34]-- I beg to lay upon the.table the following paper:Memorandum relating to the proclamation of the Papua Act, together with a draft letter proposed to be sent to the members of a Royal Commission to be appointed. In view of the interest taken in this question in both Houses, as shown by the motions which have been tabled this session, I wish to mention a few facts, although the papers speak for themselves. The proclamation of the Papua Act will take effect on the 1st September. On that date there will be added to the Executive Council three representatives of the settlers- Mr William Whitten, A storekeeper, of Samarai; Mr Frederic Weekley, miner, of Woodlark Island; and Mr William Little, miner, of the Northern Division. Our officials in Papuai will retain their positions pending the report of the Royal Commission. If we had been able to secure the services of Sir William MCGregor, a veteran administrator in tropical countries, possessed of marked ability, long experience, and special knowledge of Papua, this step might not have been necessary ; but, in view of the facts set out in the papers, and, especially as the present Administrator has asked for. an inquiry into his administration, no other course is open to us. The Commission will consist of Colonel J. A. K. Mackay, C.B., M.L.C.,' of New South Wales, formerly Vice-President of the Executive Council of the State, and representative of the Government in the Legislative Council; Mr W. E. Parry Okeden, I.S.O., formerly Principal Under-Secretary and Commissioner of Police, Queensland ; and Mr C. E. Herbert, Government Resident and Judge of the Northern Territory. These gentlemen are charged with the task of inquiring into, and reporting before the end of the year, upon the best method of improving the conditions of settlement in Papua, and of recommending any changes in its Administration they maythink necessary. Having received that report - I trust that we shall be in a position So far, to place the affairs of the Territory, upon a business footing, and provide for the best utilization of a country which, from the time of its annexation, has had to contend with a whole series of misfortunes and difficulties which are being gradually surmounted.. Mr. JOSEPH Coox - Is the Constitution of Papua to be hung up pending the report of the Commission?",14
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No . It will come into force on the 1st September.,14
7,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Has the honourable and learned gentleman received any communication from the residents of New Guinea as to the acceptability of the proposed appointees to the Legislative Council ?,14
8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"On l y in their favour. I move That the papers be printed. Question resolved in the affirmative. CLERICAL OFFICERS, POST OFFICE , SYDNEY.",15
9,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I desire to know whether the Postmaster-General would have any 'objection to lay upon the table of the L i brary the report of the Acting Chief Clerk, Mr Russell, with reference to the work of the clerical staff in the General Post Office, Sydney.",15
10,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I shall be pleased to give the honourable member an answer tomorrow. Sometimes departmental documents contain confidential information which it is' not desirable to disclose. If the report referred to does not contain anything of a confidential nature, I shall have pleasure in making it available to honourable members by laying it on the Library table. EXTENSION OF TELEPHONIC General, upon noticeCOMMUNICATION.  the Postmaster-General will be in a position to give a decision with regard to the applications made for the extension of telephonic communication to Lake Wangary, Warrow, or Coulta and Sherimga, in South Australia.",15
11,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I hope to be able to give the honourable member an answer tomorrow. NA  General, upon notice I. Is he aware'that the telegraph offices in South Australia open and close half an hour earlier than in the principal Eastern States to synchronize the various times, and that Saturday closing at 5 30 p.m. was merely advancing the time in accordance therewith from the State closing time of 6 p.m.? 2. Why is South Australia, where times were synchronized on all but one week day, singled . out for alteration, while other States in which no such synchronization exists, are left unaffected ? 3. Does he not think that this invidious action against one particular State invites suspicion of factious motives ? 4. As.definite particulars of any inconvenience experienced under State regulations appear to be unobtainable,, will he (pending the possible synchronization of times in other States) revert to the system which was adequate for all requirements and convenience prior to Commonwealth control?",15
12,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow: 1. The Postmaster-General is aware that telegraph offices in South Australia open at 3.30 GENERAL a.m., and close at 7.30 p.m. local time, which hours correspond' to 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. respectively in the Eastern States, and that prior to the recent alteration in the hour of closing those offices in South Australia on Saturday, the hour of closing on that day was 5.30 p.m. instead of 7.30 p.m., as on other week days. -2. It has already been stated, in answer to previous questions, that in other States the hours of closing on Saturday are the same as on other week days; South Australia was therefore not singled out for alteration as no similar change was required in other States. 3. There was no invidious action, vide answer to question No. 2. 4. The Postmaster-General is not prepared to revert to the arrangement under which telegraph offices in South Australia close two hours earlier on Saturdays than on other week days.

Is he aware that Mr Hughes, of the firm of Birt, Potter and Hughes, was until very recently, if he is not at present, chairman of the Shipping Conference, or ring, which from London regulates freights 'to Australia? 3.

Does the Minister for Defence consider, that a man who has been expelled from the Perth Stock Exchange for dishonourable conduct is fit to hold a Commission in the Commonwealth Military Forces? 2. As it is a fact that Lieutenant Alexander John Bussell, of the Perth Highlanders, was so expelled, and further, as shown by the Court records, evaded payment of a debt of some £400, why has his Commission not been cancelled? 3. Why is Lieutenant Russell being treated differently to Lance-Sergeant John Hanks, who when sued by his Commanding Officer did pay the sum of £10 i8s. 6d. ?",15
16,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow: 1, 2, and 3.

19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Hume-Min ister of Trade ,and Customs) [3-.45J-- I wish to make a short explanation with reference to the proposals relating to the import and Excise duties on spirits. I need scarcely say that I have been deluged with letters from various persons, most of whom wish that - certain alterations shall be made in the proposals now before the Committee. As I stated previously, the proposals embody the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, with certain modifications. I also mentioned that the duties proposed by the Tariff Commission had been increased, in order to prevent a loss of revenue. An estimate has been prepared by the officers - of the Customs Department, who believe that if the duties were altered in the manner suggested by the Commission, 204,000 gallons of imported spirits would be displaced by spirits of local production,, and that ^60,000 would thus be lost to the revenue. They estimate, further, that a loss of £14,000 per annum would result ... ns. from making a rebate of duty in' respect to spirits under proof strength. In connection with spirits for fortifying wine, there would be a reduction of revenue amounting to ;£fj,5oo, the drawback allowed upon spirit used in wine afterwards exported would amount to £4,000, and the abolition of the duty on methylated spirits would involve a loss of £6,000. It is estimated that the total loss of revenue would amount to ,£90.500, and that would be a very serious matter. I should have preferred to accept the recommendations of the Commission, with some slight modifications, but the Treasurer naturally objects to the loss of revenue that would be involved. It is a great pity that the Treasurer cannot get along without any revenue, but he is deserving of every credit for endeavoring ... 13s. to maintain the returns;, so that he may be able to hand over to the States as large a sum as possible. The object of increasing the duty upon imported spirits from 14s., as recommended by the Commission, to 15s., is to obviate any loss of revenue. Honourable members will notice that the second paragraph, under the head of "" Excise duties,"" 14s. reads as follows:Blended brandy distilled partly from ... 14s. grape wine and partly from other materials, containing not less than 25 per cent, of pure grape wine ... Free spirit (which has been separately distilled by a pot still or similar process at a strength not exceeding. 35 per cent, over proof) the whole ... Free being matured by storage in wood for a period not less than two years and certified by an officer to be brandy so blended and matured, per proof gallon ... _ ... 12s. I am satisfied that the proposed duty does not bear a fair relation to the duty of 11s. per gallon proposed to be levied upon brandv distilled wholly from grape wine. These duties have been fixed upon the re1 commendation of the Tariff Commission, and I shall presently read extracts from the evidence upon which the proposals are apparently based.",17
20,Mr HUTCHISON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,They must have been the result of a mistake?,17
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The first paragraph in the proposed Excise duties readsBrandy distilled wholly from grape wine by a pot-still or similar process at a strength not exceeding 35 per cent: overproof, matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than two years, and certified by an officer to be pure brandy, per proof gallon ns. Then comes the second proposal, under which a duty of 12s. per proof gallon is levied upon brandy which is distilled partly from grape wine and partly from other materials, and which contains not less than 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit. I am urged that to make the comparison complete the duty of 12s. per proof gallon ought to be increased to 14s., because three-fourths of the brandy which is distilled partly from grape wine and partly from other materials is composed chiefly of spirit made from molasses. That is an inferior spirit, and its presence has the effect of making the whole of the brandy thus distilled inferior to brandy which is distilled wholly from pure wine spirit.",17
22,Mr BAMFORD,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Has the Minster evidence to support his statement?,18
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Yes , I have. Further, the second proposal relating to excise offers an inducement to distillers to use spirit other than that which is distilled wholly from grape wine, because it canbe produced for about is. 6d. per gallon, whereas the better and the purer spirit cannot be produced for less than 3s. 6d. per gallon.",18
24,Mr HENRY WILLIS,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Molasse s spiiit can be produced for 6d. per gallon.,18
25,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I dare say that the honourable member is referring to a recent report from the United States, where it is stated that spirit from molasses is being produced for 4d. per gallon, and used for purposes other than human consumption. However, I am not prepared to deal with that matter at the present time. I mention it because I wish it to be thoroughly ventilated. It is a matter of very great importance that the public should be supplied with pure spirit, and it is the public interest which I regard as paramount in this connection. Within the last few days I have had an opportunity of visiting various distilleries in South Australia, and I must say that I have gained a very great deal of knowledge in regard to this particular question. Upon the present occasion I am simply giving the facts as they present themselves to my mind. Before we finally dispose of these resolutions, probably be found that it is advisable to make some variation in the duties proposed. That is why I emphasize the fact that the Government have submitted these resolupresent tions in their present form, because they embody the recommendations of the Tariif Commission. They were arrived at upon the evidence of officers- I cannot give the testimony of each officer-in the Department of Trade and Customs. Those officeis were:-Messrs . H . D . Brown, In spector of Excise, New South Wales; T . H . Norrie, Analytical Chemist, Customs Department, Sydney; W. E . Burrell, Senior Inspector of Excise, Queensland; E. P. Clarke, Senior Inspector of Excise, South Australia; P. Awcock, Inspector of Excise and Distilleries, Western Australia. There were other outside witnesses such as Mr E. W. Knox, general manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, Sydney - ther e is no doubt that he is interested in the production of spirit from molassesDr Fiaschi, and Mr A. B. Holmes. In any Victoria, the following gentlemen gave evidence:-Messrs . H . Brind, distiller, Warrenheip; S. Joshua, managing director of Joshua Brothers Proprietary Limited, Melbourne; J. M . Joshua, C. P. Preston, Australian Distillery Company, South Melbourne; H . A. Preston, distiller, Abbotsf o r d ; and W. P. Wilkinson, Government Analyst for the State of Victoria. These were the principal witnesses who gave evidence before the Commission. After having analyzed their testimony very thoroughly during the past few days, it seems to me that the recommendations of the Commission are based upon, I will not say a mistake, but upon a miscalculation. But there is no doubt of one thing, namely, that the Treasurer cannot afford to lose all the revenue that would be sacrificed if we adopted their recommendations. Therefore the Government are compelled to submit proposals which otherwise tiiey would not have made. I hope that honourable members-man y of whom have particular knowledge of this question-wil l give this matter their very close attention. This morning I have been in consultation with the Comptroller-General, who has gone through these resolutions, and he is now framing certain alterations which he thinks ought to be made in them. These I hope to have in my possession before the debate closes.",18
26,Mr HIGGINS,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Has the Minister no proI think it will posal to make now ?,18
27,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I had not much time to go into the matter this morning, but certain alterations are being drafted at the momenf; and I should like to see them either in print or in typewritten form before I submit a definite proposition.",18
28,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Then we had better postpone the consideration of the matter.,19
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"No . I think that honourable members had better proceed with the debate, because I fancy that a good deal of information has been given to some of them concerning these questions, and it is just as well to have the matter threshed out.",19
30,Mr HIGGINS,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,We shall simply be beating the air.,19
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I intend to proceed with the resolutions now, but at a later stage, when I have received the recommendations of the Comptroller-General, I will submit them to the 'Committee if I consider that they are of a justifiable character.",19
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Parramatta) [3-57]-- I congratulate the Minister of Trade and Customs upon having brought down a set of proposals in which ""he does not believe, and upon having thrown them on the table in much the same way as a man throws a bone to his dog. I have not the slightest intention of commencing to gnaw that bone myself. I prefer to wait until the Minister has brought down his mature and definite proposals, so that honourable members may discuss something of a tangible character. I have certainly never known a Minister who was engaged in formulating proposals as important as these are-the y affect our revenue to the extent of millions sterling, so far as their total yield is concerned-to frankly tell the Committee that he has no definite propositions to submit, and to ask honourable members in the meantime to discuss something before the Chamber, but to which his own knowledge led him to believe he could not subscribe. That is an unheard-of position of affairs, and one that I venture to say will find no parallel in any of our State political arenas in connection with proposals made by any of our State Ministries.",19
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Coul d I do anything which would please the honourable member ?,19
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"It is not a matter of pleasing me or any other honourable member upon this side of the Chamber. The position is that the Minister, who is responsible for the conduct of his own Department, and who is the custodian of the Customs and Excise revenues of the Commonwealth, should know what he ought to [96] do under a given set of circumstances. After having received the mature opinions of the Tariff Commission, which have spent many anxious months in the consideration of these matters, he ought to have made up his mind ,as to what would be his final attitude in regard to them.",19
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"It is the report of the Commission which makes the trouble. Mr. JOSEPH' COOK - It appears to me that the trouble of which the Minister speaks has only arisen since his visit to South Australia. May be if he paid a visit to New South Wales in connection with this matter his opinion might be again varied. I hope, at all events, that the further proposals will not be like the lame, silly speech which the honourable gentleman made at Adelaide on Saturday night last. Perhaps it was because his mind was preoccupied with these more important matters that he then delivered the disjointed speech which we read in the newspapers.",19
36,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Has that speech anything to do with the proposals now before the Committee?,19
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"It has, since, among other' statements which the honourable gentleman made at the meeting in question, was the assertion that he believed in protection, and not in Excise duties. Are we to understand that when he spoke in that way he was referring to the spirit duties? I should say that he will have to believe in Excise duties in relation to spirits, whether or not he likes them in connection with other matters. But I am not going to discuss this auestion at the present stage; I prefer to wait until the Minister brings down his definite proposals.",19
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"If the honourable member does not discuss them now, he may have to wait some little time for another opportunity.",19
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I am not particularly concerned in that regard. I point out that the Minister now seems to be in a most casual mood. He appears to be proceeding in the most leisurely way in regard to these matters, which were at t one time said to be of pressing urgency and importance. . We have heard times out of number of the way in which our Australian distillers have been and are being punished by our mangling and strangling Tariff. It seems now, however, that the nearer we approach the general election the less urgency there is in relation to Tariff questions. Here we have another illustration of this fact. The Minister of Trade and Customs is in the most casual and leisurely mood, and does not care whether or not he proceeds with the consideration of these matters. If he cares nothing about them, I fail to see why the Opposition should trouble very much. I rose only to protest against the Minister's method of proceeding with important matters, since he has indicated to the Committee that he has another set of proposals which may radically differ from those now before us, and which he will bring down on a subsequent date.",19
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I said nothing of the kind.,20
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Has not the honourable gentleman indicated to the Committee that he is going to make some alterations ?,20
42,Sir WILLIAMLYME,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I said that there might be some alterations suggested in regard to one or two of the clauses.,20
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"If the statement of the honourable gentleman that as soon as he had looked further into these matters he found some serious faults with them does not indicate the necessity for serious consideration, I should like to know what doesi At any rate, his tentative, timid attitude serves only to make the position more serious. Other honourable members may proceed, if they desire to do so, to discuss these questions, but I propose to wait until the Minister comes down with matured and connected propositions which the Government are able to stand by-subject , of course, to reasonable discussion in Committee-in other - words, until Ministers have finally made up their minds as to what they propose to do with regard to the spirit duties.",20
44,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Bendigo) [4.5] Some time ago the Prime Minister, in referring to the report of the Tariff Commission with reference to spirits and the distillation question, expressed his gratification that the report was a unanimous one, being signed by all members of the Commission, and said he thought there would be very little difficulty in dealing with it at a single sitting.",20
45,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Hear . hear.,20
46,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The honourable and learned gentleman also said that he scarcely anticipated that the occasion would be availed of by the members of the Tariff Commission to fight the question over as?ain. As a member of the Commission, I can give the Committee an assurance on behalf of my brother members and myself that we have no desire to thresh out this question any further than we have done.",20
47,Mr FULLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Hear , hear.",20
48,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"We have done our duty to the best of our ability, and in the light of the information which we have gathered from all parts of Australia. We have heard all sides and every possible phase of this great and important question. Our conclusions are based, not upon any personal predeliction, sympathy, or tendency, but strictly upon the evidencegiven on oath before us. They have been arrived at after very careful, thoughtful discussion and consideration, and we have done our very best. If they do not please the Minister or the Committee, or the 1 country, we are very sorry, but we cannot help it . It is not my desire to occupy the time of the Committee to any extent in. appearing before it in the capacity of an advocate or pleader on behalf of the report of the Commission. That report speaks for itself, and I hope honourable members will not think that I or my honourable colleagues desire, whilst giving explanations of it , to appear in the character of partisans or advocates. We are quite prepared to listen to arguments or to offer explanations; in the last resort, of course, the consideration and determination of details, depends upon the Committee. I should like to say, however, that it would be rather unsatisfactory to the members of the Commission who have been investigating and considering this question for upwards of fifteen months if the conclusions which they have reduced to writing and submitted to Parliament were lightly or care- lessly thrown .aside in response to clamouring letters in the press, to clamouring deputations to the Minister, or to representations made to him, and, it may be, to other honourable members., by those who are not quite satisfied with some of the details of the report. It will not be satisfactory to us, and I do not think that justice will be done to the great cause, if honourable members allow themselves to be lightly or hastily influenced by letters in the press or communications addressed directly to them, or if our deliberations be disregarded in favour of suggestions made either by letter or in the course of an interview.",20
49,Mr HIGGINS,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The letters in the press are often unsigned.,21
50,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"That is so. The members of the Commission are absolutelydisinterested, but would like the Committee to do them the favour of considering their report and reading the evidence upon which it is based, before they denounce their work and reject it as useless. was rather sorry to hear the Minister launch the debate this afternoon in such a light-hearted way, to hear the almost disparaging terms in which he referred to the report of the Commission, and to notice the way in which he seemed to brush aside some of its recommendations. those remarks would, to some extent, prejudice the case at the very outset; but I point out to the Minister that he, at any rate, cannot claim to have given this subject, which is, to some extent, scientific and technical in manv. of' its branches and phases,, the same amount of consideration and thought that members of the Tariff Commission have given to it over a long period of time. None of their conclusions are hasty ; none, I think, can be regarded as conclusions based on anything like party considerations. As honourable members well know, these are the considered conclusions of both parties-bot h sides of the House-in fact, all round the House. The Labour Party and the Free-trade Party are both well and ably represented on the Commission, and I need not say anything in regard to the Protectionist Party. All classes and all sections of the House are represented, and every one has had a fair 1 hearing; so that it would be very unfaii to this great work if honourable members were to allow themselves to be deluded by fugitive correspondence and letters in the press. In this great question, as in all other great questions, there are several aspects to be considered. Many of these aspects are local; there is a South Australian aspect, and also a Victorian and a New South Wales aspect.",21
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,And Joshua Brothers' aspect.,21
52,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,There is also a Commonwealth aspect. > Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The Minister of Trade and Customs says that there is a Joshua Brothers' aspect. [ 9 6 ] -2,21
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Messrs. ' Joshua Brothers have been communicating with us.,21
54,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"So far as the Tariff Commission is concerned, we have endeavoured to view everything from an Australian stand-point, and, so far as we could, to be fair, and do justice all round; and it may be that there is complaint for the reason that we have not been able to please everybody. It is impossible to I please everybody, and those who attempt to do so must fail. So far as Joshua Brothers are concerned, I do not think that they are satisfied, because Mr Joshua was, I believe, the first to complain. I have see.i him buzzing about the precincts of the House for a considerable time past, and No doubt I know that he has been writing letters on this subject; indeed, from what I can hear, he is one of the most dissatisfied.. At any rate, he sent letters to me expressing dissatisfaction ; and the fact that there is dissatisfaction all round may lead honourable members to the conclusion, that there are many aspects to be considered, and that, after all, it is not what Messrs. Joshua 01  taken into account, but what this House thinks om the whole question, after giving due attention to all its phases. I do not piopose at this stage to enter into the details of the scheme submitted, because I think that would be anticipating many stages through which we have vet to pass. But, with the permission of honourable members, I shall, at various stages of the discussion, say a few words on particular branches of the question. It would be of no use to cover the whole ground at the present stage, and to deal with a lot of technical matters which might be lost sight of when we come to consider the question in detail. But, before passing away from a few general obseivations. I should like to quote one or two letters I have receivedI suppose other honourable members have also received them-givin g a general idea of the position of the distilling industry in Australia .in relation to the reoorts of the Tariff Commission. Messrs. Joshua Brothers, in a letter dated 7th July, sav: there is a The report, as a whole, is highly satisfactory to us, and we think also that it is of great satisfaction to Australian distillers generally. What we regard as flaws in it are quite subsidiary, but might, nevertheless, prove disastrous if allowed to go unchallenged. We desire to point out that our letter of 21st February, which you have been good enough to print as an appendix to the report, sets foith that our malt whisky and wine brandy have been distilled up to a maximum strength of 35 o.p. Spirits required to blend with these, in order to make the popular tasting liquors, require to be distilled up to a higher strength. That is the first letter they wrote, and it was written under a misconception. A few days ago Messrs. Joshua Brothers sent the following telegram: Misled fragmentary press reports your plete proposals now before us amply satisfied if passed in entirety, sole exception, clause allowfact that misapprehension has arisen. ing 75 per cent, molasses whisky, as pointed out our letter to you yesterday. and members whole report - Joshu a Bros. It may be that some of the dissatisfaction work of the Commission. expressed in other quarters at the present saidtime may be based on a similar misapprehension ; it may be that others have been misled by the fragmentary reports in .the the press. This may arise, perhaps, through no fault of the press, but owing to the piecemeal manner in which the report of the Tariff Commission was submitted to the to House. Sir ' WILLIAM LYNE - How could the report of the Tariff Commission besubmitted in any other way ?",21
55,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I was not suggesting that the report could have been submitted in any other way; but my own opinion is that either the whole report ought to-have been submitted to the House at the time, or that it should have been withheld.",22
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,And every night honourable members clamouring for the report.,22
57,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I am only referring to the result of the piecemeal manlier in which the report was submitted. I know of no report of a Royal Commission having been similarly treated, namely, the body of the report separated from the recommendations-the body of the report submitted at one stage, and the recommendations submitted at another stage, and both afterwards forming two separate parliamentary documents. That was hardly fair to the Royal Commission, and no wonder misapprehension arose, as in the case of Messrs. Joshua Brothers, who admit that they were misled by the fragmentary manner in which the reports were circulated.",22
58,Mr HIGGINS,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Did the Government receive the two parts together?,22
59,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Most decidedly; the report and the recommendations were submitted in one document, signed at one ' time by the members of the Tariff Commission.",22
60,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Then it was not the Tariff Commission, but the Government, who separated the documents ?",22
61,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Most decidedly. Do honourable members think that the members of the Tariff Commission would be so unbusiness-like as to submit their report in two parts? The report was submitted as com- . a whole. I am not making any particular complaint on this score, but pointing to the I Compliment you should now like to read a communication sent by Mr H . A. Preston, of the Abbotsford Distillery, giving, his opinion on the  I have the honour and pleasure of saying that best thanks of the distillers and the general public are due to. you and the members of the Commission for your recommendations, and, if passed by Parliament, Australia will have the most scientific Tariff in the world with regard spirits. Britain and France are both demanding such a one at the present time. It would have the threefold incidence of protectionagainst the world's cheap and inferior spiritsfor the .local distiller who wishes to make a good article, as against the one who may not; and, lastly, for the consumers, in that they will know what they are getting, and have a better article cheapened to them by way of difference of duty. I particularly desire to emphasize the fact that neither whisky for blending purposes, pure malt whisky, nor grape brandy, should be distilled above 40 degrees overproof, and all distillation should be through pot-stills only. In conclusion, I trust that Parliament will see fit to endorse your recommendations by passing them into law as nearly intact as is possible. Mr Chas. P. Preston, of the Australian Distillery, South Melbourne, writes me a letter to similar effect substantially. I received another letter from Mr Henry Brind, one of the oldest and most experienced distillers in Australia, of the Ballarat Distillery. In this letter, which is dated 16th July last, Mr Brind says?Your most arduous duties as Chairman of the Tariff Commission, having now been lightened, we feel it our duty to thank you and your brother Commissioners for your recommendations re the spirit industry, which we think to be most equitable and scientific alike for the people of the Commonwealth and the distillers, enabling the latter to make a pure, unadulterated article, and the public to know what they are buying. We sincerely hope that your report will be adopted without any amendment. We also thank you for your desire to have the measure brought before the House at an early date. I also received a telegram on 8th August from Mr Jas'.i Thornton, the president,' and Mr John Ashton, the general secretary of the United Licensed Victuallers' Association of New South Wales, as follows:This Association thoroughly endorses the mendations of the Taiift' Commission in regard conditions. to our trade. The only discordant note in the correspondposed ence I received was a communication from Mr Cleland, the secretary of the South Australian Wine Growers'"" Association, which the following passage occurs :My association is of opinion that the term "" brandy"" should only be allowed to apply spirits distilled exclusively from fermented grape grain, and, finally, spirits, n.e.i. juice, and that in view of the large and ing proportion of brandy in use for medicinal purposes, its purity should be upheld and guaranteed by strict Government supervision. That is the only communication by wav protest that I have received, apart from some references to small matters of detail, such as the degree of alcoholic strength distillation. These matters of detail are fairly open to consideration. They are matters upon which even members of the Commission have no very pronounced views. Whether distillation should be at production. an alcoholic strength of 35 per cent, or 45 .per cent, over-proof is not a vital question, but it is vital that unless these spirits are distilled at a certain defined strength over-proof, they shall not receive the preference and advantages which we have commended.",22
62,Mr HUTCHISON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Why did the Commisnot sion propose to let the distillers introduce 75 per cent, of spirit distilled from other material.",23
63,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"That is but one of the immense number of details involved in the scheme. I shall deal with it later maturity. on, but I am now giving an explanation some of the - leading points at issue. I should like to sav that the 'general principle of the scheme of Excise duties on spirits recommended by the Commission is that certain concessions and advantages should be granted to spirits of Australian origin, distilled under the supervision of the Excise authorities, and complying; with certain Excise conditions. Apart from any question the regulations. of free-trade or protection, the members the Commission reasoned the matter out this way: If we were to recommend Parendeavoured liament to impose cerfain stringent condification tions for the production of spirits, certain improvements in production by pot still, patent still, or other methods, a certain strength of production, a certain time maturing;, and the use of certain materials, we could fairly recommend Parliament to grant concessions and advantages to the manufacturers who recomproduced spirits in compliance with those That is the basic principle of the whole scheme. We therefore proa scheme of Excise duties upon spirits based upon the following principles of classification:-First , with respect to in materials of origin, such as grape wine brandy, barley malt whisky, blended brandy, blended whiskv, rum from moto lasses, gin from barley malt or other These increasare the materials of origin indicated in the Commission's report, and with reference to them, it was felt that there might be, instead of a uniform Excise duty, a of graduated diuty, because it was. thought that a spirit produced from barley malt or grape wine at a cost of from 3s. to 4s. of per gallon should not bear the same Excise duty as a cheap spirit produced at a cost of only is. per gallon. Hence the graduation of the duties recommended was based to a large extent upon the cost of  propose to allow distillers to add 75 per cent, to 25 percent, of grape wine spirit?",23
64,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"If honourable remembers desire to have anything like a clear statement from me, they had better interrupt my speech. The material of origin was the first consideration, the second consideration was the method of distillation and the initial alcoholic strength. The third was detention in bond for a specified period in order to secure age and The fourth was compliance of with the directions of the excise officers and strict excise supervision, and, finally, the coping stone of the whole scheme was that no spirit should be entitled to the proposed differential advantages and concessions, unless they were certified by a Commonwealth analvst to comply with the conditions named, were good and true to name, and produced in accordance with Honourable members will of see at a glance that, even though we may in not have been successful, we, at any rate, to base our scheme of classion something; like logical and reasonable grounds. We say in our reportOn these lines we recommend the adoption of the following duties of Excise on spirits : for Then follows the scheme, and as elaborated in detail in the report, it is substantially, although not quite expressed in the resolutioni now before the Committee. I have certainly been somewhat surprised, however, to find that the Minister, having considered our scheme, having practically adopted it, and having embodied it in the resolutions submitted to the House, should now, because of some cry he heard in South Australia, or some other place, wish to abandon his own resolution, arrived at, it is to be presumed, after some consideration, and to disorganize the whole scheme.",23
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"No ; I said when I submitted the resolutions that I put them in that form, because they were submitted in that form by the Tariff Commission.",24
66,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I see. Then I must say that the honourable gentleman has hardlv graspedthe scheme yet, and it might have been wise and prudent on his part to take a little more time to consider it before he came down to denounce it, and to say something so disparaging concerning it as to be calculated to destrov it. If the Minister begins in this way, in all probability the scheme might as well be thrown into the waste-paper basket, unless honourable members generally rise to the occasion, take the matter into their own hands, and work out the problem for themselves, apart from the Minister's advice. I ask honourable members to consider the first itemBrandy, distilled wholly from grape wine by the pot-still or similar process at a strength exceeding 35 per cent, overproof, matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than two years, and certified to by a Commonwealth analyst to be pure brandy-pe r gallon ios. (4s. less than import). That is now altered to us.",24
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The certificate referred to would be equivalent to a standard?,24
68,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"What is meant is, that it is to be certified by a Commonwealth analyst to be true to name,- and true in respect of compliance with the statutory provision. Everything in that item is based upon evidence given onoath before the Commission, and that is the best specification for the production of a true brandy that we were able to devise. It might be called a scientific stipulation as to the mode in which it is to be made in order to secure the preference of 4s. If the distillers comply with those conditions and requisites, they are to get that preference, but not otherwise. The next point is a blended brandy, and I believe it is in connection with the blending that the whole controversy has arisen. I admit that on this question, there was a regular battle before the Commission between practically two great parties. One contended for a brandy which is to be composed of grape wine spirit exclusively-that is, without the introduction of any other kind of spirit-whil e the other party contended that whilst it was true that originally the true brandy was a spirit distilled from grape wine, in the course of time another kind known as the brandy of commerce came into use, and that the base of that brandy is grape wine spirit with which has been mixed a blending spirit composed of, or derived from, other material such as grain, potatoes, rice, or molasses. The whole contention is as to whether we are to recognise a blended brandy-the brandy of commerce-o r as to whether there is to be a brandy known only as grape wine brandy.",24
69,Mr KENNEDY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,That is not the point of difference I think.,24
70,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Yes ; that is the material point. I know what the case of my South Australian friends is. I heard the whole case fought out, and I thinki that I ought to understand something about it by this time. I had no preconceived . opinions upon this matter. I approached it with an open mind; and now that I have indicated the battle-ground, let not us see what the evidence is, apart altogether from the letters which have appeared. The first piece of evidence to which I would invite the attention of honourable members is that of Mr Saul Joshua, given at Melbourne on the 17th February, 1905.  witness.",24
71,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I shall quote the evidence given on both sides ofi the question. Mr Saul Joshua gave the following evidence:1 876. Would you describe genuine brandy as a brandy made from a spirit distilled from grapes? - It is described in that way by some lexicographers; but as a fact there is very little brandy of that description in the world. I have before me the figures showing the nroduction of France. 877. What would you describe as a good brandy fit for human consumption?- I should say a blended brandy, such as is understood in the trade as the brandy of commerce. 878. But have you not just told us that the brandy of commerce may mean a brandy which is the product of distillation from potatoes, beet,, and other things?-It could be. 879. What is the blend that you speak of as a good, wholesome spirit?-Win e spirit with grain spirit, or malt spirit, or sugar spirit. Blended together, as made in France. In reply to question 882 he gave figureswhich were challenged at first, but which were confirmed afterwards as absolutely *rue-as to the production cf brandy in France. He gave statistics showing that in a period of eleven years, the average quantity of brandy produced from grape wine was 2,500,000 gallons, and yet. in that period, France, he went on to prove, purported to manufacture, consume, and export, 45,000,000 gallons, the obvious inference being that the 45,000,000 gallons of so-called brandy was a blended brandy, and could not possibly have been made exclusively from grape wine, because only 2,500,000 gallons of grape wine spirit were produced annually in .all France. That is all the'evidence I shall quote from Mr Saul Joshua, as some honourable members seem to think that he is interested. T shall now quote from the evidence of Mr Daniel Ferguson, a disinterested witness, who is Chief Inspector of Distilleries in Victoria, and a thorough expert. He did not take sides between the distillers. In reply to the honourable member for Perth, he gave the following evidence:z 106. Is wine invariably used for the production of brandy?-They have first of all to use wine. 2107. Is any brandy made in Victoria from material other than wine?-The foundation of brandy is grape spirit, but other spirit may be added to it.",24
72,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Does the honourable and learned member call 25 per cent, of grape wine spirit the foundation of brandy?",25
73,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Some of the witnesses think that that is a very fair foundation, but I would remind the honourable member that it is the minimum.",25
74,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,It suggests the idea of a pyramid standing on its apex.,25
75,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"It could . be higher than 25 per cent., but that is the minimum. 2108. Why?-For reasons affecting the article, .and to give the brandy a distinctive taste. The public do not like a pure grape brandy, because there is too much of the wine taste in it. Hence the distillers try to produce an article which will - suit the public taste. 2109. At one time, when people drank brandy, they drank what was undoubtedly the product of the grape?-They may have done that years - ago. 2110. Is the taste for grape brandy modified with other spirit a correct taste?-That is for the public to decide. If I wanted brandy purely as a beverage, I would prefer that to which a little spirit had been added; but if, I wanted it purely as a medicine, I would desire pure wine brandy.",25
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,What does he mean by the addition of a little spirit?,25
77,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"A little white, or highly-rectified, spirit. The next witness to whose evidence I invite attention in justification of this differentiation is Henry Duncan Brown, the Chief Distillery Officer in New South Wales, a very able and disinterested man. His evidence is as follows :18662. Do you think that the name "" brandy "" should be restricted to spirits produced from grape-wine, or grape materials?-There is a great difference of opinion on that subject. For my own part, I do not think that a mixture of pure grape-spirit-that is, brandy, as some wish it to be called-wit h silent spirit would be unwholesome. I doubt very much whether such a mixture would not be better for drinking purposes than is a pure grape brandy. 18663. Such a mixture might be wholesome, but it would not be brandy?-That is so. 18664. Should it not be called by its true name - a blend ?-Yes ; but the difficulty is that brandy can be imported without any restriction. 18665. Certainly, but the same system would have to be applied all round?-That is where the difficulty would arise. 18666. Could not such a provision be applied to the imported article?-No ; for a reason that I shall explain. If a blend consisting of a pure grape spirit, and a silent were imported, an analyst would not be able to say what it contained. He would only find spirits derived from grape brandy. If an imported article consisted of a blending of potato spirit and pure grape spirit, and were labelled "" Pure grape brandy,"" the analyst would not be able to detect the fraud. He pointed out that, while true brandy is produced from grape wine, what is called a blended brandy has come into use, but he would confine the term brandv to brandv made from grape wine spirit, labelling the mixed spirit known as blended brandy in such a way that the public would be aware that in purchasing it they were buying, not true brandy, but a blend. I will quote another short passage from his evidence18994. Do you think it would be right to require that brandy shall not be mixed with alcohol derived from any other source than grape wine? - I do not see any objection to the blending of brandy with silent spirit, and calling it a commercial brandy. 18995. ^ ° ""v o s e e a n y objection to requiring such brandy to be labelled ""blended brandy""? - I am decidedly in accord with that.",25
78,Mr MAHON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Perhaps some of the imported brandy is not made wholly of grape wine spirit?,25
79,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The witness pointed out that a great deal of imported brandy may contain other than grape wine spirit, but that the presence of that other spirit could not be detected, and, thereno fore, imported blended brandy could masto querade as true brandy, whereas local brandy made under the supervision of the Excise officers could not contain any grape wine spirit.",25
80,Mr MAHON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Therefore , the local article would be under a disadvantage.",26
81,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Yes , unless a grape wine spirit. corresponding burden were placed on the imported article. The witness seemed to think that brandv produced from grape wine spirit should be exclusively entitled to the name, and that any compound should be termed blended brandy.",26
82,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Did any analytical chemist say that the proportion of rectified spirit in a brandy could not be distinfit guished ?,26
83,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Mr Wilkinson, the analytical chemist of Victoria, said that when spirit is rectified to a high degree it can not be distinguished - an",26
84,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,But spirit rectified to high degree is not brandy.,26
85,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"There might be 25 per cent, of true brandy of a strength not exceeding 35 or 40 degrees., but amount of silent spirit in addition grape spirit could not be detected. Mr. Charles C. Tucker, a Sydney merchant, who represented the Sydney Chamber Commerce, and is a thoroughly competent man, gave this evidence19027. You have told us that you would not under a misapprehension. allow the word "" brandy "" to be applied to other than that distilled from grape wine?Yes. 19928. Would you allow the term "" blended brandy"" lo be applied to a mixture of grape grape refuse,"" inserted. spirit and grain, or some other spirit?-Yes believe that in England they allow the term "" blended brandy "" to be used. I ask the representatives of South AusI tralia to note that I have now read the evidence on which the recommendation the Commission was based. It shows that an article called blended brandy is known to commerce.",26
86,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The honourable learned member promised to read the dence given on the other side; but he has cation. not done so.,26
87,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I think that I lic have read enough to support my own case. Evidence was given in South Australia by parted to it. Messrs. Cleland and Reid, who fought most strongly for the view that the term brandy should be confined exclusively to spirit obtained from grape wine, and that consideration whatever should be given other spirit, under the name blended brandy, distilled partly from grape wine spirit, and partly from other materials. but The Commission used the words ""other materials,"" however, because we did not feel bound to restrict the makers of blended brandy to grape spirit and To do so would not be fair to our distillers, because it would restrict their choice of material, and prevent them from using barley, oats, rye, maize, beet, and other produce, the growers of which hope to profit by any increase in Australian distillation. The distillers claim the right to make their blends of such materials as they may see to use, instead of using only grape wine spirit distilled at a strength of 35 or 40 degrees overproof together with a highly rectified grape wine spirit. On the other hand, the South Australians d it is to their honour and credita have developed a first class brandy, which, I believe, is the best in Australia. I do them the justice of saying that.  the duties will destroy their industry. to the Sir JOHN QUICK - They wilfdo them no harm whatever. The South Australian manufacturers of brandy have been carried of away by panic- a panic which has been based upon ai misconception. In the same way, Messrs. Joshua Brothers were acting The South spirit Australian manufacturers desire that the word ""materials"" shall be struck out, and the words, "" other grape wine,"" or "" other We could not . I comply with their request, because we could not see our way to limit the blenders of brandy to the use of grape wine spirit. f we had done so, we should have acted in absolute contradiction to the knowledge of and experience of the whole world with respect to blended brandy. Although in ancient days brandy was understood to be made wholly of grape spirit, we have and moved forward since then, and the evipublic taste has undergone a modifiAs is shown by the evidence, a large section of the pubdo not like brandy made wholly of wine spirit, because of the wine taste imThey want brandy made partly of some other spirit. This mav be a vitiated taste, but the distillers say that' they have to cater for the public requirements and to study the public inclinations, and that they cannot be tied down to the manufacture of brandy out of wine spirit pure and simple.",26
88,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"In words, they find it necessary to adulterate?",27
89,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The use of the word "" adulteration"" is also founded upon a misapprehension. That term can be applied only when spirits are blended with the object of deceiving the public. In cases, however, where the spirit is honestly described, and the brandy is sold as blended brandy-in cases where, as we recommend, the description is affixed to the bottles and the packages-n o one can 'be deceived, and it is wrong to apply the word ""adulteration."" I appeal to honourable members to.say whether brandy sold under an honest description, and certified to by the Excise officers as having been distilled in a certain manner, and blended in a certain manner, can be called adulterated spirit. In such a case, the term adulteration is a misnomer. It is a purely hackneyed cry that has been raised to serve a certain purpose.",27
90,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"A spirit may be adulterated, notwithstanding; that the bottle bears a description of the contents.",27
91,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I contend that the spirit is not adulterated, if it is sold under am honest description. If a blended brandyis sold as pure grape wine brandy, there is deception; but if customers wish to buy a bottle of blended brandy, and the word "" blend "" appears on the bottle, no deception is practised upon them. "" b l e n d "" is frequently used to indicate that the liquor is made up of spirits that are not of uniform character.  lic will not know what is meant by the word ""blend.""",27
92,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"They will, because, if the recommendations of the Commission are carried out, each bottle will bear upon it a description of the materials of which the spirit is made. of the objections to these proposals are due to an alarmist cry that has been raised in South Australia, and, if honourable members would calmly consider the whole matter, they would not be so ready to condemn the recommendations of the Commission. We cannot fly in the face of the public taste, or preferences. The South Australian manufacturers complain of the proposal that distillers should be permitted to apply the term "" brandy"" to any liquor that is blended with other than grape spirit, and it seems to me that that is a most unreasonable view to take. Blended branother dies have been in existence in Australia, France, and Great Britain for years past, and we cannot fly in the face of custom and the public taste. In paragraph 2, honourable members will see that a definition of blended brandy is given. The whole of the objections that have been urged against the recommendation apply to the inclusion of the word ""materials."" If , however, 1 that word were struck out, the whole virtue of the definition would be destroyed.",27
93,Mr MAHON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,It might also inflict injury upon the farmers.,27
94,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Exactly .,27
95,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,It would be more likely to injure the Colonial Sugar Company.,27
96,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"We propose to establish a standard for pure brandy, and a standard for blended brandy, and it is intended, in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 5, to extend certain exclusive rights, privileges, and advantages to those who comply with the conditions laid down. If the brandymakers of South Australia maintain their present high standard, and make brandy exclusively from grape wine spirit, they will have the sole right to describe it as pure Australian standard brandy. No other persons, unless they produce brandy of a similar character and composition, will be entitled to use that name. The makers of pure brandy will have a Commonwealth certificate to the effect that their spirit is The word of a certain standard, and no one else will be able to compete with them, unless their spirit possesses the necessary qualities. I contend that that is the most important protection.",27
97,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The South Australia brandy-makers are to go down in a blaze of glory.,27
98,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Thos e who make blended brandy will not be permitted to call it the Australian standard brandy, but The whole must describe it as blended brandy. I believe that, as is matter of fact, there is a greater demand for blended spirits than for high standard spirits, such as pure grapebrandy. That may be regrettable, but it is a fact, and the distillers have to manufacture spirits that will sell. Coming now to the question of preference, honourable members will see that grape wine biandy is to have a preference of 4s. per gallon, whereas blended brandy will have a preference of 3s. per gallon. The preference of 3s. per gallon given to blended brandy is based upon a minimum percentage of 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit. That is to say, the blend shall consist of not less than 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit. But most manufacturers of the blended brandy will, in the course of practice, use more than 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit. Many will probably use 50 per cent., and some, perhaps, 75 per cent., of pure grape wine spirit.",27
99,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"In other words, they will use the dearer article?",28
100,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"They may do so for the sake of producing a better blend of brandy. In all probability it will be to their interests to use more than 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit in producing their blend, in order that they may give it more body, more tone, and more quality, and thus make, upon the whole, a superior article. That is the reason why the Commission could not distinguish between fractions of a shilling. We could not say that a duty of a shilling should be split up in accordance with the proportion of. pure grape wine spirit which is contained in any blended brandy. We could not say, for example, that 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit in a blended brandy should give the distiller an advantage of 3d. per proof gallon, that 50 per cent, should confer an advantage of 6d. per proof gallon, and that 75 per cent, should confer an advantage of 9d. per proof gallon. We had to make allowance for the fact that in all probability the manufacturers of blended brandies would use at least 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit, spirit from the Colonial Sugar Refining and that others would require to use, perhaps, 50 or even 75 per cent, of that spirit. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Is it not as easy to specify 50 per cent, as it is to specify 25 per cent. ?",28
101,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The Commission recommended that a blended brandy should contain not less than 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit. It is claimed that our proposal constitutes a preference to the blended article as against the pure article. I fail to see it. If anybodv thinks he can make a better differentiation, I should like him to try. Of course, any persons can sav. ""Let'us destroy the scheme,"" but my reply is, "" Let them suggest something better."" The members of the Commission have done their best. We could not favour the distillers in South Australia as 'against the distillers in other States.",28
102,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,It is not a question of favouring South Australia.,28
103,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,There are dis- . tillers of blended brandy in other parts of Australia.,28
104,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The whole proposal is in the interests of Messrs. Joshua Brothers. The whole thing was engineered by Mr.. Joshua from the beginning.,28
105,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I am surprised at: the honourable member always jerking out assertions in reference to Messrs. Joshua; Brothers, as if they had ""bossed"" theCommission.",28
106,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,They are the only persons who will be benefited under these proposals.,28
107,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The honourable member should recollect that the report of the Commission was signed by four free traders as well as by four protectionists.. It is high time that he dropped his allusions to Messrs. Joshua Brothers. The Commission had to consider the whole of Australia. In Western Australia some distillers intend to go in for the manufactureof a blended brandy. It may not be to their interests to use the lowest percentage of pure grape wine spirit-namely , 25 per cent - in the production of that article. If the higher percentage of grape wine spirit be used, the preference will probably pan out at about 2s. 6d. instead of 3s. per gallon.",28
108,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Is the honourable and learned member aware that Joshua Brothers have just ordered 10,000 gallons of white Company ?",28
109,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I know nothingabout the matter, except what has beerr given in evidence upon oath, and I do not. want to know. The honourable member can pry into the private affairs of that firm",28
110,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The information was supplied to me without any prying upon my part.,28
111,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Perhaps it has been supplied by a rival in the trade. I am not dealing with trade rivals- I am endeavouring to do justice all round. Themembers of the Commission did their best to reconcile conflicting interests without doing injustice to anybody.,28
112,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I am not reflecting upon the honourable and learned member.,29
113,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I need not take up the time of honourable members by referring at length to the duties upon malt whisky, and upon blended whisky. The same principle which we adopted in reference to the duties upon brandy produced from pure grape wine spirit and upon blended brandy applies to the rates which we recommended should be levied upon malt whisky and upon blended whisky. The same principle of classification, differentiation and gradation, is applicable in each case.",29
114,Mr MAHON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Excep t that there is more whisky consumed, and that, therefore, if we omit the words "" other materials,'' greater injury will be inflicted upon the farmers.",29
115,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The honourable member reminds me of a complaint which is urged on behalf of the whisky dis>tillers in regard to the blended article. The fourth proposal before the Committee readsBlended whisky, distilled partly from barley malt and partly from other mate-rials, containing not less than 25 per cent, of pure barley malt spirit, &c. I am told that the whisky distillers desire the word ""materials"" to be eliminated, with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the word ""grain."" They urge this alteration in order to exclude the possibility of a blended whisky being composed partly of barley malt spirit and partly of molasses spirit. In regard to that suggestion I am quite willing to keep an open mind. I am prepared to hear arguments from both sides. The Commission inserted the word' "" materials "" so as to make the proposal harmonize with the proposal which is contained in their second recommendation, thus giving the distillers discretionary power to produce a blend out . of a basic spirit-in one case that spirit being pure grape wine spirit, and in the other a malt spirit-mixe d with pure and highlv rectified spirits made from other materials, subiect to the veto of the Excise officer. If the latter found that the materials so used were injurious to the public, he could veto them. Some slight alteration has been suggested in regard to other matters, which I need not occupy time in debating. I have merely put before the Committee sufficient material to launch the discussion, with a view to affording honourable members an opportunity of considering some of the leading points.",29
116,Mr MAHON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,What is the explanation of the ninth proposal which levies a duty of 40s. per proof gallon upon spirits n.e.i. f,29
117,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I cannot understand that proposal. There must be some explanation of it , but at present it is unfathomable to me. Before resuming my seat, I should like to say one or.two words upon the revenue aspect of this question. Honourable members will observe upon page 4 of the Commission's report, the following : We recommendno change in existing rates of duty on imported spirit; but if the foregoing set of excise duties be adopted, we recommend that bulk spirit imported into the Commonwealth, and imported bulk spirit reduced and bottled in bond within the Commonwealth, shall be entitled to an allowance for under proof similar to the allowance of excise duty on spirits produced in Australia upon evidence being given to the satisfaction of the Minister that a period of at least two years has elapsed since the distillation of the same, provided no such allowance shall be made on any strength less than 16.5 under proof. Upon a full consideration of the whole of these proposals, we arrived at the conclusion that whilst we were justified in recommending certain reductions in the Excise duties upon spirits, we could not-and we deliberately refused to do so-recommen d any alteration in the import duty. We worked out a scheme designed to give certain advantages and concessions to the local manufacturer, but we desired that those advantages and concessions should be plainly and clearly expressed upon the statute-book, without any reservation or condition-withou t anything arising indirectly, and producing results which we did not anticipate or did not desire to express. We arrived at the conclusion that, provided that the conditions I have mentioned were complied with, grape wine brandy was entitled to a clear advantage of 4s. per gallon; that blended brandy should have an advantage of 3s. per gallon; malt whisky, 4s. per gallon; blended whisky, 3s. per gallon; rum and gin, 2s. per gallon, and so forth. In arriving at this decision, we did not wish in any way to alter the existing import duty, nor to cause any disturbance in trade in regard to the ordinary wholesale or retail selling prices. Under the Commonwealth Tariff., during the last five or six years, there has been in operation an import duty of 14s. per gallon. That has led to certain selling rates in the Commonwealth, and it was thought that if there were an increase in the import duty it would disturb the existing selling rates, and, perhaps, to some extent, prejudicially affect the wholesale as well as the retail trade. We intended no such disturbance; we intended to give a certain clear positive advantage without upsetting existing trade arrangements and methods of selling in the wholesale or retail trade. We also felt justified, for certain special reasons which I shall proceed to mention, in refraining from recommending an alteration in the import duty. Those special reasons are, shortly, that under the Commonwealth Tariff, there has been an enormous expansion in the production of spirits in Australia. That is proved by the following figures:-In 1899 - whic h was a normal year before _ the adoption of the Commonwealth Tariffthere were distilled in all the Australian States 737,200 proof gallons of spirits, whereas in 1905 the production jumped up to the enormous quantity of 1,506,339 gallons, showing an increase of 769,139 gallons since 1899. The increase in the main was in the production of spirits from molasses in New South Wales and Queensland. By the establishment of Inter-State free trade, those spirits obtained free access to the whole of the Australian markets, and an enormous impetus was thus given to the industry in Queensland and New South Wales.' Prior to Federation, those cheap spirits would have had to pay high duties, and, consequently, they were shut out of the other Australian markets. But, as the result of the abolition of the Inter-State duties, the trade in molasses spirit received a tremendous impetus, and their production jumped up from almost zero to 700,000, 800,000, or 900,000 gallons a year. That is a very large expansion. There is also the expansion in the. Australian production of brandy, which accounts altogether for the total increase I have mentioned. In the distillation of whisky, however, there was an absolute and complete collapse, resulting in the closing of all the whisky distilleries in Australia.",29
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Has the honourable and learned member any figures showing that during the same period there was an increase or decrease in the local output of pure grape brandy ?,30
119,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,There was a very considerable increase.,30
120,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,There was a tremendous increase in South Australia.,30
121,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The figures I have quoted show an enormous increase in production, and, of course, that increased production meant increased revenue from excise duties. In 1899 the total amount received by way of excise on spirits produced in the Australian States was o n l y £ 47<935 I a comparatively small sum. In the year 1905, however, the excise collected on spirits, under the Commonwealth Tariff jumped up to the large sum of ^£267,454,- showing an increase, as compared with the return for 1899, of £ 1 1 9 , 5 1 9. The following figures, as to imported spirits, are interesting. In 1899, 2,504,926 gallons of proof spirit were imported into the various Australian States; whilst in 1905, 2,560,813 gallons were i m ported, showing an increase of nearly 60,000 gallons. I may say that, in the interval, there had been a big jump in the quantity of spirits imported, but that it fell away apparently to the normal figuies of some 2,500,000 gallons. There was thus a slight increase on importations and an enormous increase in local production, and in the amount received from the accompanying excise duties. The result is that from imported, as well as from locallymade spirits, there has been a very large increase in revenue since the establishment of the Commonwealth-a n increase amounting, probably, to ,£200,000. When the right honourable member for Adelaide submitted his scheme of duties on spirits, he based it , no doubt, on certain revenue expectations. These expectations have been more than realized. The revenue has been increasing, by leaps and bounds, and this is particularly so in the case of the revenue from, excise duties, for there has been every year since 1899 a gradual ascent in the returns. In view of these facts, the Commission arrived at the conclusion that, although they were about to recommend a reduction in the' excise duties, they need not necessarily recommend any increase of the import duty. The total amount of revenue from spirits as a whole was so great-so far beyond expectations, and above all necessity that we felt we could reasonably reduce the Excise duties without recommending any increase of duty on the imported article. I am of that opinion still, and I see no reason to alter it . I have not had time to examine the figures quoted today, though I mav, perhaps, find an opportunity during the debate to do so, and see whether there is anything to be said about the estimated loss of the £ 7 0 , 0 0 0, the £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 , £ 9 0 , 0 0 0. Assuming the estimate to be true, this expanding revenue from spirit is so great that there is no necessity to have any additional duty, in order to repair the loss.  greater in 1901 thai* it is now in the matter of imports.",30
122,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I have mentioned that in the interval between 1899 and 1905 there was a big jump, but that since then matters have come to their normal level. I did not want to bother honourable members with the figures in full . reason the Tariff Commission did not recommend any change was that the revenue was of such a character that burdens might be struck off those suffering from the Excise duties, without imposing further import duties with, of course, a corresponding rise in Excise duties. I intend to support the recommendation of the Commission that there be no increase in the import duty. I see no justification for any increase; the time has arrived when we may 'fairlv say that £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 is enough to receive from the spirit duties.",31
123,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Angas) [5.21] - I think we may fairly compliment the honourable and learned member for Bendigo on his very careful exposition of the position from his point of view, and on the exceedingly good work he has done as Chairman of the Tariff Commission. Manv of us must have been struck by the almost stupendous labours which the honourable and learned member and some of his colleagues have had to face in the work not only of taking evidence, but of afterwards reducing to synthetic expression the clashing opinions submitted to them. That is certainly a discharge of patriotic duty, which we, as members, can keenly appreciate. quite understand, at the same time, the anxietv of the honourable and' learned member for Bendigo that the recommendations of the Tariff Commission should not be disturbed. We all, of course,"" have a little liking for our political offspring, no matter what it may be. It is a sort of reflection on our discretion or judgmentsometimes it touches our amour propre-if even the Ministry propose to interfere with recommendations, especially after such an elaboration of purpose and adjusting of evidence as we have had in this instance. At the same time, I admire the wisdom of the Ministry in seeking new light on the 733 or the duties proposed. If u l ly appreciate the view that resolutions, illegal in themselves because they have to be hurriedly introduced, are, to a certain extent, tentative. They have to be quickly conceived in order to protect the revenue, and very often the technical information that may be desirable and necessary is nof available; because the Minister would have to seek expert advice from persons, who, of course, may be just those prepared to take advantage of the new schedule of duties. Without an absolute disclosure of the Ministerial proposals, any man, not a fool, could The real very well gauge what duties were likely to be brought down or increased from the questions submitted to him by the Minister seeking his advice. I can well understand, therefore, that the resolutions tabled about a fortnight ago by the Minister in regard to spirits, are, to a large extent, imperfect, and subject to such alteration as the Ministry may see fit in the course of the debate to make. Considering that we are still seeking light, I shall not do more than indicate the supreme importance of these proposals to South Australia, and also, of course, to the Commonwealth. This is not a South Australian matter purely. That State is very largely concerned, but the question of the purity of the spirits used in the blending of brandy is one that concerns the States as a whole. South Australia, it happens, however, is keenly interested in the matter. That fact does not altogether influence me, though it may undoubtedly stimulate me; I should not be here as a representative of that State if I did not feel, when her interests are specially affected, a higher degree of stimulus than that to which we must confess when we have before us matters which concern us purely as Commonwealth representatives. We represent particulardistricts and States, and questions affectI can ing these we view with keener interest than we do those of general Australian application. At the same time, mere local interests do not influence me if I think that the higher interests of the Commonwealth direct another stand. I need only refer to the Australian Industries Preservation Bill , in connection with which I had to some extent to oppose some interests of the district I represent. In the matter under discussion, if I thought it my duty to support the motion, of the Ministry I should do so; but from the best information I could get in the last few days, as well as from reading the reports of the Tariff Commission, I have come to the conclusion that we cannot accept the duties proposed by the Government. As to the effects of a blend of brandy not made purely from grape spirit-that is, 25 per cent, of pot still, and the rest rectified grape spirit- I have only to mention that last year in South Australia there was made 956,000 gallons of spirit from wine. Figures have already been quoted showing that in Australia nine-tenths of the brandy distilled is from wine. I think that the total production of wine in South Australia last year was 2,625,430 gallons-the largest quantity ever distilled in one State. A few years ago viticulture, which ought to be one of the leading industries of Australia, considering our climatic conditions and the peculiar character of the soil, had not assumed large proportions. There were then only a few thousand acres devoted to viticulture in Australia, whereas now, according to the Tariff Commission, there are about 65,000 acres thus used. labour employed averages about £ 5 an acre, which, therefore, represents nearly £330,000 'a year. When we consider that this industry, as measured by the progress of the last five or six years, is still only in its infancy, we can see the enormous possibilities, under fair fiscal treatment-that is under a differentiation that does not discourage the production of the pure article - whic h lie before the Australian producers. The position of South Australia is further emphasized by the fact that under the inspection duty of is. per gallon on spirits used for the fortification of wine, £45,000 was collected in 1904-5, of which, in round figures, £22,000 was paid by that one State alone. This indicates the importance of this question to South Austra lia, and I am pleased to see that the Government suggests the remission of this duty. From the revenue point of view, it was open to every objection that could be levelled against a pure revenue duty. It was unequal in its incidence in the different States-the figures I have given show that - and besides it was irregular in its return. Whilst the total revenue received from it was £45,000 in 1905, the total in 1904 was under £5,000. So that in addition to the other reasons given by the members of the Tariff Commission-and on this point there was unanimity-the disparity of incidence upon the States, and of vield from year to vear, render the duty objectionable from the point of view of revenue. Hence, Mr Glynn. S-] Tariff. I think it was a wise suggestion on the part of the Ministry that it should be abolished.",31
124,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"But the expense of super,vision should be provided for.",32
125,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"A suggestion has been made by the Commission as to how that is to be done. The suggestion is made, that there should be a pure inspection charge, and I suppose that solution is the correct one. It is stated in the report of the Tariff Commission on the wine industry in South Australia thatSince the operation of the Commonwealth Tariff there has been in each year an increase in quantity of wine converted into spirits, and a decrease in quantity of materials other than wine used in the manufacture of spirits. The report goes on to deal with matters to which I do not desire to refer at present, but on the question of purity, to which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo made so much reference, I should like to say that there seems to have been a The great conflict of evidence before the Commission as. to whether spirits other than pure grape spirit used for the rectification of wine, are pure; whether, for instance, alcohol made from, molasses is absolutely pure. But I failed to observe that any doubt was expressed as to the purity of the spirit made from grapes. That is the point, and when we can have a pure spirit byrelying upon distillation from the grape itself, I do not see why we should be driven back upon a spirit of conjectural purity, in order that resort may be had to molasses, potatoes, or other articles. There is a great conflict of evidence, not as to the purity of grape spirit, but as to the purity of other spirits. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo 1 has quoted the opinion of some experts, showing that it is possible to get a certain degree of purity in the rectification of molasses spirit. . It is said by some that ultimately all the spirits are pure from whatever material they may be produced. But we never get that ideal purity. As a matter of fact, it is never supplied, and if it were, there would be no such thing as flavouring. The flavour of brandy is not an idea-it is an element, the attenuation of the element to about its lowest state. Men in speaking of flavour in this connection sometimes speak of it as though it were, to some extent, an idea like the flavour of smoking, but it is not. Wisely, I think, there is no proposition made to interfere with the provisions of the' Distillation Act, under which wine can be fortified only by a grape spirit, but the same argument which was then urged in favour of the continuation of that provision, certainly applies with equal force to the manufacture of brandy from a pure grape spirit. At page 11 of the report of the Commission on the winegrowing industry of Australia, I find this evidence dealing with the use of various spirits for the fortification of wine. According to the Commission's report, Mr. H . D. Brown, who was quoted by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, thought that potato spirit, if added, would interfere with the quality of the wine. Mr Thomas Henry Norrie, analytical chemist, said it is a distinct advantage to the wine to use grape spirit for fortifying purposes. Mr Cleland, a South Australian, considered that grape wine spirit was the best for fortifying wine. Mr Adrian Despeissis, Horticultural and Viticultural Expert of Western Australia, was of the same opinion. These are strong opinions in favour of the view taken by South Australians, but I again emphasize the point that there can be no doubt about the purity of brandy that is made of not less than 25 per cent, from pot-still brandy and the balance from rectified spirit dis-. tilled from the grape. Once we begin to blend withany inferior spirit, we shall not be getting what Australia should desire, and that is a brandy that will bear a reputation throughout the world for purity. We heard from the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that certain brandies are so pure that they are objected to. What are the brandies that are objected to? The pot-still brandv, which has to be matured for two years, because it contains the greatest percentage of oils requiring to the oxidized to make pure ethers, is not consumed in the ordinary way by the drinking public, but is mixed with another grape spirit, so as to produce a blend, 75 per cent, of which is rectified spirit taken from the grape and 25 per cent, of pot-still spirit. That is the blend in relation to which the duties are objected to as being the same as for the blend from molasses spirit. regards puritv, I have quoted from the Tariff Commission's report, but I find also that Mr E. A. Mann, Government Analyst of Western Australia,, as the result of recent tests of spirits made in Perth, has certified that all the Australian brandy he examined, without exception, appeared to be of genuine character. As nine-tenths of the brandy produced in Australia is made in South Australia from grape spirit, that is a wide testimony to the value of the South Australian production. I do not think that in England they allow brandy which is not altogether produced from grape spirit to be used for medicinal purposes. I have no doubt that, in common with myself, other honourable members have received ,a letter on this subject from Messrs. Penfold and Company. I think that it deals only with the consumption for medicinal, purposes, but an extract is enclosed in the letter from Messrs. Fenfold from the Licensing Review of 30th July and of 6th August, 1904, in which honourable members will find very high testimony paid to brandy, whether blended or not, produced altogether from grape spirit. I need not read the quotation, as it is in the hands of honourable members. There is another matter to be considered in connection with this. If a blend of molasses spirit is permitted, and molasses spirit to the extent of 75 per cent, is used, it will completely displace the use of grapes for the distillation of spirit. There is no question about that. According to the best evidence I have seen, it costs about 4s. per gallon to make rectified spirit from grapes. Molasses spirit can be bought at is. per gallon. Estimates for it are given from 8d. up to is. 3d. per gallon. If the duty proposed were 12s., the position as regards the grape blend would be 12s. duty and 4s. cost per gallon, or a total of 16s., whilst the molasses would be 12s. duty, and is. cost per gallon, or a total of 13s. per gallon. In other words, there is a difference of 3s. per gallon in favour of molasses. It would be impossible for the pure spirit to compete with it ; it would be knocked completely out of the market. What would that mean? A few days ago I was in a part of South Australia-it is in my own district-where , within a radius of ten miles, between 10,000 and 12,000 tons of grapes are purchased every year for wine and the distillation of spirits. Let honourable members imagine farmers with acreAs ages running from 10 to 130 or 140 having a readv market within a radius of a fewmiles for the sale of their grapes.",32
126,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,There is no bonus for the production of grapes.,33
127,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Absolutel y none. According to the season, these farmers get from £ 2 to £ 5 a ton for the grapes. But suppose that they were paid £ 2 a ton, as they were last year. It would mean the purdence chase of 10,000 tons of grapes from the very class of men who ought to be couraged, if there is anything in all this talk about democracy. But what is the position in that district? There are of the leading distillers ready, in the vals between seasons, to make advances the crop of grapes, and without interest, am told; so they really act as <a sort accommodation banker to the growers. we. have the beginnings of an ideal munity. What do we get from the follows:molasses? We get the product of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and that is the best output of the industry. wonder what the planters of Queensland The got last year out of a total surrender £314,006, either directly in bonuses or indirectly through the shrinkage of duties as compared with 1901. I wonder how much provisions the planters in New South Wales and denaturizing Queensland will get this year out of bonuses which total up to £278,000. bonus given on grape production; molasses is the waste product of an inoil dustry \vh.ich is already over-protected. According' to the evidence of Mr Joshua, purposes the total quantity of molasses devoted to the production of spirits in 1904-5 was 7,000 tons, but the total production of industrial sugar was 196,000 tons, so that the demand created for molasses by allowing brandy too, to be blended to the extent of 75 per cent, with molasses spirit is comparatively insigneed nificant in relation to the total product the sugar industry. I have told 'honourable members what this .proposal will mean to the small vine-growers in a district of South Australia, and within a radius of ten miles. But let me now push the matter home. Are we driven to leave molasses alone? country, Will it remain a waste product ference be not given-a preference which might injure the reputation of our wine or brandy? On the 28th May, the American Senate passed a Bill allowing the use of trial alcohol. spirits made from wood, potatoes, molasses, and other such materials for industrial poses. It provides that it is to be natured or adulterated-both) used-under Government inspection, and then it is freed from excise. The matter was fully discussed in the Scientific Ameri-can for July and previously. A few ago I read the articles, which fully exto plained the actual cost of production, and the uses to which the spirit can be put. that point I should like to quote the evithink Mr Glynn. of a periodical showing that in their experience the very best way to break down enthe monopoly of such bodies as the Standard Oil Company is. to encourage, by freeing from duty, the use of spirit when defour natured for industrial purposes, because, interfor cleanliness and other qualities, it is on likely to supersede for many purposes the I use of kerosene and other oils for supplying of light, heat, and power. The quotation, There which is taken from an American trade comjournal of about six weeks ago, reads as On 24th May the Senate passed by a unanimous vote the Bill which provides for the freeI ing from taxation, after 1st January, 1907, of denatured alcohol used for industrial purposes. Bill had previously been passed by the of House, where it was opposed chiefly by the manufacturers of wood alcohol. This substance is to be used as an adulterant, however, to make the alcohol unfit for drinking. According to the of the new law, the adulteration, or of the alcohol is to be done in the various factories under the supervision of an There is no internal revenue officer. By removing the tax from industrial alcohol, our Government has but effectually put a stop to the domination of the trust over the use' of liquid fuel for light, heat, and power. In Germany and France devices for using denatured alcohol for these have already been perfected, and placed in actual use, and their adoption in this country will no doubt come quickly as soon as alcohol is on the market. As this fuel can be produced from many vegetable products that have heretofore gone to waste, and that, at a very considerably lower price than is obtained for gasoline and kerosene today; there never be any fear of lack of fuel, even should the coal measures all become exhausted, of and the supply of natural oil cease. The new fuel, besides being cleaner and less volatile, will, when used in suitably-designed internalcombustion motors, develop about as much power per gallon as will the old, while for light and heat it is far superior. Its introduction will create a new market for the farmers of our while they will benefit directly from it also by using it themselves for the production if this preof light and power.",33
128,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,That is all dealt with by the Commission in its report on indus,34
129,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The quotation is not the purless valuable on that account. I was going deon to mention that that recommendation has words are been made by the Tariff Commission, so that all we have to do is to get the Minister to adopt it ; and, as far as there is any necessity, therefore, to allow distillation nights from molasses, the spirit could be devoted a use which would lead to a far greater consumption than one which might mean the On death of the great wine spirit industry. I I could quote from several witnesses before the Tariff Commission to show the advisability of keeping our blends pure. As to the price of the molasses, it is somewhat significant that, in speaking of a scale of protective duties, Mr Joshua talks about a duty of 2s. per gallon on molasses spirit, but a duty of 6s. per gallon on grape wine spirit, showing a bigger differentiation in cost between grape spirit and molasses spirit than I gave for the purpose of the comparison. I would strongly put it to the Committee that, by preventing the use of molasses spirit for the purpose of blending brandy, or, at all events, by so adjusting the duties 'that we do not differentiate against grape spirit, as is the case at present, we shall help the extension of a primary industry which ought ultimately to give a reputation to Australia. It is not a matter affecting a few men such as control the sugar industry; in some districts there are hundreds of farmers engaged in grape-growing. I ask that reasonable opportunities be,given under the Tariff for the continuation of the development of this industry, which, during the last four years, under which the old Tariff of u s . Excise on grape brandy, and 13s. on n.e.i., has made a tremendous advance, but which, if the blending provided for by the Government is allowed, will be destroyed, because growers will be unable to get rid of their grapes. That is why the representatives of South Australia are displaying an anxiety in regard to the matter which, although it may have distracted the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, is justified in view of the possible effect of the new duties.",34
130,Mr FULLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Illawarra) [S-5 ] - 2 Whilst, in common with the other members of the Tariff Commission, I am perfectly prepared to justify and stand by the unanimous report to which we agreed after the hearing of much evidence, and a lengthy and earnest consideration of all the facts, I am not willing to do so after the flaunting manner in which the Minister of Trade and Customs has dealt with the subject. A few years ago, the Prime Minister used to say that the politics of the Federal Parliament would be on a higher p l a n e those of any State Parliament, and I ask him if the speech of the Minister this afternoon had the effect of placing our proceedings on a higher plane than those of a State Parliament? The honourable gentleman has admitted that he has not yet made up his mind in regard to the proposals which he has placed before the Committee, and he asks us to amuse ourselves by discussing them while he finds time to consider whether he is justified in what he has done. I sympathize deeply with the Chairman of the Tariff Commission in the humiliating position in which he was placed by the Minister, and, as a member of the Commission, I feel that our report has been flaunted. The Minister, on his own acknowledgment, does not understand its nature and tenor. Apparently, he will not stand by his motion, but intends later to introduce more mature proposals. Because of some outside agitation, and because of letters written to and interviews held with the Minister by persons who had every opportunity during several months to place their case before the Commission, the honourable gentleman tells us that he has not given the subject full consideration, and asks us to waste our time in discussing what he has brought forward, although he may later propose something quite different. I resent this treatment, both as a member of the Commission, and as a member of the Committee, and I ask the Prime Minister whether, as leader of the Government, he should not do something to place our proceedings on the higher plane of which he was so fond of speaking in years 'gone by, and which they do not now occupy.",35
131,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [5.56] - I am unable to find a reason for the honourable and learned member's impassioned words. The Minister of Trade and Customs said that he had obtainecT in South Australia and elsewhere information leading him to doubt whether sufficient protection is being afforded to the manufacture of pure wine brandy. But that is a subject for future consideration. Before we can deal with it, we must dispose of the motion now before the Chair, in which it is not involved, though honourable members have the undoubted right to criticise the whole of the proposals at this stage. The Government do not desire to prolong such general criticism. They would prefer the Committee to come at once to than close quarters with the motion submitted. I do not think any honourable members could take exception to the fullness with which the 'Chairman of the Tariff Commission supported such of its recommendations as have been questioned by my honourable colleague.",35
132,Mr FULLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Was it fair to require him to do so at this stage ?,35
133,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I do not know that it was necessary for him to do it at this stage. I understood my honourable colleague to intimate that, while the present motion was being dealt with,, he would give consideration to representations for the amendment of a later proposal which had been strongly urged upon him in South Australia. It is true, as the honourable and learned member for Bendigo has said, that there is a South Australian view of the subject as distinguished from the New South Wales or the Victorian view, but the report of the Tariff Commission shows that the view of the vignerons of South Australia was endorsed by every prominent and influential vigneron in the other States.",36
134,Mr KENNEDY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The vignerons of Australia are agreed on the subject.,36
135,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"It is practically a vignerons' representation. I am sorry, that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo took exception to the introductory remarks of the Minister of Trade and Customs. I heard no disparaging reference to the work of the Commission.",36
136,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The Minister's marks* sounded like a disparaging reference. He adopted a sneering tone, and, indeed, has always been an enemy of the Commission.",36
137,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"On e has only to read the report to see how exhaustive an examination was made by the Commission, while the honourable and learned Chairman showed that he carries in his head, or has before him, all the information requisite for the detailed consideration of any proposition affecting this matter. I understood my honourable colleague to refer to comparatively minor alterations, which I do not wish to discuss now in anticipation, thus unnecessarily prolonging the debate. They cannot be dealt with until we have finished with the proposals for Customs duties, and have come to the proposals for Excise duties. The honourable and learned member, in quoting from a speech which I made at Footscrav, brought together two parts of it in such a way as to alter the meaning of the second part. It is true that at Footscrav I said that this report, having been endorsed by both sections of the Commission, should be disposed of in a very short time- I hoped, in a single night. At that time, however, the consequences to the revenue had not been presented to us, as they were afterwards, by the officers of both the Customs and the Treasury Departments. In response to their representations, the Government, whilst adopting in principle the whole of the scheme of the Commission, with very great reluctance altered some of the duties. We sought, in the light of"" the best information available to us, tomaintain the revenue at about its present level. At a later stage of my speech I spoke of those cases in which the members of the Commission might be divided, and expressed the hope that no onewould raise the.theoretical question of free trade versus protection- a mere abstract question for argument between those of opposite fiscal faiths. The exact words I used"" wereWe want to put theoretical and doctrinaire considerations aside. In the last hours of this Parliament our business is to do business. The Tariff Commission has prepared the way - It has asked tens, of thousands of questions; it hasexamined hundreds of people; it has made the tour of Australia. Parliament will give its recommendations all the weight they deserve iri the knowledge of those facts, but Parliament is not there to re-discuss the questions of the Tariff Commission, and certainly not to invite the re Tariff Commission to re-discuss them on the floor of the House.",36
138,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,That was the passage to which I objected. /,36
139,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"That statement does not appear to me to cast any reflection upon the Tariff Commission. I said in effect that Parliament was not here to dis cuss abstract questions, nor to ask the twosections of the Tariff Commission to do so. All that we were justified in doingwas to ask the members of the Commission to give us the benefit of their practical experience. The honourable and learned member, therefore, has interpreted' my statement in a manner that it was neverintended to bear.",36
140,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I accept the Prime Minister's explanation.,36

I commenced by saying that what the honourable and learned Chairman stated was apt and pertinent. It is true that the Minister of Trade and Customs challenged the report of the Commission in respect to paragraphs 2 and 4 relating to the Excise duties proposed to be levied upon blended brandy and blended whisky respectively. All that he indicated was that he was rather shaken in the adherence he had given to the conclusions of the Commission that the duty upon blended spirits should be only 12s. per gallon. He stated that he thought that the question was an open one, and invited an expression of opinion from honourable members as, to whether the rate of duty should be increased.",36
143,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Does the Minister for point of view. Trade and Customs desire that the duty should be increased?,37
144,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,He stated that he was not satisfied that there should be an increase ; but that his confidence in the recommendation of the Commission had been shaken. He had previously thought that the proposed duty would be effective as it stood.,37
145,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Does the Minister Trade and Customs desire that the duty formerly levied should be continued?,37
146,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I understand that desires that the duty shall be increased from 12s. to 13s.,37
147,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"That is the existing . law. What is the use of all our investigaa tions, if that is the conclusion at which the to the proposals. Minister has arrived ?",37
148,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"My honourable colleague pointed out that the proposed alteration would make a difference in the incidence the Excise duties, as compared with the port duties.

I must say at this moment I am not prepared to how the manufacture of blended"" brandy and whiskv in the Commonwealth ought be treated.' My honourable colleague's 739 cisms were limited to two, one of which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo admits was of only secondary importance. Therefore the only exception that could be taken to his remarks is to the one suggestion with reference to the increase of the duty upon blended spirits. Surely my honourable colleague was perfectly candid in communicating to honourable members the impression that had been made on his mind by the viva voce representations made to him.",37

After he had, with the consent of all his colleagues, he adopted en bloc the whole of the recommendations of the Commission, he visited one of the greatest pure wine brandv centres of the'Commonwealth, and heard great manv representations antagonistic Then finding himself unable to answer them as thoroughly as he would have liked, he appealed to the Committee to review that one question, and, of if possible, meet the objections .raised.

Of course, if the to matter had been placed before the critihonorable and learned member for Bendigo, he would, no doubt, have replied as he has done today-h e would have given, in part, at all events, the reasons which could be urged against any modification of the recommendations of the Commission. No doubt there is a great deal to be said in support of the point of view put by him, but we can fully discuss the matter when the Excise duties are dealt with in detail. We have not yet reached that stage. We shall be called upon to deal first with the proposals to substitute higher duties for those previously collected upon imported spirits. The consideration of that matter is in no way affected by the suggestion of my honourable colleague, that one of the later proposals relating to the Excise duties may require to be reconsidered to some extent. My honourable colleague did not commit himself to any antagonism to the proposal, but indicated that when the time came he would be glad to receive further information. Therefore, after the issue immediately before us has been disposed of, we shall be able to fully examine the point that has been raised, and endeavour to settle any doubt that may exist.",37
157,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Perth) [6.9] - It is very good indeed of the Prime Minister to come to the rescue of his colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, in connection with these remarkable proposals of the Government. Unfortunately, however, we are being-asked to consider certain recommendations of the Tariff Commission which the Government are themselves unable to endorse until they have further information. It is obvious that the proper course would be to postpone this debate until such time as the Government is in possession of the information necessary to enable us to discuss the question before us in a way. I am quite sure that no member of the Tariff Commission would say that the proposals of that body are not open to improvement. We have given a great deal of time to our work, and have considered the question now before the Committee from everv possible point of view. We are prepared, at the proper time, to vindicate our attitude, but the Commission and honourable members are placed in an entirely false position when they are asked to debate certain proposals in regard to which the Government have practically no information to offer.

179,Mr HUTCHISON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"To me it is rather that something in that direction prowas not done long since. More than two years ago I called attention to the quality of the spirits that were being imported. I pointed out that nearly all the spirits coming iminto the Commonwealth were being imported bulk, also that very little case whisky was being introduced, and that the imported spirits _ were being sold without any real by supervision being exercised over them. I that this was particularly the case a in South Australia, where there was a conflict between the State and Commonwealth in enactments in regard to the matter. I am' at rather surprised to learn that under the Customs Act it was possible to prevent inferior spirits from being imported. I agree , with the honourable member for Bland that we ought to incorporate into the Bill some such provision as he has of outlined. We have in the past trusted too much to administration by means of rein gulations, which either have never been framed or have never been put into force. do not think that it is necessary at this to discuss all the matters dealt with",39

182,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The honourable member for Parramatta knows that; he is a word,39
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The honourable member voted again and again for,39
184,Mr HUTCHISON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I have always bevoted consistently, and that is more than aware the honourable member has done. The and learned member for Bendigo' mentioned that he considered a minimum of 25 per cent, of pure grape spirit was sufficient in the case of blended brandy, but I would point out that in the oldj country a number of prosecutions have been instituted against persons for selling brandy that is net the pure juice of the grape. In the case of one firm which was so prosecuted, it was stated in the course of the evidence that the great firm of Gilbey always labelled brandy not derived solely from the grape as a ""mixture of genuine grape brandy, and rectified British spirit."" It is recognised in the old land that brandy ought really to be the pure juice of the grape. That is the contention of the representatives of South Australia. Why should we allow pure grape spirit to be adulterated to the extent of 75 per cent, with the cheapest and most inferior spirit that one can name, and sold as brandy ? What hope has the manufacturer of a really genuine brandy in competition with such an adulteration ?. He cannot possibly live against such competition. In the case to which I have referred, an eminent legal authority gave evidence that if brandy not made of the pure juice of the grape were given to a patient, it would set up irritation, and do him injury. The authorities tell us that the ethers in brandy make it more valuable than is any other spirit. The purer the brandy, the higher the percentage of ethers, and the greater its value from a medicinal stand-point. The highest medical authorities tell us that the giving of a mixture of pure grape brandy and some other spirit, to an invalid, is likely to be dangerous. If it be dangerous to give brandy so adulterated to a sick man, it cannot be desirable to give it to a healthy individual. As we shall have another opportunity to deal with this phase of the question, I shall not, at this stage, make further reference to it, but I trust that the Government intend immediately to subjerimported spirits to the same conditions as are applied to those made within Australia. The whole purpose of the inquiry by the Tariff Commission has been to seek a means to protect our existing manufacturers and to encourage others to enter the industry. There is room for great expansion in this industry, but if we deal with it in the slipshod way that has characterized our actions for some time, we shall afford it but little protection.  I agree with the honourable member for Bland, that the same conditions should apply to imported spirits as are imposed with respect to those produced within the Commonwealth, I would point out that in the question now under consideration, something more is involved. The basic principle underlying the taxation of spirits is that since they have a deleterious effect upon those who indulge in them, and their consumption leads to increased cost in civic government, high duties should be imposed. I view this question, however, from the stand-point of revenue.. Whether spirits be manufactured within or outside the Commonwealth, the effect of their use is to increase the cost of government. Looking over the returns published by the Commission, I find that there is nothing in them to warrant an increase in the import duty on spirits, and, as a matter of fact, no increase is recommended. The revenue derived from the import duty has decreased in proportion to the increase in the consumption of locally-made spirits, but, unfortunately, the cost of government has not been decreased by their use. In 1899 737,000 gallons of spirits were produced in Australia, whereas, in 1905 1,506,000 gallons were produced, the figures showing a large expansion in the local industry. On the other hand, although there was an increase of nearly 60,000 gallons in the quantity of spirits imported in 1905 as compared with the quantity introduced in 1899, the imports - last - year - were considerably less than those of a few years ago.",39
185,Unknown,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.30 p.m.  for dinner I was pointing out that, in my opinion, the proposed duty of 15s. per gallon on imported spirits would be detrimental to the revenue; and I am supported in that view by the figures presented to us by the Tariff Commission. I find that in 1899 the quantity of spirits imported was 2,504,926 gallons, while in 1905 the quantity was 2,560,813 gallons. In. the growth of this industry we see the effect of the protective incidence of the duty of 14s. per gallon; and I venture to submit that if we raise the Tariff to 15s., there will be a marked falling-off in revenue. In 1901, : the total imports were 3,000,096 gallons, which is much larger than the imports at the present time. It must he apparent to any one who takes an interest in these matters that the Australian distilling industry was then subject to much severer competition from imported spirits than it today. In the meantime, not because people drink more, but as the result of creased population, local production has creased at a much greater ratio the consumption. As I have already stated, the only justification we have high duties are the effects, and consequent be disposed of. cost in other directions, of over-indulgence in alcohol. I take it that, even from the protectionist's stand-point, not much be said for the distilling industry as an employer of labour; because, practically, this connection, it stands lowest. marked increase in the local producnothing tion of spirits in New South Wales is noticeable. In that State, the crease in the period indicated has been, in round figures, 566,000 gallons, as compared with a total increase for all Australia 749,000 gallons. In other words, the put in this industry has been doubled in six years. Some capital has been made of the fact that Messrs. Joshua Brothers have practically closed their distillery Victoria. This occurrence has created something of a panic in the State of Victain toria, and has been attributed to the monwealth Tariff. The official figures, however, prove, if they prove anything, that the firm mentioned have suffered not so much from the Tariff as from the breakpose modifications of the Distillation Acting down of the barriers between the States, and the consequent influx of spirit from New South Wales.",40

190,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Perth) [7.38] - I have already entered a protest against proceedof ing with this motion, seeing that the prooutposals of the Government are in a very crude and immature state. I again urge that we should proceed no further with this particular matter, in view of the fact in that the Government are not able to explain whether they are prepared to introduce cerconditions into these specific arrangeComments for duties, whether they are going; to embody them in a series of resolutions, or whether, as has been suggested by the Tariff Commission, it is intended to prov the Excise Act, and other Acts dealing with this item. I may point out that the Tariff* Commission make a recommendation' similar to that contained in the amendment of the honourable member for Bland, with a view to protecting, the consumer against the use of immaturespirits, whether locally made or imported.. idea was that it should be dealt with e vernment should give the Committee some purdefinite information as to the plan on which they propose to work in dealing wit h all the matters that are naturallv included in the scope cf this debate.' On page 5 of the recommendations submitted* disby the Tariff Commission honourable members Will find No. 8 to read as f o l l o w s :That no spirits imported into the Commonshall be permitted to go into human consumption within two years from the date of their first shipment, unless the Minister of and Customs is satisfied that a period of"" years has elapsed from the date of distillaof an increased tion of the same. All these matters could be much betterdealt with apart from the resolutions imposing specific duties, but if we are to have-' no explanation from the Government as to ' the method of procedure they intend to adopt, I and others will have to support the amendment of the honourable member' for Bland. I can well imagine that if we are compelled to follow this scrappy and piecemeal method through the proposed alterations to the Tariff, we shall have produced a very remarkable document indeed by the time we are finished. I am entirely in accord with the proposal of the honourable member for Bland. It is absolutely necessary that the health of the people who use spirits should be protected in the direction indicated. There is not the least doubt that a large quantity of unwholesome immature spirit is imported into the Commonwealth. It is not strictly relevant to this question, but I must also mention that a considerable quantity of this class of spirit that comes into consumption is produced within the Commonwealth. In this matter it is the duty of Parliament to say that those who indulge in spirits shall be protected so far as is considered necessary and reasonable by authorities on the subject. There is, .in this connection, attached to the report of the Tariff Commission, a supplementary recommendation, signed by four members of the Commission, in favour of a differentiation of is. per gallon less than the existing Customs duty in respect of tain alcoholic liquors, admittedly of the highest quality. I should like to give the Committee an opportunity to vote upon that, but again I am in a difficulty as to where and how the Government propose to deal with such an issue. Then we have yet another issue which may probably arise, and that is the question of a preference to British goods. We have heard a great deal of preferential trade from those protectionists who have been favouring the country with their eloquence of late. I am anxious in this connection to give those honourable gentlemen who are so loyal to the Empire an opportunity to prove their loyalty by making a differentiation in respect of spirits. proved to be of British origin. Again, I ask the Government to sav whe:""e that provision should be introduced ; whether it should be introduced in connection with the imposition of these specific duties, or in the way suggested in the Tariff Commission's report.",41

194,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"There is no doubt that a great deal of inferior whisky, so called, comes to us from outside the Empire.",42
195,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,We prefer that the foreigner should make the sacrifice rather than ourselves.,42
196,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"It happens, and this supports the suggestion I submit, that the better qualities of alcoholic liquors in the shape of whiskies that are imported to Australia are produced within the Empire, and those which admittedly are deleterious to health come from outside the Empire. The way is,' therefore, clear for those who are prepared to adopt in this connection the scheme of preference of which we have cer- heard so much recently. With regard to the proposal for a duty of 15s. per gallon, I have no hesitation in saying that if it be the intention of the Government to obtain the highest amount of revenue from this source, they are going the wrong way about it .",42
197,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,That is a matter of opinion.,42
198,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,It was the opinion of the Government when the Tariff was being discussed.,42
199,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,It is not my opinion.,42
200,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The right honourable gentleman was a member of the Government to which I refer.,42
201,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"It was not my opinion then, nor is it now.",42
202,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Migh t I remind the right honourable gentleman that a few years ago the Government of Victoria endorsed a recommendation of a Tariff Commission that made full and searching inquiries into this question, and which was to the effect the honthat 14s. per gallon was about as high as duty it was safe to go in connection with the revenue.",42
203,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I have heard that old story before.,43
204,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,They also pointed out that the higher duty had led to the use of a great quantity of inferior spirit. There was very little hesitation at that time on the part of the State Parliament of Victoria in accepting the recommendation that the duty should not be higher than 14s. per gallon.,43
205,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"When Federation was established, the duty in two States was 15s. per gallon, and in another State 16s. per gallon.",43
206,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I know that in Western.Australia the duty was 16s. per gallon.,43
207,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,And the charge was is. per nobbier.,43
208,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Onl y on the goldfields.,43

210,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Does the honourable member mean that if the duty were higher it would reduce the use of whisky here?,43
211,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"In view of all the evidence which was submitted, and of certain evidence which was not submitted I thoroughly endorse the proposal made by the Chairman of the Commission, and approved by all its members that the duty on imported spirits should not be higher than 14s. per gallon. We may each have our own idea with regard to other items in the Commission's recommendations, some of which I intend to touch upon at the proper time, but in this particular case, in view of the evidence, the Commission was unanimously of opinion, that"" it would be a serious mistake to levy a duty of more than 14s. per gallon on imported spirits.",43
212,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Why ?,43
213,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"First , because it would entail a loss of revenue, and second, because it would lead to the consumption of an inferior qualitv of spirits. In view of the evidence before honourable members, and of the experience of most of the other States, especially those which have the largest population, and in which the conditions are most nearlv normal, it rests with the Government, I contend, to show reason why the additional duty of is. per gallon on imported spirits should be imposed. So far, I have heard from Ministers nothing beyond a mere expression of opinion to justify the increase, and if they car, give no stronger evidence than that I venture to think that honourable members would prefer the more definite expression of opinion, based upon a consideration of the evidence, from the Tariff Commission.",43
214,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Lang) [7.52] - This motion is on a par with all those other proposals which we have been accustomed to receive at the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs. I think I am right in saying that during this session he has not brought down a single proposal which has given evidence of careful consideration, matured judgment, correct information, or even a clear knowledge of its character. We find ourselves today in a position in which we have frequently found ourselves. The Minister brought down a proposal, but before we had time to enter upon the discussion of it, he discovered that it was untenable, and therefore he intends to submit certain amendments. This has happened in the case of every measure he has submitted. I venture to say that in no other Parliament has there ever been such an exhibition of incapacity on the part of a Minister as that to which we have been treated by him on this as on previous occasions. Like all other measures with which he has been associated, the main object of this proposal is obviously to benefit Victorian industries at the expense of the other States. It is a most singular thing that a Minister representing a New South Wales constituency should always have so little regard to the interest of his own State. Whenever an opportunity is offered, he invariably brings down measures which he declares are to benefit Australian industries, but which in their operation would more largely benefit Victoria than any other State. It is plainly evident that the proposal before the Committee is made in the interests of not even Victoria as a whole, but of one firm in that State, and that is the firm of Joshua Brothers. I am credibly informed that it is the one firm in the whole of Australia which goes in largely for the adulteration of liquor.",43
215,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Does the honourable member say that the Tariff Commission has leaned towards Joshua Brothers? The progood posal before the Committee is practically the proposal of that body.,43
216,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The Minister's prowhich posal is not that of the Tariff Commission. opinion.,44
217,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"So far as the amount of protection to be given to Joshua Brothers is concerned, it is exactly the same.",44
218,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Whateve r the Commission may have done, the Minister, in interests of that firm alone, has seized opportunity afforded by its report to come down with a proposal which, if adopted, would injure similar industries in other parts of Australia.",44
219,Mr TUDOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,How ?,44
220,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I am going to probe prescribed ceed to show how it would.,44
221,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Is not the degree of protection to Joshua Brothers the same under this proposal as under the Commission's commendation ?,44
222,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,That has nothing to opinion do with the point of my argument.,44
223,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Therefore , it is the Tariff Commission which is favouring the firm, it is favoured.",44
224,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I do not care whether the Tariff Commission favours what the the firm is doing or not. Had it anything to do with the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, or the Commerce Bill, or other Bills which were framed to favour Victorian manufacturers at the expense of the States? That is what I am complainWales ing about. We know quite well that the whole of this legislation is in consequence of an agitation which has been conducted mainly by the firm of Joshua Brothers. I am credibly informed that, before the new duties were proposed, Joshua Brothers had their warehouses of spirits which they wanted to unload on the market, but-so I am informed by local hotel keepers-the public prefer imported commission. spirits to those manufactured by Joshua Brothers; that, as a matter of fact, that firm's spirits are not healthful, but, contrary, very injurious.",44
225,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,That is not true.,44
226,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I am merely stating what persons in the business have told me. I do not profess to speak from personal protectionist. knowledge, because I do not take alcoholic stimulants.",44
227,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"It is not a proper thing to say. It may not be whisky or brandy, but, certainly, it is not injurious. It is sugar spirit from the Clarence River, and that will not hurt any one.",44
228,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,That is a matter on competent authorities differ in,44
229,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Whic h spirit does the honourable member reoommend for medicinal purposes ?,44
230,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Some of the authothe rities declare that no spirit other than the brandy made from pure grape juice should be prescribed for medicinal purposes, and that all other spirits are injurious.",44
231,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,It depends upon what the medicinal purpose is. There are two or three different kinds of spirits which mayto patients suffering from'«dif ferent diseases.,44
232,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I shall come to that aspect of the question presentlv, and if I redo not happen to forget it, I propose to quote what one very eminent authority has said. In these matters I prefer to take tru of experts to the opinions of the""who have no claim to be experts. The honourable member fqr Bland, however, may be if an expert for all I know to the contrary. Joshua Brothers is the one firm in Australia which would secure a practical monopoly as result of this legislation. It must 'be remembered that, to a large extent, it is only a distributor of spirits which are manufactured in an adjoining State. All the spiri*which comes to Victoria from the Colonial other Sugar Refining Company in New South is sold to Joshua Brothers.",44
233,Mr BAMFORD,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Has the honourable memsubmitted ber any evidence of that?,44
234,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Yes ; the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission, including that of Mr Knox, the manager of the full Colonial Sugar Refining Company.",44
235,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Mr Joshua stated on oath that he sold that spirit on merchant's,44
236,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I am not prepared to accept Mr Joshua's statements as gospel. on the He is the gentleman who declared that every protectionist is a liar, and, as he himself is a protectionist, I should be very careful about accepting, as reliable, assertions of that sort from his lips.",44
237,Mr MCCOLL,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,He said every moderate,44
238,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I believe that he did make that qualification. I have been told that Messrs. Joshua Brothers have their stores full of spirit, and wish to obtain an advantage over importers of spirits in order to get their goods upon the market. Their complaint that they could not get their goods upon the market was, I understand, the excuse for these proposals.",44
239,Mr STORRER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,What evidence has the honourable member for that?,45
240,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I am entitled, a the honourable member or any one else would be, to Base my remarks on information received. The honourable member for Bass would find it very difficult to substantiate, by an affidavit, every statement he made here. The report has been circulated that, although Messrs. Joshua Brothers asked for legislation of this kind only to enable them to put their goods on the market, and conveyed the impression that they had no intention of raising their prices, they have increased the price of one brand of whiskv by is. a gallon, and of another by is. 6d. a gallon.",45
241,Mr BAMFORD,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The Excise duty has been increased by is. a gallon.,45
242,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The protectionists say that the duties are paid by the foreigner, but it is the consumers of Victoria who will have to pay any increase in the price of the article put oh. the local market by Messrs. Joshua Brothers. The firm has not^given an absolute denial of the rumour; it says, in a circular- , Whereas a rumour has been circulated to the effect that we have taken advantage of Tecent Tariff changes to raise our prices for Australian spirits, and whereas we believe the object of this rumour is to prejudice the interests of Australian distillers in the forthcoming Parliamentary discussion, we desire it to be known1. That we have made no public announcement whatever on the subject. 2. That we have since the closing down of our works in 1902, been selling stocks at cost price and under (and this fact is recorded in the Tariff Commission's report); and 3. That we undertake for the future not to sell below cost price unless absolutely compelled to so liquidate. (Signed) For Joshua Bros. Ppy. L t d . ,",45
243,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Mus t not the firm increase its prices, seeing that the Excise duty has been raised by is. a gallon?",45
244,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Messrs . Joshua Bros, gave it out that their desire was not to increase prices, but merely to get their goods upon the market. But what I want to know is what has become of the obliging foreigner who protectionists always tell us pays all our duties ? I do not take alcoholic stimulants, and, in my opinion, it would be a good thing if the importation and local manufacture of spirits, except for medicinal purposes, were absolutely prohibited, and those engaged in the industry employed in some undertaking which would be helpful instead of injurious to the com-; s munity. The plea cannot rightly be put forward that protection must be given to the distilling industry because of the number of persons that it employs, since there are fewer hands employed in that industry than in any other in proportion to the value of the output. A little time since, I went through the Colonial Sugar Company's distillery at Pyrmont, Sydney. That is a very large place, fitted up with the latest and most improved appliances for the distillation of spirits, and having a very large output; but the total number of hands employed is only about a dozen. However, my wish is to deal with the probable effect of the proposed duties. In my opinion, the result of their imposition will be to give those who consume spirituous liguors a more impure and more deleterious rather than a purer and better article, and to bring down the standard of Australian production. So far as I can gather from the information supplied to me, the purest spirit made in Australia is distilled from molasses by the patent still process. It has been urged that the rectification of spirit gets rid of valuable qualities, but, on the other hand, experts say that the purest spirit is the least harmful from a toxic stand-point.",45
245,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,That is a moot point.,45
246,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"There is a difference of opinion in regard to it. The weight of evidence of experts, however, amongst whom is Mr Wilkinson, goes to show that the purer the spirit the less intoxicating are its effects.",45
247,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Frenc h Cognac, the finest and most expensive brandy in the world, is distilled by the oldest apparatus, which allows the natural ethers to be given over J. M . JOSHUA, Director. in the greatest profusion.",45
248,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Would what is sold 1 as Cognac in the average public bar be prescribed as a stimulant, in cases of sickness where pure brandy was necessary by a medical man who had any care for his reputation ?",45
249,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,It is pure brandy.,45
250,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I understand that the ordinary commercial Cognac is not pure brandy. I have been told by persons well versed in the spirit trade that certain brandies are popular because of their palatable flavour. This flavour is due to the presence in the spirit of certain deleterious elements which are not extracted in pot-still distillation as are in the process of rectification by the patent still processes. In the Colonial Sugar Company's distilleries the spirit is distilled above 60 degrees over-proof for the purpose of getting rid of the fusel oil and other deleterious elements.,45
251,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,They endeavour to produce a neutral silent spirit that may be used in the manufacture of half-a-dozen different liquors.,46
252,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"It is proposed that no spirit shall be sold unless it has been kept in wood for two years after distillation, but nothing is to be gained by keeping highly rectified spirit in wood for any length of time after it has been distilled. As a matter of fact, all the impurities are extracted in the process of rectification. Spirit distilled at a strength of, say, 35 per cent, over-proof contains a large proportion of fusel oil and other deleterious elements which are nauseous, and that is the reason why it is kept in wood for a considerable time-for two, and sometimes three, years. I am informed, further, that the effect of keeping such spirit in the wood is not to rid it of impurities, but merely to disguise their presence, and make the spirit more palatable than it otherwise would be.",46
253,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The honourable member should take a glass of good whisky, and then he would be able to speak with some authority.",46
254,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"My information has been gained from men engaged in the manufacture of spirit, who probably know more about the subject than does the honourable member for Bland-althoug h I am quite willing to concede that he may be an expert. I thought that it would be a good thing for .me to visit a distillery and find out exactly what was done.",46
255,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Did not the odour of the spirit affect the honourable member?,46
256,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"No . It was pointed out to me that silent spirit has no odour until it is rubbed on the hands, and the aroma is brought out by the heat caused by friction. The provision relating to the spirit being kept for two years in wood is also made to apply to gin. Those who are best qualified to speak upon the matter tell me that gin, above all other spirits. should be consumed as soon as possible af te» it has been distilled, in order that the full benefit of the juniper juice used in its manufacture may be derived by the drinker. they Then with regard to rum, I may.point out that the Australian product is made from silent white spirit extracted from molasses and coloured with burnt sugar. This spirit is ready for immediate consumption, and nothing is to be gained by keeping it in wood for the period proposed. If the condition sought to be imposed is insisted upon, the Colonial Sugar Companv in Sydney and a number of similar establishments in Queensland will have to be closed up, or the spirits manufactured will have to be exported to Europe. Thence they will probably be brought back to Australia in the shape of popular blends of brandv or whisky. I have a copy of a letter from the South Australian Winegrowers' Association, in which attention is directed to the disabilities under which Australian wine-growers will be placed by the proposed legislation. I wish to refer to this letter to show that in order to benefit one Victorian manufacturer, it is proposed to place disabilities upon others engaged in primary industries connected with the same line of business. This letter, which was addressed to the Minister of Trade and Customs, reads as follows:In response to your invitation for suggestions from those interested in respect of the conclusions of the Royal Commission on Customs and Excise Tariffs, the Council of this Association, with the concurrence of the brandy distillers of this State, have the honour to address you in reference to the suggested definition of brandy, as set forth in progress report No. 2. This definition will be found in the final paragraph of Section XXV . on page 35 of the report in question, where a serious anomaly has crept in - doubtless inadvertently - because "" Appendix D "" (which is quoted) is entirely at variance with that decision. The anomaly referred to consists in thisthat whereas the definition of "" whisky,"" blended for commercial purposes, is that such blend shall consist of 25 per cent, of spirit, distilled from barley malt, and the remainder grain spirit to the exclusion of any spirit distilled from other sources, that of brandy is that such blend shall consist of 25 per cent, of true brandy, while the remainder "" may be patent still spirits from any approved material. (See appendix B ) . "" My council feel that the trade in Australian pure grape brandy is essential to the well-being of the viticultural industry of the Commonwealth, as well as to that of this State, and that if this permission obtains, the trade already secured will be seriously prejudiced, if not destroyed. During the last fifteen years the South Aus' tralian distillers have been building up a large trade in grape wine brandies, distilled under strict Customs supervision, and a reputation for an article of undoubted purity. This trade will be ruined in many directions if future legislation permits of a liquid, 75 per cent, of which may consist of cheap spirit produced from molasses, potatoes, grain, or maize, being foisted on the public as brandy. In this connection it is satisfactory to notice, as a result of recent of spirits made in Perth by Mr E. A. Mann, the Government Analyst of Western Australia, that all the Australian brandies examined, without exception, appeared to be of genuine character. The importance of the brandy industry to the vine-growers of this State alone may be shown by the fact that in 1904 no less than 956,000 gallons of wine were distilled, and if this industry should be destroyed by reason of lax legislation, the value of 50,000 acres of vineyards would be seriously affected. That is a very serious matter to these vinegrowers.",46
257,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Will the condition of affairs under these proposals be worse than it was previouslv ? ' Mr JOHNSON - Undoubtedly , it will ; for instead of brandy being wholly made from pure grape juice only one-fourth of it will be grape juice.",47
258,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I do not think so.,47
259,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The South Australian vignerons say so.,47
260,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Is the member referring to the production, of brandy ?",47
261,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Yes - The communication continuesMy association is therefore of opinion that the term "" brandy"" should only be allowed to apply to spirit distilled exclusively from fermented grape juice, and that, in view of the large and increasing proportion of brandy in use for medical purposes, its purity should be absolute, and still guaranteed by strict Government inspection. In the case of all spirits imported into the Commonwealth under the name of "" brandy "" or "" Cognac,"" they should be accompanied by a certificate of origin, which should guarantee that such spirit is genuine. The council of this association desire most respectfully to draw your attention to the evidence of Mr A. B. Holmes, of Hunter Valley Distillery, Mr W. A. Wilkinson, of New South Wales, and also that of Senior Inspector E. P. Clarke, of South Australia, insregard to the importance of this matter. That letter is signed by Mr John Creswell, the secretary of the South Australian Vine-growers' Association. The proposals now under consideration will undoubtedly promote the production of a less pure spirit than has hitherto been placed upon the Australian market. Thus, instead of being supplied with brandies made from pure grape wine spirit, we shall get brandies which contain a very large proportion of spirit which has been produced from molasses and potatoes. In other words, instead of obtaining an article which will be useful for medicinal purposes, the Government proposals will tend to destroy that tests portion of the industry which goes in for the distillation of pure brandy, and to promote the production of impure brandy, which contains only one-fourth or 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit, and three-fourths of spirit which has been distilled from molasses and potatoes and other materials. As a matter of fact, I have been informed that at the end of last week, Messrs. Joshua Brothers gave an order to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company of Sydney for 10,000 gallons of white spirit, which is to be used in the production of brandy. Messrs. Joshua Brothers' "" Boomerang"" brand of brandy consists of 25 per cent, of pure grape wine spirit, and 75 per cent, of spirit which is obtained from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.",47
262,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Accordin g to the honourable member's theory that is the more wholesome and purer article, inasmuch as honourable it contains a bigger proportion, of silent spirit.",47
263,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The spirit which under this Act will be used in the manufacture of brandy is to be distilled no higher than 35 per cent, over-proof, which is too low to allow of the effective extraction of fusel oil and other poisonous elements. I am speaking of spirit which is not distilled from the pure juice of the grape, and which is not necessary to the production of brandy.",47
264,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Seventy-fiv e per cent, of the grape spirit is also silent.",47
265,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"But the important point is that the spirit itself is distilled from the pure juice of the grape. The other spirit is obtained from molasses. The Queensland distilleries and the distillery of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in New South Wales only produce spirit from molasses as far as I know. I do not profess to be an expert upon this subject, but the complaint is made by vignerons, and by other persons who are engaged in the trade that the effect of these proposals will be to promote adulteration, and to discourage the production of pure grape spirit. At the present time Australian spirit has a good reputation upon the European market. The persons to whom I have referred complain that under the Government proposals they will beplaced at a disadvantage in that market, and instead of enjoying a reputation ring for wind."" for selling only good, pure grape spirit, will be regarded as adulterators, and be included in the same category as perwith, sons who are engaged in some of the Chicago meat industries. In regard what constitutes brandy, I think I may pardoned for quoting the opinion of Dr Henry Macnaughton-Jones, the well-known obstetrician, of Harley-street, who gave evidence in a test case which was recently heard at the North London Court. saidHe had heard of the artificial brandy, was derived from sources other than the grape. He would not like to surmise what would the result if a common or artificial brandy administeredHe would not prescribe one part of Cognac and three parts of silent spirit. In reply to the magistrate, he said I would not call that brandy. I would administer a brandy that would create a burning sensation, and probably set up irritation, tendency to reject the intended stimulant. brandy has no such tendency. It has a stimulating and sustaining effect. If we are to engage in the liquor-producing industry in Australia we should endeavour to insure that as pure an article as possible is supplied to the public. Personally I am opposed to the liquor industry absolutely, but until we can get rid of it altogether we should endeavour to insure the least amount of injury to health in connection with it. But if legislation of this character will have the effect of destroying the puritv of the articles which are being supplied by Australian distillers, it will be mischievous in a double sense. In the first place, it will tend to destroy one set of industries for the purpose of affording protection to a single manufacturer, and in the second it will tend to still further injure-if not to absolutely destroy-the health of a great number of persons in the communitv.",47

There is only one firm of distillers, in Australia; Victoria is the only State in which the manufacture of - spirits has been permitted. The Temperance Party elsewhere are sufficiently strong to put an end to such an industry, but whilst in Victoria they talk about temperance, we find grand masters of the order always ready to vote for any proposal which would increase the difference between the import 4 Tariff. 2751 and the Excise duties to such an extent as to allow of the manufacture of spirits in this State. I believe that even the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and others have taken a most active part in bringing about this big difference between' the Excise and import duties.",49
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Does the honourable member think that is fair fighting?,49
282,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I am speaking not about the Acting Chairman, as such, but about the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.",49
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,But when he is in the Chair.,49
284,Mr TUDOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,That is hitting below the belt.,49
285,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Can it be said that I am hitting below the belt when I point out what an honourable member does in the open-that he is endeavouring to build up a drink factory here? Surely when the votes cast by him in this House show that he is always in favour of trying to build up grog manufacturing shops-that his speeches when before temperance gatherings are not to be taken as indicative of his real feelings-h e is not ashamed to have these facts stated. We have to consider, not the newspaper reports of speeches showing that he is in favour of temperance, but the votes recorded by him in this Housevotes to put down temperance. The honourable member is not the only one who acts in this way. I dare say that we shall find two or three others who, as leaders of temperance leagues, strongly advocate temperance, casting votes that will have the effect of increasing the difference between the im1 port and Excise duties to such an extent that grog manufactories must spring up. How is it that this industry did not spring up in New South Wales ? Simply and solely because care was taken by temperance men, who were true to their principles, not to permit this difference between the import duty and the Excise; what these men advocated on the platform outside, they advocated in Parliament. In Victoria, however, there has been a very different state of affairs. However strongly certain men may speak in favour of temperance outside, they support this difference in duties within the walls of Parliament. The direct effect of such a policy, according to Mr Joshua himself, would be to build up a great grog manufactory in Australia. The only reason the manufacture of drink is allowed in most countries is that it is not known very well how to get rid of it ; but with Customs duties all deleterious liquor may, by proper supervision, be debarred. As I say, under the system proposed by the Government, the only result can be to build up a great grog manufactory.",49
286,Mr HUTCHISON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Spirit s may pass the Customs, and be adulterated afterwards.",50
287,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"If so, then the States laws come into force; and that is another argument against the Government proposal. I never was a believer in prohibition, because I believe that the secrecy. and the breaking, of the law which result are more injurious than would be the drink traffic under proper control. In that opinion I am fortified by those who have had experience of the prohibition States of America. At any rate, the results of prohibition have not been what was expected. If the proposals of the Government be adopted, we shall simply throw away £150,000 per annum in revenue, in order to establish a big industry in the manufacture of drink. It seems almost incredible that the Prime Minister, who has prated of temperance, should have the audacity to countenance such a proposal, more especially in view of the fact that only 5 per cent, of the cost of production is expended in wages. In every other industry, I suppose, the cost of wages in proportion to the whole is at least four or five times 5 per cent.",50
288,Mr MAHON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,What about the farmers who grow the grain? Do they not employ labour ?,50
289,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,We all know that the grain on a couple of farms would supply enough starchy materials for the whole output of spirits. Alcohol can be made out of any starchy material.,50
290,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,A much larger proportion of spirits is made out of molasses than out of malt.,50
291,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I quite understand that it is a matter of molasses rather than a matter of grain. Even so, we are spending between £500,00 0 and £600,00 0 in order to have white people engaged in the production of sugar, and, it follows, to encourage the production of grog from molasses. Then, again, I feel sure that the members of the Tariff Commission have not quite seen the full foice of one of their recommendations. Unfortunately, it was not pointed out to them that it is possible to distil off every ether in spirits until there remains an absolute alcohol, which could not make any one drunk.",50
292,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Coul d it not? Does the honourable member say that absolute alcohol will not make any one drunk?,50
293,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I think that, on inquiry, the honourable member will find that it is the ethers in alcohol which have the . rapid effect on the brain. 1 Mr Glynn!-Then pure alcohol must be a good teetotal drink.",50
294,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I would not say that alcohol is quite a teetotal drink.,50
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,How are you to prove it ?,50
296,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I have not really looked into the matter lately; I am speaking from recollection of inquiries and reading many years ago.,50
297,Mr TUDOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Tell the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that pure alcohol is not intoxicating !,50
298,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I have no doubt that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, if he consumed a couple of ounces of alcohol, obtained from the chemist, would walk down the street quite sober. If, however, the honourable member were given an ounce of distilled' spirit, he would tumble into the gutter. All I desire to point out is that, by repeated distillation, spirits may be brought to almost any degree of purity. When a man says that he ca,n tell whether a spirit has been distilled from this or from that, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred he has not the faintest idea of what he is talking about. As a matter of fact, no man can tell the difference.; between brandy and whisky except by the amount of different flavouring matters added to the spirit. I have already adverted to the serious injury that would - accrue to the community if we were to go so far as to absolutely by our legislation bring into existence a big distillery shop in Australia. We should lose that control over the liquor which we have at the present time. It would certainly vjass away from the hands of the Federal Parliament into the hands of the State Parliament. This Parliament would have nothing whatever to do with it the moment it got outside the bond. ' In addition to that, the effect of this proposal brought forward at the present time should be considered. There is practically only one firm of distillers in Australia, and that is Joshua Brothers. They have 600,000 gallons of spirits, and the effect of the proposal giving the local article a preference of 4s. a gallon will be to put ""£120,000 into their pockets. I ask whether any one believes that this Parliament should legislate in such a way as to do that.",50
299,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Is the and learned member referring to brandy or to whiskv ?,51
300,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,All spirits.,51
301,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The difference is 3s., and not 4s.",51
302,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Ver y well; I will accept the right honourable gentleman's cor-, rection, and, instead of £120,000, I will say roughly that the effect would be to put into the pockets of this firm a little over .£100,000. That would be an uncommonly nice Christmas present for this Parliament to make to anybody. I believe that the Tariff Commission made a mistake when they suggested that for two years no spirits should go out of bond. As a matter of fact, processes are now adopted by which by repeated distillations the immaturity of the spirit and other faults can be entirely overcome. tion to that, by forcing a certain amount of oxvgen through the spirit it can be brought to the same condition as it would be in after being twenty years in butts. I was absolutely staggered when I heard the leader of the Labour Party express an opinion in favour of the proposal.",51
303,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,It should apply only to the pot-still spirits.,51
304,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Certainly , but not to the patent-still spirits. If it were to be applied to pot-still spirits I could quite understand it.",51
305,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Eve n with a pot still all the impurities are not got rid of.,51
306,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Of course, it does not get rid of all the vegetable impurities which are not removed by distillation.",51
307,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The object in distilling high-class spirits is to keep the impurities in.,51
308,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Sometime s that is done to meet the case of people who pride themselves on their skill in detecting flavours, but their requirements can be met much more cheaply by the addition of essences.",51
309,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The honourable member is misled by the use of the word ""impure,"" which is used in the strictly chemical sense.",51
310,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The honourable member will find that it is also used in the physiological sense, because, in many cases, these ethers produce very serious effects upon the brain. That is a matter of common knowledge. I do not intend to [97] 753 enter into a disquisition on such a subject just now, but I am sure that if the honourable member will look into the matter he will find that, by making age the test of honourable purity, we are relying upon the chemistry of half a century ago instead of on the chemical knowledge of today. Nothing struck me with greater surprise than to find from the evidence submitted to the Commission that three or four men who undoubtedly knew the facts, and who, if asked the question, would have given the information, never voluntarily supplied the members of the Commission with the information they had. As a matter of fact, they neglected to give the information because none of them were asked questions which would have elicited it. That is why that evidence was not before the Commission.'",51
311,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"If the honourable member says that, he has not read the evidence. Those points were brought out time and again. In addi- Mr CONROY - The Tariff Commission acted on the evidence before them, and could not act on evidence that was not before them. I do not say it offensively, but the members of the Commission did not pretend to be chemists, and to possess expert knowledge of ethyl alcohols.",51
312,Mr JOHNSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Mr Wilkinson, the analyst, saysSo far as scientific knowledge goes, the substances removed in rectification of spirits are more injurious than alcohol itself.",51
313,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I make this point: that at the present time this Parliament is asked to assent to-a measure which will place rthe hands of one distiller a direct profit of from £100,000 to £125,000. That should be done, if done at all, not bymen who will escape punishment because they are going to be rejected by their constituents, but by a House just returned from the people with a mandate to carry out certain things.. There is no escape from the fact that we are being asked to make Joshua Brothers a direct present of the amount stated. I estimated the amount at £120,000,"" being 606,000 gallons at 4s. per gallon. I have accepted the Treasurer's correction that it should be estimated at 3s. per gallon, but I think that it might have been estimated at 4s. per gallon on the class of spirits which Joshua Brothers have. In any case, the amount would be over £100,000, and it is a monstrous thing that such a proposal should be made. It is almost beyond the bounds of credibility that any Parliament could be. so far dead to a sense of what is due to it as to accept a measure brought forward, "" as this has been, by a Minister who runs away on the very first night on which it is before the House. I have no desire to say unkind and nasty things, but, undoubtedly, it would be very much to the interests of the one firm of distillers to have such a proposal agreed' to by this Parliament. And further, the proposal has not been considered as it should have been. ' The only member of the Government who seems to be responsible for it is the Minister who has run away from the discussion to-night. We have had the Prime. Minister getting up and showing how little he knows about it. He told us that the Minister in charge of it had gone away to consider it, but we find that he has actually gone away to discover how the vote of his electors are likely to go at the next election. We are in this dangerous position : that if the honourable gentleman finds out that the votes of the electors of his constituency are likely to be against him he will not care what he does in this House, how he pledges his constituents, or 'how he brings the Ministry into disrepute and contempt. There is no doubt that they will be brought into disrepute and contempt if this proposal is carried through. Sir JOH N FORREST-Is and learned member referring to the Tariff ' Commission or the Government?",51
314,Mr CONROY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"To the Government, who are bringing the measure forward. Are not the members of the Government responsible for their own acts? they think so little about what they do that they put forward this proposal in a light-hearted way? If this moribund House were to accept a proposal which would encourage the creation of a big manufacturing whisky distillery, .and so on, it would not be studying the interests of the community. When we find, moreover, that it would be done at a cost of about £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 . to be extracted from the pockets of other citizens, the proposal is seen to be still more reprehensible. When we find, further, that it would have the effect of putting between £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 and ,£120,000 into the pockets of one set of individuals, then it becomes tinged with suspicion, and we cannot but see that it is the last step which the Parliament ought to take. I cast no reflection upon the big distiller who wishes to carry on his business in that way. If the Excise duty and the import dutywere exactly the same, I would have no more objection to him than 1 would to any other citizen carrying on the business. In fact, if I had to make a choice between the two, provided that the quality was the same, I should accept the local article as against the imported article, merely because my prejudice^- I do not say my reason-happene d to run in that way. If this Parliament adopted such a proposal then, so far from blaming the particular firm to whom it had made a large grant, I should wish that I had even one-h'alf 6f the money. It must be perfectly understood that we make no reflection upon the members of this firm - I do not think I have ever seen themin their private capacity as citizens. It is only when a man comes along and says, "" I am entitled to some help as against other citizens'' that I object. The moment he says to me, "" I ought to have some privileges which are not accorded to others,"" I object. The moment he says, "" You have a right to guarantee me the interest on my money,"" I say, "" If that is so, other citizens have a right to get guaranteed work. If you make any profit it shall be distributed amongst the other citizens."" Other citizens, if they have the power, have the right to take from him in exactly the same measure as he would take from' th'em if he had the power. the honourable I so strongly object to any one citizen or class of citizens being fostered at the expense of any other class that I oppose this proposal in toio. There is another matter, of course, to be considered, and that is, that the high duty proposed would Do lead to a serious loss of revenue. If that loss were to bring about a diminution of - drinking, I should perhaps not abject. But when the decrease of revenue would not bring about a decrease of drinking, but would establish grog factories, of which,, as his votes seem to show, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, seems to be so much in favour, it is an entirely reprehensible proposal. We ought not to be asked to depart from the principle which we established when we fixed thedifference between the import duty and theExcise duty at such a rate that we practical! v said, "" We shall have all the grog that is sent into consumption under our control.""' Of course, we lose control of the grog immediately the duty has been paid; but there are a hundred-and-one different: ways of getting over that difficulty. When the grog is imported, the quantity in the cask can be gauged, and the amount to be paid can be estimated. But if it were distilled here we should never be able to estimate or discover what the leakage was. Moreover, it would be the means of traincise duty was more? ing scores of men in the art of distilling, and it would encourage in other ways the growth of sly-grog shops throughout Australia. Because if the industry were profitable those trained men would want to start on their qwn account. the honourable member for Melbourne Ports now perceives the dangerous which he has placed himself; that he will recognise that this is not a matter over, and that if he really believes in those principles of temperance which he so often advocated on the platform, he take care by his vote not to set them aside. During the last four or five years we had a fairly large difference between the import duty and the Excise duty-to o large a difference in my opinion-and no explanation can gloss over the fact that the proposal of the Government, if adopted, would increase the difference so greatly _ that it would practically bring into existence places for the manufacture of grog, and there in the distillery ? grog only. If its acceptance would attended with that result, then it is a deit parture from previous legislation. Under £ 1 2 5 , 0 0 0 . any circumstances-goo d or bad-the very last House to deal with a question of this sort where the direct result would be put so much money into the hands of dividuals, and to create a big grog is one which is in the last hours of existence. If , in the last session Parliament, we were to pass such promembers posalswe should never know where we were, and the danger would be that every succeeding Parliament, just as pened in America, when men thought they were not going to present themselves for re-election, or believed that they likely to be defeated, they would vote any measure, however dishonest it might be, which happened to be brought forposals ward. The acceptance of the proposal fore the Committee would, in, my opinion,' seriously jeopardize the standing which Parliament has obtained in the eyes of community. It would be impossible explain to the people-in fact, nobody could explain why it had agreed to £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 into the pockets of one distillers.",52

That was a perfectly legitimate statement, seeing that he asked for the imposition of the duty recommended by a section of the Commission merely to protect the revenue. The Government did not commit itself to the proposal when brought forward, but promised further consideration, and, if necessary, amendment. But the honourable gentleman told us that, having given consideration to the recommendations of the Commission in. regard to alterations of the spirit duties, the Ministry had decided to introduce proposals which' differed from those of the Commission.

347,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"That may be. I hope that the Treasurer will demonstrate it . Then, again, it is rather extraordinary that we should be asked to delay our decision until the Minister of Trade and Customs has had time to consider certain matters which are likely to cause him to alter his opinion, and that then the Minister should go right' awa^ and apparently abandon all consideration of the question. With regard' to distillation generally, I am rather in favour of the policy of New Zealand, which has abandoned local distillation. It was recognised that the amount of labour employed in the industry was exceedingly ""small, and that not .one penny more was paid for agricultural produce in consequence of local distillers carrying on business. The prices of products such as wheat and barley were ruled by the rates prevailing in outside markets, which were equivalent to those offered for grain for local distillation purposes. . It'was realized further, that imported. spirits were the source of such a large 'amount of revenue, that it was not desirable to interfere with them, and it was also feltthat the extra revenue that might be obtained from the duties on imported spirits, were there no distillation, could be applied in such a manner as to confer greater advantage upon the communitv than would be derived from the small amount of employment that might be afforded by the distilling in I realise dustry. I regard the matter in very much che same light, but I ' d o not propose to go deeply into it now, because I recognise that we are dealing with a proposal to increase the import duties, and that the question to which I have been referring is conelecnected more directly with the Excise duties. The Minister of Trade and Customs claimed that if the import duties were increased by is. per gallon, no loss of revenue would result.. He pointed out leader is not that under his present proposals-w e do not know what they will be eventuallythere will be the same difference between the Excise and import duties as under the proposals of the Commission.",55
348,Mr MCCAY,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The Government do not themselves know what shape the proposals will eventuallytake; they wish to obtain a few hints as to what honourable members desire.,55
349,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"It looks very much like that. The Government are, in effect, saying, to honourable members, "" Gentlemen, tell us ..your opinions, and we shall decide when we have ascertained the feeling of the majority."" The Minister of Trade and Customs maintains that the proposed increased import duties would not result in any reduction of the revenue. I would point out, however, that if the oincieased import duty lead to a larger consumption of locally manufactured spirit, there must be a loss of revenue. Although, under the Minister's proposal, the same proportion is preserved between import and Excise duties as under the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, the latter stops short at the present level, so far as the"" import duties are concerned. Apparently, the Commission considered that if they increased the duties upon imported spirits, a reduction, of the revenue would ensue. The Minister's conclusion cannot be supported,because the increase of the import duties to 15s - per gallon may so reduce the profit of those who sell, spirits, and who say that they are now very heavily handicapped, and have gone as far as they can, that there will be a far heavier run upon locally produced spirit. Consequently, the revenue might be much more reduced under th» Minister's proposal than under that of the Commission. I admit that it is difficult to arrive at a conclusion in this connection; but I would point out that the right honourable member for Balaclava, who was one of the most reliable Treasurers that Victoria ever had, did not, after his experience of the 15s. per gallon duty that was levied in Victoria, share the opinion of the Minister of Trade and Customs. Although the revenue did not increase when the duty was reduced to 12s., it maintained about the same level.",55
350,Mr HUME COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The honourable ber must recollect that the times were bad.,56
351,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"That maymission have had something to do with the result. I have looked at the; figures, and I find that, although under the 12s. per gallon considerations. duty the revenue did not increase, there must have been a larger consumption of imand ported spirits, because the revenue was maintained at practically the same level. - Sir JOHN FORREST - The Victorian duof ties were increased by 25 per cent - fro m framing their recommendations. 12 per cent, to 15 per cent.",56

Although the figures in. my' possession do not show that a much larger revenue was .produced, by the duty of 12s. per gallon, they do show that there must have been a larger consumption of imported spirits, otherwise the 12s. per gallon duty could not have produced practically the same amount of revenue as was collected under the 15s. per gallon rate. .' Sir JOHN FORREST - We propose an increase of only 7, per cent.",56
353,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"It is not the increased consumption that we have to consider, but how far the Government can absorb the profit to an extent which can be withstood by those engaged in the trade. If it be absorbed we may be sure that they will not cease to sell spirit, but that they will be forced to sell a cheaper article. That would have the effect of reducing the revenue, even if Excise were paid upon it. The Barton Government, of which several members of the present Ministry were members, deliberately resisted a proposal to increase ' the duty upon imported spirits to 15s. per gallon. The reason which, they urged for their action, was that such a high duty must lead to a reduced consumption of imported spirits, and consequently to loss of revenue. The present Government have abandoned the position which was taken up by a previous Administration,, of which a number of Ministers were members. Now, I come to the Tariff Commission. I feel very disinclined to dissent from the de- . cision of that body, which has taken a vast amount of evidence all over Australia, and which has given the matter the fullest and most careful consideration. In this connection we must recollect that the Commission was composed of members of opposite fiscal views, . and, seeing that they have memarrived at a unanimous decision, I am very reluctant to disturb their recommendations. I recognise that upon that Comwere-members who would give full attention to the possible financial effect of their recommendations, as well as to other I realise also that they were not of one way of thinking fiscally, consequently were not all biassed in one direction. It is evident from their reports, too, that they had the health and well-being the community in mind when they were ' Under these circumstances-unles s ""the Minister can show that the Commission was absolutely wrong, and that he is right-*-I am very reluctant to depart from its finding.",56
354,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The members of the Commission were not bound to take into consideration . the effect of their recommendations upon the revenue.,56
355,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I am perfectly sure that they did take that matter into consideration.,56
356,Sir JOHN FORREST,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"It ought to have been included in their commission, but it was not.",56
357,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Does the Treasurer mean to tell me that sensible members of this House who were appointed to the Tariff Commission simply dealt with the matter as children would deal with, it; and not as experienced members of Parliament? Does he mean to imply that they said, "" We will do this and that,"" without considering the effect of their recommendations upon the revenue?",56
358,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I do not think that it was any part of their duty to consider it .,56
359,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"If the honourable member had been appointed to a Commission of that character, would he 1 --whe n it was dealing with matters affecting the finances of the States and the Commonwealth-hav e absolutely failed to take into consideration the effect of its recommendations upon the revenue?",56
360,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I think that I should always have been looking to that, but I say that the matter was not delegated to the members of the Commission.",57
361,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Would not the honourable member himself have taken it into consideration?,57
362,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I think that I would.,57
363,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Certainl y he would. I give the same credit to those honourable members of this Committee who were members of the Tariff Commission. Other members of that body might not have deemed it necessary to give the. matter the same amount of consideration, but I am perfectly certain that those who have to deal with our Estimates and with our Ways and Means made no recommendation without first considering what would be its effect upon the revenue. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has shown by his speech today, that that aspect of the question was considered. I should now like to say a few words in reference to the amendment of the honourable member for Bland regarding the Customs duties upon imported spirits. I fear that he submitted his amendment with too little consideration, and that if it be enforced at once a most serious position will arise. He practically proposes that no spirits shall be admitted into the Commonwealth unless they have been matured in wood for two years. It is ridiculous to spring a surprise of that sort upon a trade which Parliament has had under its control for years. If the amendment were adopted, what would happen? A quantitv of spirits are now in bond-no t in wood, but in bottle. A large quantity are upon the sea in bottle, and a large quantity have been ordered in bottle. How can these spirits be matured in wood for two years? The Prime Minister, I think, will recognise the difficulty to which I refer. If he sees any difference between my reading of the amendment and his own, he might inform me of it. My reading of the proposal of the honourable member for Bland is that spirits must be matured in wood for two years before they are permitted to pav the import duty. How can such a proposal be applied to bottled spirit which is in bond, orupon the sea, or which has already been ordered ?",57
364,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,That is merely a. temtion to do that. porary difficulty. It will only continue for two years.,57
365,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I am pointing out that the amendment of the honourable member for Bland, , if enforced immediately, would create most serious anomalies, and bring about a most - improper state of things.",57
366,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I called attention to that matter when I addressed the Committee. I am now asking the honourable member if he can foresee any difficulty after the period of two years has elapsed?,57
367,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I do not see any difficulty in giving effect to the proposal then.,57
368,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,O r if it is necessary?,57
369,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Or necessary. L shall refer to that in regard to rectified spirits at a later stage. In the absence of proper notice, the proposal of the honourable member for Bland would practically lead to the confiscation of the spirits to which I have referred. In reply to an interjection which I made whilst the honourable member was speaking, he stated that the spirits to which I have alluded could be kept in bond for two years. Has the honourable member any idea of the cost of keeping anything, and especially volatile articles such as spiritswhich diminish by evaporation-in bond for two years? The cost would be so exceedingly heavy as to amount practically to the confiscation of a large proportion of really the 'goods frompeople whp had done no wrong, but who, on the contrary, had been importing their spirits for years under a different Government system, and surely ought to receive due notice before any alteration in that system is made.",57
370,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Why should they any more than the implement manufacturers, receive notice of an increase of duty ?",57
371,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I am referring only to notice of the departure from what has hitherto been the practice. An attempt is to be made to cause importers to do that which is impossible, by providing that spirits shall have been matured in wood for two years before duty is paid upon them. Spirits might come out in cases and might have been matured for four or five years, but no satisfactory evidence of that could be given to the Department, and consequently a great deal of their value would be forfeited.",57
372,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,There would be no inten,57
373,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The honourable member for Bland replied, in answer to an interjection, that the spirits could be kept in wood in bond for two years.",57
374,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Rubbis h ! Did the honourable member mean to say that they should be taken out of the bottles and put into wood?,58
375,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I do not know. But as I have said, the keeping of spirits in bond for two years would be a very costly proceeding, and, before we required that to be done, we should give due notice to those Concerned. Another reason why we should be very careful in adopting this proposal, both in regard to spirits that are the subject of import and of Excise duties, is that if it were at once rigidly inforced, the revenue would go down very rapidly, since there would not be sufficient spirit available which could be shown to have been matured in wood two years.",58
376,Mr HUME COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,ther e is such spirit.,58
377,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I do not know of any quantity.,58
378,Mr HUME COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"There are 600,000 gallons.",58
379,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"What are stopping 600,000 gallons as compared with our nual consumption.",58
380,Mr HUME COOK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,But the figures I have mentioned relate to only one firm.,58
381,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"That may from be, but. the other spirit to which reference ment. has been made is not that which is generally consumed.",58
382,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,A chemical would be to produce on the spirit the same effect that which maturing in bond for two years would have.,58
383,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"But the that Minister would not allow such a chemical to be used. We need to look at this posal very carefully, and to consider whence we should obtain the stock necesmature.' sary to supply the wants of the community. If proof were at once required that spirit, whether Australian or imported, been in wood for two years, that proof would not be forthcoming.",58
384,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Does the honourable member think that notice ought to be given of the proposed two years' limitation?,58
385,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"If the to change is made, notice ought to be given so as to avoidcomplications which would be improperly injurious to those who have been engaged in this business for vears.",58
386,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I think it was intended by the Commission that notice should be given.,58
387,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I am referring to the proposal of the honourable member for Bland, that the motion should be amended by the insertion of a provision that spirits shall have bee.ro in wood for two years before duty is paid.",58
388,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I understand that he made that proposal because the Government were not prepared with a definite proposition.,58
389,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,We are awaiting definite proposals by the Government.,58
390,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,In what respect?,58
391,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"In regard to both the import and Excise duties. Whatever may be the intentions of the honourable member for Bland, his amendment, in the bald form in which it is proposed, would practically be wrongfully injurious to a large number of traders. It would almost be impossible to carry it out without largely the supply of spirits, and conseanquently reducing, the revenue to a very serious extent.",58
392,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Provided that notice were, given, the proposal would be no innovation the stand-point of a Customs Depart",58
393,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Quite so. There is another point worthy of consideraused tion. I do not profess to know whether as rectified spirit is more wholesome than is a spirit containing ethers; but it has been stated by scientific men of high standing the - former, whether it be w'orse or better than that produced from the potprostill, does not improve by maturing.",58
394,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"That , in fact, it dees not",58
395,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"That is - all so. I saw a communication addressed to had the honourable and learned member for Angas, which he has, perhaps, put before the Committee, and in which it is stated that rectified spirit actually deteriorates bybeing kept. I know nothing as to the correctness of that statement; but, according high scientific authorities, a rectified spirit cannot be further matured.' On the other hand, it is said that the maturing of spirit containing ethers is necessary, since some it would be injurious if used soon after leaving the pot-still.",58
396,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,In commerce there is no absolutely rectified spirit. It is an exceedingly difficult matter even for chemists to get an absolutely rectified spirit. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - I am not putting any dogmas before the Committee.,59
397,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The so-called rectified spirit is only partially rectified.,59
398,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Otherwis e there would be no flavour. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - Flavour s are often introduced to satisfy the wants of the man who desires brandy or whisky. High scientific authorities say that, whether the effect of rectified spirit, as compared with pot-still spirit, be i l does not improve by maturing.",59
399,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"-Practica l experience contradicts that. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - I cannot say anything in regard to that point, but Ministers, who have the departmental experts to advise them, should consider the question, and decide whether each of these spirits should be treated in the same way. I have already said that I prefer the duty of 14s. proposed by the Tariff Commission to the duty of 15 s. proposed by the Ministry. I have that preference largely because I am informed, by the best authorities I can consult-includin g the honourable member for Balaclava, some members of the Barton Ministry who refused to raise the duty when asked to do so, and also the Tariff Commission-that a duty of 14s. is more favourable as regards revenue than 15s., and will lead to a less use of, I shall not say inferior spirit, but, at any rate, of the cheaper spirit, which has not realized the same revenue as has the imported article.",59
400,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Boothby) [9.51] I cannot help feeling that the Government appear to be treating this business in a somewhat slip-shod manner. When we are dealing with Tariff reform, surely we are entitled to the presence of the Minister of Trade and Customs, if it is at all possible for him to be here. The difficulty is that, in the absence of the Minister for Trade and Customs, we are not able to get defi nite proposals from the Government.",59
401,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,We are discussing a definite proposal now.,59
402,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"That may be so, but I am not quite sure about it , so far as concerns anything I have heard this afternoon from the Government. Are we to take it that this duty of 15s. is a definite proposal ? Tariff - [14 AUGUST, 1906.] 1 Tariff - 2761",59
403,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Yes .,59
404,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,That clears away a difficulty; but I think that we are entitled to have some data as to what the effect such a duty may have on the revenue. We should not be left to mere guess-work.,59
405,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I can give the honourable member the information.,59
406,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,And I think we ought to have it. What is the use of our having an abstract discussion ? .,59

409,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The amendment of the honourable member for Bland is scarcely being discussed at all ; the main discussion is on the question of whether there should be an increase of the duty from 14s. to 15s.,59
410,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,But the amendment of the honourable member for Bland comes first.,59
411,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The Prime Minister must admit that the amendment of the honourable member for Bland has not been discussed, but that, on the contrary, there has been a general discussion.",59
412,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The question was about to be put when the honourable member for Bland submitted his amendment.,59
413,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,There is something in that. I think the honourable member for Bland may withdraw his amendment.,59

416,The CHAIRMAN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I may point out that when proposals of this nature are submitted in Committee of Ways and Means, the usual custom is to have a general discussion on the first item, and afterwards to deal with special items.

429,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I cannot say offhand what was the effect of lowering the duty and raising the Excise in South Australia. That is one of the matters in regard to which the Government should furnish information.,60
430,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The result was to stop the 1 manufacture of whisky.,60
431,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"But it seems that proposed. in the wine industry there has been a considerable increase. Whether that is due to the alteration of duties, is a matter of opinion; and I do not feel disposed to enter into a general discussion until we have some data before us, and the Government submit definite proposals.",60
432,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [9-57]--We are unwittingly, it appears to me, drifting into acomplex position. We were discussing, first of all, the general proposal to impose a duty of 15s. instead of a duty of 14s.\ Apparently, that discussion was closed, for the question was about to be put when the honourable member for Bland, assuming the general discussion to have terminated, or, at all events, in the exercise of his undoubted right, submitted his amendment. That amendment must be disposed of before we can reach the question whether cr not a duty of 15s. shall be imposed. I think it will be admitted that the question whether the duty shall be 14s. or 15 s. or 13s. has nothing to do with this proposal as to the time which shall be allowed for the maturing of imported spirits, in order that the same restrictions may be imposed in this connection as are intended by the Tariff Commission, and by the Government to apply to spirit manufactured in Australia. ° Mr KELLY - The Chairman has allowed a general discussion.",60
433,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"And , perhaps, quite rightly. But, at the same time, when I am asked to enter into the question of revenue, while we are confronted with the amendment of the honourable member for Bland, it appears to me that we shall only increase rather than diminish the confusion.

That is the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, and if the honourable member - for Bland can see his way to put his years amendment in that form, which proposed to be adopted in the Bill , T shall be perfectly prepared to accept i here.

If we adopt this amendment as affecting imports, we must retain it also as regards the Excise provisions, which prescribe, not only that pot-still, but rectified, spirit must be' matured for two years. Is it clear .that we should make that provision in regard to rectified spirit at all? If the amendment of the honourable member for Bland be carried, it will apply, not only to pot-still whisky or brandy, which requires maturation in order to eliminate certain volatile oils"", which in the pot-still process pass over into the distillate, but it will also apply to rectified spirit, the rectification of which is supposed to get rid of those oils, so far as they can be got rid of, for commercial purposes, and to secure a silent spirit, which, of course, is never really secured in the sense in which it is regarded by chemists. The morning after these resolutions were introduced, it was pointed out to me that there was not in all Australia a rectified spirit two years old.

The effect of the amendment will be that before a spirit is put on the market for consumption, whether it be pot-still spirit or a blend of whisky, brandy, gin, or anything else, it must have matured for two years. The application of the principle is not to come into effect until after a period of two years has elapsed, and whether from the date of shipment, or the passing of the resolutions does not matter. A strong opinion has been expressed to me, not only by letter, but also personally by men who seem to know their business, to the effect that it is not necessary to mature anything except the 25 per cent, element, and that rectified spirit does not improve, and in some cases really deteriorates, by keeping. I am informed that gin actually deteriorates by being (kept in wood, because it absorbs some of the tanic acid from the wood, and is also discoloured by it. For that reason, in South Australia they do not keep gin in and wood, but in some sort of metal tanks. I have no wish to trespass on the time of honourable members by reading a letter 1 on this point from a man who can speak with authority, seeing that he has been engaged in the distillation of brandy, whisky, and liqueurs for many years, and whose testimony is borne out by Excise officers. I have tested this matter, not merely by the information of persons who might seem to be interested, but of officials connected with the Government, and they bear out what is stated by my correspondent. I shall read a short extract from the letter, as it puts the matter very clearly.",62
471,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,That relates to the Excise.,62
472,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,To the provision in the Excise as regards maturing for two vears. t and on the point that that provision should apply only to pot-still spirits.,62
473,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,We are not on that point.,62
474,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,I beg the Prime Minister's pardon. As a complement of what we are proposing to do now Ave must retain the provision already in the Excise portion.,62
475,Mr DEAKIN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,We are not bound to retain it as applied to reatified spirit if we are satisfied as to the wisdom of the opinion the honourable and learned member is about to quote.,62
476,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I propose to quote an extract which bears upon this particular matter. I understand that the honourable member for 'Bland very properly desired that whatever provision we make regarding Excise should be imposed upon the importation of spirit. The writer of this letter says The present Tariff regulations prescribe that such rectified spirit shall be at least two years old, but as there is no spirit of such age obtainable in the Commonwealth, and as very few distillers have blended more than six months ahead, it can be seen at once that the sale of pure South Australian grape brandy has been stopped. The object of ageing spirits has a clear and distinct reason. When spirits are distilled on the pot stiii from either wine or malt, various volatile oils are passed over into the distillate"". During the period of maturation in wood these oils are gradually oxidized and converted into fragrant ethers. The spirituous portion itself, we desire to emphasize, does not materially change during that period. Attempts have been made at various times to place on the market - a pure pot still brandy, but owing to the excessive quantity of ethers it is distinctly unpalatable, and has had to be withdrawn. In order to make the flavour of the brandy more harmonious it is blended with certain proportions of pwe rectified grape spirit in the manner already indicated - Notwithstandin g what the honourable memI t is an indisputable scientific fact that a highly rectified grape spirit does not change or alter its chemical properties by ageing, and we believe we are correct in saying.that it has not been deemed necessary by the authorities of other countries to make this proviso in their regulations. The South Australian distillers aTe unanimous in their opinion that pot still spirit should be aged in wood for a period of two years before entering into consumption, but they are also strongly of opinion that no possible benefit could be derived from applying this proviso to rectified spirit. We have ourselves been manufacturers of liqueurs and bitters for over fifty years, and as a matter of fact Seppeltsfield has been built up on the foundations laid down by these two lines. . Pure rectified grape spirit enters very largely into their manufacture, and the two years' proviso has, we aTe afraid, also effectively stopped this branch of industry. Under the old tariff we were able to clear our spirit at ns. per proof gallon, but unless such spirit is now two years old it will have to pay a duty of 40s. per proof gallon, which of course is out of the question, more so as similar, imported goods will be able to enter at 15s. per proof gallon, and put the local product out of the market. Pure neutral rectified spirit is a regular of commerce. It is largely used by druggists, and has moreover a widespread application. To store such spirit for a .period of two years in wood completely discolours it, and as a considerable quantity of tannic acid is absorbed it becomes useless for such purposes. That is the effect of the letter, and it is written by a man who ought to speak with authority oni this question.",63
477,Mr DAVID THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Who is the writer ?,63
478,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Mr Seppelt, who, I suppose, has one of the best distilleries in the Commonwealth.",63
479,Mr DAVID THOMSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Why did he not give evidence?,63
480,Sir JOHN QJUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"He did not, give evidence.",63
481,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The Commission professed to act.upon a letter from his firm, which is an appendix to the evidence.",63
482,Sir JOHN QUICK,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Yes , a letter, but not evidence.",63
483,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The letter was misunderstood and misapplied by the Commission. We are told by some honourable members that we must "" bolt "" the recommendations of the Tariff Commission without examination'. What are we here for except to apply our best judgment t® the recommendations'? If we are to . "" bolt "" them whole, we had better go home.",63
484,Mr BRUCE SMITH,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Parkes) [10.15]. ber for Angas has said about some honourable members ""wishing the Committee to "" bolt "" the recommendations of the Tariff Commission whole, I think it is to be deplored that it has allowed itself to d r if t into the present desultory discussion. I do not think that honourable members f u l ly realise where we are. We have just listened to a most complete treatise on the chemistry of distillation, and the honourable member who has made that contribution seems to me to have lost sight of the fact that to-night the Committee is taking a step which may aim a serious blow at Roval Commissions in the future. Honourable members are talking of the Tariff Commission as if it were simply a Select Committee of the House, forgetful of the fact that the question which is being discussed, and into which I do not intend to enter, because I am not competent to discuss its merits, is really one on which the Commission has been sitting for over fifteen months. Why didthe House require this and other questions to be referred, not to a Select Committee, but to a Commission article composed of men who were supposed to have time and inclination to make a-deep study of the questions involved, in the light of an enormous mass of evidence which was to be brought forward?",63
485,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The same thing applies to the Tobacco Monopoly Commission.,64
486,Mr BRUCE SMITH,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"We l l , I should apply the same answer. The members of the Tariff Commission sat for over fifteen months; they sacrificed .their personal convenience, and listened to volumes of evidence from all sides; and the Committee appears to attach so little importance to the judicial aspect of their report that it is now proceeding to d r if t into a debate on one of the very questions which the Commission has settled. And on what testimony is it being asked to upset those conclusions ? On the one-sided testimony of a number of discontented people who had their chance of submitting all the facts, which, if submitted, were duly considered. The Minister puts the Committee in a most humiliating position. When he came forward, what did he say ? With very little ceremony-whic h I think should have received some notice from the Prime Minister-h e moved a motion which involved a stultification of the conclusions at which the Commission had arrived. He actually said that his proposals were at the present time in an undecided form, but he would like the Committee to ""thresh them out."" For what reason? Presumably that he might ascertain what it thought before he put his proposal into a definite form.",64
487,Mr WEBSTER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Not at all.,64
488,Mr BRUCE SMITH,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The honourable member must be absolutely wanting in knowledge of dignitv and the rules of Parliament to say such a thing. « What is a Royal Commission for ?,64

501,The CHAIRMAN,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Order ! I have already called the honourable member to order, and he ought to respect the direction of the Chair.",64
502,Mr BRUC ESMITH,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I do not hope to impress the honourable member; I address myself to those who have had political experience, and recognise with me the great importance of this situation. I am much disappointed that the Prime Minister has shown so little appreciation of the seriousness of the situation as to fail to make a statement of his reasons for departing from the traditions and practices of Parliaments. I do not say that if a Royal Com-"" mission makes a demonstrable blunder, obvious to all, its recommendation should be accepted, but when a Royal Commission has been appointed by the Crown to examine difficult and complex questions, to take evidence on all sides, on oath, and bring up an impartial finding, its conclusions should not be treated in the haphazard and cavalier way in which the Minister for Trade and Customs has dealt with the conclusions of the Tariff Commission. He had not a resolution ready to place before the Committee, and, when it was pointed out to him that we were being called upon to debate something which had not been put into the form of a definite issue, he said, "" We l l, I should like honourable members to thresh the matter out,"" presumably to give him an inkling as to the opinions of the majority, so that he may act accordingly, and so that the Government may float with the tide, instead, possibly, of struggling against it. I do not hesitate to say that if I were in the position of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo as Chairman of the Royal Commission, I should throw up my commission, because of .the contempt with which he and his cola leagues have been treated by the Government. What evidence has the Minister resorted to to show that the Commission misunderstood this question ? I received today, as I suppose every other honourable member did, a copy of a letter addressed to the Minister of Trade and Customs by South Australian Wine Growers'"" Association, beginningIn response to your invitation for suggestions from those interested in respect to the conclusions of the Royal Commission. Those words reveal the existence of a highly reprehensible state of things - After a Royal Commission appointed by the Crown has fully inquired into this subject, the Minister of Trade and Customs-as late as the 24th July last-invite d interested persons to criticise its findings.",64
503,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Why should he not do so?,65
504,Mr BRUCE SMITH,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Surely , the honourable member, if he had been Prime Minister, would not have allowed his Minister of Trade and Customs to invite interested persons to put before the Ministry ex parte statements.",65
505,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Can we have too much light on this subject?,65
506,Mr BRUCE SMITH,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"We can have it at the wrong time. The Commission has dealt judicially with an immense mass of evidence given on oath, and it is not only unfair, but an insult, to the Commission to put aside their conclusions because of ex - parte and unsworn statements of persons who probably gave evidence which was considered of less weight than evidence in support of a contrary view. In its far-reaching consequences the want of appreciation of the dignity of the Commission shown by the Prime Minister and the Government mav be, a very serious matter. If I , or any other honourable member, were now asked to sit upon a Commission, what would be the obvious answer? Would it not be said, "" I might give mv time, and sacrifice my personal interests, for fifteen months, or more, and, having arrived at sound judicial conclusions in regard to an immense bodv of evidence, might then find that a Minister bad invited interested parties, who were disappointed with the findings of the Commission, to send in objections, and on them would be ready to set aside the Commission's recommendations "" ?",65
507,Mr TUDOR,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,That is what we thought in regard to the Shipping Commission.,65
508,Mr BRUCE SMITH,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"There was a great difference qf opinion among the members of the Shipping Commission in regard to almost every point. But the Government wish us to set aside the unanimous recommendations of the Tariff Commissioners, who, protectionists and free-traders the alike, arrived at certain conclusions.  the Commissioners were infallible?",65
509,Mr BRUCE SMITH,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,No .  learned member practically said so.,65
510,Mr BRUCE SMITH,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I have not said,. so, nor is that inference to be drawn from 1 any sentence I have uttered. What I say is,that it would be impossible for honourable members to deal with, in a night or in a week, the evidence which the Commission took on oath from persons of all shades of opinion, and in regard to which they made unanimous recommendations. The Minister proposes to set aside, these recommendations because of the statement of persons who are admittedly interested, and who gave evidence before the Commission. It is as if, after the parties had stated their respective cases on oath in a Court of law, and the jury had given its verdict, one of them had said to the Judge, "" I want you to hear me again, with a view to upset the verdict, because I am dissatisfied with it . "" I hope that the members of the Commission will take the step which. I have suggested, so that the country may realise the seriousness of what is being done. If I were one of them, I should throw up my commission at once, and not file another report. If the Government had a true sense of the constitutional importance of the situation it would refuse to allow the Minister of Trade and Customs to practically tout for objections from interested parties against the conclusions of the Commission, and would accept the recommendations of the body which they were practically the means of appointing, and which has made practically a judicial examination of the whole subject.",65
511,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Wide Bay) [10.30] The advice offered to the members of the Commission by the honourable and learned member for Parkes is no doubt very good, from his point of view; but it must be remembered that a Commission may do manythings that do not come within the scope of its functions. I can find nothing in the shape of an instruction to the Commissioners that they were to take upon themselves the responsibility of the Executive with regard to the probable effect of their recommendations upon the revenue.",65

514,Mr BRUCE SMITH,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,They hear all the - j evidence adduced on both sides.,66
515,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I wish to give the members of the Commission every credit for having undertaken to perform an important public duty at great inconvenience, and perhaps some expense, to themselves. It is well, however, to'remember that one of the ablest of British Prime Ministers stated that when the Government were in a corner, the proper thing for them to do was to appoint a Commission. It was in such an emergency that the Tariff Commission was appointed. The members of that body have worked hard, and have no doubt done their duty to the country faithfully and well, but that has nothing to do with the point to which I wish to direct attention. The commission reads as follows :Whereas it has been represented that the operation of the Customs Tariff of the Commonwealth of Australia has been injurious to certain industries : Know Ye that we do, by these our Letters Patent, appoint you to be Commissioners to inquire into the effect upon lian industries of the said Tariff, and into the working of the said Tariff generally. There is nothing in that to indicate that the Commissioners are to inquire into the effect of their recommendations upon the revenue.",66
516,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The whole commission relates to the revenue incidentally.,66
517,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"The honourable member is not quite correct in saying that. The Commissioners were instructed to inquire into the effect of the Tariff upon Australian industries, and into the working of the Tariff generally.",66
518,Mr BRUCE SMITH,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Then ment should have set the report aside as being ultra vires*,66
519,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I contend that the Commissioners should not take umbrage at the modification of their recommendations by Ministers who - have considerations of revenue to bear in mind. I am sure that not a member of this Committee would say that any recommendation of the Commission, even though the result might be to preserve a certain industry, should be agreed to if it w ould involve a loss of tevehue which we could not afford to incur.",66
520,Mr MCWILLIAMS,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,Does not the honourable member think that the Commission In my should really consider the effect upon the revenue of any alteration proposed by them ?,66
521,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"If I had been a member of the Commission, I venture to say that I should have given some attention to that matter; but I contend that the Commissioners have no power to ""go beyond the powers conferred upon them by the terms of their commission. If it had been intended that the Commission should consider the effect of their proposals upon the revenue, that fact should have been clearly set forth in the reference to the Commission. I am not complaining of the action of the Commissioners, nor can I blame the Government for taking up the position that they cannot afford to lose the amount of revenue that would have to be surrendered if the recommendations of the Commission were adopted. But I agree with the honourable and learned member for Parkes that the Government should have laid before honourable members such facts and figures as would have afforded justification for the action they have taken. On the other hand, I think that if it is demonstrated to the Commissioners that their recommendations, however excellent, would, if carried out, reAustrasult in a loss of revenue which the Commonwealth could not afford to incur, they should not object to their proposals being modified. The fact that a man-is appointed as a member of a Commission does not add to his intelligence or to his ability to conduct public affairs. Mr. JOSEPH COOK\-It adds to his power and his opportunities; that is the main point.",66
522,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"I do not think that any member of the Commission would set himself up as superior to the heads of the public Departments.

I have as keen an appreciation the work of the Tariff Commission as has any honourable member. I recognise the gentlemen comprising that body have being made. made a great number of sacrifices in performing the immense work which they have accomplished. But the value of their labours consists in a very large sure in' the information which they have been able to put before the public through the evidence which has been tendered, and does not rest entirely upon the conclusions at which they have arrived. That is so in regard to all Royal Commissions. Their main object is to get information, and while I confess that much mav occasionally be learned from the demeanour of witnessesi-and that therefore the Commissioners are best able to judge of the conclusions which should be drawn from the testimony of witnesses-still it does not follow that they are right in every case.",67

528,Mr WATSON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The Commission have difference considered this question from every point of view.

In my view it is utterly culous to extend almost the same measure of protection to blended spirits as it proDOsed to extend to spirits which are made from pure .grape wine.,67

When once the Commission has reported, its members have nothing further to do with this question. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo, as Chairman of the Commission, stated in reply to a gentleman who wished to give further evidence in regard to its conclusions that the matter had now passed out of the hands of that body.

The Com. mission recommend that a protection of 4s. per gallon shall be granted to pure brandy, and of 3s. per gallon to blended brandy. The difference between the cost of the materials from which these two classes of spirit are made is so great that the margin between the two rates of duty is, to my mind, insufficient. No doubt, it is a matter upon which there is room for a legitimate difference of opinion.",67

546,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Perth) [10.50] - Al - matter. though I have no desire to be heard too frequently upon this matter, so much has been said regarding the unfortunate Tariff Commission that I am justified in making a few observations in reply. If many members of that Commission had followed their natural inclinations, they would have resigned from it long ago. Probably that would have suited a good many honourable members. Speaking for myself, and, I believe, for many other members of the Commission, I may say that we realized that we had been appointed to perform an important and necessary duty. We realized that an experimental Tariff had been in existence in the Commonwealth for a few years, and that it was highly desirable that an inquiry of a thoroughly exhaustive nature should be made into its effect. Recognising this, I accepted a position on the Commission, and, in spite of the blackguardly attacks made upon it outside the a proHouse, I made up my mind that I would see the work through. That I am determined to do, regardless of what transpires, either inside or outside the House, in the no nature of attacks upon the Commission and work. The honourable and learned member for Parkes has come to the rescue of the Commission in a way that I , for one, appreciate. Although this debate has been in progress for only a few hours, I have heard an insinuation of something very like corruption against the Commission, and I have also heard insinuations of ignorance and incompetence ^gainst its members. cannot help wondering what will be the outcome if this sort of thing is to continue. Probably we shall find the members of the Commission with armoured cars and machine guns to protect them from the outraged opinions of their colleagues in the Chamber. Be that as it may, if the Committee will exercise only a little patience, and listen, to what the members of to the Commission may have to say in reto sponse to Ministerial proposals, we shall be able to fully justify any recommendations that we have made. We are in the position of having little or nothing to which to reply; we are in the the position of having to prove practically a negative. It is the duty of the Governdistillament, who bring down modifications of our proposals, to show the reasons for those modifications, and, in the absence of such reasons, members of the Commission are - naturally handicapped in dealing with this",68
547,Mr FISHER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,And so is every other honourable member.,69
548,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"Undoubtedly; but since the Commission is being put on its defence in this House, this difficulty applies in a greater degree to its members. The honourable and learned member for Parkes referred very properly to the methods of the Minister in obtaining information from sources other than those that were open to the Commission. The honourable member for Wide Bay has also pointed out that it is the duty of Ministers to obtain all information possible with respect to the question of revenue- a phase of this question which could be touched upon only incidentally by the Commission. I agree with that, but I wish to point out that quotations have been made in this Chamber from letters which have apparently influenced the Minister, letters from individuals who had opportunities to give evidence before the Commission, but refrained from doing so. I am going to state why they did not come before us. It is much easier for these people to address to honourable members letters containing more or less mystifying and incorrect statements than tc go before a Commission, which will put them on their oath, and make them responsible for their statements. We have had a good deal of technical instruction from members of the Committee regarding pure and impure spirits, and as to what constitutes genuine brandy, and that which is not genuine.",69
549,Mr HUTCHISON,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,The teetotallers seemto know most about the question.,69
550,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIAN CONTRACT POST,"That is so. I am of opinion that it would have been much better for those who talk about genuine brandy to have said nothing in that connection, so far as the proposals of the Commission are concerned. Those who make genuine Australian brandy are perhaps in a better position, under the recommendation of the Commission, than they will be when the full and fierce li^ht of discussion is thrown on their situation in common with that of the manufacturers of other classes of spirit. We have been told that it is not fair, for instance, to put blended brandy in competition with that which is not blended. A great deal of emphasis has been laid upon the quality of the so called pure Australian brandies. We have been told that much of the spirit required for the fortification of those brandies is highly rectified. Why is that so? The honourable member who gave us that infor[981-2 mation omitted to tell the Committee 'that it was necessary to rectify the fortifying spirit since it is largely produced from "" of f "" - or unsound wine, and that it has to be rectified _ in order to avoid the deleterious effect of the sources of its origin. Then again, it is suggested that the brandy which Australia .produces from the grape is the finest that can be made anywhere. I make bold to say. that there is not a single gallon of Australian brandy distilled according to the methods of that district of France in which the purest and most perfect kinds of brandy are produced; that the method of manufacture is more cr less defective, and that if we are going to insist on a genuine brandy, we shall have to provide, first of all, that no "" of f "" or damaged wine shall be used in its produc-' tion, and that secondly, the proper method of distjllation shall be observed. That method is to employ the old-fashioned potstill similar to that used in the Charente district of France, for producing the highest quality of brandy. If those two points were observed, it might be well worth our while to consider the suggestions of those who wish to protect more completely than at present brandy made from the pure juice of the grape. But . until that is done, I would suggest to those who are asking for more consideration for Australian brandy that they should ask' themselves whether it is worthwhile insisting on conditions which necessarily will have to be amplified if our brandies are to be of the perfect kind indicated by several honourable members. We have been told by honourable members that highly rectified spirit does not require' to be kept in order to mature. But one gentleman interested in distillation by the patent still process- I refer to Mr Joshua - expresse d the opinion, when before the Commission, that even that class of spirit required to be matured; he advocated that it should be kept in bond for not less than two years. That is the evidence of a gentleman interested in the production of this particular class of spirit. It is undoubtedly a very technical and abstract matter. Progress reported.
