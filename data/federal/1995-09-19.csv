2,Mr SNOWDON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (12.32 p.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 serves to make various portfolio amendments to social security and associated legislation. A number of governdisabiliment amendments and a request for an amendment were moved to the bill in the Senate. These related to the following areas: requiring a qualification assessment to be made for either disability support pension or disability wage supplement if a person has been subject to a compensation preclusion decision, has appealed to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal about that decision and has requested the assessment to be made; making some minor technical amendments to the partner allowance qualification provisions; supchanging the commencement dates for those initiatives relating to the qualifying age for the seniors health card and revised income test arrangements for certain under-18-yearold beneficiaries; and the international social security agreement between Australia and Italy. These amendments and the request for an amendment were unanimously supported by the Senate.",11
3,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I think this matter needs some clarification because I had some difficulty following it myself. We dealt with these matters, I thought, substantially on 31 August. But, in fact, on that occasion we dealt with only the request and the other matters mentioned by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). Exactly the same speech was read word for word today. If you read Hansard you will find that the Minister for Communications and the Arts gave the same speech relating to what is called schedule B, which were the amendments that had been passed by the Senate but which we were not asked to concur with at that time. Apparently, after having dealt with the request, which is the only matter we dealt with on the previous occasion, the Senate duly deliberated, concluded its deliberations and now we are dealing with the amendments which were foreshadowed. I do not intend to reiterate the matters that I addressed on 31 August save to draw attention to the fact that my detailed comments can be found on page 943 of Hansard.

4,Mr SNOWDON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (12.35 in the Secretary's p.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. the The Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 provides for the implementation of a number of minor initiatives. A number of government amendments and a request for an amendment were moved to this bill in the Senate. These related to refining a qualification criterion for the sole parent pension, omitting proposed amendments relating to the disclosure of information and changing the commencement date for an initiative relating to the restoration and suspension of fringe benefits to disability support pensioners. These amendments and the request for an amendment were unanimously supported by the Senate. In addition, a number of non-government amendments were successfully moved to the bill. These related to the reviewability of certain decisions of the employment secretary the and the Minister for Social Security; the continuation, variation and termination of determinations, with the result that social security payments will not necessarily cease to be payable even though a person has lost qualification and there will be no period of grace for maximum payment rate debts; and making a notice issued by the Minister for Social Security specifying a class of debts that may be waived, a disallowable instrument, and making that notice effective only after the expiration of the disallowance period. Although the government did not support these amendments in the Senate, it will not press that opposition.",13
5,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Berowra) (12.37 p.m.)We are following the same procedure in relation to the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 as we did in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995. In relation to this matter, my comments on the detailed matters raised by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) can be found at page 944 of Hansard. I do not intend to reiterate them, save to say that the minister on that occasion did give an assurance on behalf of the government in relation to certain guidelines, which I welcomed at that time. I draw attention to that because we do put great weight upon those matters being dealt with in the way that was outlined and agreed between the government and the opposition. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 September, on motion by Mr Johns: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Reith had moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the provisions of the bill and whilst recognising that this bill provides some improvement to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, the House is of the opinion that, even as amended, the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act remain a disincentive to job creation, that they impose a very heavy burden on business, particularly on small business, and that they were enacted without proper prior consultation"" .",14
6,Mr WILLIAMS,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 was introduced into this House on 29 June. That has some significance, which I will come to later. The bill proposes changes to six acts but primarily to the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The most significant provisions of the bill would amend the unfair dismissal provisions of that act. The bill provides that an employee's application for relief under the unfair dismissal provisions is to be heard first by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission rather than by the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, as is presently the case. The explanatory memorandum states that an application to the Industrial Relations Commission will be treated as an attempt to settle the matter by conciliation between the employer and the employee. Secondly, the bill would allow the Industrial Relations Commission to undertake so called 'consent' arbitration in relation to termination of employment matters with the agreement of the parties. Subject to a right of appeal, the decision made by the Industrial Relations Commission in consent arbitration will be binding on the parties. The only currently available means of redress before the commission for a claim of unfair dismissal is a process of non-binding conciliation. BILL 1995 Thirdly, the bill requires the Industrial Relations Court to decline to deal with an unfair dismissal claim if the court is satisfied that the former employee has access to. an alternative remedy under another law which satisfies the requirements of the International Labour Organisation's convention No. 158 on the termination of employment. There is a body of law as to the meaning of 'adequate alternative remedy' in the context of the existing provision in the Industrial Relations Act. I will say more about this aspect of the bill in a moment. The bill will also require the Industrial Relations Court to consider all the circumstances in each case in determining whether a remedy for unfair dismissal should be granted and what form that remedy, if any, should take. Although an employer may have followed a technically defective procedure when ending the former employee's employment, the employer may have had a very good reason of substance for dismissing the employee. As the explanatory memorandum shows, this provision is a recognition by the government of the idiocy of the existing law which gives an employee a remedy for such a technically unlawful dismissal. Other less controversial changes contained in the bill will amend the Defence Act 1903, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and the Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection Act 1977. The latter will redefine 'waterside workers' as 'stevedoring employees'. The also contains proposed changes increasing the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations mission in relation to coal industry matters. The two aspects of the bill that I will address relate to the Industrial Relations Court I said: and the changes to the unfair dismissal proviThis sions of the Industrial Relations Act. I quesGovernment tion the need for a separate Industrial Relawhole tions Court. This is not the first time that I have done so. When the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993 was passing through the parliament in November 1993 I contributed the second reading debate. A key aspect the 1993 reform bill was the creation of the Industrial Relations Court of reform bill eliminated the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia in industrial matsystem ters and transferred those matters to the system Industrial Relations Court. The coalition opposed this for several entertain reasons: first, the government failed to demthe onstrate any need at all to set up the new court; secondly, the establishment of specialist courts operating in narrow fields is undesirGovernment able; and, thirdly, the new court results in publicly unnecessary additional cost to taxpayers. In ed. 1956, in the Boilermakers case, the High potential Court limited the ability of bodies constituted other than by federal judges to judicial questions or exercise As a result, the judicial functions of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, as it then If was, were transferred to the Commonwealth Industrial Court. The Commonwealth Indusregarded trial Court later became the Australian trial Court. In 1976 the Federal Court of Australia was established with a general division and a structured specialist industrial division. With the estaboperation lishment of the Federal Court, the jurisdiction pose. of the Australian Industrial Court was transferred to the industrial division. The Federal Court's jurisdiction in federal industrial matters continued following the enactment of the Industrial Relations Act in 1988. When, in November 1993, I opposed the creation of the Industrial Relations Court I drew the attention of this House to the government's complete silence in regard' to explaining the need for the establishment of bill this new court. The government provided no rationale in either the second reading speech Comor the explanatory memorandum that accompanied the reform bill, and nothing was offered in the subsequent debate. At the time silence is really quite extraordinary. The is proposing, in effect, to abolish a division of the Federal Court and create a new federal judicial body. It has not bothered to say why it is proposing to do that. I went on to explain why the government to should have, and should give, a good reason of for removing jurisdiction from the Federal Court and giving it to a new Industrial RelaAustralia. The tions Court. I said: The courts are one of the three branches of our of government. Insulation of the judicial from arbitrary executive or legislative whim is vital in securing the integrity of our courts. For that reason alone, the Parliament should refuse to elimination of significant jurisdiction of Federal Court tantamount to an abolition of an entire division of the court without a detailed explanation as to why. It may well be that the has reasons which it believes justify this change. If so, it should advance those reasons so that they can be scrutinised and debatWithout any reasons being offered, there is the for a perception of an improper motive, and a perception of impropriety can be as subverdetermine sive as impropriety itself. judicial power. I went on to say: the concern is about the content of laws applied in the industrial area, the focus of attention should obviously be those laws. We do not reform laws as inappropriate by changing the court Induswhich administers them. As I said at the time: . .. it is inappropriate that a judicial body be in such a way that its membership or its should advance a particular social purI also explained that, in relation to specialist courts generally, the objection is that they develop a limited range of expertise and they tend to have input from a limited range of persons. Because of their constant association with that small range or persons and that limited range of subjects, specialist courts develop a limited outlook that a court of broader jurisdiction does not suffer from. On a more pragmatic level, there is the question of cost. As I said in 1993, it is difficult to see how the court could be set up without significant expense. I was also concerned about provision being made for unfair dismissal cases to be heard not by a judge but by a judicial registrar. They can undertake most of the routine work of the court. Their decisions are, however, subject to review by a judge. In other words, their decisions are not final. In practical terms, this means that if a party does not like the result before a judicial registrar the party can, subject to certain procedural limitations, have another bite at the cherry. This is a waste of Commonwealth resources and is discriminatory . It is a right not accorded to any other litigant bringing or defending what is, on proper analysis, a common law claim. It is also expensive for the party who may have to defend the same hearing twice. There are alternative, better solutions. The Commonwealth could have created a court at the intermediate level, the level of the county and district courts in the state jurisdictions, or at the level below-such as a federal magistrate's court. Those courts could hear applications and make non-reviewable decisions, having the authority of a judge. There need not, of course, be a court created solely for dealing with industrial matters. There is a range of federal matters that could be dealt with in the intermediate courts or federal magistrate's court. Alternatively-and this would be much simpler-the Commonwealth could invest intermediate courts in state jurisdiction or state magistrate's courts with federal jurisdiction to hear the applications. Better still, one might ask: why create the federal jurisdiction in the first place when there already exists state jurisdiction? The coalition was not alone in questioning the need for an Industrial Relations Court. The authors of Labour Law, Professor Breen Creighton and Associate Professor Andrew Stewart, wrote in the 1994 edition of their book: That said, it is not at all clear that the creation of the [Industrial Court] will serve any useful purpose. If the principal rationale for establishing a separate court was that it could be comprised of persons with a particular expertise in the industrial relations arena, then it is hard to see that the new court enjoys any significant advantage over the former Industrial Division . . . It is tempting to conclude, therefore, that the creation of the court was largely a matter of political expediency rather than legal or industrial necessity. Presently, the Industrial Relations Court is comprised of 10 judges, including the Chief Justice, Justice Murray Wilcox. All the members of the court hold concurrent commissions on the Federal Court of Australia and regularly participate in its work. Registries are in some cases shared between the Federal Court and the Industrial Relations Court. In light of that, there is little difference between the Industrial Relations Court so constituted and the Federal Court sitting in its industrial division. In the absence of real differences in relation to personnel and facilities, one may query again the need for the expensive and unexplained change in the first place. As to the cost of the Industrial Relations Court, the court in 1994-95 employed the equivalent of 52 full-time staff. According to the 1995-96 budget papers, this will increase to 86 during the present financial year. The court's running and associated costs for 199495 were just over $10 million. These will increase to slightly under $12 million in the current financial year. There have not been comparable savings in the running and associated costs for the Federal Court for 1994 as against 1993-94. In fact, the costs of that court increased by approximately $2 million. In consequence, it can be seen that the taxpayer has borne a significant burden-a burden that will continue each year that the Industrial Relations Court exists. If there .is any difference between the jurisdiction formerly exercised by the Federal Court's industrial division and that now exercised by the Industrial Relations Court, it is in the unfair dismissals area. The effect is that the government has burdened taxpayers with annual expenditure of more than $10 million in creating a new superior court in order to deal with unfair dismissal cases. But those cases are not and should not ordinarily be dealt with by a superior court in any event. Under this bill, those cases will now go in the first instance to the Industrial Relations Commission. The government really seems to have no idea what it is doing in relation to the Industrial Relations Court. I also want to comment on the amendments proposed in relation to unfair dismissals. As I said earlier, with this bill the government requiring a body hearing an application for reinstatement or compensation in the event of an unfair dismissal to have regard to 'all the circumstances of the case' when deciding whether an employer had a valid reason under the Industrial Relations Act for dismissing an employee. The intention appears to be to oblige the Industrial Relations Commission and the Industrial Relations Court to put more weight on the overall merits of each particular case. This may help to tip the scales which are weighted heavily towards the employee back towards the employer a little. As the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) said in his second reading speech: ... there should not be any guarantee of a remedy where the only defect in the employer's conduct has been some failure to provide procedural fairness and the employee's conduct warrants dismissal. The bill proposes that the Industrial Relations Court decline to deal with an application for relief from an unfair dismissal if the former employee has access to a suitable alternative remedy under a law of the Commonwealth, state or territory which satisfies the requirements of articles 4 to 11 of the ILa Convention on the Termination of Employment. If the court is compelled to decline to deal with an application, the effect is that the employee must seek a remedy available under the relevant state system. Under the existing federal law, the Industrial Relations Court must decline to deal with an application for reinstatement or compensation in respect of a termination of employment when there is alternative machinery which satisfies the ILa convention. So if there is any defect in the state machinery, the Industrial Relations Court may hear the application and is not obliged to leave it to the alternative state body. In his second reading speech the assistant minister said that the government alw-ys intended that dismissed employees use state remedies rather than federal provisions when the state remedies provide satisfactory protection against unfair dismissals. The assistant minister admitted that the legislation has operated 'more strictly than anticipated so that only state laws which virtually replicate the federal legislation could be treated as adis equate alternative remedies'. The government says that under the bill a state will be able to give effect to the ILa convention in its own way. In other words, the government's intention is that a state system that provided less than the federal Industrial Relations Act in terms of employee entitlements may be adequate, as long as it meets the requirements of convention 158. It is not clear that the government's proposals for amendments in this area can achieve that aim or will implement that intention. The latest doubt has arisen since this bill was introduced on 29 June this year. It arises from the decision of the IndustriCll Relations Court in the case of Willcocks v. Makfren Holdings Pty Ltd, which was handed down on 22 August 1995. In that case, His Honour Justice Lee found that Western Australia's dismissal laws failed to provide an adequate remedy because they fell short of the protections required by convention 158, but it appears that His Honour's statement of the requirements of the convention means that very few, if any, of the state systems would be adequate. If it is to satisfy ILa convention 158, according to the decision in the Willcocks case, the state system must impose a requirement on the employer to exercise procedural fairness. That means an employer would be prohibited from dismissing an employee without giving an employee an opportunity to defend allegations made against him or her. State industrial relations commissions would lose the right to overlook minor breaches of procedural fairness in cases where a worker clearly deserved to lose his or her job. This is in contrast to the stated intention to operate at the federal level behind the provisions of this bill. Secondly, the Willcocks decision identifies as a requirement of article 9 of the convention that the employer must bear the burden of proving that there was a valid reason for terminating the employee's employment. On that basis, it will not be enough for the employer to show that there is a ground on which the commission could find that the dismissal was justified. The effect of the Willcocks case may be that the states are required to give employees even greater protection than exists under the federal system. Unless a state complies with the strict Willcocks requirements, no unfair dismissal case will be heard under that state's system; all will be heard in the federal arena. Ironically, the provisions of this bill introduce measures falling short of the Willcocks interpretation of the ILO convention requirements. If the Willcocks decision is not successfully appealed against, the government's amendments to the unfair dismissal laws may be unworkable. At the least, they may have unintended consequences. This should be enough to make the government rethink its attempt to reform the federal unfair dismissal laws. Certainly, when in government, the coalition will give a priority to ensuring that the laws are practical, realistic and provide equity to all parties. This bill is yet another example of the difference between this government and the next.",14
7,Mr BRADFORD,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT," Mr Speaker, I certainly want to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) to the motion that the Industrial Relations and other Legislation A rnendment Bill be read a second time, particularly that part that reads: . . . the House is of the opinion that, even as amended, the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act remain a disincentive to job creation, that they impose a very heavy burden on business, particularly on small business, and t-ey were enacted without proper prior consultation. As has been observed consistently by this side in this debate, this legislation was originally, and as it is now to be amended, a payback to the unions for their efforts in the 1993 election. To the extent that it has been a payback, it demonstrates as obviously today as at any other time what a great disservice those particular activities were to the Australian people. For instance, we read today of a report from Access Economics that indicates that the total tax burden on workers is greater now than it was 10 years ago when the then Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), unveiled his historic tax reform package. So the activities of the unions in support of the government back in 1993, for which this legislation is a simple payback, have certainly turned out not to be in the interests of Australians, certainly not those that the Australian Labor Party would claim particularly to represent in this place. In his second reading speech on this legislation the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) claimed that the changes proposed in this latest bill 'will make a good system better'. That is quite an extraordinary claim for the assistant minister to make because these changes have come about in response to the fact that the original legislation was not working and was having a serious impact on business and the willingness of business to employ people at a time of huge unemployment. If anything, the minister should have said, and we would concede, that this legislation makes a bad system marginally better, because that is about all it does. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has a real credibility problem, not only in respect of his handling of this matter but in respect of just about every other matter that he handles. Of course, he is one of the Labor Party mates, and there is something unique about mateship in the New South Wales right faction of the ALP. The minister's defence of the Prime Minister at the weekend once again goes to show how far that this sort of mateship will go. He was quoted in the weekend papers as saying what enormous admiration he has for the leadership that the Prime Minister has given. The minister claims that the amendments have been widely welcomed by leading business groups, including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the MTIA. I got access to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's comments on unfair dismissal in Australia and, particularly, their discussion paper. One has only to read the first paragraph to realise how capable this minister is of overstating things or gilding the lily. The very first paragraph says that this bill will be a big step towards developing a fair and balanced unfair dismissal regime although 'important changes which ACCI has sought have not yet been addressed'. The minister claimed in the second reading speech that that represents a welcoming of this legislation by the ACCI and other business groups. It clearly does not, at least not in the fulsome terms that the minister claims of it. In fact, if you go to the conclusion of this paper by the ACCI, the very last paragraph says: Perhapsthat is the word that you need to underlinewith the more co-operative approach shown with the introduction of these proposed amendments, steps can be taken towards the gradual introduction of a harmonised industrial relations system based on joint federal and State legislation. So the minister cannot claim he has the support-and I assure the House that he does not have--of the business community as a whole for either his original legislation or what now is a marginal improvement on that original bad legislation. In fact, I would venture to suggest that the business community, for obvious reasons, is still strongly opposed to this sort of legislation. It is absolutely counterproductive as far as the business community is concerned. Only yesterday we read that Australia, apparently, is the world' s richest banana republic. What that report demonstrated for us all was the gap we have in this country for which this government has no answer; that is, the huge gap between potential and performance. It was thi., issue which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) asked the Prime Minister a question about in parliament yesterday. He referred the Prime Minister to the report of the World Bank, which showed that Australia is an extremely rich and fortunate nation through its endowment of natural resources, and to the Standard and Poor's warning on Australia's unfavourable current account deficit and runaway foreign debt. Both these reports highlight the gulf between our nation's potential and the reality of the government's failed record. Of course, the Prime Minister was not able to answer the question. But the question must be obvious when we read the headlines in yesterday's paper that Australia now, according to the latest study, by some measure is the wealthiest country in the world and, at the same time, we try to reconcile that with the fact that we have huge problems with our current account deficit, our runaway debt and so on. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to a number of statistics which proved that point. There is in this country a great gap between potential and performance. In dealing with this industrial relations legislation we have part of the answer to that disparity. Australia's industrial relations system is one of the major reasons for that disparity between potential and performance. If it is not evident now, history will show clearly that the union controlled ALP has sought consistently to give greater priority to its own interests than to the interests of Australia as a whole. In time the Labor Party, with its activities controlled and funded as they are by its union mates, will be shown to have acted against Australia's interest. As I have alluded to, they already have been when, in the 1993 election, the government prevented a tax reform package which, now in terms of the information before us today, clearly was the direction to go. As we have repeated in this place on many occasions, it was the direction that the Prime Minister, as Treasurer, wanted to go back in in 1985. He was right then. We were right in 1993, but for blatant political ends and means that opportunity we had back in 1993 was defeated. We are now stuck, as we see today, with a tax system that not only is outmoded but is disadvantaging the very people whom the Labor Party claims to be able to assist. Only a month or so back, on 15 August, we commemorated VPNJ Day with Australia Remembers. It seems quite ironic to me, when we consider what went on back in those war years, that it was a great Labor Prime Minister in John Curtin who saw Australia through those dark war years to victory, but over the past 12 years it has been a Labor government which has consistently surrendered our economic sovereignty. That is represented by the very huge and runaway foreign debt we now experience. The close and often incestuous relationship between the unions and the Labor Party was clearly spelt out recently in a paper by the IPA called the 'IPA Backgrounder', which was produced by Des Moore. The Minister for Industrial Relations has probably seen this document, although I do not think that he would like for one minute what it has to say. In the context of this debate about industrial relations legislation, what Des Moore points out in this paper ought to go on the record because I do not know whether the Australian people as a whole are completely aware of the closeness of the relationship between the ALP and the unions. The result of that relationship is that it is only a matter of how high the government jumps when Mr Kelty and the ACTU say 'jump'. Mr Moore points out in this paper that the features of the relationship between the Labor Party and the union movement include: A strong, often decisive, influence on Government policies, one important effect of which is to prevent or delay economic reform. Grants by the Federal Government to the union movement of $92 million over the terms of the Hawke and Keating Governments, and now running at around $16 million per year. The tax-free status not only of contributions to unionswhich is consistent with employer organisationsbut also of income from property owned by unions In total, taxpayers could now be underwriting, in various ways, activities of the union movement to the tune of $130-$140 million per year. He also points out: Financial and other assistance provided to the Labor Party by the union movement. Appointments of unionists to government bodies which, on the face of things, exceed those that are justified. If people wonder about the unfair dismissal legislation, the original one and the now marginally improved versions, there is the answer. They do not have to look much further than that. It is a payback not only for what happened back in 1993 but for the unions generally because they simply call the tune to which this government dances. That is the reason that we are dealing with this legislation-as counterproductive as it is for employment prospects for Australians, particularly young Australians. It is actually worse than that because the financial assistance given by this government to unions is a two-way street. In 1992-93 the unions received $14 million from the government. However, unions donated $2.2 million to the ALP's re-election campaign plus the amount of help, which I have already outlined, they gave the ALP in kind in the leadup to the election. As that IPA backgrounder shows, there is a very high correlation between the unions that donate to the ALP and the unions that receive grants in either the year of the election donation or the preceding year. The backgrounder concludes-this must be fairly obvious to anyone who is listening-that the Labor government pays money to the unions and the unions pay money to the Labor Party. That is a very cosy arrangement. It is taxpayers' money that is doing this circle: there are grants to the unions and donations to the Labor Party. For that cosy arrangement to continue the government has to deliver. The legislation before us is simply part of the process of delivering what the unions expect of this government. The ACTU, the peak union body, spent $1.3 million on its own election campaign against the coalition in 1993 but, surprisingly, the ACTU received $1.2 million in federal government grants. The government was very generous to the ACTU. I am not suggesting that this was illegal. The real concern ought to be the fact that it was legal and could happen. I am sure most people listening to this debate would say that such a practice should not occur. Hopefully it will be one of the first laws changed by a coalition government. In today's industrial relations environment-anyone who has had some hands-on experience in the workplace will understand this, but obviously the Labor Party, comprised here largely by ex-trade unionists, will not relate to the truth of it-trade unions have largely outlived their usefulness in the Australian economy. They do not like to think that is the case, but it is a fact and it is a that is proven by the statistics. Only 26 per cent of the private work force sector chooses to belong to a union. I use the word 'chooses' very loosely because there are plenty of instances where people are still coerced, if not forced, into joining unions. I think that union activities have largely proved to be counterproductive, but unions do not give up easily and many of the traditional union tactics made an art form by the former BLF are still stock weapons. For instance, the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia, led by one Jack Morell, has recently been touting for business in my electorate on the Gold Coast, and not by doing what one might expect-that is, selling its services to potential members and demonstrating that it has something to offer. No, doing that would be too hard and it would be legitimate for a union to go about that sort of activity. This union has been operating in my electorate by intimidation, blackmail and extortion-tactics which in the past have often been very successful. The Minister for Industrial Relations is in the chamber. I will not have time to do so, but had I the time. I would read on to the record letters received from two constituent companies, which are happy to be named. The first is called Combat Clothing Australia Pty Ltd. In its dealings with the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union there was absolutely disgraceful intimidation of a non-union work force. It was a case of unions trying to do deals on the side with an employer which effectively amounted to blackmail. The second company I refer to is Heat Wheat Products Australia. I am sure the minister does not want to hear this, but any one of us on this side of the House will be able to recount countless activities of unions along these lines. I received a long letter from this small business called Heat Wheat Products. I will not read it all, but close to the last paragraph it states: We find this situation totally unacceptable. Why should we, as an honest employer, have to defend ourselves againstthese activities of unions... Why should we have to pay to have ourselves fact defended when we have done nothing wrong. Why should we be intimidated by a union that is not wanted and not required and comes onto our property causing problems with our staff. I believe it is illegal for a union to insist on compulsory involvement, and yet this is happening to so many people at this time. And of course it is. It is aided and abetted by the sort of legislation we are dealing with today. It is aided and abetted by the fact that we now have a Labor government in Queensland which is prepared to stand by and allow the unions to act in this way, which is against the best interests of the small businesses in my electorate but, more than that, against the best interests of the people who work for those small businesses. I deplore that sort of activity. This legislation arose ultimately because of Australia's ratification of ILO convention 158. Once again, this particular international obligation was entered into without proper consultation, without public input and without debate in parliament. Our rush to do so was clearly unwise but typical, because the thrust of ILO 158 was obviously music to the Labor Party's ears. However, what needs to be pointed out is that today only five of the 22 countries which ratified that particular convention are members of the OECD, and they do not include the United States, Japan, Germany, Canada or the United Kingdom. What we have effectively done for the sake of this cosy relationship between the Labor Party and the unions is place ourselves under a further competitive disadvantage in the international arena. Why would we do this when we already have a huge problem with our international competitiveness, as is evidenced with our balance of payments? The only answer to that is to keep the unions happy. The government wants to attack the related unemployment problem from absolutely the wrong direction. That is why the government is so hamstrung by the present system. It is really a straitjacket for the government in that it has to resort to all these subsidised jobs programs which the other minister in the House, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), is partly responsible for and which are only bandaids and the primary purpose of which is to hide the government's failure to provide real jobs. I will only concede that this legislation is a small or marginal improvement to bad legislation. (Time expired)",18
8,Mr BRERETON,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (1.17 p.m.)-I think it is fair to say that the opposition's contributions in this debate have been absolutely riddled with factual errors, none more so than the contribution made by the member for Flinders (Mr Reith). I might just take a few moments-I will not delay the House overly long-to highlight some of the most blatant of those errors. During the debate the member for Flinders claimed that the Industrial Relations Court had ordered an employer to pay compensation to a funeral worker who had cremated the wrong body-a pretty serious allegation to make in respect of the workings of the court. I am informed that that claim is absolutely wrong, absolutely incorrect. The court found that the employee had followed the established procedure and that it was the manager of the funeral parlour who was most responsible for what could only be termed a very unfortunate occurrence-not the worker but the manager of the funeral parlour. Of course, the blatant errors did not stop there. The member for Flinders went on to claim that an employee had obtained a remedy under the Industrial Relations Act 1988 after being dismissed for theft from his employer, despite being convicted of that theft. I am advised that this again is wrong, factually incorrect. I am advised that there is no such federal case whatsoever. However, there have been cases where employers have alleged theft but have been unable to prove it-and that is a very different matter. There have been cases where dismissal has been upheld because there was a conviction or, indeed, upheld even without a conviction where there were suspicious circumstances for which an employee was unable to account but for which he or she was responsible. That is the reality of it-not as was portrayed here in the House by the honourable member. There are no cases, I am informed, under the Industrial Relations Act where a dismissal has been overturned despite a relevant conviction-none at all. But, of course, none of that deters the honourable member for Flinders because he has repeatedly asserted that there are such cases. Indeed, it was only on 19 April this year that he actually issued a press release making the claim about a case involving Pacific Power, the electricity commission of New South Wales. He made that claim despite the fact that the electricity commission case was a decision of the New South Wale"" Industrial Relations Commission-not a decision made by a federal tribunal, not a body acting under federal legislation at all, but a decision made by a New South Wales tribunal under New South Wales law. It just happened to be made at the time the Fahey government was in office and made in accordance with the Fahey government's laws. Yet, according to that press release on 19 April 1995, that is the fault of the federal industrial relations system. Looking at the performance of the honourable member for Flinders, one can only ask when he is going to stop making the same mistakes. Perhaps he should come into the House and actually name the federal case. I tell you that, if he is not prepared to, he ought to apologise for misleading everyone with these repeated incorrect assertions. If I can comment on the amendments proposed to the legislation by the opposition to this second reading, it is fair to say that, while the honourable member for Flinders acknowledges that the bill improves the unfair dismissal provisions, he goes on to say, quite misleadingly, that the unfair dismissal provisions remain a disincentive to job creation. Mr Bradford-Of course they do.",22
9,Mr BRERETON,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I will come to this. He says, secondly, that they impose a very heavy burden on business, particularly on small business; and, thirdly, that they were enacted without proper consultation. Dealing with the first of those, the claimed disincentive to job creation, the opposition's reaction to the extension of protection for employees right from the very start has been to talk up a scare campaign to scare the daylights out of employers in respect of these matters. Let me make it absolutely clear: these mischievous claims that they have repeatedly made about the provisions are far more likely to deter employers than any of the actual provisions in the act. The opposition's claims have been overwhelmingly misleading. In fact, it was the opposition who claimed that there is no defence for employers faced with frivolous applications-no defence. They have said this again and again; it has been repeatedly asserted by them. But the reality is that the court can award costs against a party who brings a vexatious claim or who brings a claim without reasonable cause. In fact, the court has used that power available to them and awarded costs in those circumstances. This is a matter of fact, not fiction. The unfair dismissal provisions have certainly not stopped employment growth in our country. That is borne out by the July 1995 unemployment rate, down to 8.2 per cent, the lowest it has been for 4Y2 years. One and a bit years into the operations of the Industrial Relations Reform Act, it is the lowest rate of unemployment for 4Yz years. In that year to July 1995, 307,800 new jobs were created307,800! I might say, 12,000 more jobs than in the year to July 1994. So it cannot be claimed that it stopped employment growth. On the contrary, employment growth has continued to gather pace. The opposition have claimed that the unfair dismissal provisions are driving employers only to engage part-time or casual employees. But analysing the figures shows that 210,700, or the great majority, 68 per cent, of the jobs created in the year to July 1995 were full time. That in itself is an improvement on the year to July 1994 when 57 per cent, 169,400, of the jobs created were full-time positions. So a greater percentage of full-time jobs has been created out of the record jobs growth while the Industrial Relations Reform Act has been operating. When you analyse what is happening with employment in Australia you see the absolute lie in what has been suggested by the opposition. Part-time employment has actually been growing since 1978. Part-time employment is no new phenomenon. More and more workers have opted for part-time employment as they seek more flexible working hours. There is no better indication of that than the survey in December 1994 which indicated that over 75 per cent of part-time workers do not want to work more hours. That is the wish of the workers. So you cannot say that part-time employment has been caused by the unfair dismissal provisions. There is no substance in that assertion at all. It is true that the unfair dismissal provisions do put certain burdens on employers who wish to dismiss employees. There is no doubt about that and we are proud that those burdens are there. We say that that burden is entirely commensurate with the importance of the decision to the employee. You never hear a murmur from the opposition about the rights of employees-not a murmur. Mr Bradford-They've got a job.",23
10,Mr BRERETON,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"No, this is when they lose their job in circumstances where it is alleged that they have been unfairly dismissed. I have never in my time in this parliament heard a single word uttered by anyone on the opposition benches about the proper rights and decent protections for workers in those circumstances-never a murmur. But let me return to the issue of the burden. It is not a new burden and it is not one that can be solely attributable to federal legislation, as you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, through your wide experience in the field of industrial relations. This is a matter that has to an extent been protection afforded under federal awards for many years. But the real difficulty has been enforcing award provisions on unfair dismissal. That has been a constitutional impediment to such enforcement. This is a burden that has applied for years under the relevant state legislation across the length and breadth of Australia except in Victoria where, of course, the Kennett government most unfairly abolished these protections-a move which has seen more than 300,000 workers transfer from the state system to the protection of the federal umbrella. The burden is not particularly large for small business either, as has been asserted by the opposition. The standards required under the legislation, particularly that key requirement-that termination not be harsh, not be unjust, not be unreasonable-are certainly adaptable to the circumstances of the individual's employment. The amendments that are now before the House reinforce that there need not be a remedy in the absence of substantive injustice. We are making that very clear. So it is not an unrealistic burden for small business by any means. The second matter put forward by the honourable member was his claim of the lack of proper prior consultation. I point out to the House that the consultation process that led to the presentation of the Industrial Relations Reform Act was absolutely exhaustive. It went on for the best part of a year. It ill becomes the opposition to talk about a lack of consultation, because it was the opposition who themselves rejected-and they went to great lengths to express this view when the legislation was being prepared and debatedthe concept of unfair dismissal as being any sort of a proper subject for federal legislation. That is what they have always expressed as their view. Their comments certainly did not affect the government's resolve to provide proper protection for Australian workers. On this point, it is worth remembering that, as late as 14 August this year, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) pledged that the coalition would throw out the existing provisions relating to unfair dismissals. This is where they are coming from. The fact is that the government has continued to listen to all responsible employer organisations just as we have listened to the ACTO. We have done so continuously since the introduction of the legislation. That does not sound like insufficient consultation; on the contrary. Let me say here today that we will always continue to listen and bring forward any changes that from time to time we consider appropriate in the light of unfolding events. There has been no lack of enthusiasm for bringing forward appropriate amendments where we see the need for them. I will deal very briefly with the other reactions to the government's amendments. These unfair dismissal amendments, contrary to what the opposition would assert here in the chamber, have been most warmly welcomed by the community. I will point out a few of the supportive comments that have been made for the amendments. I will start with Mr Ian Spicer, who is the chief executive officer of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He said when the changes were announced that he expected 'the system will now work in a more balanced fashion causing far fewer problems for industry'. There is praise from Ian Spicer. He also went on to say that the changes 'should address most problems with regard to unfair dismissals'. This is the nicest thing that ACCI have ever said about the government. For them, this is a glowing endorsement. Of course, the opposition would never own up to this. ACCI went on in its review. It was not just a burst on a hot afternoon. They stated that they as an organisation-I will use their words-were 'delighted' with the changes in that the government-wait for it-'should be commended for its decision'. How is that for a rap. It is true that the opposition has been beating up on ACCI for daring to be so praiseworthy of me and the government. ACCI is now saying that it would really like to see a few more changes. Even so, it is welcoming all of the changes that this bill makes. It is not just ACC!. Bert Evans, a man who has the widest respect from all participants in the industrial relations system-he is the executive officer of the Metal Trades Industry Association-is on the record as saying that the changes will result in a simpler, effective and less legalistic system. That is exactly what ACCI have been campaigning triennial for and what Bert Evans and the Metal Trades Industry Association put forward to government in their very constructive submischanges sion as part of the preparation of Accord Mark VIII. With endorsements from Ian Spicer, ACCI and the MTIA, what more can I say today. equitable There is a very strong basis for the governa ment to reject as most misleading and as inaccurate the comments that have been put forward by the opposition during this debate. I will conclude by commending the bill to House and indicate the government's oppositransitional tion to the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Flinders during the year. second reading stage. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmaeducation tive. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Brereton) read a third time. NA (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 28 June. Second Reading",23
11,Mr FREE,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (1.35 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 to provide an appropriation of $83,636,000 for the 1996 calendar year. The act appropriates funding for the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program through which the ComThis monwealth provides supplementary funding to state and territory governments, non-go vernin chief ment school systems and education institutions, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education consultative bodies to advance more the education of indigenous people. Funding under the act is appropriated on a calendar year basis, with the current triennium due to finish at the end of 1995. the The government intends to make major to the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program from January 1997, with a new funding triennium to commence at that time. Those changes will provide for a more basis for the distribution of funds on per capita basis and new accountability very arrangements that focus on achieving improved educational outcomes for indigenous people. To allow time to implement these the substantial changes, 1996 will be used as a period. Funding at existing levels is therefore required for the 1996 calendar This bill is an important element of the government's long-term strategy to improve opportunities and outcomes for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. It is therefore timely to review that strategy. In 1989, under Commonwealth leadership, the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy was agreed by all governments. It provides a shared framework to the year 2001 for collaborative strategies to achieve equity of educational opportunity and outcomes for indigenous people. Many factors contribute to educational disadvantage for indigenous people. Education systems may not adequately accommodate students' cultural backgrounds. People in remote communities can have limited access to quality educational facilities and teachers. Many indigenous children have special learning needs because English is not their first language. Poverty limits the ability of many indigenous people to participate in education. In late 1993 the Commonwealth appointed an independent reference group to examine the effectiveness of strategies developed in the first triennium of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples reported late 1994 that there had been broadly based improvements in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education since the policy was implemented. For example, between 1989 and 1993 the percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students staying on to year 12 at school increased from 14 per cent to about 33 per cent. During the same period, the number of indigenous people attending university doubled. However, the national review also found that, despite these encouraging improvements, indigenous people remain the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. From preschool to higher education, Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders participate and attain significantly less in education than the rest of the community. For example, at primary school level, three times as many indigenous students have literacy and numeracy problems as do other primary students. Although the proportion of indigenous students studying to year 12 has, as I have indicated, increased significantly in recent years, it is still less than half the rate for Australian students as a whole. Such continuing disadvantage is unacceptable and requires action from all governments. This government has taken the lead to accelerate efforts to achieve educational equity for indigenous people. Sponsored by the Commonwealth, the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs agreed in November 1994 to establish a task force to develop a national strategy to improve indigenous education outcomes. This task force will make its final report to state, territory Commonwealth ministers later this year on the proposed strategy, which will include action on those national review recommendations that are directed to state and territory governments. I am pleased to report that, at the May 1995 ministerial council meeting, state and territory ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the goals to the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy ;md acknowledged the need for more effurl 10 achieve equity in educational outcomes for indigenous Australia)!:; hy the tum of the century. My colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean, has already arranged bilateral discussions with each state and territory to translate this acknowledgment of need into increased practical effort. Once specific financial arrangements have been agreed, the Commonwealth will formally respond to the national review. The Commonwealth has already foreshadowed in the recent budget its willingness to increase substantially its funding support over the next four years as part of its response to the national review, contjngent upon states and territories also increasing their effort. That extra Commonwealth funding would be directed to priority areas across the range of programs through which this government fulfils its commitments to indigenous education. Abstudy provides means-tested income support and other financial assistance to enable students to complete secondary education and progress to tertiary education. In 1994 Commonwealth funding of $114 million assisted some 44,000 students. The Aboriginal education direct assistance program provides tutorial and vocational guidance support for, and encourages parental involvement in, students' education. Indigenous students needing special assistance can be individually tutored or attend centres that provide assistance in completing homework assignments. School-based parent committees are supported to participate in educational decision making and to undertake activities that encourage indigenous students to engage in schooling. The program also funds activiand ties to help indigenous students make informed choices about future education and career options. Over $49 million has been appropriated for this program in 1995-96. Support funding for higher education institutions contributes to strategies to increase indigenous people's tertiary education participation and attainment. Over $14V2 million was provided for this purpose in 1994. The Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, or AESIP, which is funded by this act, assists education providers to meet the specific needs of indigenous students at the institutional level. It supports initiatives such as the development of culturally appropriate curricula and the employment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education workers who provide a supportive role model for indigenous students and act as a link between the family, the community and the school. Over $83 million is provided by the Commonwealth for this program each year. As I indicated at the outset of my remarks, this bill provides for the continued operation of AESIP during the 1996 transitional year. Further legislation will be introduced next year to implement ,the changes to the program for the 1997-1999 triennium that are being developed as part of the Commonwealth's response to the national review. This bill also transfers $0.54 million per year from I July 1995 from this appropriation to the Department of Communications and the Arts to part-fund the establishment of the National Institute of Indigenous Performing Arts Training. This honours a commitment in the 1994 Creative Nation statement to the preservation and promotion of indigenous cultures. As funding for the new institute is being provided from July of this year, the AESIP appropriation for 1995 is reduced by $0.27 million. I commend the bill to the House of Representatives.",25
12,Mr RONALDSON,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1995. Let there be no doubt that the coalition fully supports funding the education of Aboriginal Australians and, as such, the coalition supports the bill before the House. That is not to say, however, that the coalition does not have justified concerns regarding the legislation. The coalition firmly believes that the reconciliation process needs education as a fundamental base, otherwise it will fail to achieve the aims of reconciling indigenous and non-indigenous Australia. Let me also reaffirm the coalition's belief that education is fundamental to relieving the social disadvantages experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. What must be kept in mind is that education is often part of a much larger picture which involves health, housing and, importantly, employment opportunities. This bill is part of the government's overall national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, AEP, which commenced in 1990. This program has now been running for five years. The amendments proposed by this bill relate to funding of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, AESIP, referred to earlier by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free). This program provides funds to organisations and institutions to supplement the cost of delivering educational services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The main amendment of this bill will increase the appropriation for the funding period 1 January 1996 to 30 June 1997 from $0.256 million to $83.636 million. For the second triennium of funding, the Commonwealth nominated three national priorities. The first of these includes responding to the relevant recommendations of the royal commission into black deaths in custody, which includes increased employment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education workers from 1993 and an expansion of preschool services from 1994. The government also nominated implementing the national Aboriginal languages and literacy strategy as a national priority for the second triennium. The AEP components of the strategy include the Aboriginal literacy strategy, which provides an intensification of efforts to improve English literacy among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander school children and adults with limited experience at school. It also includes the Aboriginal languages education strategy, which aims to promote and facilitate the teaching of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages in school, develop bilingual education programs and will move towards the teaching of Aboriginal languages in TAPE and higher education. The third national priority nominated by the Commonwealth for funding in the second triennium was the implementation of the national reconciliation and schooling strategy. This strategy aims to develop appropriate and consistent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander curriculum studies for all schools from preschool to year 12, develop consistent teacher education courses, establish a sister school scheme and promote a greater understanding by students of their local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and its history. The passage of this bill provides us with an opportunity to continue funding in this area at present levels, while the debate provides us with an opportunity to reflect on the government's record in this area and what achievements they have made, given the amount of money which has been allocated. At about this time last year, when speaking on the 1994 appropriation for the mentioned programs under this bill, my colleague the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) made it very clear that there is a need for quantitative performance indicators, given the amount of money expended in this area. In fact, this bill provides for the allocation of $83.636 million. The coalition still believes that what is more import-nt than the amount of money being spent IS the results that this expenditure yields. It is Labor Party philosophy through and through to allocate enormous sums of money to a problem and hope that that alone will solve it. Labor is not interested in results; it is only interested in the processes. Labor is not interested in the ends; it is only interested in the means. It should be a cause of great concern for all members of this House that still the educational standards of Aboriginal people are not rising in proportion to the amount of money being allocated to them. Where there have been improvements, they - re welcomed and encouraged by the oppositIOn. But unfortunately they are few and far between. Given the government's announced allocation of $135.9 million in this year's budget for Aboriginal education, the results should be there for all to see. A recent survey conducted by the ABS of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders presents a statistical summary of the current situation regarding the education and training of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This survey reveals some startling statistics. The survey found that school participation rates declined significantly with age. For 14-yearolds the participation rate was 98 per cent, while for 17-year-olds this rate had fallen to 31 per cent. To be fair, the survey also found that 86 per cent of parents surveyed were happy with their children's education, 84 per cent were made to feel welcome at their children's school and 39 per cent were involved in the decision making at the school while 85 per cent of students aged 13 and over-that is, those still in the education system---re happy with the education they were receIvmg. Unfortunately, the good news ends there. The level of post-educational attainment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is at an appallingly low level. Only 17 per cent of those surveyed had obtained a postschool education qualification. It should be of deep concern that only seven per cent had obtained the year 12 school certificate with only 29 per cent obtaining the year 10 school certificate. The survey also showed that 48 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people only attained a level of education below year 10 or did not have any formal education-that is nearly 50 per cent. When we look at the post-school qualifications, we find that the results are not much better. Of that 17 per cent I referred to, 26 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had attained basic vocational qualifications while 24 per cent held skilled vocational qualifications. It is nothing short of disgraceful that only 13 per cent of those surveyed held diplomas, six per cent held bachelor degrees and only one per cent held postgraduate qualifications. Only one per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people hold postgraduate qualifications. This, unfortunately, is the state of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education in Australia. . There is no need for these figures to read lIke they do when one considers that almost over $10 billion has been spent over the last 20 years to improve the standards of education of Aboriginal people in Australia. After five years of the AEP and the AESIP, this bill provides an appropriate time to reflect on its stated aims and achieved outcomes. In 1988 the Commonwealth established an Aboriginal education policy task force to develop a comprehensive long-term approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. The task force found that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. The task force stated: Australians take it for granted, as an inalienable right of citizens in this country, that their children will receive at least 10 years of education, as well as the benefits of early childhood education. However, these fundamental rights have not been extended to all Aboriginal families. The task force went on to say: Moreover, access to and participation in education for Aborigines beyond the age of 15, whether in senior secondary school, technical and further education or higher education, remains at unacceptably low levels generally. The response to the task force was the establishment of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, AEP, which has underpinning it the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program. This is the program for which funding is provided in this bill. The purpose of the AEP was designed to address the education needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students as revealed by the task force. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training stated his firm belief to the House on 23 August last year: The Commonwealth remains committed to the AEP, which addresses the inequality of educational opportunities and outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Aboriginal people. The figures I quoted earlier clearly show that this is not the case. After more than five years of the program, the original conclusions drawn by the task force are as relevant in 1995 as they were in 1988, despite the rhetoric and despite the allocation of considerable expenditure. In 1993 the Commonwealth government commenced a national review of its program for the education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In short, the review group concluded that since the joint policy had been in effect for five years it was a suitable time to, and I quote from the final report: . . . reflect on whether or not it has been successful in improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's involvement in, access to, participation in, and outcomes from, education. Obviously there was a view at the time that the program was not achieving their aims. One voice of concern was that of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who made no secret of his concerns about the government's approach to Aboriginal education. In an address to the Australian Medical Association in March of last year, seven months before the review of the program was released, the minister pleaded: I want the Ross Frees and Simon Creans of this world to put Aboriginal education up there in lights, to fight for people's basic right to an education. And again I come back to that access and equity principle. Obviously, the minister was convinced that the government was not doing enough in this area and that achievements were minimal. In October of 1994 the review found that, happily, the education experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had improved over the last five years-and, might I say, so they should have. However, the report was quick to note that the government had failed to address the inequality of opportunities and outcomes in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education. It stated: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities are not achieving equitable outcomes-culturally, economically or politicallyfrom their education. The figures I have cited earlier from the Australian Bureau of Statistics are a clear reflection of this failure. Despite finding that educational experiences had improved for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the past five years, the conclusion drawn by the review report in October of last year was not much different from those drawn by the task force in 1988, which concluded: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People remain the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. The National Review of Education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples concluded in 1994: Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait islanders continue to be the most educationally disadvantaged groups in Australia. I repeat: in 1994 it was found that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders continued to be the most educationally disadvantaged groups in Australia. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), in his former capacity as Minister for Employment, Education and Training, stated in this House on 31 August 1993 that the government's program in this area 'addresses the inequality of education opportunities between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Aboriginal people'. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training stated in this House on 23 August last year: The Commonwealth remains committed to the AEP which addresses the inequality of educational opportunities and outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Aboriginal people. In the second reading speech the minister said: This government has taken the lead to accelerate efforts to achieve educational equity for indigenous people. Contrary to those assurances, however, the simple fact remains that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are still the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. Clearly, what is needed is not just more money but a better and more effective way of directing and spending that money. Over the past five years under the AEP we have seen a pattern of assurances of equity in educational outcomes between Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people, yet fundamentally the position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people still remains significantly lower compared with non-Aboriginals. The more we look at the current figures the more depressing the picture becomes. The ABS survey found that an estimated 46 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 15 years and over who had left school actually wanted to do further study or training. Almost half of those who left school wanted to, but felt they could not, go on to do further study or training. What sort of country do we have when our citizens have the will but not the perceived opportunity to participate in education? The problem clearly lies with the administration of the present policies, not with the people they are designed to assist. These results expose the hypocrisy of the government which has deluded itself into thinkingMr Snowdon interjecting",27
13,Mr RONALDSON,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"What the parliamentary secretary is saying is that he does not support the view that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should have the opportunity to get involved in that education. The ABS survey showed that approximately 70 per cent of those who felt they could not go on to further study identified their main difficulties as lack of transport/travel, 19 per cent; financial problems, 19 per cent; and lack of child care, 15 per cent. The ABS survey found an appallingly low level of access to secondary schools providing classes up to year 12, TAPE colleges and universities. The survey found that the level of access to all educational institutions was lower in rural areas than in capital cities. Fourteen per cent of those surveyed were over 100 kilometres from the nearest secondary school which provided classes up to year 10, 32 per cent were over 100 kilometres from the nearest secondary school providing classes up to year 12, 43 per cent were over 100 kilometres from the nearest TAPE and almost 81 per cent were over 100 kilometres from the nearest university. These figures are not unique to Aboriginal people but are typical of the problems experienced by those in rural areas who are desperate to get an education. Rural education is yet another area where the government has disappointed not just Aboriginal Australians but non-Aboriginal Australians as well. The minister has called for an educational vision for rural Australia. I think the minister will agree that an educational vision is desperately needed for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in order to reverse the shameful statistics I gave earlier. What are clearly needed are benchmarks to determine the effectiveness of resource allocation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education. The minister has no choice but to acknowledge that continuing to allocate substantial sums for Aboriginal education is pointless unless there are accountability benchmarks which first and foremost determine whether the maximum benefit is derived by those they are designed to assist. I will say that again: unless there are accountability benchmarks which first and foremost determine whether the maximum benefit is derived by those they are designed to assist. This view is shared by the review of the AEP, which concluded last year: ... the work of all bodies developing policy and/or providing educational programs or services which impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders based on the following principles: efficiency of the available resources, minimising the amount money spent on administration and maximising amount of money spent on actually providing educational services for Aboriginal peoples Torres Strait Islanders. As I have said before, education is one of the most important ways we can aid Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in preparing themselves for a better future and maximising their potential contribution to the nation. With a more effective education and training system, perhaps Aboriginal unemployment would not be at its present horrific rate. There is still a long way to go in ensuring that equity is part of the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. As recently as 9 August this year the government was again challenged to deliver in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander will education by Lucas Maynard, committee chair of ATSIC's national advisory committee, stated: Our focus will be on achieving social justice for our people. Key areas to be addressed include education, health, employment, youth, the elderly, women and the arts. This makes the point that the approach of Labor Party over the past five years simply has not delivered what it promised. I have made it clear that the coalition totally supports the allocation of funding for Aboriginal education. Further, the coalition committed to raising the standards of Aborigiwas nal education. The coalition has a deep commitment to ensuring that the traditions, language and culture of Australia's indigenous people are preserved and respected Australians regard with pride the heritage and cultures of Aborigines and Islanders. What the coalition objects to is the way this funding is administered and what the funding is achieving. What has been demonstrated today is that the government's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy is simply not delivering the equity in education which it promised. Despite the assurances by the government, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are still the most educationally disadvantaged groups in Australia. This is Labor's legacy to the Aboriginal and Torres be Strait Islander communities of Australia. The of challenge for the government is to deliver the what it promised-equity in education. Its past failures give us very little confidence that and it will be able to do so in the future. While this bill addresses the financial resources and has the coalition's total support, it fails to address the government's lack of commitment to proper educational standards for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This legislation provides for transitional funding. The government has been slow to respond to the 1994 review and is not in a position to nominate priorities for the third triennium when putting this bill through. I understand that the states have been extremely cooperative. Therefore, the government's failure to provide this House with an indication of where the $83 million of funds be directed is an indication of its continuing inability to come to grips with the chalwho lenges that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education poses.",30
14,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Employment, Education and Training) (2.06 p.m.)-I was at different times amused and amazed during the contribution made by our honourable friend opposite, the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). I was not quite sure is during most of the speech whether or not he talking about this piece of legislation, as he made it very clear, it seemed to me, that he is concerned about this expenditure; at the very end of his speech he said, 'Of course, we and that endorse this bill.' He obviously did not listen to the speech made by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), and he knows next to nothing about the administration of education in Australia, most importantly Aboriginal education. About that there can be no question. I will explain that in a moment. This government, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), Minister Free and, prior to that, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) have acknowledged the need for us to do more in the area of Aboriginal education. That has been properly understood. It was this government that put in place the review that Minister Free spoke about in the course of his contribution. It was this government that made the changes to funding formulas to address the very issue that my colleague opposite raised in the context of this current debate. In a sense, he said that we should be concerned about the outcomes of the money which is being spent. Did he or did he not listen to Minister Free's contribution? Did he or did he not avail himself of information relating to the recent meeting of the ministers for education and Aboriginal education around Australia? I have to say that he must not have. The minister quite clearly said this in the course of his contribution: The government intends to make major changes to the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program from January 1997, with a new funding triennium to commence at that time. Those changes will provide for a more equitable basis for the distribution of funds on a per capita basis and new accountability arrangements that focus improved educational outcomes for indigenous people. I do not think it could be clearer than that. Yet those opposite sit here-clearly knowing nothing about it-do not articulate an alternative policy, make grandiose motherhood statements about supporting Aboriginal education and lambaste this government for what they say is this government's responsibility in relation to the poor educational outcomes for Aboriginal people. Nor did the member for Ballarat acknowledge at any point in time that education is a primary responsibility of state and territory governments; that the only aspects of education for which this government directly relates to territory and state governments are ANTA, TAFE and the university sector. School education is the primary responsibility of state and territory governments. The Commonwealth government is therefore denied access in a sense, but it wants to work with these state and territory governments to improve these educational outcomes that we are all concerned about. This is not acknowledged by the opposition; it is of no concern to the opposition, it seems. The opposition does not understand the role of its conservative ministers from around Australia who form part of MCEETYA. The opposition gives no acknowledgment of the poor performance of some state and territory governments in their constitutional responsibilitiesthat is, providing primary education, secondary education and preschool education to Aboriginal students around Australia. I will come to an example of that. The review that Minister Free spoke about involved quite a significant detailed study of education attainment levels for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people throughout Australia. One of the tables which they have produced shows retention rates to years 11 and 12 for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students from 1989 to 1993. What do we find out from this table? Contrary to what you have been led to believe by the opposition, the table says that there have been quite significant improvements in the educational achievement levels of Aboriginal and Torres on achieving Strait Islander people. In 1989, the year 10 retention rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was 70.13 per cent. By 1993 that had increased to 78.5 per cent. The year 11 retention rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people went from 33.9 per cent to 52 per cent, and for year 12 it went from 14 per cent to 25.2 per cent. Clearly that is not good enough. But to have us believe, as the opposition would, that there has been no dramatic improvement in this area when the contrary is true is dishonest. The opposition should be acknowledging that we need to do a lot more, yes, but what we have been doing is, in a committed way, working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and state and territory governments to try to achieve better outcomes. This table is particularly illuminating. It says that for the Northern Territory, my constituency, the retention rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in years 10, 11 and 12 have declined. The only state or territory in Australia where there has been a dramatic reduction in the standards of achievement for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory has, of course, had a conservative government since self-government in 1978-that is, the CLP, the Country Liberal Party, the bedfellows of the opposition. Those responsible for administering the needs of the education community and the provision of schooling in the Northern Territory is the Northern Territory CLP government. What do we find happened? In 1978 they took over the administration in the Northern Territory of education generally and the administration of Aboriginal education in particular from the Commonwealth Teaching Service and the Commonwealth. What does this document tell us? It tells us that in 1989 the year 10 retention rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was 61.38 per cent and by 1993 it had reduced to 41 per cent. That means that there had been almost a 33 per cent decrease in the achievement levels for year 10 students in the Northern Territory between 1989 and 1993 when the CLP had primary responsibility for the delivery of education services. For year 11 the figure dropped from 26.73 to 22.22. Significantly, for year 12 it dropped from 14.01 per cent to 10.32 per cent. What does that tell us? It tells us that has been an abysmal achievement in the Northern Territory in the allocation and distribution of resources for Aboriginal education. Who bears this responsibility? Is it the Commonwealth? After all, this bill is about supplementary assistance; it is not about who has primary responsibility for the delivery of education services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Commonwealth recognises that it has a special responsibility and works with state and territory governments to provide a better range of specifically targeted services to meet the needs of indigenous Australians. In the Northern Territory since self-government in 1978 we have seen a dramatic reduction in the school achievement levels for Aboriginal people. Just as a comparison, in 1993 the achievement levels for the broad year 12 population in the Northern Territory was something like 78 per cent. Therefore, 78 per cent of all students finished year 12. The number of Aboriginal students who finished year 12 was one in 10. An enormous disparity exists between the education achievement levels of Aboriginal students and other students in the Northern Territory. This has not been properly addressed by the Northern Territory government. One opposition speaker mentioned todayand it was not articulated in this way because I do not think he properly understands it-the issue of the locational disadvantages that remote area clients suffer. Let us understand what that properly means. In the Northern Territory, for example, it means that there is no high school that can properly deliver mainstream high school services to any Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory. We need to understand that not one Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory has a high school that is capable of giving them up to year 10 or, more importantly, year 12 education. It is fine if you live in Darwin, Katherine, Alice Springs, Jabiru, Alyangula or Nhulunbuy, but it is not good if you are an Aboriginal student and you live in a remote community. In the Catholic education system there is access to year lOin a couple of schools. Let there us understand who funds the Catholic education system. Primarily, the Catholic education system receives its funding from the federal government, not from the Northern Territory government. In the public education sector the Northern Territory government is primarily responsible for funding and the delivery of services, but we do not see any potential for Aboriginal students to get to year 10, let alone year 12. What does that mean? It clearly means that there is severe educational disadvantage. That is identified. A lot needs to be said about it. Not only is that an abysmal performance in the Northern Territory but it is likely to get worse rather than improve. One of the reasons for that is the basic demographic reason: the Aboriginal population is increasing. The 1991 census data indicate that in the previous five years the Aboriginal population had grown twice as fast as the overall Australian population. The Aboriginal population is growing faster and we are getting more Aboriginal children in the schools as a proportion of the total population. The demand on services is increasing at a much higher rate than that of the mainstream population. These people are disadvantaged, but the disadvantage is now being compounded because there is no recognition by the state and territory governments, by and large, of this element of disadvantage. It is plainly obvious in the Northern tory. The Commonwealth government will provide targeting assistance, but the primary responsibility is that of the Northern Territory government. A conservative Northern Territory government is responsible for this abysmal performance. There is no doubt that we have to do a great deal to improve secondary education in remote areas, but we are not going to do it if the state and territory governments do not recognise their responsibilities. The minister in the Northern Territory must recognise his primary responsibility in terms of Aboriginal education: basic access and equity, social justice, and justice in general. He has to ensure that Aboriginal children who live in remote communities have access to basic high school education. In recent months I have visited a large number of Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. I have made a small study of what is happening to these children who would otherwise be in high schools if they lived in a mainstream community. Numbers of these children are going away to boarding school. One might think that is a very good idea-and it may well be because they do not have any other choice. This involves a direct payment by the Commonwealth government. The Commonwealth government pays for the purchase of those boarding facilities and those services. It provides the tuition allowances that these students require. These costs are met by the Commonwealth government, not by the state or territory governments. There are no high schools in these communities. In the limited number of cases where these children go away to school the Commonwealth government pays. At one particular community I asked the community leaders what number of children were being sent away to high school. I was told that the figure was about 30. I spoke to the school staff and I asked, 'What proportion of those 30 children are in mainstream classes? How many of those children are actually achieving the academic results that you expect them to achieve when you send them away to school?' The figure is remarkable. The number of students in academic mainstream classes in Terri- the boarding school in Darwin was one. Whilst there may be some cases where there is provision of an educational service, one has to ask whether it is a service that achieves a result. Is it a service that actually achieves the outcome of providing access and equity in terms of service provision? Sadly, in this case, it is not. That is where the new formula, which the Commonwealth government is negotiating with the states and territories, is quite different from the past. It will not be input driven. It will be driven on the basis of the outcomes achieved by the state systems. If they feed more kids into the high schools and get them out with achievements, they will get more money from the Commonwealth. I would have thought that was a very important inducement. The Commonwealth has said in its bilateral discussions with the state and territory governments that it is important to make it firmly understood that we are committed to improving the ou-comes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, wherever they might be in Australia. I have no doubt that that is something which this community will applaud. But after listening to the opposition, and its shadow spokesperson in particular, I am a little concerned. He did not articulate anything that we do not know about the appalling state of Aboriginal education, generally speaking, and the need for us to do more. We all know that; it is acknowledged. We did not hear any new policies from the opposition about how it would do it differently. We heard some motherhood statements about how important things were but no coherent policy direction. That is what we have come to expect from the opposition in any event. The other important aspect which I do not think is properly understood is that, because Aboriginal students do not have the success rate as the broader community for a range of reasons--{)ne of which is a failure to provide services in many cases-and because their population is increasing faster than the overall community, they are doubly disadvantaged. When they compete for jobs in an ever increasingly competitive labour market, they do not have the fundamental skills to get employment. Because we do not have high schools in remote communities in the Northern Territory, these young Aboriginal students who, if they had achieved year 10 successfully, otherwise might have had access to vocational training through a T AFE cannot do it. Why can't they do it? Because they successfully completed year 10 and they do not have the basic prerequisites to get into vocational training schemes offered by mainstream state and territory administrations through the T AFE system. They are denied access because they do not have the basic skills? Why do they not have the basic skills? Because the state and territory governments have failed to provide them. Not only are these Aboriginal students disadvantaged educationally; when they compete for a job in the labour market they are doubly disadvantaged. They find that they do not have the basic skills to compete in the broader labour market. Thankfully, there have been some improvements, about which I have already spoken. We are seeing the success rate of Aboriginal students in higher education improving quite dramatically. We are seeing more Aboriginal students in the TAFE sector getting certificates where they have the initial competencies but, until we address this basic issue of providing all people in Australia, no matter where they live, with fundamental access to service provision, in the long term we will not be able to get a satisfactory outcome educationally, in terms of the labour market, vocational training or higher education. That requires commitment. It requires state and territory governments to work together. I am relieved and pleased to find that the state and territory governments have now committed themselves to the 21 goals of the Aboriginal education policy. I will not read all of them out, but they are available for all to see. I am surprised that they were not examined in some detail by the shadow minister. If he had done that, he may not have said all that he did. He would have realised that genuine commitments are now being made by state and territory governments, including conservative governments, to get better outcomes. The Northern Territory government-in a bit of doublespeak-is committed to those outcomes, but it does not achieve anything. At the third MCEETY A meeting of 26 May this year, the following agreement was reached by the state and territory ministers: have not It is recommended that Council: a reaffirms the commitment of the Australian Governments to the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy (NATSEIP) and acknowledges that it contains important proposed strategies for enabling Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to exercise greater educational self-determination and experience better educational outcomes ... That is very important. It further reads: b supports the general direction of the Interim Report from the MCEETY A Taskforce established to develop priority areas for action, implementation guidelines and strategy frameworks arising from the NATSIEP National Review, but notes that final decisions on individual recommendations should be left until receipt of the final Taskforce report; c endorses State and Territory Ministers' determination to improve indigenous education outcomes by using existing resources more effectively and to endeavour to increase their financial effort over the period to the end of the 1997-1999 triennium; d notes that the Commonwealth's intention, contingent on the above, is to provide additional strategic funding support in 1996 and further additional strategic and program funding over the 1997-1999 triennium, and e notes that, to this end, the Commonwealth will meet bilaterally with States and Territories to determine specific financial arrangements. Discussion on the bilateral arrangements will commence next month. That is the way to get improvement, to get the sort of commitment that this government has been able to achieve through these ministerial councils, to get the sort of commitment that is being achieved through the bilateral processes to ensure that we get a better outcome for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. But it requires a basic recognition by the opposition that the primary responsibility for the delivery of educational services to all Australians, whether or not they are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people, is with state and territory governments.

15,Mrs GALLUS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"I am not sure whether to congratulate the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) or lament his ability to walk the tightrope of managing to give the Commonwealth credit for anything positive that has happened in Aboriginal education and to blame the territory for anything negative that still occurs in Aboriginal education. It was quite a performance. The amendment to the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 affects the funding to DEET's Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, known as AESIP, a funding program designed to supplement the cost of education to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Funds are directed to state and territory governments, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education consultative bodies and non-government schools and education institutions. The main provision of the bill appropriates funds of $83.636 million for the funding period 1 January 1996 to 30 June 1997. Funding is appropriated on a triennial basis. I understand major changes will be implemented to AESIP from 1997 when the program enters a new funding triennium. Therefore, to allow for time for these changes to be implemented, 1996 will be used as a transitional year and funding at existing levels maintained. AESIP is part of the government's national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy which was developed from recommendations of the Aboriginal education policy task force. The task force was established with a view to establishing a strategy for the long-term approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The task force concluded in 1988 and found, to nobody's surpriseespecially not to Australia's indigenous people-that Aboriginal people were largely disadvantaged in educational opportunities. The task force called for the development of a national policy on Aboriginal education to achieve 'broad equity between Aboriginal people and other Australians in access, participation and outcomes in all forms of education by the turn of the century'. The task force stated that a new approach to Aboriginal education can only be achieved if the Aboriginal community is fully involved in determining the policies and programs that are intended to provide appropriate education for their community. How often have we heard these words? They are repeated like a mantra, and the fact that they are continually repeated shows, despite the mantra and the words, that action along these lines is simply not occurring. In response to the task force report, an announcement was made in 1988 that the AEP would be formed. The Australian education program commenced its first triennium in January 1990 with an aim to address the inequalities of educational opportunities that exist for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by the year 2000. Integral to the establishment of the Aboriginal education program is an agreed list of 21 goals, which the member for the Northern Territory mentioned, covering all education sectors. Each goal is to be pursued by all governments across all levels. The 21 goals are grouped into four headings for long-term purposes: firstly, to increase the involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in education decision making; secondly, to ensure equality of access to educational services; thirdly, to achieve equity of tional participation; and, fourthly, to equitable and appropriate educational outfacilitates comes. These are basically motherhood Strait statements, and I do not think anybody would disagree with them, but I think one does lament the lack of a hard, specific edge to these statements that would indicate clear action and concrete strategies. For the AEP's second triennium there were three national priorities. The first was to respond to the relevant recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The royal commission found of 99 deaths investigated, the majority, or most of the prisoners in fact, had only very basic educational levels, and only two of 99 had completed secondary school. The number of Aboriginal deaths in custody have, in fact, increased since the royal mission. Unfortunately, despite the rhetoric, there has been a lack of a real commitment the government to adequately implement the royal commission's 339 recommendations. The Social Justice Commissioner for Aborigities. nal and Torres Strait Islander people said the first 768-page report into the governeverything ment's implementations of the Royal Comcontrol, mission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was 'nothing more than an exercise and futility' and was a 'self-serving account of bureaucratic activity designed to bury failure in a sea of words'. The government has been very good in this area on rhetoric but, as that report by Mick Dodson has not shown, in actually putting that rhetoric action it has failed dismally. The second national priority of AEP was implement the national Aboriginal languages and literature strategy. Aboriginal languages are a major part of Australian heritage. As underscored by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, Aboriginal languages constitute a major vehicle for the conservation of aboriginality and are an important part of the identity for many riginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The national Aboriginal languages and literature strategy comprises two components: firstly, the Aboriginal languages education strategy or ALES and, secondly, the Aborigieducanal literacy strategy or ALS. The ALES, enable which commenced in 1993, promotes and teaching of Aboriginal and Torres languages in educational institutions. Under this strategy, funds are targeted under the AEP programs and are geared towards teaching Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages at schools, developing languages other than English programs in schools, developing bilingual-bicultural programs, developing curricula, producing materials for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language and developing Aboriginal and Torres Strait that, Islander language courses at TAPE. The ALS, which also started in 1993, aims to promote English languages through literacy the development among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander preschool and school-age children, as well as adults. It is aimed at those comwhose first language is not English, while recognising the existence of Aboriginal and by Torres Strait Islander English. The preference for the language in which children are taught differs among communiThis points very much to the need for that greater regionalisation in education, as in else. Instead of having centralised the Aboriginal communities need to have more capacity to indicate what they in waste want for their children. I am reminded of a trip I took around Australia during which I was speaking to Aboriginal communities. In one community I came to there was a lament that there was an ability to learn in their own language. into But in another community I was approached by the women of the community who asked to me why the teacher at the school was teaching their children in their own language. Their point was that they spoke their own language at home, the children had no need to learn it at school and they wanted the children to learn English, which would give them a better capacity to get jobs when they left school. The difference between those two commuAbonities possibly was that one community already had its language; it was spoken in the home and, therefore, there was no need for it at school. I get back to the importance of looking at local problems and letting local communities make decisions about education, instead of having centralised decision making. The third and final national priority of AEP is implementing the national reconciliation and schooling strategy. The strategy aims to see schools create a greater awareness and better understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues. This strategy has several elements: the development of appropriate and consistent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander curriculum studies for all schools from preschool to year 12; the development of teacher education courses; and a grassroots campaign to promote greater understanding by students of their school's local Aboriginal community and its history. The schools are taking this on board. You notice as you go around the country now that schools are developing their own Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander focus. It is very rare now to go into a school without finding that students are very much aware of the indigenous history of this nation. The national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's final report outlined comments from Aboriginal people regarding the program that gives effect to AESIP. Comments collected included a need for continuity and stability in funding, streamlined administration and accountability procedures and better ways to exercise self-determination in education. Every time you have a review there is the reiterated need for greater self determination in education-there is always a problem. The review further found that AESIP was thought of as a vital program but its priorities needed to be negotiated more at the grassroots level, and that bureaucracy had exercised too much control over the development process which in tum marginalised local involvement by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Earlier the shadow minister for education referred to the fact that every review had found exactly the same thing-that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were disadvantaged in education. Each review has come to the same conclusion-that there is a greater need for more involvement by the Aboriginal communities themselves-yet when we look at this we find that is obviously not happening. Even with these comments, the Aboriginal people I talked to said there was a feeling that the review itself had been bureaucratised and did not truly reflect the input of Aboriginal people. I cannot speak for all Aboriginal people on this, but some were saying that even the review that said that Aboriginal people had been marginalised and bureaucratised in the education process did not fully reflect the input that it had been given. Education contributes directly to all people's quality of cultural, social and economic life. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, self-determination in education is essential. It creates the framework which allows indigenous Australians to develop, to be themselves and to be put on an equal footing with the rest of the nation. To make real progress we have to look at what has happened and why the system has not worked better. As I have said, part of the answer is always the same. Each time we conclude that we must let Aboriginal communities have a greater input, but we just seem to talk about it. We do not do anything about it. I note that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) in his statement referred to the factors which contribute to educational disadvantage for Aboriginal people. He said that education systems may not adequately accommodate students' cultural backgrounds. I suggest that in many cases they certainly do not. He said that people in remote communities can have limited access to quality education. I think 'can have' again is hopeful. There is a definite problem there. Many indigenous children have special learning needs because English is not their first language. This is something that should have been corrected long ago. We agree with the comments on poverty limits, but there are many other aspects which he has not taken into account. There are transport, financial and social factors which I would like to refer to in a minute if I have the time. Australia's record is quite unacceptable. The participation rate of Aboriginal people is the lowest experienced by any group. Attendance rates are low and attrition and truancy rates are high. We have to look at the truancy rates and consider what are the cultural as well as the social determinations of those truancy rates. This comes back to the Aboriginal communities themselves who, in taking more responsibility for education, can look at some of these factors. Instead of trying to control them from above, we must control them from the grassroots level. Effective learning time is less for Aboriginal children than that of any other group. Attendance rates and learning outcomes are correspondingly low and there are much lower rates of transition to and graduation from award courses in higher education. Although Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have improved their standing in education over the last five years, the improvement has not been large enough. Behind the national indicators there are considerable variations between states and territories, but in all areas Aboriginal participressure pation rates are below those of all other Australians. The member for the Northern Territory spent a long time criticising the Northern Territory government for its participation rates and school retention rates. While he was talking I looked at the statistics. Although I used somewhat different measures from the member, I did note that he said there were some disturbing trends in the Northern Territory. It is obviously unacceptable that from 1987 to 1992-93 there has been a considerable drop in numbers in those graduating from year 11 to year 12. Looking through the statistics, I also noticed that that has happened in other states as well: with these relatively small numbers you get very large jumps in statistics. No matter how small the numbers, we would hope to see an increase. When I was looking at these statistics, I also noted, as all the reviews have noted, that the big problem is the retention rate from one year to the next. For all Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, for instance, the retention rate from grade 8 to grade 9 is 90 per cent; from grade 9 to 10, 85 per cent; from grade 10 to 11, 62.7 per cent; and from grade 11 to 12, 64 per cent. Over that four-year period that represents a decrease from 90 per cent of children graduating down to 30 per cent still there in year 12, which is one of the problems we have. We have to ask why it is happening at that level. It is not taken into account by the minister in his explanation because that applies to all students. So why are we getting that huge drop over that period? One reason suggested to me by one Aboriginal community was that the students who wish to stay are placed under enormous pressure due to the fact that as their peers drop out they find themselves without a peer group. As that peer group was an extraordinarily strong peer group while they were in the lower grades, they had formed their bonds with this group. Similarly, the other students had formed their bonds and had not included Aboriginal students. So, when their numbers in the peer group started to decline, the students found themselves isolated. That, plus the peer to leave school, led to a greater leaving rate in the higher grades. That is something that will have to be addressed by the school system. I have been told that, despite the fact that 20 per cent of the students in the Katherine High School are Aboriginal, in one year not one Aboriginal student entered year 12. The types of things I have already spoken about may be the cause of that happening. Aboriginal people have consistently called for a greater influence in the decision making process, not only of education but of all the parts that affect their life, whether it is health, work or anything else. Interestingly, although there has been this slight increase in the educational retention rate, Aboriginal unemployment in the workplace has actually increased from 30 per cent to 38 per centwhile there has been an increase in the community development employment program. So unemployment is certainly rising despite that marginal increase in education. It is something we all need to look at. It is a most disturbing trend as education is the basis of that employment. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) stated in a press release in March this year that generating employment and trammg opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait people still needs a lot of work. Adequate levels of employment and education go hand in hand. If the educational opportunities are not there, despite what I just said, the employment levels will certainly not be there. Education is certainly a prerequisite of employment. In a joint statement put out in May this year, Minister Crean and Minister Free stated: It is intolerable that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's education participation and attainment levels are still far below the average for the total Australian population. The undoubted conclusion is that this Labor government has failed Aboriginal people in education. The coalition welcomes the foreshadowed changes to AESIP from January 1997, especially the focus of achieving improved educational outcomes for indigenous people. However, this present bill will not resolve the inadequacies or bridge the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. It will, however, provide funding to continue with the same system, which has proved inadequate for too many years.",36
16,Mr DODD,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"The previous speaker, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), said during her speech that she did not know where she was. I will tell her where she is; she is in the Commonwealth parliament. All those matters that she referred to are not the responsibility of this parliament under the constitution; they are the responsibility of the states and territories. So perhaps she should be somewhere else. Perhaps she should be talking to the state parliaments, especially the one in her state, which I understand is now controlled by the coalition. It just amazes me that coalition speakers come in on Aboriginal education matters and other matters to do with Aboriginal affairs and lecture this parliament about things that are the responsibility of state governments. The constitution clearly states that the responsibility for primary education and secondary education lies with the states and territories. The Commonwealth has assumed some responsibility for tertiary education and tertiary education funding, but the responsibility in those other areas lies with the states and territories. This report, excellent as it is, cannot be implemented totally by this parliament or the federal government. It is interesting to note that in my state of Queensland we had a coalition government until 1989. I will relate to the parliament a little anecdote which illustrates the coalition's attitude to Aboriginal and Islander education policy. When the Hawke government was elected in 1983, Susan Ryan was the education minister. She went with my predecessor to the Torres Strait. So appalling were the conditions for Aboriginal and Islander education that she came straight back to Canberra and said to the Prime Minister that something had to be done about it. The government put in $10 million at the time to rebuild the schools in the Torres Strait. There was no contribution from the Queensland government. It did not care. On the York Islands, there is a living monument to the services that were provided for primary education in the Torres Strait. You can still see it today. It is a tin shed that used to be the school. I hope that it stays there forever as a reminder of, and a monument to, coalition policy on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander matters. That school is basically what I describe it as: it is a tin shed with no fans. There is one building for what is one of the largest islands in the Torres Strait. The Hawke government put that money straight in. There are now excellent schools right throughout all the outer islands of the Torres Strait. The National Party government was a coalition government until the middle of the 1980s. So the Liberals were just as complicit in this as the Nationals. When the Premier arrived, he gave out 10Ilies. That is exactly what happened. Mr Bevis-That is right; boiled lollies.",40
17,Mr DODD,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Boiled lollies. That was the contribution of the coalition to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education in my region in the period of the National Party government. So it is just amazing to see the hypocrisy of those opposite in the debate today. I would even call it bizarre. It is just simply bizarre that they can come into this parliament and say what they have said. But there is no doubt that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people face disadvantage in many aspects of life. Health is one area that is persistently mentioned. It is acknowledged that the gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and the health of the rest of the Australian population is enormous. The Commonwealth government is committed to addressing this problem. Apart from health, education is another area that can cause astounding disparity in circumstances, especially when the policy is not working. Commitment is not forthcoming from a reluctant government. That sounds very much like the coalition government in Queensland prior to 1989. The 1988 task force obviously emphasised that disadvantage. A whole generation of adults can find that their basic options in life are limited because a particular era of policy makers took a particular view in the area of education. I cannot stress enough the importance of having an appropriate education policy. I congratulate the report for its excellent work in guiding both state and federal governments to a more appropriate policy in this area. In many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities the dramatic changes in education policies, due to paradigm shifts in educational thought and state government policy, have wrought a great deal of damage. The debate still rages on appropriate education policies in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Around the 1950s and earlier there was an emphasis on assimilation in schooling. Mission schools, rightly or wrongly, were determined to instil an awareness of Christianity and a strict and traditional education. Unfortunately, while this may have provided Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with an education, it drove a wedge between an education and past cultural traditions that caused reverberations for generations. The 1970s saw a swing to the possibility of a culturally appropriate education. There has been criticism of what has been seen as the intrinsically racist nature of the European schooling system and the imposition of education policy on communities by government departments dominated by white men. Some academics considered whether any aspect of an education system that revolved around the classroom, the teacher-student relationship and with classes conducted in English was appropriate or relevant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. But this approach to education has also met with hostility from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parents. Denying Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the same access to schooling as non-Aboriginal students limits the options available to these children and restricts the opportunities for self-determination. It is true to say that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parents want a balance between these two approaches. They want a schooi system that is sensitive to cultural identityand that is very important-that is resourced similarly to urban schools and that does not leave their children disadvantaged when it comes to administering their communities, businesses and attaining other aspirations. This is the very argument about access and equity that is highlighted in the report. Sending a child to the comer school is taken for granted by many parents living in urban centres. Parents have a choice of a range of schools in their area. While some schools may emphasise different programs and some individual teachers may be better educators than others, a basic standard of education is expected and received. I might say that, in my electorate, there are a lot of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that reside in Cairns. I think that both the state schools and the private schools do an excellent job in that area. Cairns High School has a high level of involvement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and has got a good record of achievement in that area. St Augustine's College is a private Catholic school that has got a similar record. Emmanuel College is another private school that comes to mind. Also in my electorate located near Cairns is Wangetti, which is a non-government school solely for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from remote commumtIes. So there is a good record in recent years in that regard. But the majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in my electorate live in remote areas of Far North Queensland. Attracting teachers to these areas is difficult and retaining them more so. It is stating the obvious to say that it is remote, it is isolated and often there need to be special packages to attract people to these remote community schools. What will often happen is that teachers in their first year out of university will be posted to remote schools. Most of these teachers are very well trained, but it does mean that remote schools often do not benefit from having experienced teachers. That is not the only disadvantage that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children have in remote communities. As previous speakers have indicated, English is often a second language and sometimes even a third language. If you add to that the sheer problem of distance and the fact that written material is not often available in these communities, then you can see why the report highlights the disadvantages that occur to children in these areas. That is why I stand here and congratulate those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children that have made it through to tertiary education because, if they can do that given all these disadvantages, they certainly have achieved something. Another problem in the communities is the retention of teachers. Most teachers will leave when they have done their time at a remote school and can get a posting to an urban area. This is understandable because, of course, many of these teachers would like to return to family or familiar surrounds, but the consequences do lead to children in these remote schools being disadvantaged. In the time that I have been the member for Leichhardt I have had a lot of opportunities to meet teachers in remote communities. There is a band of them who actually enjoy teaching and living in those communities. They give a lot to those communities and in fact become part of those communities. I congratulate them, but still it is a problem. I will contrast that situation with the problem we have in getting doctors to remote communities. I think teachers come up pretty well when compared to doctors. We just cannot get doctors to those communities, even though they are often offered a higher remuneration than teachers. Yet there is that dedicated band of teachers, in Queensland especially, who go to remote communities not just in my electorate but in the far western areas, provide that education and, as I said, become part of the communities. Many of the problems, including those of culturally appropriate teaching methods, are being met as people from the communities are being trained as teachers and remain in the communities to teach at local schools. Aboriginal and Islander teachers need to be given proper support from governments and have access to education policies that meet their needs and provide appropriate training. Units on teaching in Aboriginal and Islander schools have already been introduced into the curriculum of most universities offering a Bachelor of Education. I hope to see more emphasis on this sort of training, including the placement of teachers for practicals at remote schools so they can gain first-hand experience. Work experience at remote schools would also sort out those teachers who found they could simply not live in such an isolated area, and schools would perhaps get more of those teachers I referred to earlier who are prepared to commit themselves not only to the school but also to the community in which they live. I do not want to see the situation develop where senior teachers in remote schools are all non-Islander and non-Aboriginal and where Aboriginal and Islander teachers are only in junior positions. That, unfortunately, is still the case in the majority of schools, at least in my electorate. The Aboriginalisation of teaching is a gradual process, and the more involvement local people have in the teaching process the more likely children will be given a context for their schooling. Attendance rates have been steadily rising but, unfortunately, retention rates in year 12 are still far behind non-Aboriginal children. I will give some credit to the previous Queensland government. The statistics show there does seem to be a better level of retention rates, especially in secondary education in Queensland and other states. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) referred to his territory statistics. I understand the statistics in Western Australia are equally as bad. In my electorate in Far North Queensland, the fact that James Cook University will be building another campus in Far North Queensland will give Aboriginal and Islander people access to tertiary education on a greater level. The emphasis on bilingual programs in traditional communities is also essential. Where English is a second language, provision must be made for staffing ratios that reflect this and classes must be conducted appropriately. Aboriginal and Islander parents should be given as much input into schooling as possible, and that is what the report emphasises. Extended families and clan groups should also be involved in the teaching process to assist with a more culturally normal teaching method. Bureaucratic consultation with a community needs to be at the parent level not just merely with council clerks, leaders or administrators. Parents and other family members need to feel they have ownership and input into the schooling of their children. This is a two-way process. Teachers and education administrators cannot rewrite curriculum at the whim of an individual. Communities also have a role to play in retaining teachers by giving them the appropriate support, but what is essential in this process is proper consultation. In my electorate, Aurukun State School is a shining example of how this process can actually succeed. Prior to an increase in the level of consultation in the local community, the retention rates in that school were appalling. The school was broken up and changed from the traditional classes being based on age to being based on clan groups. There was total consultation with the community and there was an outstanding increase in the retention rate in Aurukun State School, which continues. I congratulate those in Aurukun State School. I know the manager, Gladys Tybiugoompa, personally. She does a great job in liaising with the rest of the Aurukun community and the education department. It is a real success story. Although Aurukun is culturally different from other Aboriginal communities, it should be a model for this sort of development of community involvement with education. To those people opposite who say that a Queensland Labor government has not delivered in that area, they should look at the Aurukun State School because it is a shining example of how the policy that is recommended in this report has been implemented by a Labor government.",40

19,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Since the last election, in addition to stealing away the l-a-w income tax cuts, you have increased sales tax on every taxable item by two per cent, you have increased petrol excise by 7c and 5c a litre, you have increased sales tax on cars by five per cent and you have raised an additional $7 billion in indirect taxes. Yet, according to Access Economics, a person on average weekly earnings subject to the SGC is still paying more income tax than they were 10 years ago. Is this the kind of tax reform-singling out middle income earners for special punishment-that your government is proud of?",43
20,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me say that this piece of work by Access Economics seems to be unusually and particularly sloppy. I know that there is a special liaison with the opposition, and we realise you place great faith in them. After all, these were your guiders and mentors on the whole Fightback package, including the broad based consumption tax. I realise that they have a particular affection for you, but in this particular case they are absolutely up the creek. The fact is that the analysis that has been done, as described in the Australian todayapparently commissioned by the Australian, interestingly enough-relies for its whole tenor of an increase in the tax burden on the supposed fact that there has been an increase in taxes because of the super guarantee charge. Of course the OECD, in looking at taxes around the world and at tax regimes of various countries, does not include as tax contributions of this kind, which are paid to private funds, not to the government. Nor should they be included, because they are not paid to the government. The government is not receiving these amounts of money. They are not there for us to spend on whatever we want-social security or anything else. We do not get that money. How can it possibly be seen as tax? It is an absurdity. The OECD makes that clear distinction. Mr Downer--They are not listening-they are organising. Mr Reith-The Glimmer twins are up there plotting.",43
21,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will wait for a moment. Those on my left! The Treasurer has the call. I remind you of standing order 55.,44

24,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know why they bothered asking the question. Obviously they are not interested in the answer. Anyway, I would just like to make this point at least. When the OECD did that analysis, it made it absolutely clear that payments of paid to the government were not taxes and therefore should not be seen as part of the burden of a country. The OECD did its analysis on the basis of what we all understand to be taxes-that is, payments made to the government, not payments made to private funds which invest the money on behalf of members and eventually pay benefits to those members.",44
25,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What happens if you don't pay?,44
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor! Spare me the running commentary.,44
27,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Once one gets that out of the way, this whole Access Economics analysis absolutely collapses. What you have then is a situation where the supposed increase in the tax burden has disappeared. In fact, the tax burden is reduced-from 24'h per cent of GDP in 1984-85 down to 23 per cent in 199495. That is a notably reduced tax burden as a proportion of GDP. In terms of individuals, the tax burden of 13Y2 per cent in 1984-85 was down to 12 per cent in 1994-95. We are clearly looking at reduced tax burdens across the whole board and for individuals paying income tax. We should take no notice whatever of this absurd analysis. It is trying to raise a straw man. It should be seen for what it is and disregarded entirely. Taxation",44
28,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also to the Treasurer. I refer to the fact that today is the 10th anniversary of the announcement of the reform of the Australian tax system by the current Prime Minister on 19 September 1985. What has been the significance of these reforms and how important have they been to clear the reform of the Australian economy?,44
29,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Franklin for his question. It is certainly important to recall that 10 years ago to this day the now Prime Minister stood in this House and announced a series of changes to the income tax system which were very substantial indeed and gave Australia a tax system in which, for once, we could feel some pride. By any standards, that was a major set of reforms which has served this this kind not country exceedingly well. The background to this is that when this tax government came to power in 1983 we had a tax system which was in a state of near terminal decay. We recall that the previous government, with the now Leader of the Opposition as Treasurer for the last 51,4 years of its time in office, had simply refused to face up to the fundamental deficiencies of the tax system. It was replete with blatant tax avoidance and tax evasion schemes. Indeed, some of the most blatant, outrageous and criminal tax evasion schemes ever seen anywhere in the world were operating for years and years here in this country under the previous government. It was a tax system with gaping holes. For most high income earners, it had reached the stage where paying income tax was, essentially, optional. It was only when some of these schemes were plastered all over the front pages of the newspapers that we eventually got some action from the then government to redress some of the more outrageous elements. That still left a system that was blatantly inequitable and open to gross exploitation. So, on 19 September 1985, the then Treasurer under this government made his announcement about reforms to the income tax system which were designed to close off those gaping holes and restore decency, equity and efficiency to the tax system. I will briefly remind the House that the main elements were the taxation of fringe benefits, which previously were untaxed so you could simply receive income, essentially untaxed, by way of various forms of fringe benefits without paying any real tax, and that meant there was obvious scope for enormous avoidance of tax; the introduction of substantiation provisions, to require people to substantiate their claimed expenses; the taxation of foreign source income, which was basically untaxed-if there was any tax paid overseas, there was no further tax paid when it came to Australia; and the taxation of real capital gains. We previously had not had a capital gains tax, and this important way of receiving income without paying any tax was essentially closed off by this addition to the tax system. In addition to that, we made various changes to improve the equity of the system-cutting the marginal income"" tax rates. It is interesting to recall that under the Leader of the Opposition, then the Treasurer, we had a top marginal tax rate of 60 per cent. It looked to be fair and reasonable, but not many people paid it because of all these loopholes. That top rate was cut from 60 per cent to 49 per cent and eventually to 47 per cent. The intermediate rate, which applied to average weekly earnings, was cut from 46 per cent to 40 per cent, and it is now down to 34 per cent. The bottom rate was reduced slightly; it had already been cut from 30 per cent to 25 per cent and it went down to 24 per cent. As well, we substantially increased the income tax threshold. With that, we had full imputation of company tax so that dividends were taxed only once instead of twice. The incentive to invest through equity in productive activity rather than to look for the most tax effective outcome was greatly increased. That has been a remarkably important change in the tax system to ensure that we have productive investment in this country instead of tax effective investment, which was what applied previously. The company tax rate was also increased at that time to help pay for the cost of imputation, but it was later cut from 49 per cent to 36 per cent. The company tax rate is now 10 per cent less than it was when this government came into office. Ten years after that statement was made Australia unquestionably has a much more equitable, fair and efficient tax system. Without those changes, our tax system would be shot to pieces. Let me take the fringe benefits tax. In 199495, some $2.1 billion net came from that tax. Without it that $2.1 billion would not be raised and, with that loophole opened, there would be massive amounts of additional income going through. There would be an enormous loss of income which would be made up presumably by jacking up the rates for those pay-as-you-earn taxpayers higher and higher. It is also important to bear in mind, as I said in answer to the previous question, that there has been no increase in the tax burden in that time. In the 10 years, that tax burden now went down from 24Y2 per cent to 23 per cent. That is the 10-year analysis. The additional revenue raised by these measures has not been used to jack up the total tax take. There has been a reduction in that 10-year period. This year it is a little higher, but it is still less than it was in 1984-85. We have not increased the tax burden in that time through these measures. We remain a low taxed country-the second lowest taxed country in the OECD, amongst Western developed countries. We have absolutely established our credentials on tax. This government stands for fairness, decency and equity in the tax system. We have cleaned up the terrible mess that was left by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer. We have a decent, equitable and fair tax system, and the tax burden in Australia remains the second lowest in the Western world. The people of Australia are benefiting from a much fairer system and no increase in the tax burden. Minister for Human Services and Health",44
30,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Yesterday when I asked the minister to reconcile her statement of 17 April that in addition to Joe Berinson and Kay Hallahan she had spoken to other former ministers who had confirmed her recollection of events, and her new version last week that Mr Berinson and Ms Hallahan were the only two ministers that she had checked with, she replied that the transcript did not reveal such a discrepancy. I therefore quote from the transcript of proceedings of 13 September at page 2378: And theyBerinson and Hallahanwere the only two people you checked with? Yes. For contrast, I quote from your media release of 17 April 1995: Other former ministers have privately confirmed my recollection of events. I ask again: why have you changed your story? Was yesterday's answer a failure of memory or a failure to tell the truth?",46

35,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are mistaking the question in the first place and I do not intend to go through it again. What I will do is put something else on the record in relation to this matter. In the last 24 hours we have not only had the member here asking the question failing to get it right again-and I suggest he go back and have a little think abovt it-but also had a member of the Liberal Party having a little think about a few things. Senator Crichton-Browne has had a little think about a few things. Senator Crichton-BrowneMr Reith-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the minister has been asked a specific question. It arises as you know out of her claims yesterday. She has now said to the House that she is not prepared to go to the details of that but that she will go to a further and different matter. She should be required to answer the question. If she is not prepared to answer the question she should be required to sit down.",46
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister has been asked a question and, as I have constantly remarked in this place, it is not within the prerogative of the chair to know how people will respond. The minister is responding now to a question that was asked of her about certain matters. The member for Gippsland is listening for a response. The minister has the call.",46
37,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I concede that Senator Crichton-Browne is no longer a member of the Liberal Party, but he was at the time when the discussions took place. He indicated that there was a discussion held between the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Court and himself. He did not expand on exactly what those discussions were or their content. He was not prepared to say exactly what had been discussed. But denials that have been made by the Leader of the Opposition and Mr Court about those discussions need to be refuted in this parliament. Senator CrichtonBrowne was more forthcoming in discussions with the West Australian. He said: My advicethis is to Howard and Courtwas to shut their mouths, keep out of it and allow the Labor Party to tear itself apart-which is exactly what prompted this inquiry-and to allow the Press to report the machinations of the Labor Party and ultimately the inevitable findings commission. So Senator Crichton-Browne told you to keep your mouth shut and stay out of it, but you did not take his advice on that as on other matters. Having had a cosy little chat about it and obviously seeing the political advantage in turning up the heat on the Labor Party, as the opposition saw it, Senator CrichtonBrowne says this about the outcome: The problem with the Liberal Party, and I say about a party I love dearly and I seek not critical of, that we are capable of grabbing even if it's full of strychnine in the hope that can succeed before we die. Give up! United Nations Conference on Women",46
38,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. It refers to the recent conference on women in Beijing. Can the minister tell us what that conference achieved?,47
39,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure members will be aware that the United Nations first world conference has just concluded on a platform that clearly promotes women's rights both domestically and internationally. I would like to take the opportunity today to thank number of people, including Ms Kathy would Townsend, head of the Office of the Status of Women, who did a tremendous job with the delegation which included a significant number of senior public servants and parliaMinister mentarians. I would like, too, to take the opportunity to thank our ambassador Beijing, Mike Lightowler, who did a splendid job not only in supporting the delegation in protecting some of our citizens-something that was, it is sad to say, necessary at the time. The non-government organisations who took part were very active and participated well. Indeed, they took the lead in a lot key areas. My parliamentary colleagues, including the member for Pearce, also supwith ported the delegation well. I think it needs to be understood that a platform is not legally binding but it does provide internationally agreed benchmarks to of the measure how well countries are advancing the status of women, and that includes Australia. It clearly consolidates gains from previous conferences and goes further in some areas. The test for all of us now will be to see how well these commitments are implemented. The issues which are clearly of concern to women around the world are principally violence against women in all its forms and the lack of women in public life and decision making positions. I am sure members will this remember that these were two areas of conto be cern to Australian women which we have a bone given priority to addressing. The conference we actually moved further than previous conferences on key issues such as measuring unpaid work, promoting the education of women and girls, identifying ways to phase out child labour and early marriage and, of course, eliminating violence against women. It also achieved a considerable degree of consensus on greater protection for women against rape and war crimes. Both India and China ultimately had no reservations to the platform of action, which means that by far the majority of the world's women can potentially be covered by the platform. Australia, as I am sure members will know, was instrumental in initiating the conference of commitments proposal and some 65 countries embraced Australia's idea a of making very firm commitments. Again I like to thank all those people involved for a conference which, from Australia's point of view, was a very considerable success. for Human Services and Health",47
40,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed into the Minister for Human Services and Health. I refer the minister to her previous but answer and accept her offer to take up the time of the House to provide a detailed answer to my question. Will the minister now explain the glaring contradiction between her media statement of 17 April and her evidence of to the royal commission? Or is she happy to leave the House and the Australian public the conviction that she has a faulty memory, either by accident or by design?",47
41,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-Again, I suggest to the member simply that he look at the questions that he is asking me and the question that has been put to the commission. I take the opportunity to remind the member of some of the comments that have been made by the royal commissioner himself about this matter. The royal commissioner said: The terms of reference have turned out to be fairly restrictive. He said that he found himself in a very difficult position. He went on to say: It's part of my training not to make assumptions on half of the evidence. He is only hearing half of the evidence with restrictive terms of reference. He said that most of the issues that would be raised in the commission were matters that he could not resolve. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of orderMrs Crosio interjecting",48
42,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Prospect is not helping. Mr Reith-If she is that gullible, the Glimmer boys will be talking to her after question time. Mr Speaker, my point of order is twofold. Firstly, the minister is transgressing the sub judice principle. I appreciate that you have ruled that it is a convention which we are to disregard for these purposes, but that is my first point of order. My second point of order concerns standing order 145. The minister has twice been asked a very simple question-a quite specific question. She has made it quite clear that she has no intentions whatsoever of answering the question. Under those circumstances, from any reading of the standing orders, there is no way an objective, reasonable person could say that her answer is relevant to the question. Under those circumstances, you should rule her out of order.",48
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With respect to the first point that the honourable member raised, I think he answered it in his comment. In respect of the second matter, the member for Gippsland has asked on two occasions now, albeit in a different guise, a question in respect of the minister's involvement in this royal commission. She is responding to that particular question. The minister is in order.",48
44,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not think I needed to spell it out to the member, but I have the two pieces of paper here. The question in the commission-if you went back and read it was about whom I checked with before answering the question of the journalist. The question at the doorstop was much broader; it included whom in the intervening week I had subsequently had discussions with. So just have a little think, as I suggested earlier. Have a look at the transcript of the commission, have a look at the press release and have a look at the transcript of the doorstop. I think you then might just figure it out. They are two different questions. Members opposite can hardly complain about sub judice when they come in here and do exactly what we have just seen-that is, try to second guess the commission. The commission had these pieces of papers in front of them when they questioned me on these matters. Forgive me, but I think they were likely to have been more astute with the question than you were. I think it is important to get the words of the royal commissioner on the parliamentary record, because he was very concerned about the restrictive terms of reference. He said he did not want to hear half of the evidence. Commissioner Marks said: The sooner this commission comes to an end the better. I think that the experience here has demonstrated the usefulness of royal commissions is fast receding. Certainly that is true of this royal commission. He also said: Most of the issues that are raised here are ones that I cannot resolve. He further said: The present issues may gave risethis is being helped by members opposite, with the warning of Crichton-Browneto the impression that I am going to make some political determination. I underline again that the commissioner himself said that this was going to give rise to the impression that he was going to make some political determination. He said that that was a cause of some embarrassment. Mr Speaker, if members opposite are interested in inconsistencies, I draw one to your attention that has occurred today in the commission itself. Mr Court said very clearly to the commission today that he heard about the fact that he had been cleared of the allegations in the petition some time between four and seven o'clock on the day the petition was tabled from an unknown, unnamed staffer. That is what he told the royal commission today. What he told the parliament on Tuesday, 10 November, in Western Australia, was this: On Thursday momingthis is the day the petition was tabledI rang the Commissioner for Police to find out was the situation because I was not aware that I was under police investigation. So he says in the commission, 'Thursday afternoon between four and seven'; he says in the parliament that on Thursday morning he rang the Commissioner for Police, and then he says, later in the same personal explanation, 'after the matter was settled on Friday morning'. So that is three different accountstwo in the parliament and oneMr Costello-No, he gave one.",48
45,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He said, Mr Speaker, just to make it clear to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that he did not himself make the inquiry but that a member of staff told him in the afternoon. He told the parliament in 1992 that he personally rang the commissioner the next morning. Which one of those accounts is correct, Mr SPEAKER - one, two or three? Mr MCGauran- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the transcript of proceedings of 13 September 1995 so that the House will know both the media statement and the transcript relate to the cabinet meeting.",49

52,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question without notice is addressed to the Attorney-General. What progress has been made on implementing the government's agenda for improving access to justice for Australian women?,49
53,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,49
54,Mr LA VARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is good to see such interest in the subject coming from the oppowhat sition, and no doubt Australian women in particular will take on board the catcalls coming from them. Last year the Australian Law Reform Commission delivered a major report to the parliament in relation to gender and the law. The major series of recommendations flowing from the Law Reform CC""TImission was that the government should gl ve consideration to the establishment of specialist women's legal services throughout Australia. As the House would be aware, the justice statement earlier this year took up that particular recommendation am:, in fact, largely implements the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission. That program is now well under way and will have, as its cornerstone, the establishment of specific legal services for women in each of the Australian states and will see a substantial upgrading of the existing services which operate in the three major eastern states in the establishment of new services in Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and the ACT. There will also be a new service established in the Northern Territory and in North Queensland. The core of the services provided by these centres will include the provision of telephone advice networks operating on a 008 number, and will provide specific litigation services, case work and advice programs for women. Importantly, the Law Reform Commission also recognised-as had a number of other major reports, including, I think, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody-the need for there to be services directed at Aboriginal and Islander women. It was noted that particular services operated by legal aid commissions and, more specifically, Aboriginal legal services did not adequately cater for the needs of Aboriginal women. The government has accepted these recommendations and, as part of the justice program, outreach services will be attached either to the specialist women's services or to existing community legal services, depending on the most appropriate location, in order to extend those outreach services so that Aboriginal women also have provision to have their needs met. This, together with a range of other reforms to the substantive law, such as changes to the Corporations Law allowing small businesses and one-company directors to overcome the difficulty often identified of bringing unknowing spouses-in terms of the operation of a business-into a company, and improving the operation of the Family Law Act, as well as a number of other substantive law reforms, will mean that the government has put together a most comprehensive strategy to address the particular needs of accessing justice for Australian women. Minister for Human Services and Health",49
55,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Do you stand by the evidence you gave to the royal commission that you did not know that the Family Law Act prohibited the publication of the names of those involved in Family Court proceedings?,50
56,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question presumes that I would have said something under oath before the commission that I did not believe to be the case. Obviously, I resent the inference that is drawn. Mr Howard interjecting",50
57,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Absolutely. Not being a lawyer,50
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You said that?,50
59,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I said it; of course I know it. I said that before the royal commission. That is my best recollection of my state of knowledge at the time. Opposition members-Ha, hal",50
60,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It suits members opposite. Let me remind you of a few things you have had difficulty with in recent times, Mr Howard. John Howard, Leader of the Opposition, on ABC radio's AM on 25 August said that Richard Court had set up the royal commission of his own volition. What about the evidence now of Senator Crichton-Browne that you were all involved in the discussion? Mr MCGauran-You're quoting Noel Crichton-Browne!",50
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Gippsland has been asked a number of times this afternoon to restrain himself. Please do so.,50
62,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It may suit members opposite now to say that Noel CrichtonBrowne is persona non grata but he ran the Liberal Party in Western Australia for 20 years. The Premier of Western Australia owes his position to Noel Crichton-Browne. The Leader of the Opposition was not prepared to move on Noel Crichton-Browne. How was it that a conversation was had between Senator Noel Crichton-Browne, the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier of Western Australia? If Senator Crichton-Browne was so insignificant, if he was so unimportant, if he was such a persona non grata, why were you talking to him? Why were you having those cosy little discussions with him? The member for Chisholm said on radio on 18 April, 'We've been liaising with Richard Court.' Who is the 'we'? Is it the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Crichton-Browne, the member for Chisholm? The member for Chisholm said, 'We've been looking for the best way to do ""it"".' Was he lying, too? Were you not involved in discussions such as those described by Senator Crichton-Browne? When the member for Chisholm was giving his personal explanation in the House, hc cumplained: The Leader of the House (Mr Beaz]c:.') \\,,\S suggesting just· then that I had said that we were constantly having discussions. It is completely untrue. I said we were liaising-it is totally ent. There is no doubt-and everybody in this community knows it-that there were discusand sions going on and they involved the Leader either. of the Opposition. He can't remember exactly what he said. He thinks it was Richard Court who was raising it; he may have been inTrade volved. Richard Court said, 'I probably did raise the issue with John Howard. I can't remember specifically talking with John Howard. I spoke to a wide range of people.' Richard Court says he does not know whether he spoke to John Howard. John Howard is back down. trying to duck for cover. But CrichtonBrowne, as he has often done, blew the whistle on you. It is all very well now, a week after the event, a week after the powerful Senator Crichton-Browne is removed from the party, for them suddenly to be saying is a person of no significance. Nobody behas lieves you about that any more than they about other matters. Health Insurance",50
63,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. Is the minister aware that members of the Australian Medical Association have recently taken action which AMA Council: may breach the Trade Practices Act? What The action has the government taken this?,51
64,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the campaign that which the Australian Medical Association been running to wreck the government's The private health insurance reforms, no doubt but encouraged by the opposition when those ethical reforms were debated in this chamber. As part of this campaign, AMA leaders have threatmatter ened to collude on terms for negotiating ronment. contracts with private hospitals and health insurance funds. The Trade Practices Commission has written to the Western Australian branch the AMA warning it that it may be encourimplement aging a breach of the Trade Practices Act. This follows a meeting which the AMA It organised urging doctors not to enter competitive arrangements. In practice, the AMA is encouraging doctors to get together and agree only to supply their services to health insurance companies under certain differ- terms. It is this behaviour that the TPC and the government are concerned about. It is not tolerated in any other sector of the economy it is not acceptable in the health system I am surprised that the medical profession is only just coming to terms with what the Practices Act requires of it. It has been in existence for 20 years. Back in 1974 the first court case taken under the Trade Practices Act was against doctors. A number of cases have been taken since and I understand that in every case the doctors have had to The AMA has shown that it is out of touch with the standards of business behaviour accepted elsewhere in the community. Even the legal profession is making an effort to he comply with the Trade Practices Act and this involved a major rethink of its practices. do State governments have also been reviewing their legislation as it applies to lawyers to remove anti-competitive practices. But this action by the doctors is revealing a very disturbing picture of how they view their rights and responsibilities as a profession. I quote a recent comment by members of the very basis of being a professional is selfto deal with determination of fees. That is an outrageous statement. I have to say I can only agree with the president of the has Institution of Engineers, who responded: basis of a profession is not about setting fees the self-regulation of standards of practice, obligations and the paramount importance of the community interest. Professional fees are a for the marketplace in a competitive enviThe Trade Practices Act is there to ensure that the new market being created for doctors and the health insurance companies remains of competitive and fair. We are determined to an effective national competition policy to stamp out anti-competitive practices. is about time some members of the medical into profession recognised that. It is well known around this place that the AMA writes coalition health policy. They told the opposition to oppose the reforms introduced by the Minister for Human Services and Health. They tried and they failed. Now we see plan B from the AMA, with scheming to collude on fees. I have bad news for them: they will fail there also. Minister for Human Services and Health",51
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Minister for Human Services and Health to her answer to a previous question. Minister, is it not a fact that, contrary to what you told the royal commission last week and what you confirmed in parliament a moment ago, you did know there was a prohibition on using the names of people involved in Family Court matters? Is it not a fact that you corresponded with the Council for Civil Liberties in Western Australia on this very matter several months before the Easton petition was presented to parliament? Is it not a fact that, as a result of the council's concerns about the secrecy provisions of the act, you even asked your former Attorney-General, Mr Berinson, to consider the matter? Is it not a fact that public meetings were held in your electorate, articles were published in your local suburban media and petitions were collected on the subject-all prior to the Easton petition? not a fact that nine days before the petition was tabled, after a reform committee of the Council for Civil Liberties sent you a report drawing attention to the consequences of the secrecy provisions of section 121, you wrote back to them thanking them? Given all of that, Minister, why did you say on oath that you did not know about those provisions, and how can anyone believe anything you say?",52
66,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What we have here from the Leader of the Opposition is very clearly an agenda that I recognise after the fact because very considerable publicity has been given to this matter in recent years, principally by Barbara Campbell and the Council for Civil Liberties-yes, I am aware of that. But, interestingly, they campaigned against, particularly at the last election, secrecy in the Family Court. They have actually campaigned against it. The last election, I remind you, was in 1993. Indeed, Miss Barbara Campbell stood against me and this was part of the platform. I would suggest to you that the Council for Civil Liberties in Western Australia is that in name only. It is in the hands of a very conservative group of people, including a Mr Weygers and Miss Barbara Campbell and, frankly, I would take little notice of any correspondence they may have had with me. Anybody who has been active in Western Australian politics will know that one of the travesties of Western Australian public life is that the Council for Civil Liberties is controlled by a group of very conservati ve people. For example, you try finding out what their constitution is. You try finding out when they meet. You try finding out what the principles of association are. I told the royal commission that I did not know the details of that question. You can read it back to me if you like. That was my honestly held recollection. If in the course of corresponding with 50,000 constituents a year this matter may have been raised, that is not tantamount to my own knowledge, whatever members opposite may say. We can see very clearly what is being attempted to be done here. Everybody on this side can see that. You may wish to Is it run the lines of Miss Barbara Campbell, Mr Peter Weygers and the Council for Civil Liberties, but I think you will find that they are not wen regarded amongst those people who have a genuine concern for civil liberties. They have not in many cases actually stood up for people whose civil liberties have been under threat. So they are not a body in Western Australia for which I have any respect at all. Fringe Benefits Tax",52
67,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has he seen reports recommending the abolition of the fringe benefits tax? What would be the effect of abolishing the fringe benefits tax on the fairness of the tax system?,52
68,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the member for Page, I can say I have seen reports recommending the abolition of the fringe benefits tax. Indeed, it was reported in the Courier Mail of 9 September that the National Party of Australia would abolish the fringe benefits tax in a coalition government's second term of office, according to a resolution passed at its annual conference on the previous day. That was the 75th conference of the National Party in Canberra that weekend. The resolution proposed exempting small business and state and local governments from the fringe benefits tax in the first term of a coalition government. The resolution called for the FBT to be totally abolished in a coalition government's second term of office. What that shows, I suggest, is that the people who moved that resolution at the National Party conference have no idea about tax policy whatever, because that would mean that one of the key elements of ensuring that we have equity and decency in the tax system would be destroyed. Just bear in mind why the fringe benefits tax was brought in. It was brought in because an increasing proportion of income was being paid to people in non-cash forms on which no tax was paid-a loophole in the tax system that was increasingly exploited. Of course, if we were to go back to a system of no fringe benefits tax, then it would be massively exploited in the future. Take an example of the way in which remuneration is paid even now with the fringe benefits tax. Quite commonly, in the finance industry, people get payments into cash management trusts instead of payments as part of salary. That draws fringe benefits tax at the present time. In the absence of a fringe benefits tax, it would be completely untaxed. These cash management trusts can be dissolved at any time and converted into cash. They are as good as being put into your pay packet. But they would be untaxed. What justice would there be in going back to a system like that? But that is what the National Party, in all its wisdom, is proposing should be done-there should be open slather for people on high incomes to get massive amounts of income without paying tax. In other words, we would go back to the system that the Leader of the Opposition was quite happy to preside over for all the 51,4 years he was Treasurer under the Fraser government. It would be just a travesty of justice and tax equity for this to happen. It involves not just cash management trusts; there are a whole raft of ways in which income can be given to people in a non-cash form. There are things like holidays, the membership of clubs, the payment of school fees, boats, and housekeepers. You name it; there is an unending array of possibilities. That unending array of possibilities would be completely exploited. It is extraordinary that a party running for office in this country, pretending that it has the credentials to be part of a government of this country, can seriously pass a resolution of that kind. It raises issues about the opposition more generally and the Liberal Party as well. We know that the Leader of the Opposition and his various spokesmen are going around the country hinting and winking to various business groups that they will make some changes, at least to the fringe benefits tax system. If not saying outright that they will abolish it, they are at least saying that they will make some changes to it. Sometimes, they put it under the code of reducing compliance costs. We know, having recently been through the process of looking at reducing compliance costs and making a number of changes to the system to reduce those compliance costs, that you cannot do it without losing substantial amounts of tax revenue. We did it on a tax neutral basis by raising the fringe benefits tax on one form of the system. We equated the total amount of revenue. But unless you do something like that, you cannot furtherMr Katter- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I personally have been misrepresented by what the minister is saying. I moved that resolution. It is about the miners from Mount Isa; it is not about any",52
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat. There is no point of order. I know you are here.,53
70,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank that member from the National Party for his interjection. I can understand his excitement, because the stupidity of the National Party's resolution is being exposed. It is the Liberal Party's propothat sal, as I was saying, to in some way amend the fringe benefits tax system and punch some holes in that tax. They will have the opportunity even tomorrow to start to do that, if they want, when a bill on the FBT comes before the House. If they want to give effect to their resolution, the National Party can start to take some action tomorrow. We will see whether they really do believe what they passed as their resolution. The tax raises, at the moment, $2.1 billion. As I said before, that is $2.1 billion that we would not get without this tax. But if we did not have it, there would be massive amounts of other income loss going through the fringe benefits loophole. To take it away or to punch holes in it is the most extraordinarily obtuse and stupid policy for an opposition or any party in this country to have. It goes over well when you are talking to business groups, but it is stupid tax policy. It goes back to the kind of system which the opposition followed when they were in government last time. What they are really saying is, 'Elect us and we will go back to the sort of system that applied under John Howard when he was Treasurer last time.' That will mean loopholes and tax inequity everywhere. That is the kind of system they will have. It is not just confined to the FBT. We see exactly the same sort of thing in terms of the concessions that are being talked about all over the place by the honourable member for Pearce, who represents the opposition on small business, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Goldstein and probably various others. They are going around the country with nods and winks about what they will do for people in terms of the capital gains tax. They will ease the burden of capital gains tax on small business or some other section of business. Again, the same principle applies. The capital gains tax is all about tax equity. If you do not tax it, then income will go through as capital gains without any tax being paid. Is anyone saying that is really a fair system? If the opposition thinks that it is fair, then stand up and say so. The whole history of this country shows that it is tax stupid not to have a capital gains tax. Most countries in the Western world have one precisely because not to have one means that you have a wide open avenue for avoidance of taxation as well as for loss of equity in the system. What we have from this opposition increasingly is evidence that they would in government be the kind of government that they were last time-a government that allowed the tax system to corrode away, that allowed all the loopholes to be exploited and that allowed the system to be punched open by not having the blockers of things like fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax-and that they would allow this tax system to come into massive disrepute, the way they did shockingly in the period up until 1983. Wanneroo",53
71,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Last week you spoke on Perth radio of so-called 'federal interests' in the matter surrounding corrupt behaviour by gaoled former Wanneroo mayor, Dr Wayne Bradshaw, and others. My constituents who live in the city of Wanneroo want to know what are these so-called 'federal interests' and whether or not you were just grandstanding to try to take the heat off the Minister for Human Services and Health?",54
72,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Actually, Paul, I was after your antagonists. That is basically what I had to say on that occasion. I think that you have right on your side in this particular instance. Let me enumerate the federal interests in any particular area of local government. Fifty per cent of their funds, of course, come from the federal government. If there is substantial misspending of those resources, then that would be a matter of interest to us. Last time. I looked, too, as far as the taxation act was concerned, proceeds from bribery were still subject to taxation. That would also be a matter of some interest as far as the federal government is concerned. I also made it absolutely clear in the remarks that I made that those remarks should not be regarded as foreshadowing an intention by the federal government to necessarily go down this road at all. What those remarks went to was the absolute necessity for Richard Court to establish a proper inquiry into the affairs of Wanneroo-a view that I know you share since you are, in fact, associated with a petition to secure precisely that. Indeed, Richard Court's situation is made more difficult by his Deputy Premier who indicated during the course of the last week on precisely this matter, 'How could you possibly on those insubstantial things, with which I disagreed at the time, conduct a royal commission on the affairs that the minister for health has been targeted with by Richard Court and not hold one on Wanneroo?' A very good point by the Deputy Premier, I thought. 'How could you possibly go down that road,' said the Deputy Premier and National Party leader in Western Australia, 'a road, Richard, incidentally, which I told you not to go down as you would be simply looking malicious and looking as though you were targeting a person politically and then find yourself where you, front and centre, have precisely the sorts of things that royal commissions are called into, and then fail to call a royal commission into that?' Indeed, I noticed that Hendy Cowan's views on that were echoed today by a National Party member of the Legislative Assembly. As I understand it, his views had been echoed earlier in the week by two former Liberals who are now members of the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia. I understand  a royal commission or some other form of inquiry like a royal commission into the affairs of Wanneroo Inc. And well he might. There was some inquiry put in place into those affairs by the Lawrence government under the auspices of Peter Kyle, who I understand is a card carrying member of the Liberal Party. Mr Kyle got himself into this situation: he was unable to have Dr Wayne Bradshaw interviewed for that inquiry. As I understand it, Dr Wayne Bradshaw, a former prominent Liberal and one of your antagonists, has since gone to gaol. The Kyle report found this: There is little doubt that Bradshaw formed and a faction. This group consisted of active Liberal Party people and members of the Moore division of the Liberal Party. Since then, Mr Court has had some secret inquiry into the affairs of, more specifically, Liberal MLA Wayde Smith. Liberal MLA Wayde Smith was invited to explain himself to a secret inquiry as to how, as an officer on a salary of $35,000, he was able to service loans in excess of $1 million for a considerable period of time. I understand that that particular inquiry exonerated Mr Smith, though the reasons for that were never in fact tabled by the Premier-and we are not privy to reasons why that was the case. There is absolutely no doubt in the mind of anybody in Western Australia-there is no doubt in your mind nor in the minds of your Deputy Premier in Western Australia, the dissident Liberals in Western Australia and the Liberal Party in Western Australia-that there ought to be an inquiry into Wanneroo Inc. and that it should be organised by the state government. Without any question, it should be organised by the state government and/or the state parliament. That is precisely what ought to proceed. As the minister who is responsible for the finances of the Commonwealth and responsible for seeing those funds doled out, I naturally have a federal interest in making absolutely certain that Richard Court does go through the process of establishing a royal commission into the affairs of Wanneroo. I am delighted to be in such eminent conservative company across the board in that conviction, and I note also in recent times in the eminent conservative company of yourself as far as those affairs are concerned. I conclude with Hendy Cowan again: how could you possibly set up a rort like that associated with this inquiry into the situation of a minister for health in which you purely politically target someone for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with corrupt behaviour, absolutely nothing to do with maladministration and, now we know from the royal commissioner, absolutely nothing to do with misleading parliament, absolutely nothing to do with the differential rememled brances of cabinet meetings? It has everything to do apparently with whether or not the then Premier would have placed herself in contempt of parliament by interfering with a petition that we now know was drafted solely by the Legislative Council clerk, solely on the advice of Mr Easton and Mr Howard, and solely presented to Mr Easton and Mr Howard-facts now known by Mr Hendy Cowan obviously as reasons for deprecating the notion that there ought to have been a royal commission organised into that. How could you possibly do that and then sit in the front and centre of the responsibility the administration of justice in Western shortfall Australia-two councillors convicted of do corruption, a whole cloud hanging over the affairs of the branches of that area-and not have a royal commission on that? I do not think that it is necessary to expend Commonrock wealth funds on going down that course. But, as a Commonwealth minister who is at the end of the day responsible for the funds that do half the business of the city of Wanneroo, I sure as heck would like to see young RichIn ard do it.

73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member culties for Mackellar! Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander,56
74,Mr HA VILAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. What steps is government taking to protect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art and cultural expresaboriginal sion? What has been the reaction to those actions?,56
75,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. The first point I should make is that the government does accept that indigenous art does require additional protection above that which applies generally for those involved in creative enterprise. We have regarded this for some time as an area for priority attention and in the Creative Nation statement the Prime Minister acknowledged that reconsomething ciliation with Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples required also simple! additional protection for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. That is not to say that the existing law does not already provide some degree of protecO'Connor. tion. The Copyright Act does provide for contemporary Aboriginal artists a degree of protection. A couple of recent cases in the Federal Court illustrate that. The Aboriginal carpets case was an example. Some contemrecent porary Aboriginal design was applied to approach carpets which were for sale, in breach of the copyright of the Aboriginal makers of those designs. The Federal Court action was successful. There is a range of measures available to of Aboriginal artists already but the principal of that range of remedies is that they not really recognise the specific traditional background for much of Aboriginal art. They certainly do not go to art which is part of a historical ownership of an Aboriginal group-art or totemic art, for example. That kind of design, outside the life of the artist plus 50 years, which is the copyright protection period, is at large under the copyright regime and can be misused-and frequently has been. addition, there are problems with collective ownership of design, or community ownership, which is the frequent pattern of Aboriginal cultural expression. There are also diffiwith cultural activities which are not fixed by recording on paper or canvas-works of art such as dance and the like. Art For that reason, the government commissioned and circulated a discussion paper the called Stopping the rip-offs. That was launched by me and my colleague the minister for affairs in Melbourne some time ago and has attracted something like 50 submissions in the course of its circulation. That puts into context what I think have been fairly disappointing and negative remarks by the shadow spokesperson in relation to Aboriginal affairs. She accused the government of inaction.",56
76,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You haven't done anything.,56
77,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,She suggested that all forgeries could be stopped through the adoption of like a unique symbol or seal to be stamped on indigenous art. If only it was so,56
78,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have done nothing.,56
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for,56
80,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I must congratulate the shadow minister because even this spurious press release probably passes as the most significant announcement of opposition policy in the past. The truth is that we need to this with respect to all those issues that were addressed in the Stopping the ripoffs publication. We are taking the Stopping the rip-offs paper, the discussion paper and the work that has come through the 50 submissions back to Aboriginal communities next month. Just one of the many options that will be looked at is some form of mark that can be associated with legitimate Aboriginal works. Opposition members-Oh!",56
81,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not surprising that that issue would be raised. It was raised in the consultation process. Criticism then flows to us-having initiated the process-for inaction. The borrowing in this regard is by the opposition-of ideas which have been initiated by the government. It is quite a contemptuous process to find that. But, truthfullyOpposition members-Oh!",57
82,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Contempt is evident here for an issue which I think is of real significance and which the government has treated with regard for Aboriginal communities through an extensive consultation process-not just coming up with quick fix answers, which are borrowed from the government's processes in any case, but looking at the issue range of measures which will include looking at amendments to the Copyright Act and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act and, as the discussion paper canvasses, the enactment of some additional special legislation which has been recommended in almost all the submissions that we have received-and doing that against a background where we are going to go back to the Aboriginal communities and make certain that they agree with that process. That seems to me to be a much more strategic and correct approach than the trivial suggestion that the government has been inactive in a field when in fact it has been leading the way. Minister for Human Services and Health",57
83,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I address my question to the Minister for Human Services and Health. I refer the minister to her demonstrated expertise in the academic disciplines of memory loss and statistics. Government members-That was yesterday!,57
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my right! The Attorney-General and the member for Macarthur!,57
85,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Your job is to keep order in the House.,57
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And I'll do that by sitting you down unless you get to your question.,57
87,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On a point of order: I have been standing here for about 30 seconds while members of the Labor Party continually interject.,57
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Get to your question!,57
89,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think it would be appropriate for you to exert some authority and have some silence. I will start the question again. I refer the minister to her demonstrated expertise in the academic disciplines of memory loss and statistics. What is the statistical probability that seven former cabinet ministers would all suffer collective amnesia of an event and, moreover, that they would all suffer the terrible affliction of a collective fantasy in which they imagined detailed recollections of dates, conversations as one of a and a course of events?",57
90,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have just been reminded of a fairly improbable failure of recollection by the member who has just asked the question. Apparently, when he was accused of giving a speech to the League of Rights, he first claimed that it was a Christian organisation and that he had not really realised that it was the League of Rights he was speaking to. He changed his view under pressure. Members behind me have also reminded me of the member's signal failure, which was the beginning of his decline which now sees him sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition, when he did not know what the state of play was in relation to the opposition's policy on land rights in the Northern Territory. The opposition leader himself in recent times has been unclear about whether he had discussions with Richard Court or the member for Chisholm. He was prepared to forgive the member for O'Connor because, after all, it was some time ago that matters that he had frankly lied about were drawn to the public's attention. Mr Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, has said on a number of occasions that he does not think voters expect the truth during election campaigns. So, when we have questions here about remembering and truthtelling, I hope that members opposite will examine their own performance very closely. I hope, too, that they will examine the performance of one of their favoured sons in Western Australia very closely. I mentioned earlier a current failure of recollection by the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, about when it was that he was told that he had been exonerated in relation to police investigations. He told the royal commission today-and I repeat it-that he was told between 4 o'clock and 7 o'clock on the day the petition was tabled by a member of his staff. He told the parliament in Western Australia in 1992 that he had personally rung the commissioner himself-and he said two dates, the Thursday morning and the Friday morning-and the police had told him that he had been cleared and the matter was no longer under investigation. Curiously today, again, we have a very clear change of recollections by the Premier of Western Australia. He has always had some trouble recalling precisely when it was, and from whom, he got the minutes-minutes almost certainly improperly provided to him from a company known as Goldrock. For the first time today, a transcript of the police interview between Detective Sergeant Rollinson and Mr Court has been released. This interview took place in I think 1992. I will find the exact date for you. I am sorry, it does not give a date. I am happy to circulate the record of the interview. It does not give a clear date, I am sorry-not one that I can read, anyway. In it the Premier of Western Australia-the Leader of the Opposition as he was then-said to the policeman: As far as the minutes gothese are the Goldrock minutesthe minutes Jid not come from Withers. To my knowledge thr:y just arrived. That was after I first started debating the Exim business. Basically what I did with Withers is I just wanted to confirm whether this was correct. He did not get the papers from Withers. They just arrived from somewhere. He did talk with Withers about them to confirm they were correct. It is my understanding that Withers was a member of the board. He goes on to say: You know what has been going on as described in the documentation was correct. So the conversations I had with Withers at the time, that is going back a while, basically confirmed what took place. Do you know who it was that he told the commission today gave him the minutes? Withers. Mr Tim Fischer-Is the minister prepared to table the dateless document she was quoting from?",57
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the minister prepared to table those documents? Are they public documents?,58
92,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They have personal notes on them.,58
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are personal notes. There is no need for them to be tabled. Opposition members-Oh!,58
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister said there were personal notes contained on them. Mr Costello--This is worse than Leo.,58
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will withdraw the reflection on the chair that he just made. Mr Costello--I withdraw the reflection. Uniform Credit Legislation,58
96,Mr KNOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs and concerns uniform credit legislation which is due to commence in March next year. This is of great concern to my constituents. Has the minister seen reports which suggest that in two Australian states uniform credit legislation is being delayed and will not meet the deadline? How would such a delay affect the code?,58
97,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I have seen the report in the Financial Review this morning that two states, Western Australia and Tasmania, may not have the uniform credit legislation passed by 30 September. This is the legislation which we have been waiting for for years and which consumers, industries and banks want, but we have to get it passed by all states. It is required that it be passed by all states and territories by 30 September in order to have it in operation by March next year. Today, my office has been in touch with both those states. I understand the Tasmanian government is doing everything it can to ensure it meets the 30 September deadline. The minister responsible is trying to get the legislation listed in the upper house for next week and anticipates no problems in getting it passed immediately. In Western Australia my advice is that if there is a delay in passing the legislation it will be a matter of only a couple of weeks. Everyone has been waiting for this legislation for so long. It is up to the states to pass it. All I can do is encourage and urge them to make sure it is passed in time. If not, I will ask my colleagues at the consumer ministers council to review their decision of 9 May this year which allowed for the extension of the date of implementation. I remain absolutely confident that those two states will join all the other states and territories and have this legislation passed in time and therefore give consumers the uniform credit legislation which they have been waiting for for so long.",58
98,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Photographs in House of Representatives",59
99,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question to you, Mr Speaker, regarding a letter to the president of the parliamentary press gallery, which was forwarded by the Serjeant-at-Arms, in respect of the rules and regulations governing the taking of photographs during sessions in the House of Representatives. My question is, first, who initiated the letter? On what basis has the letter proposed an effective change in the arrangements? You will appreciate that there have been arrangements in place for some time now, but I think on a fair reading of the letter and the rules that there has been a change to the rules. I looked at a couple of papers and I have a photograph from this morning's Australian. I ask you to indicate whether you think that would be reasonable. If you took a very limited view of these rules and regulations you would say that that photograph did not comply. My view of that photograph is that it is perfectly reasonable and no-one could object to it. I am assuming that this new regulation was promulgated on the basis that someone was unhappy with the photograph on page 6 of today's Sydney Morning Herald. By way of explanation, I refer members-and you, Mr Speaker-to the attachment to the rules and regulations. Point (e) reads: The Member with the call should be the focal point of all photographs with the exception of general photographs of the Chamber in which both sides of the floor of the Chamber are shown. That is the rule. But in the letter it goes on to say that in future only photographs taken from the front of the person addressing the dispatch box or the parliament should be taken. This is on the assumption that federal members of parliament are somehow more attractive from the front than they are from behind. The focal point of the photograph in today's Sydney Morning Herald is the fact that the Minister for Human Services and Health is on her feet answering a question from the opposition. It is true that the photograph incorporates our reaction, but it is not true to say, in my view, that somehow that breaches what I would consider a reasonable interpretation of Chamber the rule that the photographs have to feature and have as a central element the person at the dispatch box. The minister was the central element yesterday and that photograph portrays her as the central element. Yes, it includes reaction, but that is incidental to the fact that the minister was at the dispatch box and clearly was-I do not wish to inject a political note-enjoying as difficult a day as she had today. Under those circumstances, my questions are these. Who initiated the change? Why is it necessary that in future you can only have a photograph from the front and not from the back? I appreciate that the Prime Minister is sensitive but, if he is sensitive, I should be twice as sensitive. Has the letter been solely prompted by today's photographs? If so, why hasn't there been a complaint in respect of other photographs? I have not conducted an intensive search, but some photographs have been supplied to me. I believe that a lot of photographs which would be in breach of today's ruling have been allowed to go through in the last 12 months. Quite frankly, I would like to know why we have to have a change. Could we have an explanation? If there are to be changes there should be some discussion about what is reasonable and what should be acceptable practice?",59
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"In respect of the history of photographers being admitted to this chamber to take photographs of both sides, it was an arrangement that was agreed to in consultation with the whips at some stage in the past. I think the arrangement has always been, as specified in the guidelines which were issued at the time, that photographers would be on both sides and, as you rightly pointed out, paragraph (e) of the arrangements said that the member with the call should be the focal point. At some stage, also in the past, instructions were given to the Sound and Vision Office in which the same concern was expressed about the freedom with which some of the coverage of this House was being directed. For the sake of consistency, it was decided to review the situation in respect of that matter. Subsequentyou, ly, the instruction has now gone out from me-and no-one else-and it came as a result of my looking at the newspapers this morning. It is not the first time that I have had concerns about the way in which photographers have notionally focused on the person with the call. But 1 do not think, objectively, anyone could say that a blurred figure at the bottom who was actually the person responding at the dispatch box was the focal point and had the call. It simply is to bring in line still photography with the television photography in this place. As I say, it simply came as a result of my looking at the papers this morning.",60
101,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, as I understand it, the rules in respect of photography come under your discretion. More generally, though, in respect of the broadcast there is a parliamentary committee. I think it would be useful for us to consider whether or not there should be some involvement of the committee as a means by which we can have some involvement and consultation on this process.",60
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I think the honourable member for Flinders has raised a genuine concern about the matter. I will look at ways in which that might be facilitated for the future in establishing those guidelines. Televising of Proceedings,60
103,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. On Channel 9 last night, film was shown of the Prime Minister taking a point of order. Have the rules changed on the film that may be used by the television stations? If not, would you care to get a copy of the film and advise the House?",60
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I will certainly have a look at the issue that the honourable member for Curtin has raised. Mobile Phone Base Stations,60
105,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. In July the state member for Manly in the New South Wales parliament collected signatures on a petition addressed to as Speaker of the House of Representatives, protesting against the Telstra mobile phone base station at Harbord kindergarten. Dr Macdonald sent the original, signed by 528 people, to the Minister for Communicasome tions and the Arts on 21 July, and he sent a photocopy to me. As of yesterday, the minister had not lodged the original with the Bills and Papers Office for tabling, nor had he returned the original to the state member for Manly. In the light of the Prime Minister's comment yesterday that not tabling a petition is possibly a contempt of parliament, I ask: would you facilitate in this case the tabling of a photocopy by me? I am certainly prepared to do it, and the Minister for Communications and the Arts plainly is not.",60
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I think it is an issue that you had better take up with the Minister Communications and the Arts. I do not think on this. it is within my prerogative in this House to take that further. I am, after all, the recipient of the petitions that are lodged by members. So I suggest that, having raised it here now, you again take it up with the minister.",61
107,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have already taken it up a point of order. with the minister during an adjournment debate. The petition was addressed to you, Mr Speaker, as the guardian of the rights and privileges of this House, and to the members of this House. We heard the Prime Minister say yesterday that not to table a petition is a contempt of parliament. The minister is refusing to table the petition. I am asking whether it would be possible for you to allow me to table the petition, because I am very happy to do so. If the minister will not hand over the original, may I table a photocopy?",61
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"My understanding is that originals only are acceptable in this place. Therefore, your question about whether you can table a photocopy is not appropriate. Mr Abbott-Under the standing order. I am not quite sure.",61
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"No, I do not want to debate the issue. Mr Abbott-Would you write to the movers minister asking him to go ahead and table the petition?",61
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"No, I will not. You can ask him. NA",61
111,Mr KATTER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I Isa wish to make a personal representation.",61
112,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Do you claim to have been misrepresented?,61
113,Mr KA TTER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I do.",61
114,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,61
115,Mr KATTER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I was the person referred to by Minister Willis when he talked about the abolition of the fringe benefits tax, because I moved a series of those motions. It had absolutely nothing to do with corporate executives. I do not have any of those in electorate. The miners at Mount Isa, the truth of the matter is",61
116,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I think you are debating for an issue, not making a personal explanation",61
117,Mr KATTER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"With all due respect, Mr Speaker, let me complete the sentence I was in the middle of. The miners at Mount Isa",61
118,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"No. Resume your seat. The member for Leichhardt I think is taking Mr Dodd-I take a point of order, and I have taken this one before on standing order 64. I again refer to the House of Representatives Practice which says, 'In making a personal explanation a member must not debate the matter and not deal with matters affecting his or her party.' That is clearly what the member for Kennedy is doing. It is an abuse of the procedure.",61
119,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"As I said yesterday, personal explanations are to show where you have been personally misrepresented on a particular issue. My recollection is that the minister's response you are referring to did not specifically refer to you, so how you could then infer that he was talking about you",61
120,Mr KA TTER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker, the minister specifically said 'the of these resolutions', and I was one of the movers of the resolutions, so it could not have been more specifically attributed to me.",61

123,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,You are now debating the issue. Resume your seat. NA Microphones Reflections on Chair,61
124,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"My question is directed to you, Mr Speaker, and it is in two parts. The first is in relation to the use of these micromy phones. Once today and once yesterday I noticed that when opposition people rose to speak the microphones were not turned on; I could not hear them. That was in the case of the member for Warringah yesterday, and in the case of the member who just spoke, the member for Kennedy. I have also noticed from time to time that when the Prime Minister rises to speak when it is not his turn that the microphones are immediately turned on. I would like some sort of ruling from you as to what are the rules about the technicians turning on the microphones, because I think it is important that we have a fair use of the microphones and that it is not a matter for technicians to make a decision as to how you might or might not rule on a matter. The second part of my question is this: I notice that you made a member of the opposition withdraw a comment when he drew a comparison between you and your predecessor, Mr MCLeay. I would like to know if you have interpreted that any comparison between you and Mr MCLeay is to be considered odious and therefore may not be made.",61
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"No. In reference to the second point, I will say to the honourable member for Mackellar that it is becoming a little frequent in this place for reflections to be made on the chair. I have at this point chosen to ignore that, but I give fair warning now that that is something which will change, and I hope everyone has taken note of that. In respect of the first issue about microphones, the person that has the call from the chair has only that microphone turned on. The only other microphone which is always active in this place in fact is the microphone that relates to the chair. In respect of the inference regarding the Prime Minister's microphone, I do not think that is correct; in fact, I know that is not correct. Even if he does stand from time to time, which I accept he is prone to do, that microphone is not turned on because I know the difference from here to there when microphones are on. It is only the microphone of the member with the call and this microphone at the chair which are live. NA",62

127,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Kooyong proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The increase in inequality under the Keating government and the government's failure to admit the facts to the Australian people. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",62
128,Mr GEORGIOU,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Kooyong) (4.30 p.m.)It is a tragedy that in the last decades of the 20th century, Australia, which is potentially one of the world's richest societies, has become more unequal. It is a disgrace that this growth in inequality has been presided over by the longest serving federal Labor government in Australia's history. It is a scandal that Labor has tried to deny, disguise and divert from this reality. Through decades of rhetoric in opposition and years of propaganda in government, Labor has tried to build a myth about being the standard-bearer of progress and equality. The reality is that the Hawke-Keating government has not been the party of social progress. It has been the party of regression. It has been the party that has made the least well off, worse off. Labor cannot admit this, because it would then be very hard to masquerade as the inheritors of Chifley and Curtin; to mouth the platitudes of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about the true believers, about social justice and about inclusiveness; to drip venom about the so-called straighteners. It would be very hard if Labor admitted the truth that under their governance the poor have been made poorer. Let us look at the facts. Let us see what the working class warriors have done to the lowest paid workers. Let us look at the wages and salaries that people actually earn. The increase in inequality is clear. Earlier this year, EPAC produced new statistics on earnings at the behest of the Prime Minister. These showed that in 1994 the lowest paid earners earned less in real terms than in 1983. In fact, they earned more in 1983 than in any of the Hawke-Keating years, bar one. Over the same period, the earnings of the highest paid workers increased by almost 20 per cent. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has delicately described this as 'some increase in earnings disparities'. You have to give him something; he has a certain Sir Humphrey way with words. The brutal reality is that under Labor the gap between the highest and lowest earning employees is larger than it was under Malco1m Fraser. Under that Prime Minister, who Labor claimed was a social reactionary, under the man that they dubbed the 'Squire of Nareen', the least well paid workers earned more in real terms than they have under the Silver Bodgie or the boy from Bankstown. I will make one further point about earnings. Of the 12 countries compared in the OECD report from which the EPAC statistics were drawn, only three countries experienced a real fall in the wages of the bottom 10 per cent of workers: Australia, Canada and the US. Mr Anderson-Really?",63
129,Mr GEORGIOU,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, and the fall in Australia was in fact larger than the fall in the United States. In the United Kingdomsometimes it is referred to on the other side of the chamber in the context of debates-the earnings of the bottom 10 per cent of workers actually increased in real terms by 11 per cent. So tell us about negotiations some time.",63
130,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Under the dreaded Thatcher.,63
131,Mr GEORGIOU,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Under the dreaded Thatcher. Those opposite do not like that but, unfortunately, it happens to be correct. Mr Chynoweth-You should have a look there.",63
132,Mr GEORGIOU,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Let us forget earnings. Let us look at income.,63
133,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You can go and live there if you want to.,63
134,Mr GEORGIOU,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I do not think he would. Income takes into account not only wages, but also pensions, supplements and social security benefits. The income statistics are unequivocal. Under the Hawke-Keating government, income inequality has increased. This is the judgment of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, the Social Policy Research Centre and many others. In fairness, it has to be said that statistics are one dimensional. If we want to vividly understand what the Labor Party has done to this society we have to look at the landmark study by Bob Gregory and Boyd Hunter, which shows how our society is changing for the worse. It shows a society in which 'income distribution has become more unequal and the change is extraordinary'; a society in which 'there is a significant increase in the geographical polarisation of household income'; a society in which 'the poor are increasingly living together in one set of neighbourhoods and the rich in another set'; a society in which 'the economic gap is widening' . How does Labor respond to this devastating picture? It is simple: Labor denies that it exists; it has not happened, it is a mirage. It is a mirage caused by-once again we hear the minister's delicate phrase-'compositional change in the bottom one per cent of areas' . What Labor is saying essentially is that its policy of targeting public housing concentrates the poor in some neighbourhoods. So the poor are not really getting poorer; they just look as if they are getting poorer. Leaving aside the public policy implications-by deliberate act of policy-of congregating the poor in a limited set of neighbourhoods, and leaving aside the pathologies that this is likely create, the fact is that Labor's myth is not true. The facts are as follows. Labor's policies have hit the overwhelming majority of neighbourhoods, not just the bottom one per cent. In 70 per cent of Australia's neighbourhoods-yes, 70 per cent-average household income fell in absolute terms. Seventy per cent is a rather large 'compositional change'! Between 1976 and 1991, in the least affluent five per cent of neighbourhoods, average household incomes fell by over $7,000 in real terms. The income gap between the top and bottom five per cent of neighbourhoods almost doubled to over $20,000. But Labor says, 'Don't you worry about that, things can't be all that bad; there has been a massive increase in household disposable income.' That is what the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social Security have said. The Minister for Social Security has said in this House that between 1983 and 1995 'real household disposable incomes have increased by 40 per cent'. The Prime Minister says, 'Of course there has been a massive improvement.' He said it is 'certainly 40 per cent for households'. One prominent social affairs correspondent who, for some obscure reason, takes the government's witterings on seriously, reports that 'after-tax family incomes have increased by 37 per cent under Labor'. Nothing could be further from the truth. Nothing. Real household disposable income is the combined income of all Australian households on an after inflation, after tax basis. Comparing March 1983 and June 1995 it increased by $19.48 billion. At the same time, the number of households increased by 1.55 million. Once the increase in households is taken into account, average real household incomes have increased by a miserable 4.1 per cent over the 12 years of Labor government. On a yearly basis, this is next to nothing. The fact is that the real household disposable income figures once again drive home that Labor has made the least well-off Australians worse off. Those opposite are very quiet. Labor has not run out of ingenuity; it is to very good at sloganeering. It has found a very nice phrase, a new light on the hill, 'the social wage'. That has a nice feel about it. It is very warm and very fuzzy. The social wage has been blessed by the unions and by the Accord, and questioning it sends Labor quite ballistic. Buckle your harnesses because you are about to be encouraged to go into orbit. The claim that the social wage offsets income and wage inequalities is a sham. Listen carefully, because if your ministers have told you that the social wage is your way of avoiding that ugly data on income inequality, they are doing a Carmen Demidenko number on you. You see it every day, and you know it does not work. The first version of the social wage is put forward by the Minister for Social Securityand it is simple. Very simply, it is a totally outrageous con. It adds together all federal government expenditure on education, housing and child care, divides it by the total population, allocates the product to each individual and, gee whiz, we are all, every Australianevery man, woman and child in this country-$1,774 better off than we thought we were. Gee, you guys are clever! The only problem is that no-one believes you. Not even the true believers believe you. But it is worse than that. Labor calculates that the increase in the social wage since 1983 is $767 for each Australian. Tell me: how close does this come to compensating for the thousands of dollars cut from the household incomes of the least well off? It goes nowhere. The second version of the social wage used by Labor is based on models created by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. These models allocate state and federal expenditure on health, education and housing to different household types and they indicate that the lowest income groups get the most benefit from the social wage. There are some problems however. A big problem is that the models do not report on actual incomes. They report on constructed, adjusted, hypothetical, 'equivalent' incomes. When real incomes are used, it becomes clear that the social wage is not progressive and does not compensate for the growth in inequality. In short and in truth, given what real people earn in the real world, Labor's claims about the social wage are a sham. On the basis of actual incomes, the lowest eaming 40 per cent of households received 35.5 per cent of the social wage. The top earning 40 per cent of households received 46.6 per cent. You guys are really accomplishing something! Just in case Labor thinks it can still wrap some shreds of its tattered egalitarian myth around itself, let me tell you about education and the working class. Education has always been a classic mode of mobility in this society. Through the 1960s and 1970s there was a movement towards increased equality of access to tertiary education by children from the least well-off families. The HawkeKeating government reversed this. The regression is tracked in a study by the Australian Council for Educational Research on the transition to higher education of students completing year 12. In 1980, under Malcolm Fraser, 48 per cent of students from the least affluent quarter of the population entered higher education. In 1989, that proportion had fallen to 35 per cent. That is an absolute disgrace. Australia has not always been as equal as we would like to imagine. The historic treatment of Australia's indigenous peoples and our failure to address their disadvantage emphasises the gap between social values and effective action. Nonetheless, the value placed on egalitarianism, on a fair go for all, on improving the opportunities, income and capacities of the least well-off, has been a social light on the hill. It has not been monopolised by the Labor Party, despite their myths. It is something that has been shared by the whole of our society. The egalitarian commitment has contributed to our nation's progress by nurturing and liberating talent and by promoting unity and cohesion amidst the diversity which is inherent in a society that draws 25 per cent of its population from overseas. It has enhanced Australians' capacity to enjoy their lives. Under the Hawke-Keating government, Australia's commitment to egalitarianism has been betrayed and the implications for our society are profound. Labor has created an environment which is foreign to us, to our values and to our experience. It has created a society in which the least well-off are getting worse off, a society that compounds disadvantage and wastes talent. We have to confront this corrosion of egalitarianism in our society and the first and fundamental step is to recognise what has happened. Labor has perpetuated a myth designed to deceive ordinary Australians and its own true believers. This myth will be exploded and the people who perpetuate it will suffer the electoral devastation for which their actions have made them liable.",63
135,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I congratulate the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) on having finally, in his party, discovered that there are poor and working-class people in our society. He is quite a unique individual within his party. I am very pleased to see that he has been able to overcome the massive disadvantages he has within his party and actually discover that there is an important section of our community that is underprivileged and deserves support. I also urge that he be involved in all the policy making formulations wi thin his party because there are many other members of his party who are intent on cutting and slashing all of the government programs and support programs that are directed towards assisting the very people that the honourable member for Kooyong has indicated in his speech today he has considerable concern for. We need to be very careful in our analysis of the selective statistics that the honourable member for Kooyong introduced in his address today and in questioning whether or not he is prepared to stand up for what he believes in, as he has stated here today, and to ensure that within his party's policieswhenever we find out what those policies are-there will be a retention of all the Labor Party initiatives which have expanded the income opportunities and expanded the health, education and housing opportunities for the poor and the working class which he has outlined that he has such great concern for. If one analyses the comments and the contributions that the Liberal Party have made over the last 13 years concerning what they would do in government and where their policies would be targeted, it is very clear the ones that will be most disadvantaged by the Liberal Party, should it come into power, will be the very people that the member for Kooyong claimed today he has a great concern for. One of the most fundamental planks of the Liberal Party's policy that they took into the last election and which they have to take into the next election---otherwise they cannot honour any of their other promises-is that they will slash massively government expenditure on programs such as those in the areas of social security, health and education. I draw on the opposition's own comments to make this point. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), has indicated that he wants to implement severe corrective measures to fiscal policy. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has committed himself to significant public savings. So far the only other definite statements that we have had on these issues are that certain areas of government expenditure will be quarantined. The opposition has outlined defence and the fact that it will increase spending to the states. That accounts for 21 per cent of federal government outlays. It is also clear that public debt interest is worth another eight per cent, so about 30 per cent of federal government outlays will be quarantined from any cuts. Let us look at the other 70 per cent. Sixty per cent of federal government outlays are in three areas: social security, health and education. If there are to be the tens of billions of dollars of savings to the federal government budget to pay for some of the other initiatives the opposition intend to undertake, they must come from the three major areas that contribute to the welfare of the poorest and most disadvantaged in our community; that is, social security payments-family payments, health expenditure and education. It is all very well for the member for Kooyong to come in here with his glib phrases and his descriptive tum of words and say how disgraceful he believes it is that such a disparity has grown between the poorest and the richest in our community, but he has to back up those comments with a few commitments about what he would do. The fact is that that if his party were to get into power the very reverse of what he claims he wants to achieve would occur. The poorest and the lowest paid in our community would suffer the greatest under his government. That is borne out by the experience of the last period when the Liberals were in power. In his address the member for Kooyong used what he described as the landmark study of Bob Gregory and he placed a lot of emphasis on the information contained in that study. A few points need to be made about that study which question the validity of some of the assertions the member for Kooyong made as a result of the study. Firstly, the greatest widening of the gap between the top 10 per cent of income earners and the bottom 10 per cent of income earners occurred from 1976 to 1981. If you ask Bob Gregory, he will tell you that that is what his statistics have shown. The gap became the widest in the years when the Liberal Party was in power. The Australian Labor Party has been gradually trying to close that gap. As economic growth occurred from 1992 onwards, there has been considerable growth in the income levels of both the bottom 10 per cent and the top 10 per cent of income earners. But the greatest gap in the income distribution between the top 10 per cent and the bottom 10 per cent occurred when the Liberals were in power. But, of course, the member for Kooyong did not make that point. He did not explain that to the House because he knew how embarrassing that would be. I have had a discussion with Bob Gregory about his study. I do not know whether the member for Kooyong has, but I have, and I have got some information about his study. Bob Gregory admits that there is one very strong weakness in his study: it uses census data on households; it does not analyse people; and it does not look at individuals' incomes and situations. He based his study on what are called census collector districts-200 houses in a suburb---and he compared this census collector district in this suburb with census collector districts in other suburbs around the state. He looked at the same 200 physical houses. It did not matter who the people were in the houses; he looked at those houses. The member for Kooyong failed to understand that in each five-year period between each census there was 40 per cent mobility of people in those houses. So between 1976 and 1991 there was a totally different bunch of people whose incomes were assessed and looked at in the census data. So it is not valid to say that there has been this fall in income of those people when he has ignored the considerable mobility that occurs in Australian society both in the physical sense of house movement and in an income sense which has very definitely occurred. He also failed to take into account that over those 15 years there has been a considerable change in the size of households; the numbers of people that make up those particular households has changed. So the amount of income coming into a household changed, because over a IS-year period in those census collector districts people moved out, the numbers of income earners - hanged and the income distribution in that household changed. People moved out, children grew up and moved house and people changed from being workers to retirees. You failed to take account of any of those changes in those family situations within those households. That is a very strong weakness in the Gregory study, which he admits. Thirdly, the study failed to analyse-and the member for Kooyong made this point but then discarded it as irrelevant-the fact that Commonwealth and state government public housing policy has deliberately targeted the lowest income earners. We have been making sure that our public housing stock has been targeted to those on the lowest income with the greatest need. So, of course, those suburbs which have high proportions of public housing have changed considerably over the last 15 years because we have been targeting the lowest income people to move into those public housing stocks, which was not the policy prior to the election of the Labor government. Those three facts make very considerable inroads into the viability and validity of the statistics that Bob Gregory used in his study and therefore question the whole basis of the member for Kooyong's arguments. However, some really important things need to be said. The first and most important thing about poverty in Australia is that it is directly related to unemployment. We do not doubt that; we do not question it. That is one of the clear findings of Bob Gregory's study that we accept. In fact, we accept it so much that this government committed itself to a $5 billion program last year and over the next three years to significantly tackle unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, because that is going to be the best way we can alleviate poverty in those poorest suburbs. The Working Nation paper, the very document that has been working so hard, has already made great inroads into the massive levels of unemployment that exist in those poorest suburbs. I do not discount the fact that those poorest suburbs have the highest unemployment in the country. I know that and that is why we are deliberately targeting our unemployment policies and programs to tackle those high levels of unemployment. After 12 months, what has this government achieved? Since Working Nation was put in place 12 months ago, 385,000 new jobs have been created-nearly 30,000 jobs per month for 14 months. When this government went to the polls in March 1993, we committed ourselves to creating 500,000 new jobs in our term of office. After only two and a bit years of government we have surpassed that promise. We have fulfilled it by providing 670,000 new jobs in a little over two years, and that is going to be the best way we can tackle unemployment-to give people jobs. We are committed to continuing that program for the next three years and that is a real program that is having real benefits in those suburbs. But what would the Liberal Party do if they were in power? We already know what they would do. The opposition is on the public record as saying that they would make massive cuts to the job creation programs. They would abolish most of the Working Nation initiatives. They would ensure that the people in those poorest suburbs, the ones with the most significant levels of unemployment, would continue in unemployment forever and a day. That would be the legacy that the Liberal Party would impose on the poorest and the most disadvantaged in our community. So don't come into this House preaching to us about how we should be ashamed of ourselves because we have a commitment to the poor and the most disadvantaged, when on every policy level the Liberal Party would slash and bum every policy that this government has put in place that will assist the poorest and the most disadvantaged. Those are the facts. Your shadow Treasurer is on the public record showing that. I quote from a Peter Costello press conference on 20 June 1995 where a journalist asked him: Well will you tell us what you'd be prepared to cut? Costello says: Well I've already told you that we think that in relation to many of the Working Nation programs that there's room for savings. I've said that along. I said it when it came down. And he is still saying it. Despite the fact that Working Nation has created 385,000 new jobs since it started, the very way you are going to help the poorest and the most disadvantaged in our community-and you must acknowledge that giving them a job is the best way to get them a decent living standard, and the very way to do that is to provide the training programs to provide them with the skills, to provide the employers with the subsidies so that they can put these people into jobs-is to slash those programs. Although I believe the member for Kooyong is genuinely concerned, I do not believe his party is. That is why we on this side of the House believe that the claims made by the opposition in this matter are hypocritical in the extreme, because the evidence is there from the last time they were in government. When they had the reins of Treasury, the income gap between the poorest and the wealthiest increased dramatically. They slashed all social security payments so that people like old age pensioners' standard of living collapsed. (Time expired)",65
136,Mr FORREST,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The speech from the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) was a disappointment. He sought to discredit Professor Gregory's work. He failed to acknowledge that the Hawke-Keating government is under judgment from a number of major reports. One is by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, another is by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling while yet another is by the Social Policy Research Centre. They are all saying that the legacy of Labor after 13 years is taking its toll on the social fabric of our nation. I would like the honourable member for Moreton to stay and listen as I develop the point of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) about the need to address the parlous state of people in rural Australia. Let me develop that argument, because the diverging gap between the rich and poor is no better epitomised than when we consider the plight of rural Australians. It no better epitomises the government's failure to address the all question of inequality. The appalling divergence in wealth is dramatic when comparing rural Australians with urban Australians. If the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his Treasurer (Mr Willis) hope to present themselves as a credible choice at the next election, they ought not do two things. One is what the honourable member for Moreton has just done, which is to basically ignore the issue of inequality by trying to explain it away. The second is to attempt scare tactics about what we might do as an alternative government. More of us on this side every day are confronted with needy families. They are the people that we represent. In my own case, every week a new family is presented to me that is struggling to make ends meet. The government seems to forget that point every time it berates the opposition and makes allegations about what we might do. We speak for millions of Australians. They do not need to be frightened any more about what might happen to them, be it from the Labor Party or us, because it is already happening at a frightening rate. They are well aware that the Australian Labor Party in government has failed them. It is no worse felt than in the rural regions. In the last little while, we have heard a lot of rhetoric from the government about its so called concern for rural and regional areas. In fact, it is quite clear that the thrust of the coming election strategy will focus on those regions located outside the metropolis and major metropolitan centres. If the Prime Minister and any of his ministers of government expect to have any credibility with the people in rural and regional Australia, my advice would be that the Prime Minister launch his election campaign with a series of apologies to, in particular, people in rural Australia and certainly those who are caught in this inequality trap for offending them with neglect. He can start by apologising to all the bankrupted small businesses who did not survive the decade of unprecedented high interest rates which he presided over as Treasurer. He could apologise to all those people consequently unemployed who contribute to the abominably high rural unemployment rate. He can apologise to all those families who miss out on Austudy because of the iniquitous assets test. He can apologise to all those drought stricken farmers who do not qualify for any aid because of the iniquitous criteria which they are expected to meet to be eligible for it. We are talking about equity and wealth sharing. So much for the alleged social wage that the government continues to hide behind. We heard a little about it from the honourable member for Moreton. Drought aid is supposed to be included in the gross aggregate of government money spent on the social wage. However, because of the criteria, it seldom finds its way to the coalface where the families are that need it. The Prime Minister could also apologise to all those rural businesses that miss out on telecommunications technology because of the government's neglect. He could apologise to a huge number of Australians because of his litany of broken promises and his failure to deliver decent policy. Who of those families caught in this trap will forget the infamous 1a-w promises he failed to meet in respect of taxation cuts? He had most certainly better apologise very smartly for the offensive remarks he made on 11 May this year when he said, 'This is as good as it gets. It will never get any better.' That is not a lot of encouragement to those mum and dad businesses that are struggling to pay their bills and keep people in employment. I could spend hours in this chamber reminding this House of every broken promise that this Prime Minister and his government have failed to honour and of every insult he has delivered to struggling Australians. What about the 'Get a job' jibe. It was disgraceful behaviour for a Prime Minister, especially the someone from the Labor Party, which purports to be the champion of social justice and the underdog. If the Prime Minister is man enough to make these apologies, I think we can expect that he will be apologising for the entire length of the campaign. There are so many Australians, particularly in rural areas, whom he has offended. The government's neglect of rural regions, despite their value and importance as an income source with regard to our exporting, amazes me. Why has this government allowed rural poverty to run rampant when rural Australians contribute almost directly, but certainly indirectly, $2 out of every $3 we earn from our international trade, which derives from agriculture but certainly from the resources sector, yet only one quarter of Australians are located outside metropolitan areas? It is incomprehensible that the government has allowed a gap to be created between rural and urban Australia to the shocking extent that it has over the last decade. We have created a lower rural class. People of dignity and determined spirit are reduced to living cap in hand and being dependent on government handouts to survive. The statistics for rural Australia show huge disparities in respect of income levels, the delivery of government services and health and educational outcomes. The government's defence of the social wage, which we have heard several times, is an absolute nonsense in rural areas. That $1,700-odd that the honourable member for Kooyong has mentioned never reaches them. It may surprise members on the other side that many of those rural Australians do not have access to the government services that it boasts so much about. I get very angry sitting in this House day after day listening to this government beat its chest about what it does. The honourable member for Moreton says that Working Nation has all the answers. That is absolute rubbish. We have to stimulate the 800,000 small businesses. They are mum and dad businesses that employ less than three or four people. They are the ones that we need to stimulate and encourage to create jobs in Australia and to distribute wealth by allowing the people who receive a wage to benefit from it. What annoys me the most is the mental stress and suicide that is created. There have been 16 suicides in my electorate in 2V2 years. We have a suicide rate that is four times that of urban centres. When are the people on the government side going to start listening to the desperate needs of rural Australians? Mr Braithwaite-They don't even care.",68
137,Mr FORREST,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is what my people have decided: you do not care. The sooner you are dislodged, the better. Take a second to look at the ABS statistics. I have only the 1991 statistics available. Of the 20 poorest electorates defined by median family incomes, all of them are located in rural areas. There are 20 rural seats. Four of them are held by the Australian Labor Party, which is probably the reason why they are ignored. Those government members who sit on that side holding rural and provincial seats ought to be challenged about the adequacy of the advocacy that they are providing to the government. They are either silent, not listening or do not care, as the honourable member for Dawson said before. Government speakers have defended this very serious issue raised by the honourable member for Kooyong by attacking the opposition. I think it is about time that this ongoing litany of misrepresentation stops. People say to me every day that they are sick and tired of hearing the Treasurer of this country stand up and baffle them with statistics. They do not care about the GDP. It does not mean anything to them. They do not care about the plethora of statistics trotted out by the government. They care about the need to meet their expenses and costs. (Time expired).",70
138,Mr CHYNOWETH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Before the members of the National Party leave the chamber, let me just answer a few of the allegations that they have just made. I have never once heard the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) get up in this House and attack Jeffrey Kennett for what has happened in Victoria. Have a look at what has happened in Mallee: schools have been closed, train services have been stopped and hospitals and nursing homes have been closed. But he has not said one word about that. The member for MaBee went on and on about how the mum and dad businesses are closing and going broke. I will tell him why they are going broke in his area. It is because of the policies of the Liberal Party in government in Victoria. How many of those businesses are going broke because of the gambling casinos that have been set up by Jeffrey Kennett? In my electorate, in Frankston alone $1 million a week is being taken out of the economy by the poker machines, which would have been spent in the businesses around that area-$52 million a year. You can walk out. You are not really interested in looking after your people because, if you were, you would be like old Black Jack MCEwen and you would not be letting Kennett get away with it. You would be in there attacking the Liberal Party governhis ment. But the National Party members of this parliament have not got the guts to do it; just walk away. That is all I have to say about the National Party. Let me get on to the Liberal Party. This matter of public importance is all about article that was written in the Herald-Sun the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), in title. which he said that one of Australia's dominant characteristics has been our 'fair go ethic'. It is a pity the Liberal Party and its colleague, the National Party, do not practise giving people a fair go. I realise that, as former state director of the Liberal Party, member for Kooyong had to say many things and write many articles that he did not really believe in. This has got to be one of them, because it is the most hypocritical article have ever seen written anywhere. I would like to contrast what is happening under the Liberal government in Victoria with this matter of public importance about inequality which has been put forward by the member for Kooyong. Let us not forget, however, that the member for Kooyong was one of the people who was instrumental in setting up the Liberal government in Victoria. Mr Georgiou-Quite right.",70
139,Mr CHYNOWETH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He was. He actually is got those right-wing fascists into power down there. He is responsible for some of their policies. They are the people who are practisshould ing these sorts of policies in Victoria which are affecting the majority of Victorians ruining the economy and people's living standards. The member for Kooyong is the person a party. who stacked the branches with people who make Genghis Khan look like a member of the left wing. He is responsible for the polichair. cies and the implementation of those policies. Therefore, he shoulders some of the blame for what has been happening in Victoria. should hang his head in shame. He should also apologise to this House for the blatant hypocrisy of this matter of public importance. Let us have a look at a bit of the history of the Liberal Party when they were in power up here. I can just remember Johnny Howard and fistful of dollars-with tax cuts and all the rest of it. Let us have a look at Howard's first they budget-I cannot really recall the date when Howard's first budget was around-which was a bad budget.",71
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl)an Order! The honourable member will refer to by the Leader of the Opposition by his correct,71
141,Mr CHYNOWETH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Leader of the Opposition's first budget was a horror budget, if I remember rightly, because he denied the indexation to pensioners. There was eight per the cent inflation in that year but the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, refused to give those pensioners indexation. Because of that those pensioners lost one week's pension. I That is the sort of thing we can look back on when we talk about equality and inequality, because he was a great practiser of it. The member for Kooyong used some academic statistics from Professor Gregory's report and other studies. I do not want to use academic statistics. I have been a practical person all my life. What I would like to use are a few facts and figures of real people who have been affected by these cuts that have been put into practice. If we have a look at what is happening in Victoria, we see that this the sort of thing that will happen on a national scale. That is why you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, as a National Party member be very wary of your colleagues here. You are not doing a good job for the National and Party-not you particularly",71
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! I might say that occupants of this chair do not have,71
143,Mr CHYNOWETH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am sorry-the party that you have when you are not in the In the years that Kennett has been in government, 35,000 public servants and hundreds of school teachers have been sacked. He All the schools have been sold. Prince Henry's hospital down there was blown up so that they could build a townhouse-they did not just pull it down, they blew it up to get it out in a hurry. The state government has sold off all the assets. It is running down the whole infrastructure of Victoria. If we have a look at some of the actual facts-not statistics-we see that these things are happening in Victoria to real people. These are the sorts of things that should be mentioned. This is a case study of a man with Down syndrome. He was living in a health and community services residential unit in Dandenong and was transferred to a nursing home due to his restlessness at night. The man has minimal personal support needs and cried after being hurt by another resident of the nursing home with dementia. The staff of the nursing home felt that this man should not be there. The Kennett government has transferred people with intellectual disabilities into nursing homes in order to place them under the Commonwealth system. So we are actually paying for it. It is estimated that this has happened in over 700 cases in Victoria. The state government is shifting the blame and creating inequality not just between rich and poor but between people with all sorts of disabilities. It is putting those people in places that are not really correct for them. There is also a case in my electorate of a pensioner who has had her electricity cut off. When she went to pay, she was told that she had to pay a $140 reconnection fee up-front. She paid it. She then could not pay the initial electricity bill of $50, so her electricity was cut off again. She now has to pay another $140. These sorts of policies, which are being implemented by people like those opposite, create inequality in our community. One only has to look as what is happening at the Frankston council, which has three commissars who are getting $60,000 a year. They are all paid-up members of the Liberal Party. I think they are all retired and are fairly wealthy business people. They receive in their pocket whatever they get in their pension, plus $60,000, plus phone, plus a car. What is that doing? It is creating a huge disparity because the low income people of Victoria have to pay an extra $2,000 in taxes. We also have to pay a $100 poll tax, a home tax-which Jeffrey has just removed because there could be an election in the air. He will reintroduce it if he ever gets back in again. However, while the people of Victoria have got taxes and charges of $2,000, we have got people in the Liberal Party getting more money. What does that mean? It means that the rich are getting richer while the poor are poorer. Of course there is inequality. If you get your academic mates to have a real good look at those figures and do all these statistics, they will find that the biggest disparities are in Victoria because of all the consultants-who are friends and members of the Liberal Party-getting paid-up jobs, such as chairmanships of boards. In Victoria they amalgamated all our hospitals, sacked all the community representatives on the hospital boards and put people on them who are being paid $300,000 a year. Is that creating a disparity? Is that creating inequality? While the Liberals in Victoria are taxing the lowest people in our community by putting $2,000 in taxes on them, they are giving consultancies and contracts with councils and with the state government to their mates. Even people in this House have actually got contracts from the Victorian government. This sort of thing is going on all the time with members of the Liberal Party opposite. That is one of the reasons why we are creating this inequality. Because your policies are being enacted in Victoria, they are the sorts of policies you will implement here in government. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. You hit us poor people. Mr Nugent-You, one of the poor? Ha, ha!",71
144,Mr CHYNOWETH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I can't say I am one of the poor. I was poor; I do not deny it.

148,Mr DODD,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"In continuing my speech on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill, I must say that the issues I raised earlier which are facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students are being addressed nationally through the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. I congratulate those members of the national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, in particular the chair, Mandawuy Yunupingu, and the deputy chair, Romina Fujii. Romina resides on Thursday Island. He is a constituent of mine and has spent his lifetime dedicated to the education of Torres Strait Islander people. There are a lot of outside aspects as well that must be taken into account in the education process. There is very little motivation for anyone to attend school if there is no reason for attending and no jobs at the end of it. That is where strategies such as the Working Nation paper can work in schools to develop regional employment policies, identify skill shortfalls and tackle tertiary education needs. The government has addressed this issue by allowing labour market programs into CDEP communities, which was previously prohibited. I congratulate the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), who spoke earlier in the debate, on his work as parliamentary secretary. He has fought long and hard for this. It is something on which a lot of people have called for him to be congratulated. Health is another important aspect of the education process. Children who are not well will not learn well. The federal government is tackling many of these issues and, in some cases, the states are playing their part. There is obviously a lot further to go but the commitment is there at the Commonwealth level. The Queensland government, I am pleased to say, has some innovative projects-I have mentioned Aurukun. Queensland has moved towards a community development approach. Consultation and making programs relevant to particular community needs have become a goal. Simple things such as the need for culturally appropriate discipline and community participation in schooling are being addressed. In my electorate, in particular, the community of Kowanyama has a community justice project in which the schools are playing a vital part. Aboriginal people are also being given responsibility and involvement in the education process as teachers and in the management of schools. The initiative of the ASPA committees comes to mind here. All these aspects are moves in the right direction. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can meet their aspirations, retain their cultural heritage and grasp self-determination with an educational process that takes the time to involve them. It is important to remember that the cultural aspect of the reference group in the report is important. I do not have time now to go into the recommendations but I think anyone who has any contact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities will recognise the importance that they attribute to cultural education. I was very pleased to have the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visit my electorate last week. It was a historic visit-the first time that a Prime Minister has visited Thursday Island and certainly the second time a Prime Minister has visited the Torres Strait. It was very pleasing to see the reaction of the school children. They recognise the contribution to education in the Torres Strait that has been made by the Labor government. I was particularly pleased to hear an address by the captain of the Thursday Island high school, Miss Bakoi Bon, who gave a very eloquent and considered address. It showed how the education process is working in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. She gave a very eloquent address, an address that could match, I would say, any school in the nation. It makes me very proud to see Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal children perform at such a level. It is difficult for anyone to speak in front of the Prime Minister, and that was a great performance. Despite the doomsayers in the opposition, there are improvements that are being made. We have a long way to go because of all the disadvantages that have been stated. The main job lies with the states, and that is what members of the coalition have conveniently forgotten in their addresses to the parliament. I hope they take this report back to their coalition colleagues, especially those in state government, along with the comments they have made here and say, 'This is a good report. Let's implement it Australia-wide.'",74
149,Mr NUGENT,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), who has just spoken on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill, referred in his speech to Thursday Island, Kowanyama and Aurukun before he was interrupted by question time. I have visited those places and in fact many other communities around the country. Whilst obviously there have been some improvements in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education in some respects over the last few years, there is no question that, by any objective assessment, one would have to say it has not been sufficient and certainly has not been fast enough. The measures that the government has put into place have certainly not been as effective as it would have liked or as effective as they should have been. It is also important to recognise at the beginning of any debate on this particular issue the important role of the states. The member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) made great play about the states earlier in this debate. There is no question that the role of the states is an important factor in the delivery of any services. Speaking as a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, I would have to say that one of our strategic goals in the next three years of the council's operation is to very much focus on the role of states in delivering those services. Without proper delivery of those services by state governments of all persuasions, we will never be successful in addressing these very serious concerns in what is by any yardstick the most disadvantaged section of our community. It is interesting, as an aside, that the state government that tends to get criticised the most these days happens to be the Goss government. I will not go into that at this stage. Overall, we do need to see a national energy and will to solve the problems. It seems to me that all too often people are prepared to stand here and talk about the good intentions of programs without looking at the outcomes and without being prepared to recognise that there is a need to change some of the ways money is spent and programs are implemented and without being prepared to look to do that quickly and effectively. The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill will fund extra educational measures for indigenous Australians. It is all about the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, known as the AESIP. It is about Aboriginal education policy. It has got a number of worthy objectives. It has got several national priorities, and it is particularly concentrating on implementing recommendations from the deaths in custody royal commission. It is talking about Aboriginal literacy and reconciliation and the schooling strategy. All of those measures are worthy, necessary and supportable. The specific provisions of the amendment provided for in the bill are to provide $83-odd million as part of the triennium amount for this set of programs. There is contained within the bill a minor adjustment in terms of the National Institute for Indigenous Performing Arts Training, and if I have time. I might talk about that a little later on. But the main thrust is to provide extra money for Aboriginal education. I would like to look at how the government has performed over the last few years in this area. This is not just coalition rhetoric, which we are so often accused of by the other side. I would like to quote from an objective report to put in perspective the nature of the problem as it stands today in Australia in respect of our indigenous population. Unless people understand the nature of the problems and the current situation, we are not going to be effective in introducing new programs and spending money. I want to talk a bit about a report that came out of the University of Melbourne-in July of this year, so it is a very current report. It is headed 'Educational outcomes survey: Aboriginal students in secondary schools-a preliminary analysis of learning outcomes and student perceptions of schooling'. This covers a number of different areas. The researchers have surveyed a whole range of schools across a wide range of areas. I want to quote from the introduction. It says: How well do Aboriginal students fare in Australian secondary schools? How do their outcomes compare with those for other students . . . Aboriginal students, who complete school less often than others, are less well represented in the most institutionally valued subjects and are more likely to fail insofar as they are represented. Their attainment in senior secondary English is weaker, a pattern foreshadowed by reported greater coping difficulties in Year 10. While Aboriginal students study vocational subjects more frequently than nonAboriginal students, the reverse is true of the more esteemed vocational options like accountancy. Aboriginal students appear to have lowered expectations of school and their perceptions of the success of their schools in meeting their needs are also lower. Boys in particular have poorer relations with teachers and are less well integrated in school. While these findings require fuller investigation, they reveal disadvantages which are specific to or which are experienced with greater intensity by Aboriginal students. The data are sufficiently sophisticated to display differences between subgroups within the Aboriginal population. Policy initiatives in Aboriginal education should not always assume that Aboriginal students are a homogeneous social group. Differences in the educational experiences of boys and girls and students in rural areas are of particular interest. Behind those general statements there are a number of statistical facts, and graphs and charts which obviously one is not able to display in this chamber. I would like to comment on some of the more detailed findings of this report. For example, in looking at enrolment rates in mathematics and physical sciences in year 11, staying at school, whilst an important measure itself, needs to be supplemented by information on subject choice. Mathematics and physical sciences are a major area of interest because of their links with university. There is also evidence that students taking these subjects have a more positive experience of school than those who are not taking them. Consequently, we need to measure relative levels of access to them. Aboriginal students reaching year 11 are significantly less likely than other students to study chemistry or physics, and they are also less likely to study any form of maths, including university preparatory mathematics. I will talk a bit about English and not just mathematics and the sciences. While English itself is not regarded as a 'high stakes' subject, achievement in English has implications for performance in other subjects, including maths. The English curriculum is a major vehicle for cultural development as well as for mastery of communication. Attainment differences are therefore of great concern. Over 60 per cent of Aboriginal students in the sample that was assessed in this report were in the lowest two bands of performance, and this was nearly double the rate for non-Aboriginal students. One might be tempted to say that all this is not really new information and that we have known about it for many years. But what is concerning is that this is information that has come to light this year-1995-after several years of the programs that this government has been putting forward. What I think it is demonstrating is that what the government is doing is not working. Whilst we all desire to spend money and improve the situation, we have to look at new ways of doing it. For example, let us look at relative outcomes for students' performance in year 12 English in rural and provincial cities. Amongst Aboriginal students, which groups are achieving least well in English? Rural and provincial city students are more likely than their urban counterparts to do poorly. Nearly two out of three country students are found in the lowest bands of performance. Of course, that has a particularly adverse effect once these people finish schooling, because it is the rural areas where unemployment is the worse and where you therefore need to be better equipped to become employed. Today schools are expected to play an increasing role in the provision of vocational education and training. Vocational education and training enables students to develop their abilities whether or not they wish to compete for places in university. It is interesting that Aboriginal students are well represented in various vocational subjects at school. However, in some subjects-notably, information technology and accountancy, which are high demand subjects in the world today-their participation is lower than for non-Aboriginal students. These are subjects which enjoy greater institutional recognition and provide more secure pathways to university or TAPE. If you look at post-school plans after year 10 and compare Aboriginal students with nonAboriginal students, you find that Aboriginal students in year 10 have lower aspirations than non-Aboriginal students. In other words, it is a question not just of what is being achieved but of what the expectation is. If you go in with a lower expectation, you are obviously less likely to achieve. Aboriginal students plan to leave school at the end of the compulsory years more often. Although balanced by a greater interest in apprenticeship or other vocational training in TAPE, or with other providers, this still implies lower general levels of attainment. Moreover, these differences hold even after comparisons are made between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students of similar socio-economic status. I think that is an important measure. The figures that this report looks at concern people coming from similar socio-economic levels. The cultural and material advantages that young people derive from parents in the professions and management do not appear to translate for Aboriginal students into the high aspirations that would be expected given the pattern of their non-Aboriginal counterparts. I think it is also important to look not just at the expectations of the schools and what the system provides but at the perspectives of the students themselves-the perspectives the students have on educational experience and the quality of learning. The report says: Educational statistics rarely report the point of view of students. Yet what young people say about their experience of learning provides valuable insights into differences in participation and attainment. Low self-esteem and perceptions of negative attitudes on the part of teachers are linked with under-enrolment in maths amongst girls and probably also with poor achievement and lack of commitment in English amongst boys. Monitoring the quality of student experience in the middle years of secondary school can playa useful role in identifying poor morale and low satisfaction amongst particular student groups-often linked with poor academic progress. Similarly in the senior years the association between curriculum stream-on the one hand-and student-teacher rapport, student motivation, and reported parental expectations-on the other-highlights the need to strengthen programs through tangible benefits (such as vocational training) as well as pedagogically. It is interesting perhaps to look at coping with English by gender. There is a difference between boys and girls, and this comes back to what the gentleman from Leichhardt was saying about cultural expectations. It seems to me, as I have gone around many communities, that historically it was the women in the Aboriginal communities who looked after the home and did a lot of the basic provision and so on-that still applieswhereas the men traditionally had the men's business and the cultural aspects to attend to, perhaps some of the hunting and so on. Basically, that role has been taken away from them, particularly as Western society has impacted upon the communities. Therefore, in many ways the men find themselves with little to do, and their self-esteem tends to be low. So there are differences in approach and attitude between men and women, or boys and girls, in the Aboriginal community. Aboriginal students who reach year 12 have a much higher chance of failing English than non-Aboriginal students. The developing pattern of poorer attainment is already suggested by how many Aboriginal students reflect on their learning experience in year 10. As many as 40 per cent of boys at this level report coping not well or poorly. The pattern is much better for girls, though they make up a smaller proportion of students. Overall, every fourth Aboriginal student in year 10 reports making unsatisfactory progress in English. Given the links between attainment, quality of school experience and school completion rates, such a high figure is obviously a serious concern. Confidence obviously plays an important role. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I know that you, as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, like me, have travelled to many communities, and you will be well aware that if you do not have the confidence you often do not make a go of things. Confidence in the communities is often a major problem. We find that, although there are some very confident Aboriginal students in year 10, as a group they are much more likely than nonAboriginal students to expect to do poorly in all their subjects and are just as likely to say that they will do poorly in some. Every fifth Aboriginal student has a lower level of confidence in academic progress. On the eve of the more specialised subjects which are introduced in the senior years of secondary school and the greater emphasis on personal responsibility for learning, many Aboriginal students already doubt their ability to continue. So it is not surprising that we have lower retention rates in the Aboriginal community going through to the senior levels at school. Aboriginal students are as likely, or about as likely, as other students to say that schools are successful in promoting care for the environment, respect and care for others, taking pride in achievement and valuing knowledge and ideas. But in other areas their estimations of school success are much lower. These include: being organised, working with others, believing in the value of working for the future and respecting people from other backgrounds. Responses on these items suggest much less confidence on the part of Aboriginal students in the value of a school as a vehicle for planning and implementing personal goals than it does on environmental and cultural reconciliation. So the whole attitude to school has a heavy bearing on how successful one is likely to be, and that means that we should be tailoring our programs to take account of those factors. One of the more depressing features of the report that I found was a question about which image pest describes your school. The choice of a single image to convey feelings about school tends to confirm the finding that Aboriginal students are less likely than others to think of school as a productive experience. Aboriginal students choose 'stepping stone'the most common image used by students at whatever school level---only half as often as non-Aboriginal students. 'Prison', on the other hand, they choose twice as often. This image conveys a sense of confinement devoid of positive purpose. In fact, 58 or 59 per cent of Aboriginal students in year 10 described going to school as being like going to prison. If that is the attitude-and it is an understandable attitude for all the sorts of reasons we have been talking about-then obviously we have some major problems with people being successful in that sort of environment. There are large differences between Aboriginal boys and Aboriginal girls on measures of student morale. Girls are consistently more positive than boys about relationships with teachers, about the overall quality of school experience and about the value of making extra effort with school work. And so I could go on, but time is running out. I want to make a few other comments before I close. This report tells us in a current assessment-an objective assessment, not a political assessment-that clearly there is a problem with getting education at an acceptable level for our indigenous community. We all know that there is a whole host of reasons for that, but it is a damming report and it really tells us that what has been going on for the last few years, whatever the good intent, has not worked. Of course, education is a cornerstone to anybody's future life. Without education these days, you will not get a job. If you do not get a job, you cannot buy a house. If you cannot buy a house, you cannot provide the proper health conditions to bring up your next generation. Then, if you do not have a job, a house and any money, you get into substance abuse and domestic violence-all the things that the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody talked about and all the things that we as a nation need to be attacking. So the cycle goes on. Frankly, the government has to improve its performance in this area. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) in his second reading speech talked about changing the programs, as I understand it, from 1997. We are only just in the third quarter of 1995 and he is talking about doing something in two years time. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)-health is an important aspect of this, because more than 50 per cent of Aboriginal children going to primary schools have middle ear infection, so they cannot absorb the lessons because they have a major problem-is saying, 'We have now broken off health from ATSIC, and we are going to be responsible.' But nothing tangible will come out of her proposals for some time to come. Three weeks ago my sixth grandson was born. That boy will have an 18-year better life expectancy and all sorts of better opportunities than an Aboriginal boy born on the same day. This is 1995, when we h,lVe had 12 years of this government standing up here lecturing about all the good things it is doing. Its performance, frankly, is not good enough. We have had 12 years of this government telling us how it should be done. We have had 12 years of this government being very unctuous, frankly, about what it is all about, and the evidence shows that its methods and methodology have failed. Although the coalition will support this measure, the government has to lift its game. (Time expired)",75
150,Ms HENZELL,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Capricornia) (5.47 p.m.}I acknowledge the concern and commitment of my colleague the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), but I would ask him and other members of the opposition-six months out from an election where the opposition parties are putting themselves forward as the alternative government, and after much breast beating and moral indignation on this issueto say what their policies are. I am not aware of any specific policy put forward by any of your spokespersons on Aboriginal health, education or any other issue. So I challenge members of the opposition, if they are concerned about these issues, to say what their polices are. I understand the research reports that the member has been quoting from, but let me in tum quote from the National Review of Education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, which was presented to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) by Mandawuy Yunupingu on 30 September 1994. The document is a major review of the national Aboriginal education policy. I quote from page 2 of the report to add some balance to the arguments presented on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill by the member for Aston: On the basis of the evidence presented to us we have no doubt that the educational experiences of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders have improved over the last five years. More Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders than before are involved in educational decision-making and in the delivery of educational services. More have access to education facilities. More participate in education, particularly in the technical and further education and higher education sectors. More people use their knowledge and experiences of education to contribute both to their communities and to the wider Australian community. But equity is not just a matter of numbers. In 1994 Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders continue to be the most educationally disadvantaged groups in Australia. While more opportunities to express their views about the policy, programs and practices of education have been created, Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders remain concerned that their views are not heard. Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders continue to have the most limited, and in some cases no, access to education beyond primary school. They do not participate in education to the extent that other Australians participate, particularly in secondary education; in technical and further education and higher education they participate only in particular and narrow fields of study. Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders still do not enjoy equitable and appropriate outcomes from education. I think a great deal has been achieved, but from a low base. Having been on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the member for Aston and I are aware of a range of complex difficulties-whether they be with coastal communities in New South Wales or in other states or in very remote locations-militating against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children making use of those expanded opportunities. I certainly want to comment on those issues, but I also want to comment on some of the more positive things that are happening as a result of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy which is an initiative of this government. It is fairly important that recognition is given to that policy. In May 1993, the early part of the current parliament, there was an agreement with all state and federal governments to provide better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our community. At the time, the problems were obvious to all participants. I will quote from the overview of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy for the second triennium, 1993-95, which states: less than 50 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children had some pre-school experience compared with a national equivalent rate of more than 90 per cent; So at the very beginning of their educational experience they are seriously disadvantaged. It continues: participation in school among children of compulsory schooling age was about 85 per cent for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, and close to 100 per cent for the nation as a whole; and just 10 per cent of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population aged 15 years and over held post-school educational qualifications, compared with the national proportion of 31 per cent. There were, and still are, some major problems. The report continues further: in In 1991, the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody found that the most significant factor contributing to the overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody was their disadvantaged and unequalled position in Australian societysocially, economically and culturally. The social, economic and cultural factors which contribute to this situation lead to low self-esteem and reduced confidence. It is a national tragedy that Australia's indigenous people remain the country's most chronically disadvantaged group on every social indicator, including health, housing, employment and, importantly, education. Of the 99 cases investigated by the Royal Commission, 40 of those who died had not proceeded beyond primary school and only two had completed secondary schooling. I do not believe there is a great deal of debate and dissension about these national statistics. These statistics were never going to be turned around easily or quickly, but it has been a commitment of this government to work with our state counterparts. One of the reasons we are debating the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1995 is that, as we review the national Aboriginal education policy for the calendar year 1996 and when major structural changes come into the AESIP-the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program-from January 1997, we will be providing for a more equitable distribution of funds per capita and new accountability arrangements which will focus on achieving improved education outcomes for indigenous people. There will be an attempt to target what works and address how we get to that point. A great deal has been achieved in relation to the allocation of these special resources. I would like to give some examples of this from central Queensland. It is of considerable significance that the Queensland government has become a key player in this area and developed strategic action initiatives as part of its education plans. I want to refer to that issue because when speaking with a departmental person from DEET in central Queensland today, he pointed out that one of the most positive points he noted is that, now that the state education department has a fully integrated plan for Aboriginal education which is very much at one with the national strategic initiatives, there has been a real change in the attitudes of educational service providers on the ground and in the communities. That is where you will get those positive changes. You will not get practical changes if you do not have attitudinal changes from those who are providing the services such as school principals, P&Cs and so on. I want to refer to the changes outlined in the Queensland education department's social justice strategy for 199498. I commend the Queensland government for the work it has done in this area. Part of its vision is: The distinctive cultures of our Indigenous people are a rich and important part of Australia's living heritage. Furthermore, it needs to be acknowledged that Aboriginal histories, cultures, languages and societies are quite diverse from Torres Strait Islander histories, cultures, languages and societies and each group needs to be the regarded as such. The education of Aboriginal people & Torres Strait Islander people has been eroded over time in many communities for a variety of reasons. The particular needs and circumstances of Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander people must be adequately accommodated by the education system. Equity for Aboriginal students and Torres Strait Islander students is achieved when: Aboriginal people & Torres Strait Islander people are participating in decision-making processes and the delivery of education to Aboriginal students & Torres Strait Islander students; Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander people are involved at all levels of education in ways that are relevant, enjoyable and useful for them, to the same extent as other Australians; and Quality educational outcomes for all Aborigll1al people & Torres Strait Islander people are equitable in terms of both their own performance and the appreciation by all Australians of Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander histories, cultures, languages and societies and the contributions and perspectives of Indigenous people of Australia. There has been a huge change. I remember a particular day in the education of my older daughter at Indooroopilly State School-an excellent school in Brisbane. I went along for the Australia Day celebrations and the students in years 1 and 2 and so on were doing a play for the assembly. The comment was made that the settlers were attacked by blacks. I thought, 'Heavens! We haven't moved very far in the last 20 to 30 years if that is the best one of the better schools in Brisbane can do in terms of involving indigenous history.' It has taken a long period for things to change. That baby daughter is now 19 and in her second year at university. It has taken a deal of time, but full marks to the Queensland government. In their social justice strategy statement they make the following point-and I think it is something that the member for Aston would not disagree with: More than 35% of our Aboriginal & Torres Strait as Islander families have annual incomes less $15 000 compared with less than 25% of other Australian families. We are dealing with a group in our communiwill ty that is educationally disadvantaged. In many other respects they are socially disadcoming vantaged and suffer from a range of health problems, which the member for the Aston referred to, such as middle ear infections, abilities which affect their hearing and have a major impact on their lives. We need to recognise that for many Aboopportunity riginal and Torres Strait Islander families English is a second or third language and areas. when we attempt to have those children conform to a European school system it is in their interests. In talking with educators central Queensland today I received some very positive examples of just how the initiaIslander tives that we have funded and put in place actually working. I refer to things like the ASSPA committees where parents are very involved in the education of their children. I will give the House one example. There is a particular program centred in the Mackay area but which is available to all central Queensland schools. This program picks up on gifted and talented learners amongst the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. munity. In order to develop the skills and talents of this particular group the Aboriginal education adviser has developed the following consultadid tive mechanism. First of all, from the indigenous community there is selected, through consultation, a group of resource people who are then been put through an instructional skills course the local T AFE college. It is their job to gauge the level of talent of these young students by using oral traditions, rather than written traditions which often disadvantage Aboriginal students. These adults are aged between 20 and 60 years. They work with the children by means of storytelling, dance, music and art and develop the children's skills and competencies. These skills and competencies are assessed through videos photographs. With the aid of the Aboriginal education advisers the skills and competencies are documented, using various initiatives such the homework program initiative. Those than young students will be presenting their work to the wider school community. Increasingly, those resource people from the community be used with other schools in the region. We have schools and local communities together to develop processes whereby, in this particular case, gifted and talented students are able to allow their particular to flower. It will not only assist those young people to develop their abilities but raise their confidence level. Thus we have an to assist those young people to do much better in the more traditional curriculum At the same time, we are raising the profile, not the respect and the interests of indigenous in culture in the wider school community. We are involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait community members in that school are community. A lot of those projects that have been developed as part of the social justice strategy with the Queensland education department are based on working with a bottom-up approach. We have the school, the community and the education providers going through a process of consultation and involvement which will benefit not only the indigenous students but also the wider school comThis is what the national Aboriginal education policy is all about. This kind of initiative not just happen overnight. It is very much at odds with what we might well term the more traditional approach. The development of the ASSPA committees has been increasingly successful in involving parents in the at educational experiences of their children. If we look at research across the world we see that one of the key factors in educational success and outcomes is the involvement and support of parents in the education of their children. Where you lock out any group of parents from the educational experience of their children you are going to get a less positive outcome for those children. Recent history in Queensland has shown that very and few Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are now parents had access to educational opportunities. Certainly their culture and their languages were banned. It has been a major turnaround to involve those parents in these processes. People to whom I have spoken in central Queensland have advised me that those initiatives are bearing fruit. In the wider community, however, some of our positive, affirmative action strategies are still very misunderstood. There are still a lot of people in Rockhampton who believe that Aboriginal children get taxis to school. None of this is correct. We have Abstudy support. We have a range of supports for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. They are very well defined. Certainly there are no free taxis. If our Aboriginal students attend school camps it is probably as a result of decisions by the local school ASSPA committee. There are income tests associated with Abstudy as well as very tight accountability requirements. It is very important to make sure that the wider Australian community knows that to overcome these serious educational disadvantages-which the member for Aston indicated were certainly a key factor in the continuing disadvantage of Aboriginal people, and which was supported by the royal commission finding-we must make sure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students find school to be a place where they can participate, develop, have their culture respected and to understand the European culture. It is important that non-indigenous students also respect and understand indigenous culture. That is what this policy is all about. I commend the government's commitment. We are turning around what has been a tragic underutilisation of educational opportunities. It is not easy, but this government has policies. I challenge the opposition to its policy. I have not seen one policy on Aboriginal issues put forward to the people of Australia by the opposition. (Time expired)",79
151,Mr KATTER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"The previous speaker, the member for Capricornia (Ms HenzeIl), epitomises to me all that is wrong with Aboriginal affairs in Australia. The attitudes that she espoused in her speech are very much those that create the problems that exist today. In her speech she quoted figures which prove conclusively the disastrous failure of both this government and the state governments throughout Australia in Aboriginal affairs. We have a situation in which the average income for most Aboriginal families, according to the member for Capricornia, is $15,000. There is something terribly, terribly wrong when the average family of Aboriginal descent in Australia has an income of $15,000. The reason for that is that social workers, such as the honourable member for Capricornia, are paid amounts of money to go out and look after these people and tell them all sorts of wonderful and exciting things, inculcating in them attitudes and values which, unfortunately and sadly, are similar to those that were exemplified by the missionanes. In this place I have constantly tried to bring home to the parliament of Australia what it was like to be black in the Australian states. In some of the states that terrible history was still occurring into the late 1950s. That is particularly true of the state of Queensland under the Labor government. It was only the incoming government-Country Party as it then was; National Party now-that swept away those dreadful laws. In the past, two-arguably three-generalearn tions of Aboriginal children were removed from their parents. The member for Capricornia and her ilk of social workers are doing exactly that today. In fact, the very last case that I handled as the state member for the electorate of Flinders in the Queensland parliament involved two parents, both of Aboriginal descent, who had their kids removed by a social worker. That was the same job as the member for Capricornia had before put forward she came into this place. In that case, one of the kids was caught thieving. He was brought home by the police. A fairly enlightened businessman did not prosecute the kid, and the father gave him a good hiding. Two weeks later the kid was caught thieving again. He was brought home by the police and, again, as a result of an enlightened atti tude by the local business house, he was not prosecuted. The father gave him another hiding. The social workers turned up and took the kid off to the doctor to be inspected. I rang the doctor and the doctor told me that he could not find any marks on the child at all. I said to the father, 'Well, you did not give him much of a hiding.' He said, 'It may not have been much of a hiding, but the social workers have taken my five kids off me as a result.' If you break the right of the parent to discipline the child-and we are talking about education here-you are educating the child to know that he does not have to obey his parents and educating the parents to know that they cannot discipline the child. At a function in Mount Isa, some 200 people were involved in a riot. A lot of those people were of Aboriginal descent. Afterwards I called a big public meeting to try to quell tempers and to get something done about the very real problems that existed there. A number of the parents stood up and said, 'The answer lies with the parents. The parents have to discipline their kids. The parents should be punished for not disciplining the kids.' I did not have to say anything because the inspector of police stood up and said, 'Forget about that possibility. If the parents attempt to discipline their kids, they will end up in gaol and they will certainly have their kids removed from them.' So the very last case that I handled as a state member of parliament in Queensland was the same old story of the kids being taken away from the parents because the parents' attitudes do not reflect the attitudes of the do-gooders, the politically correct people of the day. In days past they were the unfortunate and, sadly, misguided missionaries that went out and took two--arguably three-generations of kids from their parents. To think that it was done in the name of the little carpenter from Nazareth is sadder still. That ugliness occurred and is part of Australian history-and sadly the history of my own state. I make the point that that education is taking place out there. It is very real education in the marketplace. It is informing parents that they no longer have control over their children, and it is informing the children that parents no longer have control over their kids. It is exactly the same principle that has been espoused in the state of Queensland, with the relatively brief interlude-I suppose it is not so brief; 30 years--of government by my own party. Many people would think that what I am saying is radical. To me, there is absolutely no difference between the social workers-the do-gooders of today-and the missionaries of yesterday. There are some very good and decent missionaries, but unfortunately they were very few and far between on the frontiers of Queensland. Without control and without discipline, there is absolutely no hope of getting kids educated. If I had been given the choice as a child of whether or not to go to school, I would not have gone. If I had been made fully aware of and educated to the idea that I could not be disciplined, I would not have gone to school. I would have had many pleasant days along the Cloncurry River with my shanghai. That is happening today in all of the communities throughout Queensland, not only for kids of Aboriginal descent but also for kids of white descent, particularly from parents with no educational background. They no longer have any discipline or control over their kids and they are not really very interested in education, so no great encouragement is given to the kids. As a result, the kids simply do not go to school. The Governor of Queensland, Sir Walter Campbell, called me aside at a function and said, 'Bob, I have been to Aurukun, and the kids there are not going to school.' There would not have been one-third of the kids at school that day. Truancy rates were 60 per cent. I informed him that I was not minister for education, but he said that, as I was minister for Aboriginal affairs, he wanted it fixed up. I admit that I appreciated him doing that. That situation was typical not only for the old reserve communities in Queensland but also for towns with kids that were predominantly of part Aboriginal descent. Those kids are simply not going to school. Those opposite can come into this place and talk about what we are going to do in the area of education, as the member for Capricornia and all of those in the bleeding hearts club have done today, but the kids are not going to school. What we have here is an interesting charade. It is a pleasant little debate in ety, but it is a debate about something that is not reality in the real world. It is not happening out there at all. The vast bulk of the population of Aboriginal descent in Queensland come from the old reserve communities. About 30,000 of the 70,000 people of Aboriginal descent in Queensland come from the old reserve communities. Probably two-thirds of the others come from towns such as my own home town of Cloncurry, where at least half of the population would be of part Aboriginal descent. I am very proud of the town because it is an excellent example of integration in Australia and of where this country should be moving. The official figures show that in remote rural communities, such as Cloncurry, 72 per cent go on to complete 12th grade. If you come from an urban community, 73 per cent go on to complete tertiary education. The classification that I am seeking is that of remote areas where people of Aboriginal descent live. In terms of the definition of 'remote', in the Northern Territory the only town that is not remote is Darwin. So even Alice Springs is considered to be remote in the context of this definition. Only 55 per cent of the kids from these areas complete 12th grade. When I stand here and say that the kids realise they do not have to go to school any more and that they are not going to school any more, this is backed up by the figures. In an urban community, where the parents on the whole are better educated, where people are more conditioned to do as they are told-the move with the herd mentality-they go to school. Kids in the remote areas that I am talking about do not. As far as tertiary education goes, if you come from an urban community in Australia you have twice the chance of going to a university or a tertiary institution than if you come from a non-urban community in Australia. Not only are those statistics bad; they reflect the fact that in communities such as the western towns in Queensland, and most certainly in New South Wales with which I am familiar, the people of Aboriginal descent are less likely to go away to complete 12th soci- grade or go away to a tertiary institution. I thought it was a quaint notion put up by the last speaker, the member for Capricornia, that we should get back to our Aboriginal culture and that we should assert Aboriginal culture. I remember watching a person on television one night who was debating with a lady from Sydney. The lady said, 'Unless our people get back to their culture then they are finished; we must educate them about our culture.' When she had finished her fairly strident assertions, the other speaker said, 'Well, you might talk about getting back to your culture until the cows come home, but I suspect that on Saturday afternoon they will be in front of the television watching the match of the day in the Sydney rugby league, and on that night they will be off to the local disco.' I was so impressed with the bloke's statement and with his knowledge and understanding of the first Australians that I went to the trouble of finding out who it was. The next day I rang the television station. The person's name was Fred Hollows. I had never heard of him back in those days, but I thought, 'This is a bloke calling the shots true; this is what it is like in the real world.' Some people may be ashamed of the cultural heritage from which I personally come, but it is the cultural heritage that the vast bulk of people of Aboriginal descent in Australia come from. It is a heritage that loves its rugby league, its country music and its rodeos, and that is the sort of world we live in and the sort of culture we aspire to, look up to and enjoy-and we are not particularly interested in that of anyone else. If you want to go to the big cities and listen to American rock music, that is fine. I have nothing against you doing it, but do not try to foist it upon us. In our schools throughout Australia. I see kids, many of whom are of first Australian descent, having rammed down their throats that this is not good, that this business of running around with horses and working with cattle is fairly primitive, that playing rugby league is fairly brutal and that country music is hicksville. So the culture, confidence and values these kids have been taught by their parents to love are being utldermined. But it is relevant to them. These people are being continuously denigrated by the education system which we have had imposed upon us. When I hear the rather naive previous speaker, the member for Capricornia, come into this place and give us lectures, it indicates to me that she obviously has not mixed with any people of Aboriginal descent in the whole of her life, except those who are referred to by a rather crude expression-an adjective, which obviously I will not use in this House. The second word they use, the noun, is coconut-obviously meaning white on the inside and brown on the outside. If you mix with first Australians you will hear this term very often. Clearly the member for Capricornia has mixed exclusively with those sorts of people or she would not be saying the rather stupid things she has been saying here today in this debate. Even the language that is used interests me. All the speakers today have used the word Aborigine continuously. If I could again hark back to my own background and my own home town of Cloncurry, the term Aborigine is never used. It is a term which is simply not in the lexicon of the local people. On an odd occasion they might use the term 'Murri', or a similar term to that, but the term Aborigine is not a term used in the environment in which we live. In many cases it is an identity that has been foisted upon people and which has created terrible divisions in societies where divisions have not existed in recent decades. Undoubtedly in days past those divisions were there, and some of them were terrible divisions. Most certainly those divisions could be seen in the history of inland Queensland. The major reason for education is to teach kids not only history and culture but, most important of all, survival skills. If you live these isolated areas, I venture to suggest that the survival skills needed to work in the cattle industry, the mining industry or in house building are the survival skills that rately needed for people in these areas to prosper. We have this place giving our people huge areas of land, but you cannot eat land. I owned a lot of land, but you cannot eat itit does not feed your kids. Quite frankly, it does not give you pride, either. Pride does not come with owning land; pride comes from producing something from the land. We have given the people the land, but we have given the people no ability whatsoever to work that land, nor the legal mechanisms to enable them to utilise the land properly. There are bleeding hearts all over the place here for people of Aboriginal descent, but noone has made a stand against the Queensland government. When I was a minister in Queensland we simply passed a memo around. We got agreement from all the Aboriginal community councils in Queensland that we would have all houses built exclusively by people of Aboriginal descent. The net result of that was the creation of about 350 jobs over the next 18 months. There were 60 or 70 apprenticeships. All of those jobs are now being abolished. There are very few of them left in Queensland because of the current Queensland government. I have written to Mr Tickner, and I have spoken to him twice, but he has done absolutely nothing. I do not think Aboriginal people are much different from other people, but people of Aboriginal descent, peculiarly enough, are excellent when it comes to house building skills. In fact, on Palm Island, two white teams were taken out and black teams took over their work because they were far more efficient, their output was far higher and their work was of a much higher quality. In the early days of my ministry they were used exclusively. But there has been no stand taken by this parliament or by this government against the Queensland government which is proceeding to abolish the survival skills, the training and the education needed to provide these people with the wherewithal-not to give them fish, but to give them a fishing line in so that they can catch their own fish-to be able to survive in the world out there, to hold their heads up high and to produce something of value, not only for themselves but for the are despe- greater Australian community. I cannot help but conclude by saying that it always amuses me that the European millennium, if you like, in Australia considers that everything in Australia came from Europe. (Time expired)",83
152,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (6.27 p.m.}-I am very pleased to be speaking on this very important Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill and to canvass some of the issues already canvassed by previous speakers, including the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). Let me say that the appalling approach towards Aboriginal culture he adopted in his speech is exactly the sort of problem we have faced for the last 200 years. When he said that there is nothing else in Aboriginal culture except rodeos and other phenomena brought toMr Katter-If I could take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, that is a very crude misrepresentation. There was nothing whatsoever like that in my speech. I said they are very proud of the culture they have, and that is their culture today.",87
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,Order! You are debating the point. There is no point of order.,87
154,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,He is debating the point. He said that education should not be directedMr Katter-On a point of order: he said that I said that that was the only culture that they had. You will not find the word 'only' in my speech.,87
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,Order! There is no point of order. You are simply debating the point.,87
156,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"The fact is that, if we are to have a serious and substantial program of education for our Aboriginal people, then we cannot ignore the richness and importance of their traditional culture. The member for Kennedy, whatever he says, was saying that that was irrelevant and not a significant factor. Mr Katter-I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am not trying to be difficult. He has said once again that I denigrated their Aboriginal culture. I didn't. I was emphasising what is a culture common to them and other people.",87
157,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,You did. I heard you. You ought to be ashamed. Mr Katter-What you are saying is an absolute lie.,87
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,Order! The honourable member for Kennedy had his opportunity to participate in the debate and was heard in silence. I ask the parliamentary secretary to come back to the bill.,87
159,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"The fact is that there cannot be a program of education that is significant and meaningful for the Aboriginal community but does not focus on these issues. What such a program must do is begin with the fundamental recognition that there has been wholesale destruction of Aboriginal culture in the last 200 years to the point that, in some places, some groups of Aboriginal people have completely lost-we have no records-their belief systems and the richness of those cultural traditions. That is something which we ought to be eternally ashamed of. There is another point. Fortunately, with the work of people with foresight, we have also been able to record and preserve large elements of Aboriginal cultures. In so doing, we now have to face the question of what our obligations are in terms of the promotion of these cultures. First, we have an obligation as Australians to gain a much broader recognition of the depth and meaning of these cultures. Secondly, we have an obligation to do more in the education of Aboriginal children to assist them in the reconstituting and recognising of these cultures that have been destroyed or lost. Why do I say this? I say this because some people think it is just a question of restoring a few belief systems. We do not understand how extraordinarily rich and important Aboriginal cultures were. It is very important to record what experts have said about this. For one thing, the lives of Aboriginal people were steeped in a tradition that we understand only marginally; that is, the tradition of religion and mystical belief. Let me read from an excellent book, The World of the First Australians, as follows: In comparison with many others, and certainly comparison with Europeans, the Aborigines were a deeply religious people. Religious feeling was manifested through ritual observance and through mythic expression-and, essentially, taken for granted. And an intrinsic part of it was a deep emotional attachment to the land, their own land. The whole countryside was full of signs and clues that were directly and indirectly relevant to their lives. It was made familiar and intimate to them through mythic beings who were believed to be manifested at specific sites, always present, and approachable through the medium of ritual. These were eternal or enduring elements, underlining continuity sustained through religious practice. one conceptual level, everything was brought together into one expanded socio-cultural environment. The deities were manifested predominantly through man, and other living things and other features were selected as intermediaries or symbolic representations: all drew on the same life force. This deeply mystical and religious concept, this depth, tied the Aboriginal people to the land, to their cultures and to their belief systems. Then European man came in and destroyed much of this, often not even having an idea of what was happening. Now we see Aborigines whose whole systems we have destroyed and we say, 'Look at them. They are the lost people.' Of course they are the lost people because they have lost these belief systems. They have lost much of this tradition and culture. A lot of this is our fault. If we are to give these people meaning life, we do not need more of the rodeos that the member for Kennedy talked about; we need to be able to give them some sense of their own identity, their history and their tradition. That means we have an obligation in Aboriginal education to orient much of towards the restoration and rebuilding of cultural forms. Of course you cannot totally bring back past, in that sense. Aborigines to have a tradition of European education. But a genuine Aboriginal education policy must relation merge these two traditions so these people can have a sense of their own history, worth spiritual inheritance. Unless they have that, other practical programs are going to fail. Why do I say this? It is because we simply cannot do things only in the European way. the If we build more houses, we must build them in such a way that they are meaningful to in those people. We need to have better systems of health and education, but they must be meaningful to their traditions. We must not do what we did in Oenpelli, for example, where, with good intentions, we built Western houses that had no system that related to the culture of that region. Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the Tiwi people of Bathurst Island. I did that in my capacity as parliamentary secretary responsible for the Australian Hearing Services. At I went there to explore a problem: 85 per cent of Aboriginal children on that island are partially deaf. They have serious hearing loss. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know what was happening? It took years before the teachers at the school realised what the problem was. The kids would come to school and the teachers would try to teach them, but they could not get the message across so they thought the kids were ignorant and foolish and that their IQs were low. But the children could not hear the teachers. Because of our neglect, we have created a situation in which the Aboriginal hearing problem is at crisis point. The government has recognised this problem and in this budget it has put aside $6 million. We often pride ourselves on the in white man's way of doing things. When this problem was first encountered the educational institutions said, 'They cannot hear. It's a health problem.' The health authorities said, 'No, it's not a health problem. It's in the classroom so it's an education problem.' So it the health and education authorities were these mucking around trying to decide whose problem this was. Meanwhile, children in the these schools were not learning because they will also have could not hear. I am very determined to take action into this issue. I will not accept bureaucratic nonsense about whether it is an educaand tion or health problem. We are going to do all whatever we can to ameliorate the problem of Aboriginal hearing. I bring it up in this context because it had a very big impact on educational possibilities for those children. In that classroom now, those children have to be taught by a loudspeaker system. There is a loudspeaker and the teacher wears a microphone so he can talk to the children. The point I am making here is that we have specific and important problems in Aboriginal education, but we also have the problem of arrogance-the presumption that we know how to resolve all of these matters-and the idea that we should not be consulting with the Aboriginal people and restoring their culture is very important. I conclude by making a couple of comments about the deep richness of Aboriginal culture. We do not even know a half of what existed. We have not even recorded it. We do not study it enough. We do not understand it enough. But we always think of the superiority of our systems. If we look at what anthropologists and other people who have done a good job in recording what the Aboriginal people believed, we find that in their belief systems there was a whole richness of not only symbolism but also philosophical thinking, serious thinking, about the nature of life, the nature of death, the nature of the human world and the meaning of the word 'existence'. All those issues which we pride ourselves on in terms of Western philosophy and Western religion are present in the Aboriginal tradition. Let me read one little creation story: The Muruwari tribe believed that Bida-Ngulu, sometimes called Wi-Bida-Ngulu, was the creator of all things. The name meant 'forehead of fire' and his face must never be looked upon. He lived in the sky and spoke with a deep, booming voice when thunder was heard. His greatest gift to men and women when he created them had been a dhuwidi, or living spirit. He had also given them their totems, which had remained their spiritual affiliation since the Dreamtime. To maintain life, he had left behind many good spirits which the people believed to be always hovering close to them. They stood quietly before making a request to these spirits, perhaps asking for a change in the weather or saying: 'Please give us fish in the The point about this creation story is god and his similarity to the Christian God, the creator of the world, especially the Old Testament figure. It is almost identical in terms of its symbolism. Yet we believe that our religions and our cultures are far superior. There is a story here about this god manifesting himself in the world in the shape of a man and mixing amongst the people. That is a story which we are also familiar with in the Christian tradition. What I am saying is that it is time for us to show that we are committed to the meaningfulness and importance of Aboriginal culture and the restoration of those belief systems that have been lost. Aboriginal education has to be oriented in this direction. Of course, practical matters are involved. There have to be practical skills. But in the area of practical skills, it is amazing that we are now discovering that many Aboriginal bush medicines have a very scientific basis. We are now funding a project to look at the similarities in and the Western scientific basis of Aboriginal medical knowledge. Years ago we used to think that this was all gibberish and nonsense. It is this transformation and this understanding of the worth of this culture which we have to embed in the Australian nation. More particularly, we must give Aboriginal children the opportunity to learn these traditions for themselves. In the book Dying Inside, Duncan Graham discusses the causes of Aboriginal deaths in custody. It is not just about external manifestations, maltreatment by police forces or other people or races: it is called 'dying inside' because many of these people have died inside their own self, their own spirit, their own sense of worth. They died in this way because much of what constituted their culture and the meaning of their existence was lost. Therefore, there was hardly anything left. Not only was there very little opportunity in employment and education through the white man's system but also there was nothing much left of the traditional culture and the traditional meaning. In that sense, therefore, many people, especially the younger ones, feel they have no identity or that their identity is totally confused or lost. In that sense they river.' want to recapture their Aboriginality. The honourable member for Kennedy said that this is nothing more than the work of white social workers and do-gooders. What a nonsense. If there is one thing that the Aboriginal people themselves have built up in the movement of Aborigines in the last 30 years it is their own consciousness of what they want, their own attempt to restore that feeling of worth in themselves through the restoration of the meaning of their culture, the richness of their culture, especially the spirituality, the belief systems and the philosophy of their culture, and in so doing to feel that they have a place in the modem world-and they do, because they can teach us something about the real meaning of existence rather than simply the pursuit of material goods all the time. In that sense we can learn a lot from Aboriginal people. I think that we can do this through the education system. Aboriginal education must be oriented towards achieving not only the practical skills of survival but also other skills. (Time expired)",87
160,Mr MILES,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"I rise to enter into the debate on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1995. The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) spent a considerable amount of time on anthropology and cultural understanding of the Aboriginal people. I wholly agree with much of what he said. If the debate continued down this vein, we might re-establish what the real function of this parliament is about, and that is, an exchange of views on the floor of the House between members who are elected to it. The honourable member raised important issues regarding people's identity, their selfesteem, their dignity, and coming to a meaningful understanding of their human spiritedness. I guess we could say that is what the honourable member for Calwell was talking about. That having been said, we are now looking at funding for Aboriginal education. It is interesting that during the last 20 to 25 years we have heard this discussion about culture, the importance of understanding people's culture right around the world and, particularly within this country, the Aboriginal people's culture. As a member of the government, the honourable mcmber for Calwell said the education system must merge the Aboriginal and European cultures. The present government has been in office for 12 years and is still saying, 'Something must happen.' TIllS has been going on for 12 years. I looked at the second reading speech because I have taken an interest in Aboriginal affairs for quite a period of time now in the parliament. In the fourth paragraph the minister said that the government intends to make major changes to the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program from January 1997, with a new funding triennium to commence at that time. The new funding triennium is fine. But the government is going to 'make major changes'. This really is an admission of defeat of what they brought in in 1989. Last year in this debate I encouraged the government to set out very clearly some measurements of whether we are making progress in this area, as it should in any other program. One of the problems in Aboriginal educational funding is that the government of the day-and this government has been there for 12 years-is not prepared to say, 'As a goal, for the next three years we want a participation rate for Aboriginal students of 30 per cent or 40 per cent at year 10 or year 12.' But the government is not prepared to set a goal. I would be absolutely delighted if we made some small progress towards set goals. Often in this parliament we set the standard too high for what we want to achieve overnight. This is a complex area. It does involve a loss of dignity by a group of people. All people are equal. The previous speaker did indicate that there has been a tendency to look down on this group or that group of people. He is quite right. There should be none of that because every human being should be seen equally. In this area we find however that the government has not really set about systematically wanting to achieve set goals in a whole range of areas. The government has nominated three national priorities for funding in this second triennium. The first relates to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. As a by-line to that, it is very interesting to look at that issue. Looking at the Australian Institute of Criminology figures, the death rate has now flattened out. There was a huge peak in the number of Aboriginal deaths in custody at that time. Paralleling that peak, almost identically, was an increase in the number of deaths in custody of non-Aboriginal people. Now the numbers have all dropped down again. A lot of that came about because of the focus in public debate and you had this imitative behaviour, about which criminologists know quite a lot-if you talk a lot about it, you actually increase the number of people who choose to kill themselves. That is a tragic thing, but the government says it is going to deal with this area in its education. The second thing was to implement the national Aboriginal languages and literacy strategy and also implement the national reconciliation and schooling strategy. I wonder in these terms whether we as a parliament are being too wise for our own benefit. Is it possible to achieve some of these grandiose ideas with the funding that is being contributed? I would suggest to the government that it really needs to set up some very clear achievable goals in education in this area. Then year by year we should be able to progress towards those goals. Maybe each year we could move the goals on as we progressively achieve the set goals of the previous year. I am concerned that we have before us another proposal to make major changes to the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program. A previous speaker in here from Queensland said that Queensland has been more successful than any other state in its retention rates of Aboriginal young people for year 12. That is true. In fact, per head of population Queensland actually retains double the number of Aboriginal young people in year 12 than in any other state. Looking into that, it appears that one of fundamental factors in making that contribution has been stability in the education delivery system. Over the years in lots of other states there has been chopping and changing. That has also been difficult for the European children to take. But for the Aboriginal children I believe that that has been a major contributing factor as to why they have not maintained their schooling. But in Queensland over the years there has not been that chopping and changing in the delivery of education. So it has been much more stable, much more predictable and much more able to be understood by Aboriginal students. So they have progressed through the various stages without having either year 10 results or certificates changed or the curriculum changed; or getting started, then getting halfway through and having it changed on them and really not following it. It is okay in our culture, we are used to being adaptable; but for a lot of the Aboriginal young people that is not the case. So stability in what is actually being delivered in regard to education is very important. It worries me that we are now into another set of changes. As I said at the beginning, it indicates to me that the government did not get it right to begin with. It has now been 12 years and they still have not got it right. They are now pushing it out and holding out a great hope that in the future we are going to get it right. I only wish that in this parliament there could be a recognition of setting some reasonably achievable goals whereby in a bipartisan way as a parliament we say, 'We are going to move towards achieving these set goals of literacy rates and numeracy skills across the different grade levels for Aboriginal young people.' No matter what we say about the culture, the anthropology and how important it is to teach that, we still have to all come back and face the fact that these are the most educationally disadvantaged young people in Australia and things have to happen to try to improve that. One of the difficulties in trying to merge the two cultures in this way is that, if we are the going to spend a lot of time on Aboriginal culture and anthropology, which is fascinating and very interesting, we have to ask how much we can really fit into the curriculum and how much can really be taught by teachers. Are we really going to teach English language to the Aboriginal young people? I think everybody would agree: yes, we are. Most of the Aboriginal elders that I have spoken to would also say that it is fundamental. They have to have one foot in one culture and another foot in another culture. That is a common sense understanding of the merging of the two cultures. But there is a limit to what teachers can do in the six hours in which they are teaching. There has to be a selection of what they are going to be taught. I agree that it would be great if we could continue to teach the spiritual aspects of the Aboriginal culture. At the same time, if we talk about that, are we going to talk about the spiritual aspects of European culture in the same way? That will still take time. Really fundamental things have to be got across. First of all, we have to get our Aboriginal young people in many parts of Australia to just go to school and stay at school. I have talked with one of the teachers in Arnhem Land who has been teaching for 22 years in one area. He said, 'On the statistics, they stay until year 10, but the actual grade of teaching which is being achieved is grade 3.' People in parliament get the impression that we are making real progress. He said to me that the real difficulty is getting them through to a year 10 standard. Because they miss so much schooling or do not come to school and often are not followed up, they get to the age of 15 but still only achieve a grade 3 standard, and that is a problem. There needs to be a little realism. We need to set goals that are achievable. I find that there is still not that acceptance at this level. As I - aid, we have the government saying that it will make major changes. After being in government for 12 years, it can say that only three objective standards have improved over the last four years. It says, for example, that between 1989 and 1993 the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students staying on to year 12 increased from 14 per cent to 33 per cent. That is really good news. During the same period, the number of indigenous people attending university has doubled. That is good. But what about some measurable outcomes for people achieving grade 6 education? What about the standards of literacy and numeracy, which are fundamental skills in the Australian cultural context, irrespective of background? The government ought to be focusing on and bringing to the parliament what the goals are. Have the state and federal ministers for education really sat down with hands-on experience and put up realistic goals? I sometimes wonder whether this does not happen because we are too scared that we might be seen to fail. It is time that we be realistic about the way in which we go about this. We should not continue with broad generalisations about how we are spending money in Aboriginal education. Let us understand what is required. Let us not overload the curriculum. Let us make sure that we identify those key areas that need teaching in those schools. Let us get on with it and be clear about what our goals are. I believe that we can make progress. I do not have any doubt that the Aboriginal people coming through our universities will make excellent teachers. I do not have any doubt that lots of European teachers want to contribute to Australia's progress in education in these ways. It can be achieved. But, while we have generalisations, changes and a lack of specificity about what the money is really for, we will not make a lot of progress. It would be my request to the government that it become much more focused, that it identify at the ministerial councils of education ministers much more clearly what the goals are and that it hold the bureaucracy to achieving those goals. As I said, last year in this debate I requested clearly identifiable objectives and standards by which we can measure whether we are making real progress. I see two in this document. I welcome and applaud that progress. I hope that next year, instead of having only two criteria in here, we might have 10 or 15 so that we can really say in future years, 'Back in 1995, we did set up some criteria by which we can judge whether we are making progress.' Let us not keep changing the delivery of these programs. That is half the problem. Teachers get frustrated with it. On the one hand, they just get used to what is going to be delivered, where they can get financial assistance to help certain young people, and the next thing they find is that it has all changed. There are different types of forms and different goals. When they just start to make some real progress in the area, it gets cut off. There needs to be a very clear examination of that. I hope that next year, when we are here, we will see clear goals, clear objectives and some measurement as to whether we have achieved them.",90
161,Mr HOLLIS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"I am pleased to participate in this debate. I was quite interested in what the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) was saying. I agree with some of what he said. He talked about the spiritual aspects of the Aboriginal culture. He seemed to be suggesting that there might be too much emphasis placed on that. It always seems amazing to me that no-one ever raises the issue of Christianity being rammed down people's throats in so many of our schools. No-one questions the teaching of religious studies. I know that in my area some friends of mine did not want their children to participate in religious education and that their kids were ostracised. We do not question religious studies being taught in our schools, but we seem to question teaching the spiritual aspects of Aboriginal culture. Mr Miles-I am happy for that.",93
162,Mr HOLLIS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Thank you. I do not want to be partisan in this debate, which in many respects has been fairly bipartisan. The parliamentary secretary at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Dr Theophanous), had an exchange of views with the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), but, apart from that, things have gone along in a fairly bipartisan way. I have no disagreement with the honourable member for Braddon talking about achievable goals being set. But, considering the way that he talked about this Labor government being in power 12 years, one would imagine that absolutely nothing has been achieved in 12 years. There are those of us who have had some contact with Aboriginal communities. The honourable member for Kennedy seems to think that unless you are from an outback electorate you do not really have an understanding of Aboriginal matters. I originally come from Kempsey on the north coast. I have a pretty good understanding of such matters. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, I was brought up not all that far from Burnt Bridge and near Green Hills. You know about Purfleet at Taree. People like us who have been born at, and brought up on, the north coast of New South Wales understand the situations and some of the frustrations involved in dealing with this aspect of our society. There has been a considerable and wide ranging debate on this bill. Some members have spoken of frustrations; others have spoken of successes. Many of the issues have been covered by the speakers in the debate from all sides of the House. They have ranged from the anthropological study that the parliamentary secretary gave us to the first-hand experience that the honourable member for Kennedy gave us. I would like to share a success story with the House. We hear of some of the not so successful stories, and I would like to share a success story that I have a particular interest in. When the honourable member for Braddon reads my speech in the Hansard, maybe he will agree that there have been successes in meeting the goals of this project that have been set. In supporting the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill, I want to use as an example a particular training program in Aboriginal cultural tourism at Wallaga Lake on the south coast of New South Wales. The direct result of this program has been the formation of a quite successful business called the Umbarra Cultural Tours. This particular project is in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). I must say that the member for Eden-Monaro has always supported this venture and has maintained a very close interest in it. In fact, I was talking to him about it today. I am indebted to one of my former electorate assistants, Terry Fox, who, after working with me for about five years, spent several years at Wallaga Lake assisting the community in their training. Terry, who regularly visits my office and occasionally relieves there-as he is at the moment-has kept me informed of the progress of this particular venture at Wallaga Lake. I would preface my remarks by drawing the attention of the House to the close link between land rights, Aboriginal education and training, and the revitalisation of Aboriginal culture. Following the enactment of the New South Wales Land Rights Act by the Wran Labor government in 1983 and the formation of local land councils, many Aboriginals sought to validate their claims to particular areas of land. They turned to their old people for information about their sites, history and culture and sought further proof for their claims in the documents of non-Aboriginal settlers, historians, archaeologists and anthropologists. Quite suddenly, Aboriginal people could see a new and very real need for some form of education. There was a further step in the process. Once an Aboriginal community had gained title to its land, the question arose about possible uses, both cultural and economic, to which the land could be put. The obvious answer at Wallaga Lake was cultural tourism. Once that decision had been made, the people saw the need for a community based training program. It is to the great credit of the Wollongong office of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which was then responsible for the Wallaga Lake area, that funding was made available for the training program. The regional manager believed, quite correctly in my opinion, that a thoroughgoing training program would not only assist the community in developing a successful business but also stimulate its members to playa more active role in its various organisations-such as the land council, the housing company and the preschool committee. This is exactly what happened. Before the training program commenced, the community's affairs had been left in the hands of a few willing people. But, as training progressed, the trainees began to give voice to their opinions and to stand for executive positions. They brought to these organisations a more informed understanding of meeting procedures. This resulted in better conducted meetings and in their organisations becoming more accountable to both the community and government funding agencies. Community leaders at Wallaga Lake are convinced that, had training been restricted to the accustomed low budget, short-term programs, then nothing of any significance would have been achieved and the community would have continued to be one of the most demoralised on the south coast. During the project's second year, the training program faltered because of funding delays and uncertainties. It was left to a small group of half a dozen people who persisted with a series of shortterm courses. Towards the end of that year, with the assistance of further DEBT funding, they were able to attract a number of other younger people to join them in Aboriginal studies and tour guide training. These courses in particular opened their eyes to the need to make use of written resources and other information made available through organisations such as the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies here in Canberra and the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service. With the cooperation of the Bega office of the New South Wales Department of School Education, the trainees started visiting local schools where they spoke about their culture and history, displayed traditional artefacts and bush tucker, and demonstrated the use of ochre painting and boomerang throwing. They also took school groups on daylong excursions to nearby areas of spiritual significance such as Mumbulla Mountain and hosted visits to Wallaga Lake. These activities were at first seen as a kind of work experience within the overall training program but quickly developed into a successful business. The trainees had no previous experience in this kind of work. They now found it necessary to spend many hours developing their presentation skills, researching their information and working out effective ways to present it to school children. Since those early days, the activities of Umbarra Cultural Tours have expanded considerably. Last year, for example, they were invited to spend a series of two-day sessions in nine different Canberra schools. The afternoon of the first day was spent educating the teachers in Aboriginal culture and history. The second day was spent, class by class, with the children themselves. Quite early in the training it was realised that, if the proposed tourism business-which included a cultural centre and cabin accommodation-were to be successful, it would need to be developed very gradually. They identified seven steps, each of which had the potential to be a stand-alone financial success. Doing it this way, they realised, gave them the chance to grow with the project, learning more sophisticated skills as they went. It also gave them the opportunity to call a stop at any point should it be decided that further developments would interfere unduly with the life of the local community. By the end of the second year, the training group had defined further areas of training, such as office administration and procedures, computer skills, and bookkeeping and accounting. Since then, they have arranged for follow-up training in areas of particular need, such as trail construction and horticulture. These courses have been conducted at Wallaga Lake in conjunction with Bega skillshare. In addition, several trainees have from time to time sought individual tuition in English, mathematics and bookkeeping to better equip them for specialised jobs within the business. In short, on-the-job training has become a normal part of their working life. As honourable members would be aware, NAIDOC week, a time when Aboriginals and Islanders celebrate their history and culture, falls in July each year. This is a particularly busy time for Umbarra Cultural Tours, which has school activities scheduled for each and every day over this period. The remark has been made that, were this to happen in all parts of Australia, the reconciliation process between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians would be considerably accelerated. Two months ago, Umbarra Cultural Tours took a major step forward when it opened its cultural centre. The next stage in the project will see the addition of an amenities block, a large shelter shed and several holiday cabins. The business will then be in a position to offer overnight hospitality to school and family groups. At present, Umbarra Cultural Tours has a staff of five but is currently negotiating with the Department of Employment, Education and Training for further training subsidies which will make it possible to employ another 10 people from the community. These young people will be given hands-on training in a variety of tasks, including landscaping, walking trail construction and construction of the first holiday cabins. Once a week, a local tourist business, Merimbula Tours, takes mainly pensioner groups to Umbarra where, to their great amusement, they learn the fine arts of boomerang and spear throwing and also much about local Aboriginal culture and history. There are many other things that could be said about Umbarra Cultural Tours, but time does not permit this. Let me conclude by emphasising that the people now running the successful business had very little previous education and most of them had been many years away from school. I believe it provides an excellent example of how government funding can be used to foster Aboriginal initiatives in tertiary education and training. The results are many. It has provided employment at Wallaga Lake, enhanced community self-esteem, encouraged the people to uncover many details of their history and culture, and given them the ability to educate non-Aboriginal Australians in their ancient traditions. Regarding the more detailed aspects of the bill, I am particularly pleased to see that there is an appropriation within the bill to the Department of Communications and the Arts to part-fund the establishment of the National Institute of Indigenous Performing Arts Training. This honours a commitment in the 1994 Creative Nation statement to the preservation and promotion of indigenous cultures. For us to blossom as a society, we must share the Aboriginal culture with our own culture. One thing that has always amazed me is how the pakeha in New Zealand, the white New Zealanders, share and take pride in the Maori culture of that country. If you talk to any of the pakehas in New Zealand, they deal with the Maori culture as their own. I do not think we have reached that stage in Australia, which is a pity. I do not think we will be a fully developed nation until we, the white Australians, share in the culture of the Aboriginal, the original, Australians. It is part of the culture of this country, so I welcome that aspect of this bill. I particularly congratulate the people of Wallaga Lake on their perseverance and commitment. I give my enthusiastic support to the bill now before the House in the belief that the funding it provides will be put to similar good use as the example I have outlined tonight has. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Dr Theophanous) read a third time. NA Motion (by Dr Theophanous) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Housing Project in the Philippines",93
163,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I have a good news story tonight-that is, a company in my electorate, Ortech Industries, has signed a $30 million export deal with a company in the Philippines. The Ortech Industries company was formed as a result of a management buyout of Stramit Industries. I am sure anyone from the building industry in this House would know and understand the technology of the Stramit system, which was devised by a Bendigo resident who formed a company which became a leader in building technology throughout the world. This is a very exciting project for Ortech Industries. I have been involved with the company on the development of and interest in this project. It is proposed that 3.9 million houses-that is correct, Mr Deputy Speaker: 3.9 million houses-be built in the Philippines over a period of five years at a cost of some $550 million. There is a massive housing shortage in the Philippines which has resulted from a number of housing relocations occurring in a whole range of areas. All the people in one area which has been affected by the activity of volcanoes are to be relocated. Ortech Industries and the Philippines government will work on a cooperative basis to house these people. Also, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, in some of the poorer areas of the Philippines many thousands of people live adjacent to rubbish dumps; they will also be relocated to these homes. The object of the exercise is to set up 20 plants in the Philippines, using Australian technology combined with local Philippine technology, to produce a low cost home. That low cost home-and I have seen the prototype-consists of a concrete floor, steel roofing and a cement rendered exterior. Of course, the interior of that low cost home, if made in Australia, would have been of straw Stramit type sections-that is, compressed strawboard. But in the Philippines nine million hectares of land are used for rice farming. Generally, the farmers on that land are poor as they have no other income; more specifically, if the return from rice is at a low level, they have a very poor income. The farmers have had no demand for the rice straw and have been used to burning it. But now, utilising the technology available from Ortech Industries, the plan is to make houses from rice strawboard panels. This will add to the farmers' income and, within those 20 provinces, enable them to survive as primary producers. So the internal walls in the building of these homes will be made from rice strawboard panels. They will be supported by steel which will be formed in Australia and exported to the Philippines. On August 21, a letter of intent was signed by the company and the Cooperative Union of the Philippines. Machinery will be sent to the Philippines, and technology from Australia will be used to train the people in the Philippines. The group leader, Zinnia Teruel, the regional director of the Philippines Department of Science and Technology, was in Bendigo recently with a Philippines development team. All in all, it seems to me that there could be some very exciting opportunities for the Ortech company and other Australian firms associated with this project. There is obviously a vast market for this prototype housing, which comes at a very low cost but which is very effective, particularly in those tropical climates, with the cement floor and the cement rendered exterior making it weatherproof. It should present wonderful opportunities for Ortech-and it is great to hear a good news story.",96
164,Mrs EASSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Lowe) (7.29 p.m.)Recently a delegation from the state of Kuwait visited the Australian parliament. The members of that delegation visited the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia, Mr Howard, and the Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Tim Fischer. They had useful talks with a range of members of this parliament. This delegation was concerned with the continuing problems of the POWs from Kuwait being held by Iraq. I support the work of this delegation. The continued holding of these Kuwaiti men by Iraq is shameful. It shames Iraq, it shames the Arab people and it is completely against the values of Islam and all religions. I call upon the Australian government and all Australians of goodwill to support this campaign to free the Kuwaiti prisoners of war held by Iraq. There are approximately 630 men held and it is now 4Y2 years since the end of the fighting in the Gulf War. The arrival of this delegation, on this mission of mercy, should refocus Australia's eyes upon the Gulf. For a variety of historical and geographical reasons, Australia's involvement with the Gulf states has been minimal. This is not good and is contrary to the real interests of Australia. Australia enjoys an excellent reputation in the Gulf region. Our Australian brand of political involvement does not need domination of the Gulf or exploitation of its resources. We never try to take political advantage of any region. This proper behaviour is well known by the Gulf states leadership and it brings about a situation which gives Australia a very good name in the region. For some time now Australia has lacked any diplomatic or trade representation in Kuwait. I think this is unfortunate. I know that the expenses of such establishments are relatively high and the budget for this year is now set. However, I think that it should be possible for Australian authorities to consult with the Kuwaiti foreign ministry to look for a suitable Kuwaiti citizen to act as Australia's honorary consul in Kuwait. It is in our interKuwait ests for us to have a suitable person with high level Kuwaiti contacts who can help Australian business find the right doors to knock on and someone who can help his Kuwaiti compatriots find some useful investment in Australia. Kuwait has over $100 billion invested overseas, but very little of it in Australia. The Gulf region contains the world's richest oilfields. The average income is considerably higher than the Australian average and over the next 20 years the population of the six Gulf Cooperation Council states will double to over 52 million. This level of resources is without equal in the world but at the moment Australia's goods and services are very hard to find in this market. All political parties in Australia support the policy of Australia as an international trader. Yet this Gulf region is being neglected. This is more by accident than design. I note that the Leader of the National Party regularly makes strong efforts on behalf of Australian companies in this region. We should all support him in this but we should do more and we should do it soon. Kuwait has many problems, social as well as political. Australia is a country that has an excellent record in dealing with social problems. One major problem in Kuwait is the problem of the Bedoon. Recently the American organisation Human Rights Watch put out a 105-page report on the situation of the Bedoon in Kuwait. The report shows a serious problem for both the Kuwaitis and the Bedoon. The importance of Kuwait-both strategically and in natural resources-is so great that this problem should not get worse, but efforts should be made to help Kuwait with this problem. Australia has an excellent track record in giving social help. Our own society is testimony to the successful efforts of all Australian political parties over the past 50 years. People overseas see Australia as a nation that can be relied upon for good advice and practical assistance. We do not seek to rule anyone, dominate regions or manipulate governments. Sadly, this Australian way is not the way of other nations. The outcome of Australia's increased involvement in Kuwait-and other Gulf states-would be many· opportunities in many fields. But we should remember that people overseas feel comfortable dealing with Australia. To conclude, Mr Speaker, I do think that Australia should increase its engagement with the Gulf region states. The potential for trade and commerce is excellent, our reputation is very good and our duties as an international citizen should impel us to look closely at helping Kuwait remain free from external threat and stable in its internal situation. Kuwait is important. It is very important. Our record of useful assistance is a good record. Let us add to this record, improve our trading position in the Gulf and help the Gulf states with their real and pressing problems. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade",97
165,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"On 5 June 1995 and 30 August 1995 I made two speeches in relation to serious matters concerning the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, DFAT. Copies of the two Suriname documents raised on 5 June which related to secret payments to Mr Michael Costello, permanent head of DFAT, were handed to the Australian Federal Police on 19 June. On 30 June, the afternoon Melbourne Herald-Sun published a front page item by Ian Livingstone quoting AFP sources as stating that the documents were forgeries. However, the AFP immediately issued a media release describing Livingstone's article as 'incorrect' and the conclusions drawn as 'misrepresented'. On 25 August Detective Superintendent Brian Hepworth informed me by telephone that the AFP could not assess whether the documents were genuine or false as they did not have access to the original documents. Significantly, the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) on 29 August did not refer to the first documents as forgeries and asked that I hand over all documents to the AFP. On 1 September the AFP were provided with copies of the two documents relating to my speech of 30 August 1995, another Suriname document relating to the Marshall Islands affair and a letter on Australian High Commission, London, letterhead. On 8 September I received a strangely hurried phone call from Superintendent Hepworth. He informed me that the documents were not genuine, although he did not specify to which documents he was referring. The previous examination of the documents had taken the AFP a period of two months; whereas the AFP thought the second letters to be forgeries within five working days. In view of Superintendent Hepworth's bizarre phone call, and despite prior positive forensic and analytical opinion on the three Suriname documents, I further sought the professional services of one of Australia's leading forensic scientists, Neil Holland of Scientific Document Services Pty Ltd in Melbourne. Mr Holland's reports are recognised up to Supreme Court level. His detailed report agreed with the original AFP assessment; namely, that he could not establish whether any of the four documents presented to the AFP were genuine documents or otherwise as he did not have access to the originals. He also noted that the use of electrostatic techniques revealed that there were no decipherable indentations on the lettersthat is, there were no identifiable signs of document interference. I have been reliably informed that it would be impossible for the AFP to establish the authenticity or otherwise of these documents and address the complex issues involvedincluding the Marshall Island passports scam, the role of Graham Richardson, alleged large deposits in a European bank and the provision of passports to known drug traffickerswithin five working days. The Queensland Criminal Justice Commission, the CJC, recently condemned the AFP report concerning the Operation Wallah investigation into Richardson as a whitewash of questions that were politically sensitive and 'too hot to handle' . As journalist Brian Toohey recently pointed out, 'I don't think you can expect a police force, say, to investigate politicians who've been corrupt. Because, after all, they're still working for those politicians in a pretty direct sense.' Indeed. I will continue to raise in this House questions of official corruption and, I add, with documents. Nuclear Testing in the Pacific",98
166,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I was part of a group of parliamentarians who went to French Polynesia to demonstrate against the French tests at Mururoa Atoll and at Fangataufa. That delegation of people encompassed all parties except the National Party. We got there and we were confronted with a peaceful blockade of a road. This blockade had initially taken place, I believe, a day or two prior to our getting there. We partook on that first day in a peaceful march through the city to the Territorial Assembly. The people who were involved in that march, politicians from all around the world and native people, had one intention: peaceful demonstration against the French actions in resuming nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll. We then went on with a number of meetings with leading politicians in the Territorial Assembly. Some politicians went to see the High Commissioner. In fact, we were engaged in a number of long-term meetings to try to engage ongoing peaceful demonstrations against the French test. The next day, the day the French actually detonated their device, I was on my way to the Territorial Assembly, where an assembled press conference was to take place at 3 0' clock. While walking past the High Commissioner's residence, which is in a street that is aligned to the Territorial Assembly, I witnessed gross brutality by the French metropolitan police against three young Japanese students. Naively I went in with my passport in hand and pleaded for the violence to stop against these students. Their actions while they were being arrested were only to protect themselves from the blows to the knees and from the punches they were receiving from the police. I do believe the police got a little agitated after I was told to speak French and I then spoke in French to them and again repeated my protests. I was then arrested when a Norwegian television camera crew put their camera in my face. Inside that holding cell, I, with the others, was asked to grab the bars and spread my legs. Next to me was a young Japanese student, probably 17 years of age, who could not speak any English or French. He followed what I was doing and was in no way resisting anything that was asked of him. They grabbed this boy by his belt and pulled him out to a point where he could hardly keep himself upright. Then they kicked his legs from underneath him until he fell crashing to the ground. They then grabbed him by the scrotum and dragged him to his feet. They did this repeatedly until I was taken away. After five hours of interrogation, in which they alleged that I had pushed and punched the police, I asked them to charge me so that they could make more of a fool of Jacques Chirac than he has made of himself in the world's eyes. The next day I attended a rally of unionists and women. The women's groups and unionists wanted to demonstrate on that day against the Mururoa test. The whole gist of that meeting was to peacefully demonstrate against what had taken place. I went out there with a number of other politicians and accompanied those people to the airport. The women took their place on the tarmac. The French are trying to tell us that other people caused the violence. I will tell you what caused the violence. The French fired on those women. One woman, holding a baby, was hit with a tear gas canister, and both were injured. That led to an eruption of violence. People lost control. Speaking after that to the leaders of the women's group and unions, I was told that they had completely lost control whilst they had tried to calm the people down. Violence having been executed on their people by the French, the French cowardlycowards as they are-turning around to try to blame the Australian and New Zealand politicians and the media is tantamount to a gross act of deceit on their part. I wanted to say this, I want to say a lot more, and I hope to have the opportunity to follow on with this story. These people have done something which is absolutely inhuman. Their actions towards their own people on Tahiti lead me to wonder whether they deserve the right to claim the sovereignty of that area of the world. I did not go there to attack the French or their sovereignty. I, like all the other politicians, did not go there for anything other than a peaceful demonstration. (Time expired) Involvement of Churches in Politics",99
167,Mr CLEARY,ADJOURNMENT,"Recent statements by the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, concerning the involvement of the churches in the political life of Victoria deserve the greatest condemnation. If memopposition bers of the federal coalition sit back and give their tacit support to these comments, they deserve condemnation. To on the submerge yourself in the rhetoric of individualism, as members of the coalition so often in this House when they defend the individual against international conventions and big government, yet on the other hand tum a blind eye to Jeff Kennett's authoritarianism constitutes abject hypocrisy. If Jeff Kennett were a fascist, a bovver-boot boy like Benito Mussolini, for example, we could understand this desire to bring the church to heel. But before he was elected Jeff Kennett did not ever say he was opposed to elections, free speech, an independent judiforum ciary or the pluralism that characterises Western democracies. Sure, we knew he a right wing lover of the corporate sector, we all suspected he would be into cronyism, but most people did not think that he would start acting like a reborn Mussolini. Now the undeniable truth is that Jeff nett is beginning to seriously resemble fascist dictator. Jeff Kennett knows that in absence of an effective opposition the churchments es constitute the most serious obstacle economic and political vandalism. That is why Mussolini, aware that the church might become his strongest source of opposition, about wooing the Catholic Church in pre-war Italy. When bribery and pork-barrelling failed, the police and the bovver boys were sent into close down particular Catholic organisations. Sending in the police or his own special squad is not likely to endear the Premier to the Victorian community. He can get away with that down at Albert Park or at Richmond Secondary College, but out in the northern suburbs I think we would take offence if he started burning books and storming presbyteries. In essence, what Kennett is doing is firing the first salvos in the war against his real opponents-the churches. Now that the churches constitute one of the major bulwarks of opposition to Kennett's morally bankrupt policies, they have been targeted for a bit of jackbootism. The sad reality is that the disappearance of the state has forced the churches to assume this position of opposition. So bad are things too in the state ALP, there is a defectors list one hand longer than your arm. Like 'stay at home' patriots who wanted do everyone else to do the fighting during the First World War, Kelvin Thomson and Bob Sercombe will wax lyrically about the horrors of 'Kennettism', but ask them to take up the challenge and they will tell you that they are bound for bigger things-a leather seat and a better super scheme in Canberra. In my electorate of Wills, as I am sure is the case in so many other electorates, the churches are a crucial ingredient in the political life of the community. When I held a jobs at the Don Bosco Centre in Brunswick prior to the 1995 budget, Bishop Jeremy was Ashton from the Anglican Church in and Merlynston, Brother David O'Brien and Father Peter Rankin from Don Bosco, and the Reverend Alistair MCRae from the Uniting Church, West Brunswick were all in attendKenance. Each expressed serious concern about a unemployment, in particular youth unemploythe ment. Each expressed a desire for govern to allocate greater resources to the to his problems of unemployment. Again, showing great equanimity, representatives of churches of various denominations, set including the Reverend Dick Wooton, Father Mark Crawford, Father Len Thomas, Bishop Ashton and the Reverend Alistair MCRae, were in attendance when I held a press conference for visiting Sinn Fein peace envoy, Jim Neeson. The truth is that the churches and their representatives cannot and should not avoid politics. The more governmentsfederal and state-reduce their outlays, the more churches and their communities feel the pressure. Ask any church leader how things are and you will be told that the church is acquiring more and more responsibilities and is being stretched financially to the limit as it attempts to compensate for the withdrawal of government services and funding. Preening yourself or snaring a photo opportunity at a charity ball, as Jeff Kennett and his philistine mates love to do, will not camouflage the anti-social policies of the Kennett government. Given my knowledge of the local churches in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, I cannot see them caving in under the weight of the crude, fascistic pronouncements of Jeff Kennett. The Premier's arrogance and selfdeception-not to mention his political stupidity-may know no boundaries, but it is no recipe for eternal success. The people cannot and will not live on prayer alone. To chide the churches for allegedly abandoning their spiritual responsibilities in favour of politics only reveals how reactionary Jeff Kennett is. The community knows that privatisationfederal and state-will never serve the interests of an egalitarian society. I hope the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) is in there telling the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that. The community knows that the term 'reform' is nothing but a euphemism for economic vandalism and cronyism. (Time expired) Bank Fees and Charges",100
168,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to talk about bank fees and charges, which are of vital concern to families in my electorate and throughout Australia. Last Friday was the deadline set by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) for the banks to indicate whether or not they are prepared to introduce a no-frills account or a basic banking product. It appears that most banks are willing to comply with the Treasurer's request. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the commitment of the Commonwealth Bank to introduce a basic banking product as I would welcome its decision to abolish over-the-counter fees for disabled customers and offer new exemptions for some age and war veteran pensioners. I would also like to take a little time to reiterate what a basic banking product is so that there can be no misunderstanding about this matter within the major banks. As is the case in so many areas of public policy, the devil could well be in the detail. The banks must understand what we mean by a basic banking product. It is one which has no account keeping fees, one which has more than one free transaction a week, one which has reasonable access to over-the-counter services, one which provides those who are unable to use ATMs with access to over-thecounter services and so on. Opponents of no-frill accounts describe those who advocate the account's introduction as calling for free banking. We are doing no such thing. Nothing could be further from the truth. Advocates of no-frills accounts want a basic banking account which will serve people on lower incomes and will not cost those people an arm and a leg. In the last fortnight we have come a long way on this question of getting a basic banking product. But the banks must understand that a basic banking product must be more than a PR exercise. We cannot let the banks hide these accounts. They must be promoted by the banks, and staff must be trained to advocate them. There will be a continuing role for members of this House, particularly on this side, to ensure that the banks are kept honest in this endeavour. In outlining the case for a no-frills account, the PSA report also said that the banks should not seek to increase their overall revenue from fees but should concentrate on changing the structure of existing fees to make them more efficient. My message this evening is very clear: the banks should not try to pay for the cost of providing a basic banking product by lifting other charges, particularly transaction charges. This is but one reason why I find the comments by the ANZ chief executive, Don Mercer, made in China so arrogant. He said that banks should be charging more for transactions but 'he would be lynched if he uttered those sentiments in Australia'. I dare say he would, and he would not just be lynched by people in this House but by many of his own customers. The same Mr Mercer said earlier this year that 'compulsory basic banking is almost an insult'. He went on to say, 'The last thing we need right now is someone trying to regulate us into a time warp.' I tell Mr Mercer that the government is quite prepared to re-regulate the banks if they do not make progress towards a basic banking account. As far as the ANZ is concerned, we know that they do not really believe in the account and they will have to be watched all of the time. My view is that if this bank or any other bank starts moving to across-the-board transaction fee increases the government must re-regulate. It is a strong view in the community that the only winners from financial deregulation are large corporate borrowers. The losers have been small to medium sized businesses and the banks' retail customers. The problem we have with the banks is that they only want to cater to the top end of town. They want to be merchant banks, not retail banks. It is no coincidence that some executives who run retail banking are now paid by massive incentive schemes. That is, if they grab more money off a pensioner through fees and charges their pay goes up substantially. The banks have never told the public about the greatest rort of all. The greatest rort of is private banking. Private banking is where some banks offer special treatment to the executives of large customers and to their own board members. Australian battlers are subsidising free banking for board members and million dollar a year executives. These are policies which are delivered from on high. It is not the fault of the staff of the bank or of middle ranking executives. These policies are delivered by the board and senior executives. It is about time we had a public debate about how rational, how fair and how efficient these practices are. I urge customers not to vent their frustrations on the counter staff. It is the board that makes the policy position. The question I pose in the House this evening is: are the banks disclosing benefits to their directors and senior staff given to them under the guise of private banking? Good corporate governance should require that all directors' benefits are clearly transparent and laid out in the annual report of each bank. As the Coles-Myer wrangling demonstrates, shareholders need to know that board decisions are made for their benefit and not just for the benefit of a few in the privileged inner circle on the board. Shareholders and the public have a right to know what benefits are derived by directors by way of loans and many other concessions. This is critical to ensure that directors are seen to be at arm's length in general deliberations on fees and charges. Good corporate governance means that banks should immediately take steps to disclose this information, and I call on them to do so. Essay Competition",101
169,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Every year I run the Fisher electorate essay competition. In the last sitting weeks I had two students from the electorate here in Canberra-Amanda Watson-Brown, the winner of the primary section, who is in year 7 at Nanango State School, and Fayleen Scherger, the winner of the secondary section, who is in year 11 at the Abundant Life Christian School. When here they saw the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the Deputy Leader all of the Opposition (Mr Costello), the House of Representatives question time and the Senate question time. Tonight I would like to read one of the essays into Hansard and on another occasion I will read the other. The essay is headed 'How should the government treat families?' and it is written by Fayleen Scherger, a year 11 student at the Abundant Life Christian School at Kingaroy. She writes: The Government should respect families more and make decisions to benefit families. Families are what Australia is made of, and should be looked after by those who are chosen to make the big decisions. The family is the cornerstone of society and will crumble if not supported properly. Peace and harmony in family life have a far reaching effect on the world at large. Concern for the good of the family and for the advancement of each of its members should be their first thought. Government should encourage good schools that teach honesty, integrity and respect. The children of families will one day become a part of Australia's future and need a good education to be able to do their part for Australia. Australia needs more better educated people, especially those who learn rules of good character. These people can and will make it far and others need to be encouraged by good schools to do the same. Government should also encourage more jobs. Too many people are relying only on payments like the dole. If Government encouraged Australian business they would not have to import so much from overseas. This would create more jobs here in Australia and the people of Australia could have the opportunity to get a job and do their part. Children will grow up and need jobs too. Government should give them the chance to get one. Families on farms and land should be looked after and encouraged. They are barely existing, yet without them our family would be much poorer. They work so hard for so little, they don't want to give up but it is so hard for them to make ends meet. So hard that they cannot even encourage their own children to work on the land. Government has to be more sensitive in their needs before it is too late. Government needs to recognise the importance of the family, especially the importance of each of its members. The role of the father is not just a breadwinner, he is important to the upbringing of future Australians. The role of a mother is that of a full time nurse, cook, cleaner, companion, accountant and so many other things she must do, that to hire a person to do each of these chores would be impossible. Give parents respect and restore their prestige. Make them proud to be giving Australia their best. Government should encourage more Australians rather than bringing in more people from overseas. Government should support parents raising families on their own and help them. When children are neglected in these families, the family unit breaks down and all society is affected. Government should not stereotype families. Every family is different, unique, each having different requirements. They need to be loved, respected, assisted and advised. The Government needs to support all families because they are Australian. I was particularly impressed by these students. They came to Canberra, they came to Parliament House and they learnt how our nation was governed. They were very interested in everything they saw. They were given a very courteous hearing by the Leader of the Opposition, the next Prime Minister of this nation, and were also privileged to see the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. They found Senate question time interesting and they found question time in this place even more interesting. These students also saw a number of the other important things around Canberra: they saw Questacon, they went to the High Court and they went to the National Gallery; and they were very impressed with what they saw. I hope to run the Fisher electorate essay competition again next year because I think it is important to give young people from various parts of the nation the opportunity to travel to our national capital so that they can see how their government operates. Nuclear Testing in the Pacific",102
170,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"It is a pleasure to speak to the House about two people from my constituency, Sharon Collyer and Martin Moroney, who have done a magnificent job in highlighting the opposition of so many Australians to French nuclear testing in the Pacific. Sharon and Martin have collected no fewer than 300,000 signatures from school children around Australia and New Zealand protesting about French nuclear testing in the Pacific. Some principals who have been associated with the gathering of this petition have said that they have tried to allow their students 'not only to protest the dangers of nuclear testing, but also to involve the children in an exercise of active citizenship'. Another principal referring to this petition gathering said: Young people have to learn how to exercise their rights in a democratic society. A third principal has said: This petition has promoted sensible debate of the issues in our school. I say hear, hear to those principals and I say congratulations to Sharon and Martin. But they have not just collected signatures from kids all around Australia and New Zealand; they have also brought an art exhibition to Parliament House called' Art from the heart' . Of the 1,000 entries in this competition they ran, they have selected 160 quite magnificent and moving pieces of art to show here in Parliament House today and tomorrow to let the visitors to this great Parliament House know how the children of Australia feel about French nuclear testing. Some of these works of art are from children in my electorate: Peter Fairlie, aged seven; Thor Kreft, aged seven; Steven de Rome, aged six; Sarah Gould, aged six; Kristy MCLean; Jason Jones; Shayne Green; Brianna Reid; Chontelle Bornstein, aged seven; Jonathon Manna-, aged seven; Maryanne and Phillip Bee of Irvine; Kate, Lucy and Sally; Nicky Lewis, Rita Topalian and Martin Scott, all from North Curl Curl Public School. I refer also to Holly and Tess Moroney and Peter and Chloe James from Manly. They are magnificent artists as well as very concerned young Australians. As well we have some art from children at the Royal Far West School, in particular from Jimmeen Quinlan and Kylie Rose. I say congratulations to all those children for the magnificent work they have done and for the very creative and talented way in which they have demonstrated their personal opposition to French nuclear testing in the Pacific and their personal concern for our environment. Martin Moroney says: French people have great respect for the office of the President. We've been careful all along to direct our attack at behaviours of the French government, not at the French people. In selecting the art we've been careful not to present anything which is insulting to their President. However the impact of the message is nothing short of a roasting for any Government that is casual about its treatment of the environment or its attitude to Nuclear weapons. Sharon and Martin hope to take this marvellous exhibition, 'Art from the heart', from Parliament House to Paris so that the people of France can see and know exactly what the school children of Australia think of French nuclear testing in the Pacific. I am sure I speak for everyone in this House when I say congratulations to Martin and Sharon for their work. We wish them good luck and godspeed and best wishes in their attempts to let the French people know what we think of the actions of their government.",103

The following answers to questions were circulated: Rwanda and Burundi (Question No. 2369) Mr Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 29 May 1995: (1) What diplomatic efforts is the Government taking to seek a negotiated settlement to avoid further violence in Rwanda and Burundi. (2) Did the UN Secretary-General recommend that Australia and other countries maintain a trained standby force which could be deployed rapidly to protect civilians and aid workers; if so, what (a) is the Government's response and (b) are the precise circumstances under which the Government would approve the deployment of the force. (3) Does the Government support a stronger mandate for peace-keeping troops to protect civilians. (4) What specific action is the Government taking to support the international tribunal established by the UN Security Council. (5) Did the Rwandan Government request financial support through the UN Development Program to rebuild the criminal justice system and create a more secure environment to which refugees could return; if so, what action has the Government taken in response. (6) What sum has Australia (a) pledged and (b) contributed to the UN Consolidated Inter-Agency appeal for Rwanda and Burundi. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Since the humanitarian crisis began in Rwanda in April last year, the Government has sought to contribute to international efforts to bring lasting peace to Rwanda. In visits to Rwanda by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 6-7 September last year and by a Parliamentary delegation (Senators Stephen Loosley and David MACGIBBON, the Hon Roger Price MP, Mr Bob Halverson MP) from 23-27 January we have emphasised the importance of the process of national reconciliation in Rwanda. In has responses to six Questions Without Notice in the Senate concerning Rwanda and Burundi since May last year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs underlined the need for all political groups NA to participate in negotiations to reach a political settlement in Rwanda. The Government believes that more needs to be done to produce a sustainable political solution to Rwanda's problems and indeed those of the immediate region. We continue to encourage the Government of Rwanda, its neighbours and the rest of the international community to cooperate to help create the conditions that will allow the return of Rwandan refugees, reduce political tensions and sustain the healing process in Rwanda and the region. In response to two Questions Without Notice in the Senate this year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed concern about the continuing political tensions in Burundi and emphasised the importance of sustaining the momentum of preventive diplomacy efforts by the international community. The Government continues to believe that preventive strategies must continue to be pursued to advance the process of national reconciliation and avoid an escalation of violence in Burundi. These strategies have been operating at three levels: preventive diplomacy, peace building to create effective governmental institutions and to meet the economic and social needs of the country, and contingency planning options for possible intervention by the international community such as preventive deployment. (2) (a) The Prime Minister advised the UN Secretary-General, Dr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, during his visit to Australia from 26-30 April, that Australia would be willing to negotiate a stand-by forces agreement with the UN. Under the UN's Standby arrangements, countries provide the UN with a list of resources which might, subject to a case-by-case consideration by Governments, be made available to a particular UN peace keeping operation. Forty two countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand are now participating in the arrangements. The Standby system applies to the full range of functions of UN peace keeping operations and is intended to enhance the UN's planning capacity for these operations. The Standby arrangements could be used to protect civilian and aid workers, if this function were included in the mandate of a specific peace keeping operation. (b) If Australia participates in the UN's Standby arrangements, the Government will consider requests to contribute personnel to UN peace keeping operations using the same case-by-case approach it currently employs. The criteria considered are still being refined but include consideration of whether the operation has clear and achievable goals and clearly defined tennination or review points; what other resources are likely to be available for the operation; how much Australian interests are engaged, including regional, alliance and humanitarian interests and community attitudes; what costs the contribution might incur, including the effect on the Australian Defence Force's capacity to undertake other tasks including national defence; what Australia's level of commitment to other operations is at the time, having regard among other things to our reputation as a supporter of the United Nations; what training and other benefits will accrue to the Australian Defence Force; and what risk to personnel is involved. (3) The specific mandated responsibility of peace keepers for the civilian population will vary between operations. It is, however, being increasingly accepted by the intemational community that, even in the absence of a formal mandate authorising the use of force under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, peace keepers who are present when a serious, life-threatening violation of human rights is occurring or about to occur, have a duty, if they realistically can do something to stop it, not to stand idly by. There will, however, be cases where individual peace keepers will be caught out by events and will be unable to act effectively. To the extent to which peace keepers can act to prevent an atrocity they should do so. There may be cases where a peace enforcement operation could be considered necessary to protect civilians. In such cases, peace enforcement should be undertaken with clear, achievable objectives, an appropriate mandate authorised under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and by an adequately resourced and equipped force. Difficulties have arisen in operations where forces mandated and resourced for peace keeping have been required to undertake peace enforcement actions. In these cases, the ""peace keepers"" have not always had the capacity or the authority to provide adequate protection to the civilian popUlations they have been mandated to protect. (4) Following the adoption of Security Council Rcsolution 955, which established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the Government dccided to amend the Bill before Parliament relating to the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, so it would also incorporate Australia's obligations in relation to the war crimes tribunal for Rwanda. The International War Crimes Tibunals Act (1995) was passed by the Parliament in February, making Australia one of the first countries to have implemented SCR 955 in domestic legislation. In addition, Sir Ninian Stephen is a judge of the Appeals Chamber of the tribunal (which it shares with the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia); the Government supported Sir Ninian's election to the Tribunal. (5) The United Nations Development Program together with other United Nations agencies have been working closely with the Ministry of Justice to implement programs for the rehabilitation of Rwanda's justice system. The Rwandan Minister for Justice presented a progress report on the justice sector at the UNDP Round-table Mid tenn Review Meeting in Kigali on 6 and 7 July. The Minister reported that fifty foreign judges were being recruited as a stop-gap measure while 120 Rwandan ""non jurist magistrates"" are being trained. A bill to change the Constitution to allow foreign judges to preside in Rwanda is currently before the Parliament. Nine public prosecutors offices have begun assisting the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda with preparing cases. Work is expected to be completed on a new prison facility to house 5,000 prisoners by September. Legislative refonn is underway to assist in reasserting the rule of law and to create the key mechanisms of the Arusha Accords (the Supreme Court and the Council of Magistrates). The UNICEF program to separate child prisoners from adults has begun. The Minister also outlined that priorities for the next six months would be the training of 250 personnel (including deputy public prosecutors, nonjurist magistrates and clerks of the court), establishment of the mechanisms of the justice system (as per the Arusha Accords) and implementation of a mechanism for identification of detainees. The justice sector programs in Rwanda have been well supported by donor countries and are wellfunded. Australia was not specifically asked to contribute to programs for the rehabilitation of the justice system. As set out below, Australia's substantial contribution to humanitarian assistance in Rwanda has been directed at other sectors of need. Australia has contributed $300,000 to UN Centre for Human Rights' deployment of human monitors to investigate human rights abuses and to prevent the abuses recurring. (6) (a) The Australian Government has pledged a total of $18.5 million for relief activities for Rwanda and Burundi from the aid progra since the crisis commenced in late 1993. Included in this pledge is an amount of up to $5 million from the 1995/96 Humanitarian Relief program earmarked for activities in the health sector, possibly building on the work of the Australian Defence Force. This would involve programs through NGOs and international agencies and could include additional funding for traumatised children (and adults), immunisation programs, HIV programs in camps and assistance to re-establish some form of basic health service through international agencies. (b) Over $13.5 million has been spent from the pledge of $ I 8.5 million. This assistance has been directed at relief needs and channelled through the World Food Programme ($2.1 million), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ($3.7 million), United Nations Children's Fund ($1.3 million) and Australian and international NGOs ($5.8 million). Along with the Australian Defence Force contribution for the medical contingent ($25 million) and community support for NGOs ($30 million), this brings total Australian support for Rwanda/Burundi to around $74 million. Work Directions Australia (Question No. 2395) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs upon notice, on 5 June, 1995: (1) What relationship exists between his Department or its agencies and the firm, Work Directions Australia. (2) What sums did his Department or its agencies pay Work Directions Australia in (a) 1992-93, (b) 1993-94 and (c) 1994-95. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) There is a record of five occasions where there was a relationship between my Department and Work Directions Australia. Three involved staff matters and two involved veterans. (2) (a) $1,620.00 (Staff) (b) $100.00 (Reimbursed to a veteran who used the services of Work Directions Australia) Payment for Rehabilitation Services provided to Department of Veterans' Affairs staff may also be made by Comcare directly to the providers. To receive this service my Department pays an insurance premium to Comcare. In 1993-94 Comcare paid $1,665.00 to Work Directions Australia for services rendered in respect of Department of Veterans' Affairs staff. (c) Nil. Australian National: Waste Disposal (Question No. 2526) Ms Worth asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 30 June 1995: (I) Has Australian National ceased dumping waste asbestos and other prescribed wastes listed in the seventh schedule of regulations under the SA Waste Management Act at its Islington, SA, railyards; if so, when did it cease to do so. (2) Does Australian National hold records of the quantities of waste asbestos and other prescribed wastes which have been dumped at the rail yards since 1975; if so, (a) what is the total quantity of waste dumped since 1975 and (b) will he provide a copy of the records; if not, (i) what is the estimated quantity of waste dumped since 1975 and (ii) how was the estimate obtained.",104
172,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) AN advises that most of the contamination on the former AN site at Islington was put there by the former South Australian Railways (SAR) when it owned and/or occupied the site from 1892 until 1978. AN also advises that most of the major contaminant, asbestos, was put there by the SAR when breaking up steam locomotives for scrap. AN contributed further material but advises that it has ceased dumping waste asbestos and other prescribed wastes listed in the seventh schedule of regulations under the SA Waste Management Act. AN advises that no formal records of dumping were kept by it, and none exist from the SAR. However, AN management has advised that to the best of its knowledge, no dumping has occurred since March 1985. AN further advises that it is certain that no dumping has occurred after 1989. It is not possible to estimate accurately the amount of waste dumped, though a considerable volume of soil is contaminated. The waste is not uniformly distributed through the contaminated soil, and the SA Environmental Protection Authority has estimated the amount of contaminated soil on the site at 232,000 tonnes. The Government takes this issue very seriously and has appointed the CSIRO to undertake an independent study of contamination at the site. The CSIRO team will evaluate the situation, assess any possible impact upon people living nearby and develop a site remediation plan. As part of the task of providing advice on decontaminating the site I have asked the CSIRO to advise also on the quantity of waste involved. Telephone Number (09) 5924034 (Question No. 2572)",107
173,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 23 August 1995: (1) Is he able to say whether the telephone number (09) 5924034 is or was funded by the Commonwealth for the use of any office of the Member for Brand; if so, which Department funds or funded the number. (2) Is he further able to say whether the number has been used since February 1995 by the Deputy Prime Minister and ALP candidate for the electoral division of Brand in the next election; if so, (a) in what manner, (b) on hqw many occasions, (c) for what purposes and (d) does the usage conform with the guidelines for the legitimate use of a Member's office.",107
174,Mr WALKER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)-(2) Telephone number (09) 5924034 is not a line funded by my Department South Australian Aboriginal Legal Rights (Question No. 2576) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 23 August 1995: What Commonwealth funding did the South Australian Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement receive in (a) 1992-93, (b) 1993-94 and (c) 199495. Mr Tickner-The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following information in response to the honourable member's question: The South Australian Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement received the following funding from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as per financial year: 1992-93-$3,372,559.00; 1993-94$3,091,298.00; 1994-95-$3,127,025.00 Strehlow Collection (Question No. 2578) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 24 August 1995 : What has been the history of the Strehlow collection or collections since his answer to tion No. 749 (Hansard, 7 February 1994, page 499). Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On 24 March 1994 I appointed Mr Elliot Johnson QC, under s.13(3) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (the Heritage Protection Act) to mediate in relation to a declaration that I had made over Aboriginal objects and related records that were collected by the late Professor Ted Strehlow. Mr Johnson met with the parties affected by the declaration, including Mr Carl Strehlow, Dr Kathleen Strehlow, the Northern Territory (NT) Government and the Central Land Council (CLC), with a view to resolving the matter to the satisfaction of the applicant (the CLC) and myself. Whilst negotiations took place, I made a number of short term declarations, six in all, under s.12 of the Heritage Protection Act to ensure that Movement the Aboriginal objects and related records were protected. On 22 December 1994 Mr Johnson reported to me that it had been agreed by the parties that the CLC would purchase the Aboriginal objects from Mr Strehlow, and the NT Government would purchase the related records from Dr Strehlow. Mr Johnson was also able to facilitate agreement on all the terms of the sale, except price. After the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's Board of Commissioners decided in February 1995 to provide funds to enable the CLC to purchase the objects, Mr Strehlow and the CLC reached an agreement for the sale of the objects. Following a further approach by myself to Dr Strehlow's solicitors, asking her to accept the NT Government's offer, Dr Strehlow and the NT Government reached an agreement for the purchase of the related records. I would also point out that the objects are of crucial importance to the cultural identity, spirituality, and religious beliefs of the Aboriginal people involved. More than 120 senior Aboriginal men were consulted with prior to the purchase, and they identified the objects as being of a secret and sacred nature. The objects were purchased expressly so they could be returned to their traditional custodians. Some of the objects have already been returned, with the remainder being held in trust by ques- the CLC while final arrangements are made for their return. In relation to the related records I am advised, that most of the records have been delivered to the Strehlow Research Centre. A list of the remaining records that are a part of the recent agreement with Dr Strehlow is being made and it is expected that those records will be handed over to the Centre in the near future.",108
