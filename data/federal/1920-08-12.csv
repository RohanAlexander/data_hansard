3,Mr BAMJPORD,Unknown,"I protest against the reception of the petition. I hold that any petition that is in order should be received; but this petition is not in order. I have received a copy of it , and know, therefore, that one of the requests of the petitioners is that the Act to which the petition refers may be repealed. No exception could be taken to, the petition if the petitioners asked that the Act be amended; but to repeal the Act would be a violation of the Constitution, and consequently ultra vires. Section 48 of 'the Constitution says that until Parliament otherwise provides, the allowance of each senator and each member of the House of Representatives shall be £400 a year; but if the request of the petitioners were granted, the parliamentary allowance would not be reduced from £1,000 to £600, or to £400, but would be taken away altogether, which would place us behind scratch, so to speak. I do not suppose that even the most rabid member of the Taxpayers Association would suggest that the members of this Parliament should be paid no allowance at all.",20
4,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"""Would they not? They want something cheap.",20
5,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I credit them with more liberality. It may be held by some that Parliament has the power to abolish the allowance altogether. In my humble opinion, it has not that power. There are many sections of the' Constitution which contain the words "" until Parliament otherwise provides "", and if we were to go behind what they enact, the Constitution would be a mere scrap of paper.",20

Mr HUGHES fBendigo-Prime Minisidle ter and Attorney-General) [2.44] -(B y leave.)-Yesterday afternoon I saw Mr in New South Wales. Lawson, the Premier of Victoria, and discussed the coal situation with him. I asked him for certain information which he has promised to supply. also got in touch with the steam-ship owners, Avho promised to do what they could to make tonnage available, and to get into communication with the coal proprietors. I asked them to the result of their communications, when coal supplies might he expected, and they have furnished me with the lowing information:The following steamers w i for Victoria between today and Saturday of this week, viz.:Maoedon . . 6,000 Period . . 4,000 Alabama . . 3,000 Koonda .. 2,300 Perth . . 2,000 The following steamers are due to arrive in.'

Werribee .. 5,000 Aiistralmouttt . . 6,000 Wear ' . . 2,500 Koori/nga .. 3,500 Bunodh . . 3,000 Goulbwrn . . 4,000 Monaro . . 3,500 27,500 making a total of 45,000 tons. From the above list it will be seen that there is no likelihood of Victoria's public utilities or industries having to close down for want of coal during the next week or two, and after period it is confidently expected that coal will improve materially. It is necessary to mention that the shortage coal is by no means entirely due to exports. The frequent stoppages, lasting from one to several days, caused by the employees at. various collieries on trivial grounds, have greatly contributed. to the shortage. During the month of June no less than 82 days were lost in this manner; during July 54 days were lost, up to the 10th August 23 days were lost. The output of coal lost from these stoppages of would represent no less than about 100,000 The whole of the collieries of New South were laid idle on Wednesday, 30th June, to hold stop-work' meetings, which could have just as well held on a back Saturday or a Sunday. Many of the miners themselves were of the same opinion. Furthermore, a few days ago several of the largest collieries were laid by the men, ostensibly for industrial reasons, hut actually to enable them to celebrate the release from prison of certain gentlemen I shall keep the House' posted from time to time with whatever further information comes to hand, but it will he seen I that steps have already been taken to prevent the existing shortage in Victoria from becoming acute, and to enable the public utilities of. the State, including gas works and electric lighting let me know plants, to carry on. and .

The Opposition certainly do not intend to take up - the rdle of obstructionists; but if the resolution stands, I take it that at 10 o'clock the Chairman will be forced to give effect to it , although we may happen to be in the middle of the discussion of an important amendment.

47,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Melbourne Ports) If [ 3 . 0 ] - I take it that the Government are in earnest in introducing this Bill ; if they are not, all the time spent upon it has been cruelly wasted. I do not desire to be charged with, reiterating arguments used by members on this side, but I am determined that nothing shall be done in the direction proposed, Avithout expressing my opinion and giving my reasons for opposing the Bill as it stands. The Prime Minister recognises that unless the Bill is made acceptable to the working section of the community it will prove inoperative and useless;, but as to the weight which the right honourable gentleman attaches to that fact I am not certain. This Bill was introduced because of the delay in the Arbitration Court, and in the Court itself there 'are difficulties in the way of proving what is an ""industry, "" just as there will be a difficulty under this Bill of proving what is an "" industrial organization."" The Prime Minister ""gave the show away"" when he claimed that the so-called trade union at Kalgoorlie is bond fide; hut all that he proved was that it is an industrial organization which may come before the Court and which may destroy what I call a bond fide organization. I ask' the Prime Minister, or any one who has been concerned in cases before the Arbitration Court, what chance have we of industrial peace when there may be two organizations both claiming the right to appear in Court on behalf of a particular industry, while both hold distinctly different opinions as to why they come into Court ? The National Labour organization at Kalgoorlie was brought into existence by men opposed to the Australian Workers Union.",25
48,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,Do you call the Coal and Shale Miners organization a regiszation tered organization ? Do you wish prevent those miners' coining before the tribunal ?,26
49,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I am not dealing the with that question now; but I admit witli there is a difficulty. There are unions organizations in Australia. which are not registered under the Conorganizations ciliation and Arbitration Act, and there are bond fide unions which are not affiliated with Trades Hal l Councils; unless we define in this Bill what is ""industrial organization,"" and provide that only those organizations really the accepted power majority of the workers in any in dustry shall be recognised, this B i l will be useless. If there are to organizations both claiming to represent intends to do. the same set of workers any effort at settlement will be futile, especially if strength of the unions he anything like equal. I am not a lawyer, but 1 pose that even through the amendment the foreshadowed by the Leader of Opposito tion (Mr Tudor), the proverbial ""coach and four might be d r i v e n "" ; at airy rate, and organizations. what the honourable member proposes is that a bond fide association shall be recognised by the Trades H a i l Council he announces his ' intentions? in the district or State. Under the a bond fide union, however, in any one the States, whether or not it be affiliated with the Trades H all Council, will recognised. There are unions in Victoria not affiliated with the Trades H all cil, hut they are recognised by that Counw cil as bond fide industrial unions; so that tirely destroyed. there will be no difficulty so far as the Trades H all Councils are concerned. In my opinion, the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition would meet the case, but the Prime Minister will not accept it , saying that he will relegate to no individual or outside body the right to say which is a bond fide industrial organization. Unless the right honourable gentleman does so, however, this Bill will prove futile.",26

79,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General). [3.27] - Le t us consider a concrete case. As the result of the 1917 dispute, the members of the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Union, or some of them, were thrown out of work; a body of men, whom some said were non-unionists, but of whom 99 per cent, were blacklegs from other unions, formed a union and put them out of their jobs. I am not commenting on what was done; I am merely stating the facts. There is a dispute now, not between these so-called non-unionists and the employers, but between the bond fide unionists and the employers ; and if a tribunal were appointed, its members would be representative of the employers and of the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers. The non-unionists, with whom there is no dispute,. would not be represented oh the Tribunal. They might, of course, be called as witnesses, but they would have no standing in connection with the inquiry.",28
80,Mr MAKIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,There is no guarantee that a bona fide organization will be protected.,29
81,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"We are considering the establishment of Tribunals to settle de facto disputes. A dispute must exist before a Tribunal can be appointed to settle it, and there must be no other way of settling it, or, at any rate, no other must have been found. In the coal-mining industry there is a dispute which cannot be settled in any other way than hy a Special Tribunal, or, at any rate, it has not been settled in-any other way. It may be that in some of the mines there are a few men working on tribute who do no°t belong to a union- I do not know whether that is so or not-bu t in creating a Tribunal to deal with a dispute :n that industry, we should appoint representatives of the employers and representatives of the Federation of Coal and Shale Workers. The interests of the unionists are absolutely safeguarded. In the constitution of a council for the prevention of disputes, men will naturally be selected who represent 99 per cent, of the workers who are organized; but when - dealing with do facto disputes, it must be the parties to a particular dispute who must be represented on a Tribunal, and these are always the employers and the unionists, not the employers and the bogus unionists.",29

89,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,The Prime Minister said that the disputing was always between the employers and the bond fide organizations.,29
90,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I know that at Broken Hill there are two organizations. The honourable member belongs to one of them, and calls the other a "" scab"" organization ; and, no doubt, a member of this organization would have something similar to say of him. If a dispute arose between one of the organizations and the employers, the Tribunal to settle it would be constituted of members representative of the employers and of the organization, whichever it might be, interested in the dispute. The members of the honourable member's organization are those who never will give in, but will stand out to the last. Obviously, therefore, the dispute must always be with them, in which case they will be represented on the Tribunals.",29

I am sure such a position would not be satisfactory to the great majority of the men employed in the industry concerned.",29
92,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,Why should not the others be represented before the Tribunal ?,29
93,Mr MAKIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"The honourable member will agree that today we have reached that stage in industrial affairs; as well as commercial matters, in which we regard the individual as very insignificant, and deal with organization against organization. an At Moonta, in South Australia, there are two bodies engaged in the mining industry, one being an organization which is to a very large extent supported and coun-' tenanced by the mine-owners of the copper field, and the other being a branch of the mining section of the Australian Workers Union. Should a dispute arise at Moonta, the former, which is a bogus organization, may to some extent support the claim of ' the latter, which is the legitimate organization ; and if the Bill is amended as the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) suggests, if it has a membership of 100 persons, it will be in a position to gain recognition before the Tribunal, and may, in fact, really determine and decide the case for the men who, in larger numbers, are members of the larger organization, which is the bond fide union engaged in the industry. That is the serious danger of the Prime Minister's proposal. If we do not give to bona fide industrial unionism the safeguard we ask, and the guarantee that their interests will be so protected, that employers will not be permitted to make use of other organizations as a convenience in their endeavour to overcome certain difficulties that may arise in various industries, a great suspicion will arise in the minds of the workers concerning the merits of this Bill , and the source from which it emanates. The secretary of the Australian Workers Union at Moonta has written to me as follows: The following resolution was carried meeting this evening:-""That we, the mining section of the Australian Workers Union, protest against the indecent haste Government in rushing through the Industrial Peace Bill, as it does not provide for recognised organizations.""",29
94,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"They are under a misi t . apprehension, because the Bill does provide for recognised organizations.",30
95,Mr MAKIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,I do not think they under any misapprehension. as it stands does not provide'for recognised organizations.,30
96,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"But if the definitions the Conciliation and Arbitration Act included, the omission will be rectified.",30
97,Mr BLUNDELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,The Prime Minister has intimated that he will include definitions.,30
98,Mr MAKIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,The i r inclusion w i l help matters very much.,30
99,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,They will provide that parties under this Bill will be in exactly the same position as parties under the organized labour. Conciliation and Arbitration Act.,30
100,Mr MAKIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"This is one of the finitions in ""the Conciliation and Arbitrabeginning tion Act which the Prime Minister proI poses to have inserted in this Bill : Any association of not less than 100 employees engaged in any industrial pursuit pursuits whatever, together with such persons, whether employees engaged in any inMinister. dustrial pursuit or pursuits or not, as have been appointed officers of the association and admitted as members thereof. Nothing is said about the recognition of a bond fide organization. Seeing that any body of men not numbering less 100 persons could form an organization and assert that they represent the emfor ployees"" of a particular industry, the Prime Minister's proposal could not possibly be satisfactory to organized labour. If honourable members are anxious to conserve industrial peace, and protect the in terests of those who are sincerely desirous of helping to frame legislation which will overcome industrial difficulties, they must give to organized labour greater security than is now provided in the Bill , (particularly in respect to the * guarantee asked for in the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) on behalf of the Leader of 'the Opposition (Mr Tudor). This part of the Bill is regarded by organized labour throughout the Commonwealth as its most vital part, and upon the decision of the Committee in regard ""to the principle emat our bodied in this amendment will very largely depend the success or otherwise of of the National the Bill .",30

104,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,The honourable member or withdrew his amendment and accepted other the amendment suggested by the Prime,30
105,Mr BLUNDELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"rYes , because it goes further than mine went. It was my desire to protect bond fide unions in Australia against any body which miffht have than about them any suggestion of being '.'scab"" unions. The honourable member Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) has quoted a. very unfortunate ease to support his argument. It is true tha : there is at Moonta an organization which has been in existence for a number ot years, and has lately linked up with the Australian Workers Union, and is now practically controlling th© whole of the mining industry in the district; but there is also in the same locality an organization of miners which has been formed in opposition to the Australian Workers Union. The honourable member points out that if a dispute should arise at Moonta, 100 men could appear before a Tribunal and obtain recognition, securing; the same rights as any other body of men; but if we include in the Bill the definition of au association as set out in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the union at Moonta which has become associated with the mining section of ' the Australian Workers Union, being the recognised registered association, no other body of men operating in the industry in the district could obtain any recognition whatever,- even with a imembership of 500 persons, until it appealed to the Arbitratio n Court aud secured registration. All the necessary protection against bogus unions is afforded in the definitions in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. No bogus union can secure registration without any other body engaged in the particular ' calling having the opportunity of lodging an objection against its registration, and without an investigation of the whole of the facts by the Arbitration Court. ' Mr Fenton- - Are we not now dealing with a Bill quite distinct from the Conciliation and Arbitration Act ?",30
106,Mr BLUNDELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"But the Prime Minister has met the objections raised to this Bill by promising to include in it certain definitions contained in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and the moment they are included it will naturally follow that the organization which will secure benefits under this measure must necessarily be an association registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. When I was discussing this question with the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) he showed me a recognised legal authority, which stated that an Act whioh is passed embracing the same subject-matter as that covered by an existing Statute cannot, unless it is expressly stated to the contrary, deprive any person of his rights under the 1 existing Statute. The position becomes very much stronger when the definitions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are included in this Bill . The unions to be dealt with are those-which today. are registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Our-friends apposite are asking the Committee to adopt a new definition, providing that the persons to take part in proceedings before tribunals shall be members of the bona fide trade union representing the industry as recognised by the Trades Council in the district or State. But in all the States there are organizations which are antagonistic to Trades and Labour Councils. They have no time for them, and are really working in direct opposition to them.",31
107,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,-*Ye t they are recognised by them.,31
108,Mr BLUNDELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"That is so, but if a question arose as to which of them was to be the deciding factor there would be an interesting "" scrap,"" since, although' they are supposed to be bound together by the bonds of brotherhood when it comes to a question of securing privileges or the recognition of rights, they can fight amongst themselves just as well as can any other section of the community. If we provide that an "" organization of employees "" shall mean an organization which is registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act , no question as to a bogus organization can arise, nor can any point be raised, as to how that organization came to be registered. It has been urged that this definition would not cover the coal miners' organization of which Mr Willis is secretary. I have inquired from Mr Stewart, the In dustrial Registrar, and am informed by him that it is registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.",31
109,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"The president of that organization has just told me that it is not registered, and will have nothing to do with the Court.",31
110,Mr BLUNDELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I telephoned to Mr Stewart a few moments ago, and was informed by him that Mr Willis's organization is registered under the Act, so that it would be covered by the definition I propose.",31

112,Mr BLUNDELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"The fact remains that it is registered under it , and is taking advantage of all that that registration gives. That is to say, it can sue its members for subscriptions, can hold property, and can exercise other powers under the Act.",32
113,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,I think the honourable member is wrong I do not know of a case where it has sued a member for arrears of subscriptions.,32
114,Mr BLUNDELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"But , being registered under the Act, it has power to sue. The fact that it is registered does away with the objection that the men in the industry with which we are principally concerned at the present time would not take advantage of this Bill . If the suggested amendment be agreed to the legitimate rights of trade unions will be absolutely protected. I am pleased that the Prime Minister has changed his views in regard to this matter.",32

It may be necessary to recommit the clause, and I am sure the House would agree to that, should it be necessary, order that this question may be satisfactorily dealt with. I desire to help the honourable member for Hunter in every direction but I am not going to vote his amendment, since I think it would give rise to a great deal of trouble, and at the same time would fail to achieve the object he has in view.",32
123,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Barrier ) [3.56] The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) appear to be much concerned as to whether the industrialorganizations will work under the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Act or under this Bill . The Prime Minister has become involved in something of a tangle. He talked about the honourable member for . Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) "" walking outside himself,"" "" walking all about himself and coming back again,"" but his own explanations in reply to various questions put to him showed that he also was "" absent from the body."" 1 do not know whether he was "" present with the.

My belief is that the industrial organizations outside will go on their way regardless not prepared to of this Bill .",32
124,Mr BLUNDELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"That is to say, they him will be a law unto themselves.",32
125,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"If the Industrial Peace Bill commends itself to the men in the industrial organizations outsidei f they think that they can gain anything by going to the tribunals for which it provides-the y will avail themselves of it . If , on the other hand, they think they can gain nothing, from them, then the may have their special t r i bunals, as provided for in the Bill , but we shall not have industrial peace. Despite what honourable members may say, that is the actual position. Honourable members appear to be surprised and shocked, but I invite them to throw back their minds to what happened in conthe nexion with the Newcastle coal-mining trouble in New South ""Wales in 1917. I The employers, through their agents, the National Government then in power in New South Wales, tore up, so to speak, the M in in g Act, under which a man was in not allowed to work in the face.of a mine unless he had been engaged in coal-mining for two years, and all - the "" rifffor raff "" of ihe country was gathered together to act as "" scabs."" What did the employers care about industrial organizations as long as they could get out the ""coal?",32
126,Sir GBANVILLE EYRIE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"The men came from the country districts were not "" riff-raff."" 4",33
127,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I said nothing about the.men who came from the country. The honourable member cannot put words into my mouth. I had in mind the "" scab "" bureau which was opened ' in Collinsstreet, Melbourne, and which gathered men from all quarters, regardless of whether or not they belonged to any organization, to work in the coal mines. All that was desired was to get out the coal. And what for? To help John Brown and Company. Did we hear anything then in regard to industrial Tribunals or arbitration Courts? Not much. If that was good for the "" bosses,'' it cannot be bad for the industrial unions to play the same game. And so it goes on. The employers, when they are in control, do not bother about indusLrial organizations unless it be to try to "" break"" them. We have had a great deal of talk as to bringing in these organizations, whether they register under the Bill or not. I gave the Prime Minister a case in point as affecting Broken Hill . A handfull of men there registered under the State Act and Judge Edmunds went to Broken Hill and solemnly gave them an award. But the thousands of workers in the industry refused to have anything to do with the Couirt. The only Tesult of the award was that thousands did not work and no sulphide, lead, or zinc was produced.  point.",33
128,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Of course it is, and the Prime Minister recognised it was when he side-stepped the question I put to him. He has been a party the appointment of a chairman of bunal for an unregistered organization that is representative of the men Hill . When the State Court made award the thousands of miners at Broken Hill said, "" Y o u can have your award, but it will not produce lead or zinc""; Act. and it did. not. In connection with coal-mining trouble at Newcastle in the State Government tore up an that was designed to protect the miners. What, then, is the value of safeguards this Industrial Peace Bill? If an industrial upheaval took place tomorrow, would there not he a special meeting of who Parliament, constituted as it is, to tear up the safeguards given the industrial unions. If the Government received orders from the industrial exploiters to take that action they would quickly do so, just as the National Government in New South Wales tore up the Mining Act'. We must look at the facts fairly and squarely. We must recognise that, whether safeguards for organized labour are provided or not, organized labour outside, if powerful enough, will be recognised by the Parliament. But all the safeguards that could possibly be introduced into the Bill would not be worth a snap of the finger-if organized labour were not powerful. In such circumstances the Government would not Tecognise it. If industrial labour is strong enough to force recognition we shall be in the same position, as our friends in Bus3ia. We shall be the organization de facto even if we are not the "" recognised "" organization. The Prime Minister will appoint the chairman of a tribunal to see whether or not we are to have industrial peace. The Allies will not recognise the Soviet Government, but they appoint commissions to decide all sorts of trade questions. That being so, we have the substance, and the other side can have the shadow.",33
129,Mr WEST,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"East Sydney) [4.3] There is a very strong suspicion that the Bill as presented to the House was reared in an atmosphere utterly foreign to trade union principles. It is absolutely at variance with them. I am justified in making that statement since the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) yesterday had to that admit in .this Chamber that he did not know' whether there was any to provision in the Bill for the recoga Trinition of unions. Those who follow the reports of meetings of the variat Broken ous Chambers of Commerce in Ausits tralia must know that they have repeatedly, and in no unmeasured terms, condemned the Conciliation and Arbitration They are .god-fathers of this Bill, the and believe that by means of it they may 1917 be able to defeat the attempts of trade Act unions to secure improved conditions. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. in Blundell) has tried to show that the only 3482 Industrial [REPRESENTATIVES.] safe course to follow in this matter is to follow the lines laid down by the Conciliation «nd Arbitration Act. When arbitration was first proposed various States, industrial unions practically confined to mechanics, and since then, unskilled labour and professional labour have been organized, although the great increase in the number of unionists is caused by the addition of the former. Skilled labour, in its desire for better conditions, made sacrifices, and urged unskilled labour to organize itself. Skilled labour does not worry about a Bill like this, or about the Court, because it is strong enough demand what it considers reasonable. Neither does the Journalists Association nor the union of the legal profession attach any importance to a measure of this kind, because, like skilled labour, each is strong enough to look after its own interests. This Bill is an effort to do something for the benefit of unskilled in the community, and all we ask is that there shall be a definition of those trade unions or labour oragnizations who may take advantage of the proposed If the amendment is not accepted by the Government, or approved by the Committee, the Bill will not be acceptable to unekilled labour, and should not be. ever radical the honourable member for Broken Hill (Mr Considine) may be considered by some honourable members, he has certainly spoken some words of wisdom, pointing out that this is a BiJl emanating from gentlemen who are entirely opposed to the interests of labour, and, therefore, not likely to inspire confidence in the working section of the community. Those who represent vested interests are not desirous for a Bill which will give labour an opportunity to better its conditions. I am surprised that the Prime Minister, who was'prepared to give the country a Conciliation and Arbitration Act, is not prepared to accept the amendment, especially in view of the changes that have taken place in .the labour world since the passing of that Act. In legislation of this the advice of Mr Justice who has displayed a very mind in all matters brought him, should have been sought and accepted. That gentleman is a man of exceptional ability, and a student of the subject, and would have proved a valuable servant to the people of Australia if - Mr West. Peace Bill. he had been asked to suggest proposals for removing industrial unrest. But nothing of the kind has been done, in the simply because Mr Justice Higgins and were the Prime Minister cannot agree on every point. These two gentlemen do not seem to run in the same groove.",33
130,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N, Order ! The honourable member is going outside the scope of the amendment.,34
131,Mr WEST,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I am endeavouring to show that this amendment is the outcome Arbitration of the thoughts of others besides those to who sit on this side' of the House; and if the Temporary Chairman cannot see that my remarks are relevant, I am sorry. It is to be regretted that you, sir, have not risen to that high intellectual plane necessary for the positionyou are now occupying; but I think that, after my re1 marks, you will agree that I am right, labour and that you are wrong. Even at this time, I think the Prime Minister might seei his way to accept the amendment. He admits that there is no definition of Tribunals. organizations which are to approach the Tribunals, and it is necessary that there should be a definition about which there can be no difference of opinion. There How- are unions, such as those of the whiteworkers, who, by reason .of the technicalities raised by the employers and the expense attached to proceedings, are unable to approach the Arbitration Court, and these might very well come within the operation of / i Bill of this kind. It will be most regrettable if , through lack of confidence on their part, such workers withhold their assistance and co-operation; but, like a nation going to war, they have no faith in their enemy, and the past industrial history of Australia justifies their attitude. I would go so far as to say that only unionists should have the benefit of the Bill ; and I can remember, some thirty-five years ago, the present Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) declaring that unionists and non-unionists could not work together-that if there was kind, one thing on earth that could not be done, Higgins, it was to make them work together. Then, open again, there was a case in Adelaide, when before a medical man refused to visit a certain house because there was a doctor there who did not belong to the medical imion. The Prime Minister knows these facts as well as I do, and he should afford honourable members on this side every facility in their efforts to provide that only members of unions shall approach the Tribunals, for without such an amendment the Bill will worth the paper upon which it is printed. Once the suspicion is created amongst the workers that the Bill is intended for their in j u r y, and not their benefit, it will take a long time to remove the impression, even if it be a mistaken one; Ibut unless the amendment is inserted, the workers are not mistaken in their This amendment is not proposed hurriedly, or with any idea of killing the Bill , but only after being well thought out. Without the confidence of the workers, we might as well have no T r i bunals at all. They must feel that the Tribunals are appointed with an honest intention to Temove misunderstandings, and to decide the many in dustrial questions that arise; in my opinion, the Prime Minister is making a mistake in refusing to accept the amendment. If the right honourable gentleman were now a member of the Labour party, instead of being on the other side, he would see that this and other amendments from the Opposition are proposed with the sole idea of inspiring amongst the workers the fullest possible confidence in the proposed T r i bunals.",34
132,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Batman) [4.20] - It must be granted by the Prime Minister and others that the amendment raises a very important question in connection with this Bill , or, indeed, any Bill having for its object the prevention of industrial unrest. The Commonwealth Conciliation nnd Arbitration Act rests upon the principle of the organization of employees and of employers. It was sought in that measure to do away with a kind of guerilla warfare between individuals or isolated bodies of workers and employers. that reason we based the Act upon organization. It was to that fact that we owe some of those brilliant defences of the principle of preference to unionists with which at various times the Prime Minister has favoured this House and the country. In the Bill as introduced there was no definition of the word "" employee,"" and no reference to any organization of employees. That was a curious, and, it seems to me, a most sinister omission. It must be apparent that if that defect were uot remedied, it would be fatal, because it would be hopeless to expect honourable members on this side to recommend the not be Bill to the favourable consideration of the country unless we knew how far the Government was prepared to recognise organized industrialism, and how far it was prepared to recognise certain kinds of organizations of industrialists. I think that the Prime Minister was not ingenuous yesterday when, - first of all, he told the honourable member for Adelaide that he judgment - could not accept his amendment, because we would have to deal with employees who were not organized, and when afterwards he told me that he would accept the definitions in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act so far as they applied to organization. The definition, if I have gathered aright, not having had the advantage of hearing the observations of the right honourable gentleman, which he is prepared to and, accept as the definition of "" employees,"" is sub-section b of section 55 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which reads- Any association of not less than 100 employees in , or in connection with any industry, together with such other persons, whether employees in the industry or not, as have been appointed officers of the association and admitted as members thereof. Those persons are not organizations within the meaning of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, but they are a class of persons who may apply to be registered as an organization under that Act.",35
133,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,They are an association until they are registered.,35
134,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"They are an association only, and may qualify themselves to be registered as an organization. On the other hand, they may be rejected as an organization for any one of the large variety of reasons set out in the Act under For the rules and regulations framed under the Act.",35
135,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,They need not be registered in order to come within the purview of this Bill .,35
136,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"That is so. But the Prime Minister, if I - understand the matter aright, proposes to accept the subsection I have quoted from the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as a definition of "" employees."" When we come to consider the Commonwealth Council, we find that it is proposed that it shall consist of a chairman and an even number-no t less than six--of other members, and that of the members other than the chairman one-half shall be representatives of the employers, and one-half shall be representatives of the employees. When we put that to a practical test, and come to make appointments to the Council, we shall have claims for representation from organizations, that is to say, registered bodies, and also, perhaps, from any number of bodies that may have been refused registration altogether. There is no l i m it to the number of bodies which may be formed as ""employees"" under the definition of that term which the Prime Minister is prepared, I understand, to accept, and they may all claim the right to representation upon the Council. I can see that while the employers will be in a perfectly satisfactory position, having their full measure of representation, the representation of employees will be cut up amongst a number of contending bodies who will have no interest in common at all, and it is possible that representation supposed to be of the employees will be more repugnant to organized labour in this community than are the employers themselves. The organizations truly representative of labour may be outnumbered and outvoted by various bodies of employees.",35
137,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Supposin g a de facto dispute, and that one of these fragments of an industry secures representation on the Tribunal, and the Tribunal gives a decision of some sort. Would it bring about industrial peace if the fragment securing the decision represented, it might be, only one-tenth of the industry?",36
138,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"It would not. But that is an argument against the whole policy of conciliation. The same argument might have been used, though I have never heard it used by the right honourable gentleman in connection with the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Act and the registration of organizations. There will always be a certain disgruntled few who will not join any organization, unless it be an association from which they hope to get some special - advantage when trouble arises. If we hope to bring about industrial peace we .cannot expect to consult every individual. We must recognise some class of organization as standing for labour in a particular industry. I cannot imagine any scheme under which the Prime Minister could expect to have every employee and his eccentric opinions and claims represented on this Tribunal.",36
139,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,What chance would such a person have for appointment if he were so unrepresentative?,36
140,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"He would have no chance of appointment if , as I understand, the Prime Minister is now prepared to l i m it the definition of "" employees "" to associations of not less than 100 members.",36
141,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,I do not think that he is. ',36
142,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I confess myself still in doubt as to what is going to be the effect of this measure if "" employees"" is to be defined in the terms of the subsection I have 'quoted. . If that is all that is necessary to constitute employees entitled to representation on these Tribunals we shall be pursuing a retrograde course from that which we shaped when we said thatemployees means registered organizations, and that in order to become registered an organization must satisfy the proper authority that it represents the majority of employees and interests in connection with a particular business. It must show that it occupies the ground as employees, and if others come in rivalry to obtain the benefit of registration, they must show that there is not already in existence an organization to which they might conveniently and properly belong. If they can show some special reason why they should be regarded as a separate organization they may be entitled to registration. Under this measure, so far as I can gather, the persons who are to be called ""employees"" are any loosely associated bodies of 100 members. The ground may already be occupied by a registered organization, but the Government propose to recognise a rival body, and it m i g ht be a rival body which has been created in a moment or in an hour for a special purpose in connection with a dispute, and merely in order to outvote and destroy the influence of the genuine employees in an industry. I confess that I have never had very great confidence in the Bill . It has always appeared to me that if this effort had been devoted to amending the ConAnstey, F. ciliation and Arbitraion Act on the lines Tudor, F. G. suggested by the Judges, and, perhaps, Page, James also by incorporating some of the proNicholls, S. R. visions of this Bill , we might have done Maloney, Lavelle, T. J. some really useful service for the comMCDonald, C. munity. I am afraid that, however Gabb, J. M. much we approve the object of this Bill , MCGRATH, D.

It is upon the definition of "" employees"" and "" organization "" in this Bill , and the exactness of the definition of those terms, that any possible success from the operation of the measure will depend. Those definitions should have been included in the Bill . They should have been printed and circulated before we were asked to proThis ceed further with its consideration.

143,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Bendigo-Prime Minis- I Tliat the following definition 'be inserted:"" Organization "" in reference to employees means an association of not less than 100 employees engaged in any industrial pursuit or pursuits whatever, together with such other persons, whether employees engaged in any industrial pursuit or pursuits or not, as have been appointed officers of the association and admitted as members thereof. amendment will bring the Bill into line with the Arbitration Act, which defines an association as. . . any trade or other union, or branch of any union, or any association or body comput. The posed of or representative pf employers or em' ployees, or for furthering or protecting the interests of employers or employees. 15 This matter has been discussed at con29 siderable length by honourable members who voted in favour of the last amend-14 ment. Tn ray opinion, the amendment I AYES. am now submitting is perfectly satisfactory, and in the practical working out of the measure there will be neither confusion nor room for confusion. The honourable member for Batman (Mr . Brennan), speaking on the last amendment, put forward a hypothetical case. He' stated that under the. Arbitration Act an association, of 100 persons could apply NOES. for registration. Their application would be scrutinized by the proper authorities, and, if thought fit, granted. That association would then be registered under the Act, and be eligible for its benefits and liable to the penalties i m posed thereunder. The honourable member proceeded to point out that, under this measure, there would be no registration and no scrutiny of associations which made application. All I have to say to that point is that if the honourable member thinks that machinery for registration' is desirable, and would of itself be a sufficient guarantee, such machinerycan be provided in the Bill . The honourable member omitted to point out that, under section 62 of the Arbitration Act, the Governor General may, by proclamation, declare the Act to apply to any association, whether registrable under the Act or not.",37
144,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Is it the intention the Prime Minister to include that secordinary tion in this Bill , or to insert a definition of organization?",38
145,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"That will not be quired. I am dealing with the argument of the honourable member for Batman that, under the present Act, registration is a safeguard for the union. I am ing out that under that Act unregistered associations can be dealt with by clamation. And as the Tribunal to appointed under this Bill can only brought into existence by the action of tihe Governor General, the same matended chinery can deal with the association, and the same scrutiny as to its bona fides can be applied as under the Arbitraremove tion Act itself. I stated on the second reading that this Bill is not intended supersede the Arbitration Act. It is i tended to deal with special cases-thos de facto disputes which from time to time paralyze the community, and for the setbunal tlement of which there must be mabest chinery. The policy of the Government and, I hope, of Parliament, is to proHunter vide adequate means for peaceful legal redress of disputes. It is a reflection this Legislature that the machinery proThey vided so far has been inadequate. There have been de facto disputes, notably the gas strike, the seamen's strike, the eni gineers' strike, and the coal-miners' pending dispute, which were outside the purview of the Court, or, - at any rate, were not dealt with by the Court. This Bill will provide machinery for dealing with what may.be called extraordinary that. cases.",38
146,Mr CHAHLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I take it that if unions desire to go to the Arbitration Court they will still be at liberty to do so, and that this Bill is intended only to meet cases in which the parties interested prefer to go to an Industrial Board ?",38
147,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"That is so. Earlier in the day, in reply to the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), I said that I did not pretend that this Bill will cover the whole of the industrial field as in my opinion it ought to be covered, but that it is a measure which exhausts our limited powers under the Constitution.",38
148,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,It is more of a conciliatory measure than anything else.,38
149,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Yes . The first part of it is wholly conciliatory. The second of part is intended to deal with those extraoutbursts in the industrial world which may be likened to epidemics of disease in the physical world, such as bubonic plague and small-pox. Against rethe outbreak of such diseases special precautions have to be taken. Similarly, we have to adopt special precautions against these extraordinary industrial outbursts. pointWe propose to deal with them by means of this Bill . I wish honourable members proto entirely disabuse their minds of the be idea that the measure is intended to supbe plant the machinery of the Arbitration Court. Nothing of the sort. It is in to supplement it . It is designed to deal with those cases which are not dealt with by that tribunal. It seeks to every legitimate cause for direct action, so that no union with a grievance will he able to say that there is no T r i to bunal to which it can appeal. The fact n - that at this moment the coal miners have e asked me to convene a Tribunal, which for all practical purposes will be a T r i under Part IV . of this Bill , is the proof that such a measure is necessary. I tell the honourable, member for (Mr Charlton) that I am willing to insert any amendment which will in on sure the protection of bond fide unions. are assured that if they have a dispute the representatives upon the t r i bunal which will be empowered to settle t w i ll be selected from their ranks. It i m - would be midsummer night's madness to do anything else. The point to which I took exception in the amendment which has just been negatived was that the Trades H all was to determine what was a bond fide union. We could hot agree to",38
150,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,Some disputes may arise between contending bodies of employees.,38
151,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"In that case the T r i bunal will be composed of representatives of either sidei We have to deal with a dispute. If I saw the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) get up and strike the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), which God forbid! I would bave to deal with a de facto dispute. The Serjeant-at-Arms would be called in , but he would not have to do anything either to me or my colleagues - h e would have to deal only with the two combatants. The Bill provides for exactly the same kind of remedy. Its object is perfectlv obvious, and I ask honourable members to agree to the amendment.",38
152,Mr MAKIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,The righ t honourable gentleman has stated that the Bill is not intended to supersede the Arbitration Court?,39
153,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,That is so.,39
154,Mr MAKIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Does he not think that clause 17 will bring the Special Tribunals which are to be constituted for the settlement of industrial disputes, into conflict with the Arbitration Court ?",39
155,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,But that clause is in tended to deal only with disputes which arise as the result of the failure of the Arbitration Court to settle de facto dis'putes. Its provisions will became operative only after an award has been made by that Tribunal.,39
156,Mr MAKIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,Will it not interfere legal etiquette?,39
157,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"When , we come to that clause, I shall be prepared to hear arguments in support of its modification. It was inserted in this Bill to prevent any union saying-as was said by the engineers-that it cannot go into the Arbitration Court, because that Court cannot vary an award. But, obviously, we must do something in cases of that sort. Of course, we can amend the A r bitration Act, and if we do that, necessity for clause 17 in its present form will disappear.",39
158,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Hunter) [4.58] This matter has beeu fair l y well threshed out, and I regret that the Committee rejected the amendment of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor). If that amendment had been accepted, or if some other proposal had been adopted, which would have insured that the rights of in dustrial unions would be protected, this Bill would probably have met with a very favourable reception at the hands of in dustrial unions. But, in its present form, it will only engender suspicion in the minds of industrial organizations. I am very pleased that the Prime Minister has made it clear that, these organizations w i ll still be able to have recourse to the A r bitration Court-, if they do not desire to avail themselves - of the provisions of the Bill . But there are organizations which will not come under the measure. The Bill provides another avenue by which disputes may be settled without recourse to a strike or lockout. But in order to achieve his object, the Prime Minister has departed from the position which is laid down in other Statutes concerning the registration of unions. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Elundell) stated that the Prime Minister had indicated his intention to include in this measure all the definitions embodied in the Arbitration Act . But the right honourable gentleman has made it clear that he has no such intention.",39
159,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I have not. When I was on my feet, I said that I was prepared to include all those definitions in the Bill .",39
160,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,And to compel unions to be registered under the Arbitration Act .,39
161,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,No .,39
162,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,I am quite in agreement with the right honourable with gentleman. But the honourable member for Adelaide stated that the Prim© M in ister was prepared to do that.,39
163,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I said that we would provide the machinery by which, under this Bill , there can be that close scrutiny of unions which is necessary to prevent bogus unions registering.",39
164,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"That is quite another matter. In the clause which we are now considering, there is a danger, and I think that the Piinie Minister is anxious to guard against it . But in its present form , the clause leaves room for the suspicion that, in the event of an in dustrial dispute arising, certain men may be employed in opposition to unionists, and if they number more than 100, they may form an organization, and thus obtain all the privileges which this Bill seeks to confer. I do not think the Committee wishes to encourage the formation of bogus organizations, and to permit them to get the benefits of this Bill . Otherwise, there would be no necessity for legislation of this character. The Prime Minister has himself stated that the Bill is intended to provide a fresh avenue for the settlement of disputes. Because of his desire to meet some of the most militant unions in Australia, he has provided that there need be no registration. It is evident that when the Bill was drafted, this defect was not noticed. Only after the debate had been initiated was it disclosed.",39
165,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,Would it not be to wait for the definition clause?,40
166,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I have it in my hand. If we can get satisfaction upon this particular inatter, I believe that the Bill will have a fair passage. But the point with which I am dealing is the crux of everything.",40
167,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"If provision be made for the registration of the organizations, will that suffice?",40
168,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"No . The big militant unions will not register under the Arbitration Act. They have become so disgusted at the delays which have occurred, both in the State and the Federal sphere,' that they will not register. Mr BnucE -^If power be given under the Bill to proclaima union, as is provided by section 62 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, that would meet the case,",40
169,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I do not think so. What we have to do is to make it clear beyond doubt that this legislation has been introduced for the purpose of assisting to bring about industrial peace, and not for the purpose of assisting bogus unions which may be formed in times of industrial turmoil Look at the position which obtains in a mining district. Quite recently a number of men went from Victoria to fill the places of strikers at the Richmond Main mine, in New South Wales, and their action cost the Government of that State a lot of money after the dispute had been settled. Those men, if they numbered more than 100, could form an association, and come right into conflict with the recognised miners' organization, which has been in existence there for years. They would probably get an award which would give them entirely different rates of pay from those recognised in that industry.",40
170,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,Would not the Court have regard to all the conditions that obtained in the industry?,40
171,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I am afraid not. I fear that under this clause the men employed in the colliery I have mentioned would be able to establish a separate organization, and thus secure a Board to which matters in dispute could be referred for adjustment. If those men cut into the conditions obtaining in the industry their action would be resented. well Mr MAXWELL - That is the very reason why such an award would not be made. It would make for industrial unrest.",40
172,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I recognise the fairness of the honourable member, and I know what he would do in the circumstances. But, unfortunately, everybody is not constituted alike. I fear that the men composing these Boards would not take such a fair view. They would say, "" It is laid down in black and white in an Act of Parliament that if there are more than 100 men employed in an industry they may form a Board and bring their grievances before it . "" I need hardly remind honourable members that the decision given in the case of these men might affect thousands of other employees in the industry. Snp-» pose there came again the days of cut throat competition, an award of that kind might be the means of bringing down the wages of all employed in an industry, which would cause a strike, and later there would have to be another award. You must have uniformity.in the conditions of any big industry; you cannot permit associations of 100 or more persons to obtain Special Tribunals, becauso if you do so you destroy all your arbitration legislation, and prejudice the workers against that means of settling disputes.",40
173,Mr BRUCE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Coul d not the difficulty about bogus unions be got over by requiring registration, and the difficulty about genuine unions that will not register be got over by providing the power to draw them in by proclamation?",40
174,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,That might be done. I am not so much concerned about the big militant unions.,40
175,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,They can look after themselves.,40
176,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Yes . My desire is to get these big unions to accept our legislation, so that there may be no trouble.'",40
177,Mr BRUCE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"You cannot do that if they will not register; but there will be no need for them to register if the right to proclaim is retained, and you can prevent the bogus unions by insisting on registration where there is no proclamation.",40
178,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I would like the Prime Minister to devise means for'mak, ing it clear that the existing unions in an industry shall be the parties to be recognised. I know from the experience of a life-time that any other arrangement will mean failure. The members of my own union want legislation to prevent trouble. They are too strong for the Arbitration Court, and it is the country that will suffer if means cannot be devised for settling their disputes. Under the proposal now before us an association of 100 or more persons could obtain recognition, and that would bring them into conflict with all the other workers in the industry, which is what we should try to prevent. We are not asking for an advantage for certain organizations, because they are able to look after themselves; but we wish to be able to prove to them that we have provided better machinery for the settling of disputes, of which vthey can avail themselves. We wish to show them that non-union organizations will not be recognised. Such organizations count for nothing, because they spring up like mushrooms when trouble arises, and disappear as quickly. Our desire is to kee,p the wheels of industry moving. If it were provided that the existing organiza-. tions m an industry should be recognised, the Committee would be almost unanimous in regard to the Bill . Ha d the amendment which has just been rejected been agreed to, the Bill would have been passed in a very short time, because there are only one or two other matters on which there would have been debate, and we could have recommended the measure to the industrialists as one worthy of favourable consideration. But we cannot do that if the amendment now before the Committee is agreed to. No one who has heen connected with industrial unionism for a life-time can ask his organization to accept such an amendment. It cannot be said that there has been any display of party spirit in this debate. But if the present amendment sisted on we shall have to vote against the Bill on the third reading, which is what we do not wish to do. It is satisfactory to know that the measure is intended only to cover cases which are not covered by the Arbitration Act, and to provide machinery additional to thab of the Arbitratio n Court. I hope that the Committee will agree to the amending of the amendment in such a way that bond fide trade unionists will know that it is they who will be recognised when the Bill becomes law. If that is done, there will be very littl e trouble.",41

180,Mr BRUCE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,The Prime Minister offered to make the necessary amendments.,41
181,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,It is a pity that he and the member now'leading the Opposition could not confer.,41
182,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"There is at present a considerable amount of discontent, but no one desires strikes, because they mean an immense amount of suffering, especially for the wives and families of the strikers, and throw the community into turmoil. The Bill has been ill-considered by the Ministry and by the Prime M in ister. The right honourable gentleman argued yesterday that it contained certain provisions, but afterwards he found that they were not there, and promised that he would insert them. He has referred over and over again to the shipping t r i bunal, which, he said, has so adjusted matters that ""there has been no dispute in connection with shipbuilding during three or four years. Honourable members opposite might not approve of the constitution of that tribunal, nor might they approve of all its decisions.

184,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"To-day , and for some years past, we have been building ships more cheaply than we could get them be in - built abroad. What we are now considering is legislation for the establishment of tribunals to deal with a variety of industries, and if we were rightly setting about the amendment of our industrial law, we would incorporate many of the provisions of the Bill in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. This party stands for conciliation and for arbitration. The Prime Minister has spoken as though it were now for the first time proposed to establish round-table conferences, when, as a matter of fact, the President aud the Registrar of the Arbitration Court have power to bring together the parties to an impending dispute ; and over and over again differences have thus been threshed out, and agreements have been come to which have been registered as awards of the Court. I consider that this piece-meal method of legisWakefield lating will make confusion worse confounded. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) has made it plain that the industrialists of this country view this measure with suspicion; and, in my opinion, their attitude is justified. If honourable members earnestly desire to secure industrial peace, they should be prepared to give consideration to the claims of the 700,000 unionists of Australia. If the community were divided into classes, the organized industrialists and those who depended on them would be found to constitute the larger part of the population. They are the real producers. It is they who are doing the work which is making Australia progress.",41

186,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"""We complain that the proposed definition is altogether unsatisfactory, and too limited; and I am afraid that, if it is agreed to, the Bill will not he a success. The Prime Minister has evidently made up his mind to do nothing more for us: The Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith) knows that he has no power to accept any suggestion from this side of the chamber. Only the Prime Minister can do that. As soon as he says "" I am prepared to accept that suggestion"" all the members on the Government side readily acquiesce.  the Prime Minister here? Mcr.

191,Mr RYAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"West Sydney) [5.23] The fact that such an amendment as this is moved by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) will be admitted by all members of the Committee to be evidence that the measure Avas ill-considered before it was placed before us, because the amendment is a very vital one. The Prime Minister explains that it is intended to place industrial unions on the same footing under this measure as under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. We must all admit that there is great difficulty in bringing forward, any measure that will completely do away with industrial unrest. The Prime Minister does not claim that this measure will do so, but he does claim that it will be a vast improvement on existing legislation. I do not view with suspicion a. measure because of the source whence it comes. I do not view this Bill with suspicion merely because it happens to be not fathered by the Prime Minister. We must judge a Bill by what is contained in it, but, although the Prime Minister would have us believe that the amendment he now proposes will largely meet the objections put forward from this side, in my opinion it merely has the effect of making it appear that the Prime Minister intends to give to industrial unions that recognition and relief to which they are entitled, though, in fact, he does not. Under the Arbitration Act no one but organizations of employers and organizations of employees can make application to the Court - Under this measure, even if this amendment is passed, it will still he possible, so far as I can see, for persons as distinct from organizations to Wing) applications before these Tribunals. As I read clause 15, it will still be possible, even if the Prime Minister's consequent amendment is in serted, for persons as distinct from organizations to move the Tribunal under it. Having connected proposed amendments, which no doubt will be carried, as the Prime Minister has the majority, and having made a complete whole of them, I submit that there will still be a loophole left in this measure that is not left in the Arbitration Act ; that is, the Tribunal may still be moved by persons as distinct from organizations - Clause 15, as amended, would readA Special Tribunal shall have cognisance(a) Of any industrial dispute between an organization of employees on the one hand and employers or organizations of employers on the other hand, referred to it by the persons or zations parties thereto. That will still make it possible for persons to move the Tribunal, a thing which is not possible with the Arbitration Court. The Prime Minister, therefore, in bringing forward these amendments, is really not carrying out what I understand to be his undertaking to bring the measure in this respect on to the same lines as the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The Prime Minister might now, by way of interjection, let me know whether he is likely to make it possible under clause 15, as a consequential amendment, for only organizations to move the Tribunal.",42
192,Mr BEENNAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"They will not ganizations, but new associations.",43
193,Mr RYAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Of course, they are not the same type of organizations as are referred to in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act . The fact that the Prime M in ister brings forward these amendments, which are so vital, is ample evidence to me that this measure, so far as this particular clause is concerned, is intended as a kind of make-believe to the public and to industrial unions that thing real and effectual is tp be done in order to remove industrial unrest. We have, first of all, the Council, that is going to inquire into the causes of industrial unrest. We do not want any Council to inquire into them. We all know the main causes, and we know that one of them is the fact that profiteering is allowed to go unchecked. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr Atkinson) - Order ! The honourable member is going beyond the scope of the amendment.",43
194,Mr RYAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"In what way ? these The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN. The amendment deals only with the definition of industrial organizations, and not with the causes of industrial unrest.",43
195,Mr RYAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"It deals with the definition of industrial organizations, with a view to create machinery to be available to organizations to remove industrial unrest. If I am only to discuss the definition, without reference to the other clauses, it is impossible for me to discuss it intelligently. The proposed definition entirely begs the question, and gets away from the real evil. That is, that the causes of industrial unrest are allowed to exist, organialthough they can be dealt with , not only under the power in the Constitution, which enables this measure to be passed to prevent industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State, but under other parts of section 51 of the Constitution. If the Prime Minister really wishes to do something that will effectively tend in the direction of removing industrial unrest-and I am sure that in this he would have the support of every honourable member on this side-it would be as well for him first of all to set about removing the causes which we know exist. One of those causes is that the cost of living 'is allowed to be high, through profiteering. If that cause were removed, and if also those restrictive and be ortyrannical measures",43
196,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N," Order! The honourable member is sroing into a general discussion of the question of industrial unrest, and quite beyond the amendment.",43
197,Mr RYAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I am dealing with industrial unrest, and the relation of organizations to it . A m I not allowed to discuss that question? The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN some- I do not think the honourable member is putting it in that way.",43
198,Mr RYAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,I am inclined to think that you are not construing the Standing Orders as they ought to be construed.,44

200,Mr RYAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I have my remedy, which I shall take if you invite me to take If you want that done, I will do it . I the meantime I am endeavouring to suade you that what I am saying has bearing upon the amendment that the Prime Minister has moved. It is a vital amendment, which goes to the very foundations of the Bill , and surely allowed to refer incidentally to the causes which we were told existed for the introduction of this measure. I am ing the Prime Minister to agree to the association may be a body proposals put forward by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) this ' afternoon, in preference to his own proAct. posal. He will go a long way to show sincerity and the sincerity of the ment by simultaneously taking steps deal with what we know are the causes industrial unrest. What is the use of spending hours here talking about appointing Councils to investigate them is like appointing a Commission to ascerright tain the best gauge to use on the ' tralian railways- a matter that was tled long ago. We know what the. causes of industrial unrest are, and we have means at our hand of removing them ; but, instead of our endeavouring to go the real root of the question, measures this sort are introduced, with new finitions of organizations, in order tomittee make believe to the public, both ployers and employees, that they really deal with the question. I am posed to the amendment",44
201,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,Are you ' getting to the amendment now?,44
202,Mr RYAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I noticed that the able member was also opposed to the sure, because he voted against the second reading. I am opposed to the amend There ment because it does not go f ar It is certainly better than the measure it stands. It does try to fill in but it does not fill it up in the proper way. It provides for organizations which any dispute. need not be registered, and which need not be recognised by any trade or industrial council. It contains a general vision that any 100 persons can come ward and be regarded as an organization. A p a r t from that, any one person move a Tribunal. For these reasons I opposed to the amendment. . Mr BRENNAN (Batman) [ 5 . 3 6 ] - It is rather curious that, under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, certain associamay become organizations, whereas, in the amendment proposed to be inserted in this Bill , an "" association "" means an it . "" Organization,"" reversing the position n - set out in the Conciliation and A r b it r apertion Act. When speaking previously I a did not have the Prime Minister's amendment before me. In addition to the objections I have already raised, I wish to point out that this proposed definition I am' refers only to "" organizations of emmain ployees,"" and proposes to give the meaning of ' ' association ' ' to the phrase ' ' orinvitganization of employees,"" although an which has been already refused registration under the Conciliation, and Arbitratio n An y body or any number- ' of his persons, any union, bogus or real, may Governbecome an association of employees so to long as they have sufficient'numbers. The of Prime Minister foreshadows that he proour poses to substitute "" organization "" for "" association "" wherever the latter occurs ? It in the Bill . The proposal may be all as far as it goes, but when we come Austo deal with the Commonwealth Council, setwhich is to consist of a chairman and representatives of employers and reprethe sentatives of employees, what will be the position when there is no reference to any to organization or association of employees? of Unless we make consequential amenddements, the proposal now before the Comwill not help us where the Bill reemfers to employees only. My main objecwill tion to the amendment I have already opstated. A body which may be recognised under this Bill may be a registered or an unregistered body of employees or a body back which, having applied for registration on the ground that it was fairly representahonortive of the industry, may have had its meaapplication refused on the ground that ib was not representative of the industry. is no test provided in the Bill enough. or in the amendment for discovering as whether an association of employees is in a gap, any sense representative of a particular industry and entitled to speak for it in",44
203,Mr CUNNINGHAM,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Gwydir) [5.42]. pro- - It is apparent to any one having exforperience of the Arbitration Court that the amendment will provide no redress can for employees as a whole, or get us over am the main defect of the Bill , namely, that which I might term the judiciary to be set up by the Bill , in - which provision is made for the representation of organizations which may be non-representative of the great body of the workers. A Judge delivers awards in the Arbitration Court, but, under this Bill , the determining factors in arriving at a judgment will be the proposed councils, which may comprise representatives of non-representative organizations. We have to consider how these councils may be utilized to the detriment of employees eenerallv. If amendments are not inserted in the Bill definitely setting out the position of organizations, we may have on a council, which is part of the judiciary set up by the Bill , three representatives ' of employees' organizations, who are at direct variance with one another.",44
204,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,A Council cannot give decisions.,45
205,Mr CUNNINGHAM,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"But a Council may conduct an inquiry, the tone of which may he of a character that will in terfere with the whole of the industry concerned. If chambers of commerce or employers' federations are prepared to start "" scab"" organizations, they maysecure the representation of those bodies on a council, and gain a distinct majority which will enable the inquiry to be so conducted as to give an entirely erroneous idea of the conditions prevailing in any particular industry. We all know that in the past employers' organizations have endeavoured to n u l l if y the Arbitration Act, and that the unions have only been able to make it at all effective through the fact that it was a Judge who presided in the Arbitration Court. If "" scab "" organizations, by securing representation on the proposed tribunals or oouncils, can work in with the "" bosses "" against the interests of the main body of the workmen, the consequence will be that the men will not work under the decisions of these t r i bunals, and confusion will only be made worse confounded. I hope that provision will be made in the Bill so that the status of the employees' organizations on these councils will be placed beyond doubt. If they are not, the whole measure is doomed to failure, and instead of being conducive to industrial peace, will be an incentive to industrial unrest, if this other class of organization is permitted to assume .any position of authority in connection with [144] the proposed Tribunals. Personally, I think the real cause of industrial unrest lies deeper than can be reached by'such a Bill as this. It is not the lack of machinery to deal with disputes. It is the excessively high cost of living, and the fact that, - owing to the untrammelled operations of profiteering, a wage which may be a living wage today may be much less than a living wage in a week's time; and no matter how comprehensive this Bill may be made, it will be quite ineffective in respect to bringing about industrial peace, if we cannot probe down and remove this real and fundamental cause of existing industrial unrest.

208,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [ 6 . 4 ] - I do not know how the honourable member's argument can support his amendment - I can, however, understand his contention that these provisions should be embodied in the Arbitration Act ; but I am afraid the honourable member has confused this portion of the Bill with that which relates to Special Tribunals. This clause provides for machinery for creating councils of advice, not to advise the President of the Arbitration Court, whose functions are limited to the settlement nf disnutefl within the meaning of the Act, but for the purpose of advising this Legislature, if necessary, as to what means or measures must be taken to deal with an industry - I as a whole. W it h that the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, as such, has nothing to do; but this Legislature has everything to do with it . Thus it is rather a reflection on this Parliament to say that it is not to have the benefit of the advice of these Councils. It is to this Legislature that the Trades and Labour Councils and the various trade union organizations look. The Conciliation and Arbitration Court is the creation of the Parliament; and whatever may be said as to the authority that should create a Special Tribunal, the Councils ought clearly to be appointed by this Legislature. This is the proper authority to appoint them. Their functions are advisory. They are not, as the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham) seems to imagine, to make inquiries into disputes. They are to consider what are the troubles from which the industrial body is suffering. They will have no legislative'or executive functions. Industrial Disputes Committee of the. Melbourne Trades H all Council, for in stance, is an advisory body. It endeavours to conciliate and to bring the parties together; and one of the functions of these Councils will be to consider and report as to what, kind of machinery is necessary for such purposes. We hope that there will shortly he an opportunity for the people to express an opinion as to the nature of the constitutional amendments necessary to enable this Parliament to deal effectively, amongst other thiugs, with industrial troubles. These Councils may consider, and report, what amendments, if any, should be made; what kind of Court, if any, should be appointed; and what its functions should be. They may report as to the co-ordination of State and Federal functions, and the prevention of overlapping on the part of State and Federal Courts. All matters can properly be considered by these bodies.",46

218,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Wilmot ) [ 6 . 1 5 ] move That the word ""half,"" twice occurring in sub-clause 4, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" third."" The object of my amendment is to provide - for the representation of the general public as well as of employers and employees on the council. The public suffer because of industrial disputes, and they will have to "" pay the piper "" for all these tribunals which are designed to bring about indust r i a l peace. The employee or the employer directly concerned in a dispute today may become tomorrow, in the case of another dispute, a member of the general public. The Committee will recognise that, apart fro m the direct parties to a dispute, something like 70 per cent, of the people suffer by reason of the dislocation of industry, and have no means of protecting themselves. It is time that we provided for the protection of the general public. When a dispute occurs between employers and employees in an in dustry, it is an easy matter for the parties to come to an agreement that there shall be an increase in wages, and that it shall be met iby a rise in the price of the product of the industry. The increase is thus passed on to the public. The time is coming when this system of working round and round in a circle will have to stop, if there is not to be a snapping of the industrial affairs of the country. I am glad to learn from the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) that the coal-miners are beginning to recognise that something in this direction must be done. The honourable member has told us that the miners believe that inquiry by a Special Tribunal would show that their wages could be increased without necessarily involving an increase in the present price of coal.",48
219,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,Who would elect presentatives of the general public Council?,48
220,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"They would be power of wages? elected just as the other members of the council are to be elected. All sections the community should have a fair deal, and I fear that the measure will not of much avail unless we insert in it the provision I have outlined. per cent, of the people who are not directly concerned with any industrial trouble reputable representatives may - I readily be selected. The representation of the general public on the council will be in the interests of the employers and employees themselves, because in some cases it may do away with the suspicion that the increase in the rates of wages paid in an industry is provided for by raising the'. cost of the article produced to the general public. If there were direct representatives of the general public ^present at, a conference, who could subsequently inform the people that the best arrangement possible in the circumstances had been made, much would be achieved in the direction of allaying suspicion.",48
221,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,Does not the honourable member realise that these Councils will not deal with disputes at all ? ,48
222,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I am well aware of that, but I have already indicated that I do not propose to stop at the appointment of representatives of the public on the Councils. Similar representation must be given upon all the several bodies to be created by this measure.",48
223,Mr RYAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Do not the words "" employers "" and ""employees"" cover the whole of the general public?",48
224,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Not when there is a dispute. The great body of the people are neither employer nor employee in industrial troubles; yet their in erests are so involved that they are entitled to direct representation upon any form of tribunal which may be dealing with an issue. My proposition is not a hew one; I have voiced these same views for years past. Until the general public are satisfied with any proposed settlement of an in dustrial crisis, there cannot be freedom from industrial unrest. For those who are interested parties in a. dispute today may be merged in the great general public when a dispute arises tomorrow; and. vice versa, from among the disinterested the regeneral public today there may be on the directly involved parties tomorrow.",48
225,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,Why not give a Judge power to regulate the purchasing,48
226,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"That is another of question. It is sometimes easy for parties concerned in an industrial dispute to hold be a conference and arrive at some decision, irrespective of the rights and interests of From the 70 the general public.",48
227,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"The honourable member says that parties to a dispute today may be ranked among the general public tomorrow. If that is so, and representatives of the public are appointed to all tribunals, there will be merely a multiplication of the representation of employers and employees. Mr ATKINSON "" - A Special Tribuna l will' not always be composed of the same personnel. There will be, of course, different industries concerned in different disputes. If any good is to come of this legislation, it will be by reason of the fact that those selected to sit around the table will be actually acquainted with t h t subject-matter under review. It will be as easy for the Government to provide by regulation for two direct representatives of the pulHc as to authorize the appointment of direct delegates from employees and employers. I am of opinion, personally, that these Councils could be done away with altogether. my first proposed amendment accepted there will be several consequential amendments, most important of which will be the insertion of the words "" and one thir d representative of the general public apart from the direct parties interested in the dispute or threatened dispute.""",48

I have already stated, while discussing the Bill , that if the working classes of Australia are left to look after the interests of the general public, they will look after them much better than would some organizations brought into being by busybodies who hold their meetings in back parlours, and are responsible to no one, and representative of no one. workers, most of whom are on the "" bread line,"" are the general public. There are really only two classes in Australia-the employers and the employees - ther e being very few, indeed, who do not come under one category or the other. If the general public are given representation on these councils, machinery will have to be provided to select delegates to represent the public.",49

233,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Yes , who are they, and to whom are they responsible? They are a number of busyboclies .who are responsible to no one, but who have an aptitude for poking their noses in toother people's business, who hold hole-andcorner meetings, and who have a great predisposition for "" limelight."" Then there is an association called the "" Middle Class Association."" Whom does that association represent, and who are the members? Who gives them authority to speak on behalf of the people of Australia? No one. It seems to be the fashion in Victoria, and in other States, for half-a-dozen people who have "" an axe to grind,"" or desire some limelight, to meet in Collins-street, or elsewhere, and pass ponderous resolutions which If are sent to every member of this Parliais ment. I dare say that during the last four years I have received for t y such among the communications fro m bodies which have sprung up in the night; and the last was that from the Taxpayers Association today.",49

238,Mr CUNNINGHAM,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Gwydir) [8.5]. - I do not think the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) is serious in submitting this amendment. If he really claims that the general public should be represented, he should outline a scheme for the selection of representatives. Does he propose to take a vote of the whole of the electors of the Commonwealth to decide who this one-third of the representation is to he, or will he accept the Government nomination? If the representation of the general public is to be secured, the chairman should be the representative, because he will be selected by the Government, who should look into his fitness, with that object in view. It is not right for honourable members to attempt to get a certain amount of "" l i m e l i g h t "" by using such catch-phrases as "" the general public."" I believe that this amendment was inspired by the letter which the honourable member for Wilmo t received today, in common with other honourable members, from the Middle Class Association, and in which what that gentleman said last week is brought forward as an argument why we should take certain action today. We should not allow this opportunity to pass without giving our reasons why we are against these ridiculous proposals, which, on the face of them, are designed for the purpose of showing that the representatives appointed as proposed in the Bill will not represent the general public.",49

If the Prime Minister, or Cabinet, cannot find representatives the general public for the Special T r bunal, I do not know who can. Honsomething orable members are trying to scout the amendment, and refer to all sorts of associations to which I never alluded.

240,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"When there is an industrial dispute on, that is generally so. This Bill is designed to alleviate industrial unrest, and if we are merely to have 30 per cent, of the population represented on the Council or other bodies contemplated by this Bill , and to permit any rise in wages to be passed on to the public, we are going round in a vicious circle, the very thing of which the neople complain. We can now give the public a chance to have their case put ; but if we refuse to do so, they will soon see, considering the electoral system now in operation, that they are represented. At an election probably some body like the Middle Class Association will take care to run candidates, for we know that now many candidates may be put forward without involving any split votes- a fact which many honourable members do not seem to appreciate. If the mass of the people are not represented on these bodies, there will naturally arise associations who will run candidates, and instead of two parties, of which honourable members opposite appear to think the country consists, there will be many. That, of course, does not matter under the preferential system of voting; but the public are entitled to representation. If honorunderable members do not like my amendment",50
241,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [8.13] - I hope the honourable member for Wilmot there (Mr Atkinson) will not insist on the amendment. The honourable member, I sure, does not appreciate the functions of the Council, which are not to deterThe mine the price of commodities or the wages of workers; their decisions will as have nothing to do with prices. What one the public is concerned about is that n industrial peace shall prevail; and these the Councils, at any rate, will tend to prothe mote harmony between the two sections of which disturb industrial peace. When i - we come to deal with the Special Tribunal may be said of the general public, although I say at once that the general public, will be represented, and freely and full y 'represented, by the Amendment negatived. you say",50
242,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and 'Attorney-General) [8.14] - I move That before the word "" employees,"" sub-clause 4, the words "" recognised organizations of "" be inserted. The effect of the amendment is that representatives of the employees will be chosen from and by recognised organizations. ""Recognised organizations"" is better than ""organizations,"" simply because "" recognised "" is a broad term, the meaning of which, in fact, everybody knows. It is those organizations which stand for organized labour, and it is organized labour that this part of the B i ll is in - "" recognised."" tended to deal specifically with.",50
243,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Fawkner) [8.15] I do not quite understand what the Prime Minister means by the word "" recognised."" Recognised by whom? We have a definition of an organization of employees, but there are organizations of employers, too. I think it would be better to adhere to the word ""organization,"" without adding "" recognised.""",51
244,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney^General) [ 8 . 1 6 ] have no objection to what the honourable member suggests, but it is useless for us to shut our eyes to facts. The honourable member asks, ""Recognised by whom?"" I reply, "" Recognised by the whole community."" Mr MAXWEIX.""-But we have a definition of "" organization of employees.""",51
245,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"The position in regard to employers is quite different. There may be employers who do not belong to the Employers Federation, or any other Federation, but that is not important. Industrial disputes menace the community because of the actions of certain organizations of employees, and it is in order to create conditions which will induce them to preserve peace that these Councils are to be appointed. If we use the bare word "" organizations,"" the point raised by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) and other honourable members immediately crops up. I can think of no better way of expressing what we mean than by using the word '"" recognised,"" although I admit that if I am asked by whom such organizations - are to be recognised I can only reply that they are recognised. I would not agree - to an earlier amendment which provided that the organization should be recognised by the Trades H all , because the Trades H all might, owing to some political or other difference of opinion, deliberately black-list a union recognised by the whole community. I suggest that the amendment I have proposed is the best for m of words to secure the object we have in view.",51
246,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Hunter) [8.19] The amendment is a good one; in fact, I had intended to propose a similar one. We think it necessary that the organizations should be defined more specifically, and I know of no better word to use than I take it that the recognised organization will be taken to be the recognised union in existence.",51
247,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Barrier) [8.20] Despite what the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) has said, it is not. clear as to what authority shall recognise an organization. The Prime Minister objected to the Trades H all being the body which should determine recognition; then who does the Prime Minister intend shall accord recognition? If there - I are two claimant' organizations, will the recognition be accorded by the registrar of trade unions, who now determines which union shall obtain registration under the Arbitration Act, or will the determining authority be the President of the Arbitration Court?",51
248,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"So far as I know, there hi no such ambiguity or uncertainty as the honourable member suggests. If he can tell the Committee of any two organizations which are rivals for recognition, we may deal with them. I know of none..",51
249,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"The Prime M in ister explained a few minutes ago that by ""recognised"" he meant "" recognised by the general public"". On the occasion of the last upheaval in the coal-mining industry, the Government were not much concerned with the recognition of an organization by the general public. They then did everything possible against the recognised organization.",51
250,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,Who recognised that organization ?,51
251,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,The general public.,51
252,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Ver y well, what more do you want?",51
253,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,But the Government did not accord the recognition.,51
254,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,This Bill will .,51
255,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"The trouble is that the other "" Bill "" did not.",51
256,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"The two "" Bill s "" were in conflict. The fact remains that these safeguards for the unions are not required while industrial peace is maintained, but in time of industrial turmoil all the safeguards in the world",51
257,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,Thes e Councils have nothing to do with industrial turmoil. They are to advise on the general industrial situation.,52
258,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Listenin g to the Prime Minister's introductory speech, I was under the impression that this Bill marked the last achievment in machinery for the preservation of industrial peace.",52
259,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,The honourable member must understand that these Councils are to create the trouble which will be settled by the tribunals.,52
260,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I understood that the Commonwealth Council and the District Councils were to be representative of employers and employees, and would make suggestions to the Government for the preservation of good relations between the parties, thereby obviating industrial unrest.",52
261,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,I am still waiting for a suggestion from the honourable member.,52
262,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I suggest to the Prime Minister that he should recommit the Bill , and introduce some amendment on the lines of my speech on the second reading. Such a proposal would have some effect on industrial unrest. multiplication of words in the definition of organization of employees does not give any more protection to the organization than if the additional words were omitted, because the Prime Minister has not stated what authority shall accord recognition. If recognition is to be left to the M i nistry of the day, their decision will depend upon the strength of the organization engaged in the industrial fight. The Prime Minister illustrated that fact earlier in the evening when he spoke about different organizations. assured us that the bond fide trade union would be the organization recognised, but when he was asked to apply the same method of determining a bond fide organization which operates under the Arbitration Act, he refused to do so.",52
263,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,I did nothing of sort.,52
264,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,The Prime M in ister refused to incorporate in the Bill a registration clause.,52
265,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I said that I would i corporate in this Bill the same machinery as is in the Arbitration Act, if honourable members opposite so desire.",52
266,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,But the Prime Minister did not incorporate it .,52
267,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I am willing to do so if honourable members opposite can make up their mind as to what they want. But as soon as I attempt to meet one of their objections, they immediately find another one.",52
268,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"The Prime M i nister cannot complain of the criticism which the Bill and his amendments have received. This measure is supposed to represent the Ministerial policy in regard to the prevention of industrial unrest. In the process of discussion, the Government have made amendments in response to criticisms from both sides of the House. Whilst the Prime Minister, by the amendment he has moved, is ostensibly giving something to the unions, he is actually giving them no more than they will have if the amendment be not made.",52
269,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,Ver y well; shall we leave out the words I have moved to in sert ? ,52
270,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,The inclusion or omission of the words is immaterial.,52

272,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,That is the honourable member's idea of bringing about industrial peace.,52
273,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"The Prime Minister is doing what he told the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Mathews) to do-he is walking around himself. When he returns to his body he may be able to criticise intelligently the march on Warsaw, and to understand the He first criticism of his own Bill. The amendment does not interfere with the existing industrial organization. It is the powerful organizations that the employers wish ,to get before the industrial Tribunals and the Arbitration Court. Organizations like those of the waterside workers and the the miners are so powerful that they will be accorded recognition whether recognised by the Bill or not, and it does not much matter whether the Ministry of the day or the Arbitration Court and the indusn - trial tribunals accord recognition to organizations that have power. The de facto organizations will enforce actual recognition, whether they get nominal recognition or not. B y tinkering with the Bill by an amendment like this, the toPrime Minister is indulging in his old pastime of camouflaging the issue, and is omitted, pretending to give something while ally giving nothing.

291,Mr BLAKELE Y,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Darling) [8.58] Paragraph 6 provides for conferences, but paragraph d provides for calling evidence. I cannot see why a distinction is made. The objection to paragraph b is that a dispute affects no one but employers and employees.",54

Ib will be its duty to secure information as to the best way of dealing with matters in general. For example, it may wish to inquire into the industrial welfare of the State of New South Wales, and may be desirous of conferring with a man like Professor Meredith Atkinson, who has given a great amount of study to the question of settling industrial disputes, and some time ago delivered a series of lectures before the Trades Hall in Sydney. Why should not a District Council have an opportunity of conferring with him, or with Gompers, if he came here, or Hodges, or any of the - other English Labour leaders, or any one who has ideas as to what ought to be done to remove industrial unrest? I put it, therefore, to the Committee that we ought not to strike out the word "" persons,"" since we desire to enable the Council to have access to all sources of information. Paragraph 6 differs fundamentally from paragraph d.",54

I was unfortunately absent when the - Committee dealt with the previous clause relating to the powers and duties of the Commonwealth Council; but as the Dist r i c t Councils will be only twin brethren of that body, I must' express the view that they will prove to be perfectly useless. Tjnder this clause, and the one with which we have just dealt, we shall - create a number of public positions, and perhaps harass certain sections of the public by summoning them, under penalties, to give evidence. The Councils will have power, .generally, to make a very wide and interesting range of inquiries-that is to say, interesting to those instituting the inquiries)-bu t they do not appear to be likely to bring us any nearer a solution of industrial disputes. That being so, then let us not be particular as to the number of persons whom they may invite to give evidence before them. For my part, they might invite Venus and the Man in the Moon to give evidence if they did not see any impropriety i u calling upon them to appear before them at the same time.",55

298,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"The Prime Minister has foreshadowed that possibility. I have it from the representative of Russia on my right (Mr Considine) that Lenin and Trotsky will be. visiting us at an early date, and that being so it would be just as well to give these useless Councils-if we are to have them-scop e to prove a little more entertaining than they are likely to be .under the clause as it stands. These Councils are quite different from the Special Tribunals with power to act on behalf of employers and organizations of employees; and, therefore, although it may seem somewhat reckless and unprecedented on my part, I do not propose to oppose the Prime Minister's view of this particular matter. Amendment, as amended, agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. - Clause 12 agreed to.

We have already passed that stage, although it is only a few minutes after 9 o'clock.

I have already stated my reasons for proposing this amendment. While a Commonwealth Council and the District Councils will have only advisory powers, the Special Tribunals for which this clause provides will have power, under clause 17, to set aside or vary the terms an award made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. I desire that the Tribunals in their essence shall be subordinate to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. I have already pointed out that under the clause, as it stands, the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court will inevitably resign immediately the Act begins to operate. No self-respecting Judge will remain, in such a position knowing that his awards might be varied by a Tribunal of laymen. No self-respecting barrister would accept an appointment to the Court if it were to be governed in this way by a Special Tribunal.",55
301,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"That is, provided that clause 17, which gives the Special Tribunal power to vary awards of the Court, is allowed to stand.",56
302,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Yes . We have had no information that the Government intend to withdraw that clause. I wish now to ascertain the opinion of the Committee as to whether the Conciliation and Arbitration Court or a Special Tribunal should he. the higher body. I am emphatically in favour of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court being the superior body. If it is not, it will go by the hoard, since we shall not be able, in the circumstances, to induce any one to carry on its functions.",56
303,Mr BRUCE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Flinders) [9.121 - We have now reached a vital part of the Bill involving the determination of a number of matters, and I shall need to have more light thrown on this clause, which provides that Special Tribunals may be called into being iby the Governor General, before I agree to vote for it either as it stands or as proposed to be amended. Part IV . of the Bill may be taken to completely cut away the ground from Under the Conciliation and. Arbitration Court. It may be regarded as doing away with the principle of arbitration, as exercised for many years by Arbitration Courts in Australia, and substituting for it this new type of Special Tribunal. If there is any idea of appointing Special Tribunals to deal with every industrial question that is. likely to arise, I shall vote against the clause, since it would mean putting an end to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. As the honourable member for Darling has suggested, of no self-respecting Judge would remain on the Arbitration Court Bench knowing that.a Special Tribunal had power to set aside his awards. If , however, the Bill has merely been introduced because our power to put in order the whole of our machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes in Australia is limited under the Constitution, then I am not sure that we cannot accept the principle of Special Tribunals.",56
304,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,This Bill does not put us in any better position so far as our constitutional limitations are concerned.,56
305,Mr BRUCE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I am not suggesting that it does. I am merely suggesting that, instead of amending the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which would appear to he the reasonable course to take, the Government have introduced this measure because, owing to our constitutional limitations, we cannot legislate for the settlement of industrial disputes from a national stand-point as we should like to do. If that is so-if this is 'merely a proposal to provide special measures to deal with special cases-n o exception can be taken to it. If we can obtain from the Prime Minister an assurance that the Government, which is given power under this clause to create Special Tribunals, does not intend to take practically every matter out of the hands of the Arbitration Court, but merely proposes to use the power in cases of great industrial disturbance, when it is necessary to act, and act quickly, I am prepared to accept the clause, with this one proviso, that I do not accept the Bill as a finalized measure for the settlement of industrial disputes in this country. At best it can 'be no more than a measure introduced to tide us over until such time as the Convention sits, and in its wisdom, I trust, gives us full power to deal with the whole industrial question.",56
306,Mr CUNNINGHAM,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,What will happen if the Government which gives the assurance goes out of power?,56
307,Mr BRUCE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"That would be unfortunate; but I am prepared to take the risk and I am not nervous. We are giving this power to the Government appoint Special Tribunals, and I will for the proposal only on an assurance from the Government that, while are in power-and this is all the assurthat ance the Government can give-the y w i not use it except to appoint in circumstances of serious industrial or threatened serious industrial unrest. the Government is in a position to give that assurance, I am prepared to vote for the clause.",56
308,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"Bendigo-Prime Minisindustrial ter and Attorney-General) [ 9 . 1 7 ] The honourable member for Flinders (Bruce) has raised a question cover of which we may discuss some of the general principles in Part IV . , dealing with the appointment of Special and Local Tribunals. The honourable member has said that this measure could be ministered in such a way as to practically take out of the hands of the A r b i tration Court all effective jurisdiction over industrial disputes; and I admit it could be so administered. The honorvernment able member has also said that if that is the intention of the Government, he necessary and beneficial. feels sure that no self-respecting Judge would consent to continue in an office which would be superfluous and could not possibly reflect any credit on himself be of any credit to the country. When i troducing the measure I tried to make clear what the Government had in mind. I expressed in plain words iny appreciashould tion of the fact that this measure could not be regarded as a panacea for induscountry trial unrest or as the last word in trial legislation. I said that with present limited power under the Constifare tution it was impossible to do full (to the industrial situation. I further said-which , I think, is undeniable-tha the present condition of things is not satisfactory. I pointed out that there an evil for which there is no remedy, that industrial unrest is a world-wide trouble, from which we suffer very in this country, although certainly not more than other countries. I added that during the war we had resorted on setemper veral occasions to Special Tribunals; we had been compelled to do this partly because of the limitations on the power of the Court; partly because the unions themselves, or some of them, would not to recognise the Court; and partly because vote - the circumstances created and arising out of the war precipitated crises which the they Court, having laid down the principle it could not arbitrate when conl l fronted with a de facto strike, declined the Tribunals to interfere with. The honourable member has asked for If certain assurances, and says that he does not approve of the principle of the Government appointing Special Tribunals, or appointing chairmen to Special T r i bunals, for the purpose of dealing with disputes. I am not going to - argue that point, but I may refer the Mr honourable member to the practice in undeT Great Britain .",57
309,Mr BRUCE,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"The only point I raise for the moment is under clause 13-that these Tribunals shall be created only adin major industrial troubles, and not for every trouble, thus taking away the power of the Arbitration Court.",57
310,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I was going to say that that in England the practice of the Goappointing Tribunals to deal with disputes has certainly been found I leave aside now the question of whether the State ought to interfere at all . I think we have come to the point that, whether directly or indirectly, the State must in or terfere; it is only a question of whether n - it should interfere through the agency of somebody outside whom it appoints for the purpose, as a Judge, or whether it interfere directly. But it may be accepted as a basic principle in a civilized that the State cannot stand idle induswhen there is a dispute, whether indus""the trial or not, that is a menace to the weland safety of the country. The honjustice orable member for Flinders asks whether we intend to apply this legislation to all t disputes, or only to special disputes that evade or escape the control of the Court. is I can answer that question very shortly. It is intended for just that class of disputes and no other. It is intended to much deal with those disputes which the Court cannot or does not deal with, either from a failure of its jurisdiction, through the of the men, or from any cause. that Those disputes must be settled, and the machinery created by this Bill will enable the Court to deal with them. The honourable member also asks whether this measure is to be accepted as £ final instalment of industrial legislation, It is not. He has said that the Convention, which is to be appointed as the result of legislation this session, will probably make some recommendations to the people; and I hope'that recommendations will be made and accepted that will enable this Legislature to deal with industrial unrest in a very much more effective way than at present. The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr. Atkinson) referred to the fact of the Courts awarding increases of wages, and the employers paying the increased wage by increasing prices, as a "" vicious circle."" This Parliament has no power whatever to deal with such conditions, and, consequently, industrial disputes occur and recur through high wages being given to meet high prices, and high prices again causing industrial unrest. I hope that the people will give this Legislature, which alone can deal with the matter, the power to deal with this phenomenon.",57

312,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"It has been held by the High Court that we have no such power. We have to deal with a disputewe cannot make laws regulating industry. The effect of the decision of the Court in any case begins and ends with the parties to the dispute; therefore this Tribunal cannot do any more than the Court does now-it can deal with a dispute. In order to make a common rule, every one of the parties in the industry must be brought before the Court, one after the other, if they are not all joined together. That is a difficulty inherent in our Constitution, and cannot be remedied. To summarize shortly mv answer honourable member for Flinders, I give him the assurance that the Government intend to use this oower for special and not. genera] purposes. It does not intend by this Bill that these Tribunals shall supersede the Arbitration Court. The vernment propose to use these Tribunals in cases where the Court cannot deal with de facto disputes, or does not do so.",58

318,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I submit, in all circumstanoes, that this measure is amply warranted. The necessity for it is obvious, and that necessity has been emphasized in the last few weeks, when those engaged in the coal-mining industry, which is the basis of all industrial operations, have absolutely and point-blank declined to go to the Court, and have asked me to appoint a Tribunal and a Chairman thereto; they will not attorn to any other kind of Tribunal. I am not defending that attitude; but there it is, and will honourable members say that, although the coal miners are prepared to abide by the decision of a Tribunal, we are to court industrial warfare and disaster to the Commonwealth rather than follow the sane and sensible method of settling disputes by the means that are available ? I give the honourable member the assurance for which he asks, and I hope that we shall be able in the spring of next year to introduce a comprehensive measure. I - hope that the people will give us the requisite power; at any rate, they will have an opportunity to do so. If they give us the authority for which we ask, this measure will , in the nature of things, lapse, aud we shall be able to deal effectively with industrial unrest without any limitation at all upon our powers.

Suppose we had been dealing with the recent marine engineers' dispute. When the Tribunal had given its decision, the dispute would have been finally settled. But in the coal mining industry, the dist pute will not be finally settled by the mere decision of the Tribunal. We have to consider the working of the industry, and its adcircumstances and ramifications are such that, in my opinion, the Tribunal must be to - it as one is attached to the shipbuilding industry. The circumstances of the industry vary so much, and the provocations to industrial unrest are so numerous) that it will be a mistake to appoint a Tribunal merely to settle a particular dispute, and then allow it to lapse.",58

322,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"There might be; but no Tribunal will be appointed except to deal with a special case of industrial unrest that cannot be settled in any other way.

If that be so, the amendment offers an opportunity for the co-ordination of the provisions of this Bill with those of the Arbitration Act. If the President of the Arbitration Court, in stead of the Governor General, is given power to appoint the Special Tribunals, we shall to some extent have co-ordination of our industrial legislation. If , however, such appointments are to be made by the Government through the Governor General, complications and misunderstandings are likely to arise owing to two distinct authorities operating in the same sphere. If it is the desire of the Prime Minister that this machinery shall merely supplement, and not supersede, the A r b i tration Court, he will be merely acting consistently if he agrees to give to the President of the Court the power to create a Special Tribunal.",59
324,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,I cannot agree to that.,59
325,Mr MAKIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I think the amendment offers a means of obviating two different sets of machinery being in operation for the settlement of industrial disputes. The Arbitration Court has not been wholly successful, owing to the l i m i tation of its powers. If the Court is given authority to supplement its present operations by the appointment of Special T r i bunals under this measure there will be a ""co-ordination of effort which is very desirable.

A large number of employers, rejpresenting nearly all the big industries, are anxious that some use shall be made of the Arbitration Court in conjunction with the machinery proposed in this Bill . Their idea is that a dispute should first be taken to the Arbitration Court, which should determine whether the trouble extended beyond one State. If the dispute were found to be Inter-State, the Arbitration Court would appoint a Special Tribunal, representative of employers and employees in the industry, to endeavour to reach a settlement at a round-table conference. An announcement of the Government's intention in regard to more comprehensive legislation would have a good effect upon the people. Possibly the Committee would be wise to accept the amendment.",60

I am afraid that if the appointments are left wholly to the Cabinet, there may be an opinion abroad that the persons selected do not sufficiently represent the interests involved, and I think that a personnel selected by some one outside the political arena would inspire more confidence. I am sorry that the public has not been made aware that this Bill is only a step in the direction of industrial reform; and unless something further is done, we shall have a system of settling disputes by tribunals running parallel with the Arbitration Court, and one or other system of .settlement will become useless sooner or later. But if the principle in this Bill be grafted on to what is good in the Arbitration Act, a workable measure will be got. The Prime Minister would be well advised if , as soon as circumstances will permit, he got into touch with the employers and employees, who between them would be able to draf t a Bill which next session would be able to take the place of this.",60

348,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC TELEPHONE I N,"I wish the Arbitration Court to be supreme, and I have seen a copy of the Arbitration Bill in which it cuts is made supreme. In any case, we can make it supreme; and when the Arbitration Bill is before us, I shall try to setthat that is done. I am prepared to allow the Government to bring into existence any tribunal with a view to settling disputes. If it does not do so, it may be criticised, and even put out of office. The marine engineers got no sympathy fro m the Arbitration Court when, on a recent occasion, they approached it - The President told them that he could not hear their case. H a d the machinery provided for in the Bill been then in existence, the Government would have had to appoint a special Board. I am against giving too "" much power even to the President of the Arbitration Court. Parliament should be supreme in regard to all matters affecting industry. I have the utmost confidence in the Arbitration Court, but con-. gestion of business will take place there; and should the amendment be carried, and the Court be applied to for a special Board, it would want to know the reason for the application. It would be told that there was a dispute to he settled, and probably would then require evidence to show the existence of a dispute. A ll this would mean delay, and probably bring - about a strike.

Evidently he is not aware that the Court has for many years possessed this power; but, so far as I know, has not exercised it . Section 36 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act says1. The Court may refer any industrial dispute of which it has cognisance, or any matter arising out of the dispute, to a Local Industrial Board for investigation and report, and may delegate to that Board such of its powers, including all powers of the Court in relation to conciliation and the settlement of the dispute by amicable agreement as it deems desirable.

On the report of the Local Industrial Board the Court may, with or without hearing further evidence or argument, or both, decide the dispute and make its award.

I want to address a word of warning to the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), who wants to extract a solemn assurance from the Government that these Special Tribunals would only be employed in extreme cases and for very special reasons, and was able to secure the guarantee from the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) that they would be bodies which would come into existence to deal with special disPersonally, putes and would go out of existence, perhaps, in some cases and not in other cases when the particular disputes were settled.
