1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Leo MCLeay) took the chair at 10 a.m., and read prayers. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) In Committee Consideration resumed from 3 October. Schedule 3. Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs Proposed expenditure, $277,459,000.",11
2,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"ln not speaking about the estimates for ment of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, I address particularly the question of a total lack of a population icy on the part of this Government. It interesting that at this time, when the ernment wants to set hurdles over which Opposition must jump in relation to taxation and related matters, in the areas in which the Government has a clear administrative responsibility, there is a total lack of petence on its part to deal with the imporment tant questions facing Australia. . We have seen in the area of immigration and ethnic affairs a preoccupation by the immigration Government in dealing with non-issues like it migrant selection where, increasingly, referboth ence is being made to debates that are well imperative. and truly over, such as race and the like, in the area of certainty, of population policy for Australia, the Government has lost its nerve. 1 refer to the comments from the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) a television program on Sunday, 20 August, when he was interviewed by one Kerry ment's O'Brien. He was asked about the question population generally and the appropriate ceiling for Australia's ultimate population. He said this: Well ... I am not as conscious of it or as formed as I should be. That is certainly the case. He said: And. that struck me the moment I came into the portfolio. The moment I took over this had no idea what Australia's optimum population should be in the long term, and that's something we must start to establish. I mean, in terms of the rest of the world, the rest of the world is probably better off if we remain a net exporter of food and energy. They are better off in terms of their own standard of living. My intuitive guess is about 25 million. That was an extraordinary comment from a Minister. On all the information available to me, we need not have an immigration policy 1989-90 if that is our optimum target. Leading demographer Christobel Young makes the point very clearly in her studies that we will reach that target, with very little change in the immigration program that we have now, at about the turn of the century. But thereafter the population would continue to rise. If one fixes a target by an intuitive guess of 25 million, of course, one can see that it would be long before that target, with existing the Departpolicies, was exceeded. That brings me to the Estimates debates that have taken place in the Senate recently poland to the speech by the Prime Minister is (Mr Hawke) to the Federation of Ethnic GovCommunities Councils of Australia on 30 the November 1988. The Prime Minister wanted to make it appear that the Government had a coherent policy in relation to population matters. After canvassing a number of issues comhe made a very clear and unambiguous stateat point six in his address, when he said: . . . we will soon announce the blueprint for our policies to the year 2000 and beyondwill be a balanced strategy, reflecting the needs of the individual family and the broader economic but I believe that we need that sort of blueprint and that we need a clear, unambiguous statement of what population policy should be in Australia.. In the Senate some of my colleagues sought information from the Minister in for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in relation to the Governprogram in this area. It was the most of illuminating discussion I have heard in some time. In relation to the Prime Minister's address my colleague Senator Durack asked the Minister what was the task of the Departwell inment and its Bureau of Immigration Research. He asked whether the Minister believed he had any particular responsibility for the blueprint that the Prime Minister had portfolio, I promised. The Minister said: I am pleased that you quoted it in the way you did, because he probably did. J;lot give a timetable for achievement. That was an extraordinary comment because the Prime Minister's statement was, 'we will soon announce'. I do not know what is meant by 'soon announce', but we found out later on what the Minister had in mind. He said: You have got to be able to crawl before you can walk. This was after his Prime Minister had made that statement. He continued: As I have indicated before, there is insufficient terial available to this Government-and, I would argue, to any Government in the last 30 years-on which to make some sensible decisions because the lack of properly founded research. No doubt it would be quite easy, in four or five years time, to do such a blueprint going to 2000 and beyond. I do not know what the Prime Minister means by 'soon' but if when he opens his mouth and makes a promise that he. will soon do something he means that he will do it in four or five years' time, that ought to be made clear to the Australian people. It is obviously what his Minister had in mind in this area. Mr Jull-He said that the planes would fly by the end of September.",11
3,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"End of September? In four or five years' time we might solve the dispute. The question then is whether the Minister was aware of his Prime Minister's undertaking in relation to this matter to Ethnic Communities Council. The Minister was asked whether he had read the statement ment. Senator Durack said: Presumably you read it. Senator Ray replied: No, I have not read it. Senator Durack said: Anyway there is no special attention being given to this other than what we have been discussing generally, The Minister responded: Not right at this moment, but there may be in the Office of Multicultural Affairs or in the Prime Minister and Cabinet. If that is the way in which population policy is being dealt with in this country, it is in abysmal shambles. Clearly there is no coherhave ence and the Minister has no knowledge of what the Prime Minister has in mind. From their own statements there seems to be total inability of the Government and Minister to understand what is required in a population program. Clearly if the.Minister has in mind a target population of 25 million people his policy ought to be to call an end to immigration altogether. If that is what the Government has in mind after we get an election out of the way, then it ought to be made very clear. I suspect it is not. I suspect the Minister is matrying to be all things to all people. We need to know what resources will be devoted to developing this blueprint for 1989-90 and of what the Department is doing in relation to it. We need to know what the Government has in mind in relation to the research that the Department has already commissioned, particularly the Norman report on the Economic Effects of Immigration on Australia, which makes it very clear that it is in Australia's economic interests to have a higher level of migration than we have now. I have a number of other questions which I would like to address to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) and which he might like to answer. I will put them specifically in the context of this estimates debate. The Government recently announced a program dealing with the recognition of skills of overseas professionals who come to Australia. I ask the Minister: the Have any national standards of recognition of skills been promoted since the announceof the Government's program? What is, the Department's role, in this ongoing process? Have any recent competency-based assessments been established? If so, what are the results? Have only 30 additional job training places been established to meet the needs of the additional 7,000 migrants whose qualifications are not recognised this year? Will there be only 50 additional places next year? In what States and colleges will these 30 and 50 places be available? At what cost, and what staff will be required for prebowels of departure counselling and assessment-a matter referred to in the estimates information given to the Senate-as well as postan arrival counselling and referral? What steps been taken to achieve occupational deregulation in the professions, particularly law and medicine? Who, besides the chairman, a has been appointed to the new advisory comits mittees for the Government in this area? I have some questions for the Minister in relation to the recently announced camp clearance exercise for Indo-Chinese refugees. What is the projected impact of' the relaxed criteria that will apply to Indo-Chinese refugees on long term health and security costs for Australia? Are there any implications in possibly admitting to Australia-",12

5,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"Obviously, many issues in this area need to be raised. I thank you for your courtesy, Mr Deputy Chairman.",13
6,Mr JENKINS,Unknown,"This stage of the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) gives us an opportunity to look indepth at matters concerning each portfolio. Before commencing my remarks about the Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs portfolio, I draw to the Committee's attention the fact that because of the depth of information now given to us on budgetary matters we are able to have much more informed debates. During the committee stage of the debates I have referred often to Budget related Paper No.7. There are 19 volumesa volume for each portfolio. Speaking to the Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs portfolio, I must say that the people who prepared Budget-related Paper No. 7.9 should be congratulated. Compared to the papers for the rest of the portfolios, it provides information of a quality that I do not think can be equalled, the type of information that has arisen out of a shift to program budgeting. We have clearly defined roles for each of the programs, we have a description of the programs and, importantly, we have some discussion of performance and outcomes. That is what we are looking for. It is no use just describing programs if throughout the process we have no way of evaluating whether the program is meeting its stated objective. I turn briefly to the comments made by the honourable member for, Dundas (Mr Ruddock). As usual, he made a quite considered contribution to this debate. There are a couple of things that I would like to challenge which have gone a little bit over the top in the run-up to an election. I think the honourable member would have to acknowledge-he quite rightly states that there is a need for Australia to have a definite population policy-that until last year when the Bureau of Immigration Research was establishedno body had been set up to look at the matters that he' raised within the bureaucracy. At least the first step has been taken. Whilst he quite rightly wished to query when there might be some results from this research, the point is that it has commenced and it is being done in a coordinated manner, so there will be a result. The matters that he raised will be looked at and appropriate population policies will be put in place for Australia through to the next oentury. To suggest in this debate that there might be a clandestine move, after an election, to wind down the immigration policy is a furphy that is not worthy of being thrown into the debate. The year up to September was designated the Year of Citizenship. If one examines the explanatory notes one will see that that year was successful in its stated aim of encouraging more eligible people to take out citizenship. The figure available to us for the number of applications received in the last financial year was the greatest for any financial year: It indicates an increase of 54 per cent over the previous financial year and, on the basis of an analysis of expectations dependent upon the profile of the population, applications are up by some 35 per cent. That indicates that the program which the Government set out to put in place this year has been successful. In the last three weeks I have attended two citizenship ceremonies at which over 500 people took out Australian citizenship. In an electorate like mine, where 36 or 37 per cent of the population was born overseas, it is of great importance that people be encouraged to involve themselves in the wider community; to involve themselves,· through citizenship, in the development of Australia. The Government should be congratulated on the step it took this year-instituting the Year of Citizenship-to promote the benefits of citizenship and encourage our new arrivals to take on the responsibilities required when taking out citizenship. , I also want to speak about our post-arrival and ethnic affairs programs in this portfolio. There is a continuing debate on the definition of a post-arrival service. I have an electorate in which the bulk of those people who were born overseas come from longer standing ethnic communities-communities which came to Australia as part of the immediate post-war immigration program. They, quite rightly, have some concern that because our post-arrival services place an emphasis on those who have most recently arrived, they are in some way missing out. Because of past policy practices groups within those ethnic communities believe that they have missed out and have not got the type of support that they should have received. This is a dilemma. The Government has responsibility for an immigration program involving some 140,000 people, and should do its utmost to ensure that the expectations of those people are fulfilled and that they play their full in the Australian community. Therefore, it is quite right that an emphasis be placed on those groups most recently arrived, but there is also an obligation to look at the particular problems which face those communities which have been here for decades. I will take an example. In the area that I represent many of those people who came out in the post-war period were young people who had very few skills. They were welcomed into the burgeoning manufacturing industry in the area. They were able to fill those positions-predominantly unskilled positions-which it had been difficult to fill. Now, as we gear up to higher technology and a greater development of our manufacturing industry, many of those people find that the world is leaving them behind. They have no skills and they are out on the unemployment scrap heap. We are trying to encourage them back into the work force through a number of programs, but we meet one basic deficiency in them, a lack of language skills. They have that deficiency because when they first arrived here-this is not in any way some sort of partisan comment-perhaps we did not place enough emphasis on encouraging them to take English training or whatever was required to gather the appropriate communications skills. This is sad because at a time of record growth in employment and with opportunities appearing, there are disadvantaged groups within the community who cannot have equal access to those opportunities. I hope that through some of the measures that were announced with the multicultural agenda-an emphasis on English as a second language - raining and other such things-we will place some emphasis on the older communities which have been here for a longer time. Unless we do, a generation of 45 to 50-year-olds who still have time to make a contribution to the further development of Australia have been cut out. If we were to move towards a time when unemployment levels were such that we sustained a pool of unemployed, it would be very difficult to reintroduce such older people into the work force. It would be sad because of the dimensions of the flow-on to families. I hope we can address this problem further and that part we can widen our definition of post-arrival services and our commitment to a range of migrants in all aspects of their lives.",13

8,Mr ALDRED,Unknown,"Over $277m has been appropriated for the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in financial year 1989-90, a significant increase over last year's expenditure of $230.4m. In my consideration of Appropriation Bill (No.1) I wish to concentrate my remarks on migrants and in particular the migrants from the geographical area known as Yugoslavia. Over recent months there has been a great deal of media coverage regarding the activities of a foreign intelligence service operating within the Australian Yugoslav emigre community. That service is the Yugoslav secret service, otherwise known as the SDB. The House will be aware that the Yugoslav Federation has for some time been experiencing enormous domestic problems. The latest evidence of this was the recent passing of legislation by the Slovenian provincial parliament allowing that region to secede from the Federation if it so chooses. The Yugoslav Federal Government vigorously denounced this attempt by Slovenians to remove themselves from the Federation of Yugoslavia. It is a fact that the Yugoslav Government has chosen to lay the blame for the upsurge in its domestic troubles firmly at the door of what it refers to as the overseas Yugoslav dissident community. As a result there has been a significant increase in the level of Yugoslav secret service operations abroad to counter this perceived threat. Perhaps the best illustration I can use is the attempted assassination on 20 October 1988 by a senior officer of the SDB, Vinko Sindicic, of Mr Nikola Stedul, a Croatian now resident in the United Kingdom. In fact, it is alleged that Sindicic is well known to Australian authorities as he has visited this country to carry out operations against Australian citizens. Australia has become a playground for the Yugoslav secret service. They are seemingly able to come and go and do as they please with impunity. Lest there be any doubt that the Yugoslav secret service covertly, and without sanction from the Australian Government, collects intelligence on Australian citizens, I will relate to the House some experiences that have been recounted to me. Former citizens of Yugoslavia who are now citizens of Australia have found when they returned to Yugoslavia to visit relatives that they were pulled aside at Belgrade Airport for questioning by the SDB. In all the accounts I have heard, people have said the same thing, namely, that they were extremely surprised at the extraordinary amount of information on them that the SDB interviewing officers already possessed. Photographs taken in Melbourne were also shown to the individuals being questioned. Furthermore, the same people and others have recounted how, when they have fronted up to the Yugoslav Consulate-General in Melbourne to be interviewed for the issue of a visa, they have discovered that the Consulate already has very detailed information on them. This particularly seems to apply· to visa applicants who have been active in local ethnic organisations, especially those with links to the Croatian cause. These accounts would seem to lend credence to the allegations that there is a surreptitious involvement of the Yugoslav secret service in a number of Australianbased Yugoslav and Croatian ethnic organisations. There are in Australia quite a number of these organisations, many of which do much valuable work in their respective communities. Indeed, many have officebearers of great dedication and goodwill to the ethnic community concerned and to Australia. This would be true for instance of the HOP, the Croatian liberation movement. The problem lies not with the overwhelmingly decent majority of ethnic Yugoslavs and Croatians, who constitute the membership of these organisations, but with the manipulative efforts of the Yugoslav Government through its Australian-based agents and informers. Nearly four weeks ago in this place I referred to the fact that the records of the Yugoslav Welfare Association based at Fitzroy in Melbourne had ended up in the hands of the SDB in Belgrade. I am advised by my sources in the Yugoslav community that these records are an invaluable asset to the Belgrade authorities in building up their database on Australian residents. The question of just how these records ended up in Yugoslavia has yet to be addressed by the Government. It is not good enough to say, as one Government member has already said, that the files of the Yugoslav Welfare Association contain only details of welfare cases. The mere fact that such files on Australian individuals can end up in SDB hands in Belgrade, or anywhere else for that matter, has to be of the deepest concern. Every member of this House knows from his or her own constituent work how much detail can emerge on individuals when assisting them to solve their particular welfare problems. I refer honourable members to· my speech on 5 September last, recorded in Hansard on page 924, and to the reported comments of Mr Jim Duncan, Australia's Second Secretary at our Belgrade Embassy. A further concern is the number, however small, of Australian individuals who cooperate with the Yugoslav secret service in its efforts to suborn Australian nationals and residents. Any individual who has cooperated with the Yugoslav secret service without the knowledge of the Australian Government has betrayed the national interest of Australia. Pressure can also be applied in the interest of Yugoslavia by other means and in other situations as well. In my speech on this matter on 5 September last I referred to one of the Yugoslav secret service's particularly well placed informers, who attempted to use his influence to block the application for permanent residency of the Yugoslav-born leader of the Footscray branch of the Islamic Society of Victoria, Imam Azam Efindira. I am informed that Imam Efindira authorised a freedom of information request to be submitted to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in an effort to find out exactly what was going on in relation to his case. It seems that the Department considered part of the files on the imam as too sensitive to release and they were, therefore, not released. The imam's file number is V85/11466. Folios 35, 36 and 46 were withheld from him completely and folios 37, 38 and 39 were released in part only. The prevailing view is that the file documents withheld from the imam directly concern the well placed SDB informer and have been withheld for this reason, and that any departmental story to the contrary is exactly that-a story. In the public interest, I call on the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) to immediately release to the imam the documents his Department has withheld. I further call on the Minister to advise the Parliament whether any of the folio documents withheld in full or in part relate to a Federal Labor member of this House. That concludes my comments on this matter for the moment.",14
9,Mr KENT,Unknown,"It is always interesting to follow the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred), who sat down with a look of glee on his face because he managed, yet again, to character assassinate people. That is his usual form in this chamber. I am not alone in finishing up as being implicated as an informer. The character on the other side thinks· that just because he was born in Melbourne he has some advantage over me as I was born overseas. It is true that he was born in Melbourne, but at the time of his birth the doctors were horrified when they noticed out of which aperture of his mother's body he emerged. Mr Ruddock- Mr Chairman, I rise on a point of order. When you read the transcript you will see that it is quite inappropriate to describe honourable members in the way in which the honourable member is seeking to describe the honourable member for Bruce. Having regard to the proper decorum of this House you have some responsibility in this matter.",16
10,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Mr Hollis) ,-Although I was listening very carefully I did not quite catch what the honourable member said. He should refer to other members by their electorates. If the honourable member for Bruce found it offensive, I ask the honourable member for Hotham to withdraw that comment.",16
11,Mr KENT,Unknown,"What comes out of that place is very difficult to withdraw, but I withdraw without any qualification. Notwithstanding all that, he managed to grow into mediocrity. He certainly took a great interest in immigration. Since he has migrated from one seat to another, he has some experience. He appeared in this House by some chance or accident as a mediocrity back in the 1970s as the honourable member for Henty. I believe that the people in Henty did not want him here; they tossed him out. He reappeared as the honourable member for Bruce after Sir Billy Snedden's resignation from Parliament. He is now attempting to try his luck in the seat of Deakin because the people of Bruce, or his Party, do not want him in that electorate. As I said, the characteristic of the mediocre is that they cannot stand excellence or success. They come out and attack just about everybody under privilege of this chamberand that is what the honourable member did. He accused high ranking officers of the Royal Australian Navy of some collusion and graft on the submarine contracts. He accused the former mayor of a city of some terrorist activities. He has accused no less a person than the late Justice Murphy of running organised crime in Australia. He was paranoid about the Soviet fishing fleet spying on his electorate. I wonder which electorateHenty, Bruce or Deakin? I suppose whichever one he was in at the time. He was also paranoid about the Yugoslav community. I can tell the honourable member that the Yugoslav community is a good community. It is the third largest community in Australia from a non-English speaking background. I will always defend that community because its members worked very hard to make Australia what it is. As far as challenging the loyalties of people who come from Yugoslavia is concerned, those opposite did not speak up against the Yugoslavs when they were rescuing Allied airmen during the Second World War. Villagers were shot by Germans, as hostages, because of the actions of the Yugoslav people. They did not talk about that whatsoever. Mr Aldred- Mr Deputy Chairman, 1I have two points of order. Standing order 145 requires that remarks in a debate be relevant. The honourable member seems to be straying considerably from relevance in this matter. The second point of order is that he has misconstrued my earlier comments. 1 did not cast any aspersions upon the loyalty of the overwhelming bulk of the Yugoslav community here in Australia.",16
12,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"As 1 understand it, standing order 145 refers to questions. There is no point of order.",17
13,Mr KENT,Unknown,"The honourable member comes in here and says 'some have recounted to me', 'others have said', 'I was led to believe', 'I got information from sources'. If the honourable member for Bruce has any information about the improper dealings of the social workers with the Yugoslav Welfare Association, who work very hard to help their community, he should go to the law enforcement authorities and not speak under privilege in his coward's castle from where he can attack and smear people. But that is the usual style which we can expect from him. The honourable member says, 'Files ended up in the hands of the SOB'. 1 do not even know what the SOB is. Has the honourable member any source of information that anything improper was done by anybody, such as a highly placed informer? Does he mean that an Australian Labor Party backbencher, the only one who has come into this chamber through being elected as an adult migrant-that is me-is not loyal to this country? If that is what the honourable member means to say, why does he not come outside and say so? Mr Aldred- Mr Deputy Chairman, I rise on a point of order.",17
14,Mr KENT,Unknown,"Listen, 1 let you speak, you arsehole. You sit down and listen to me.",17
15,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order! The honourable member for Hotham will resume his seat for the moment. Mr Aldred-I take it from the reflection that the honourable member for Hotham made on my earlier remarks-which 1 take objection to-that he is not denying that the records of the Yugoslav Welfare Association have ended up in the hands of the SOB in Belgrade.,17
16,Mr KENT,Unknown,"Sit down, you turd.",17
17,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Let us deal with one point of order at a time. The honourable member for Hotham will resume his seat. As 1 understand it, that is not a point of order, but I warn the honourable member for Hotham that if he wishes to attack the honourable member for Bruce he should do so-as he well knows from his experience in the chamber-by substantive order and not in this part of the debate. Mr Lamb- Mr Deputy Chairman, 1 raise a point of order. The interjection by the honourable member for Bruce is really perpetuating the debate and not raising a point of order and it does no justice to him. It actually decries the level of debate in this chamber.",17
18,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I ruled that the honourable member for Bruce had no point of order. I ask the honourable member for Hotham to confine his comments to the Appropriation Bill now before the Committee.,17
19,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Chairman, 1 want to make a very simple point. The honourable member for Bruce has taken a number of points of order which he knows are not points of order and which have been ruled out of order. The honourable member for Bruce, in making his statement to the Committee, was happy to say that anyone who provided information to Yugoslav authorities was a traitor to Australia. He then went on to refer to, and sat down on the basis that such a person was, an unnamed member of the Australian Labor Party. If the honourable gentleman wants to dish it out he has to be prepared to tai<:.e it and not try to cover the kind of scurrilous allegation that he has made by taking false points of order. 1 draw your attention to that section of the Standing Orders which deals with members abusing the Standing Orders in the way in which the honourable member for Bruce has done. Mr Aldred-There has been no abuse of the Standing Orders by me but there has been by the honourable member for Hotham.",17
20,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The plan of honourable member for Bruce will resume his seat. Mr KENTI am entitled to have my say and I am going to say what I want to say. I will not be attacked by that turd over there just because I was born overseas.,18
21,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The to Australia honourable member for Hotham will resume his seat. Let me respond to the point that the Minister has made. If the honourable member for Bruce has a further point of order. I will deal with it then. As I underand stand it the concluding remarks of the countries honourable member for Bruce did not name an honourable member of this chamber; he made a general reference to him. As I listhose. tened to what he said then I felt that that was in order in that he made only a general reference to the point. Mr Aldred- Mr Deputy Chairman, I ask that the last remarks of the honourable member for Hotham be withdrawn as the language used was totally unparliamentary.",18
22,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,There were activities about three or four members trying to raise points of order at the same time; so I not hear what the honourable member for Hotham said. I was trying to hear four points of order at the one time. I do not know what he said. If the honourable member for Hotham would withdraw the remark that claimed to be unparliamentary in the statemoney ment that he made when I was listening to those points of order it would be appreciated by the Chair.,18
23,Mr KENT,Unknown,I do not think I made any comment which would not apply to the honourable member for Bruce.,18
24,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,It would representations. assist the Chair if the honourable member for Hotham withdrew the remarks.,18
25,Mr KENT,Unknown,"In deference to you, Mr overstayers-to Chairman, I withdraw.",18
26,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order! The actual honourable member's time has expired.,18
27,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"1 take the opportunity in this debate on Appropricompliance ation Bill (No.1) to raise some further queschanges tions. Unfortunately, I was not able to put them in the time that I had previously. I was asking a question about the comprehensive action relating to Indo-Chinese refugees. I had asked the Minister in relation to the camp clearance exercise what the projected impact of relaxed criteria on long term health and social security costs was for Australia and whether any estimate had been made of those costs. I also wanted to know whether there were implications in admitting individuals who may have been excluded previously because of adverse security assessments. Is there any estimate of the numbers of people who may have been the subject of an adverse security assessment who may be seeking admission to third such as Australia? If it is intended to exclude those with adverse security assessments, what will be the long term fate of people if they are rejected? In other words, will there still be people in camps in Indo-China who will not be taken by any nation? I also want to ask some questions in relation to the apprehension of illegal immigrants. What efforts have been taken to use the existing provisions for controlling the of immigration agents? Will the Government be relying on clients only to did seek redress under amendments to the Immigration Act or to use consumer protection law? I raise that question relating to agents in the context of illegal immigration because of the large number of complaints that are is now coming to notice of large amounts of being paid to individuals holding themselves out to assist people with applications for change of status. The distinct· probability is that those people holding themselves out to assist are not able to do so and very large amounts of money are being lost to individuals because of those It seems that, notwithstanding an increase in the numbers of illegal immigrants located, in the estimates there was still a net increase in the number of 80,000. When will this problem be seriously addressed and when are the numbers expected to decrease? I would like to know what percentage of the Department's budget and officers are engaged in work and how these percentage have varied in recent years. 1 would also like to know the average number of illegal stayers iQvestigated and sent home per case officer. I have some other questions in the area of health that I would like the Minister to address. In the Senate Estimates Committee E reference was made to the National Committee on Health Screening of Migrants and Refugees. Some of my colleagues sought advice from the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) as to the way in which that Committee's recommendations had been dealt with by the Department. I noted, rather , interestingly, in the discussion that Senator Robert Ray was of the view that that Committee dealt only with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), but the fact is that that Committee has a much wider responsibility than just screening intending migrants who may be suffering from AIDS. Senator Durack made that clear. He said: If it is about the health screening of migrants. I it is mainly AIDS but I gather it is looking also at hepatitis Band TB as well as AIDS. Mr Harris was then brought into answer some further questions in that matter, but again his comments were primarily in relation to the recently announced changes by the Government in the AIDS area. Senator Durack asked him: You say you have already had recommendations which you are implementing. There is no new development? Mr Harris said: Apart from AIDS and the testing of all migrants for the HIV there is no change in our health determinations, which we do with the Department of Community Services and Health. He asked: And you have not received any recent recommendations . . .? Mr Harris said: Just the AIDS one which was published July or August. The transcript continues:",18
28,Senator DURACK,Unknown,"There is no other ongoing investigation of the health screening of migrants that you know of? Mr Harris-Not to my knowledge, no. I want to put on the record that arising from that meeting back in October quite substantive recommendations were made. I will not go through all the preamble to the consideration of those issues. Resolution 1 from the Committee was: The Committee considers that all pregnant women, migrants and refugee, and all children being adopted from overseas should be screened for Hepatitis B as part of their pre-migration health screening. I would like to know what has happened in relation to that matter. Resolution 2 was: The committee considers that state and national data collections on tuberculosis incidence and prevalence are inadequate for effective monitoring of the situation and calls upon the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health to take the lead in improving the collection, analysis and distribution of tuberculosis data as a matter of high priority and allocate appropriate resources to this task. The Communicable Diseases Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council should be requested to monitor tuberculosis in Australia. I would like to know what has happened in relation to that. The third resolution was: The current pre-migration screening for tuberculosis guess and other diseases should continue and the problems identified through this process managed appropriately. Selective post-migration screening should be carried out where indicated. Resolution 4 was: That the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs examine mechanisms for notifying State health authorities of the arrival of all migrants and refugees in their respective areas of responsibility so that health care needs can be met and public health issues resolved. The final resolution was that the Department: examine ways of encouraging all migrants and refugees to bring with them to Australia all personally held medical information e.g. immunisation cards. These matters of health are of the utmost concern and have come to my notice because there is a concern amongst health professionals that these matters are not being properly addressed. I would like to know what has happened specifically in relation to each of in those recommendations. Finally, I would like to ask the' Minister to deal with some administrative and support matters. I would like to know what the reason is for a 244 per cent increase in property operating expenses, capital, that was referred to in the estimates. I would also like to know why, in view of the significant drop in the level of ministerial correspondence, there has not been reflected in operating expenses a reduction in the amount of money spent in that particular area - Order! There was only one other matter I wanted to raise, which has been of considerable concern to me. It is in relation to the Government's decision relating to Imam Sheikh Al Hilaly of Sydney. While I had no complaint, and I still have no complaint, that the Minister determined to leave the imam on licence, he had a number of options. He was asked to grant him permanent residency. I think it was appropriate that that decision should have been adverse because of events in Sydney involving the Jewish community in particular and other information that was before the Minister in the report that was before him. While I might have made a different decision in relation to this matter, I have no complaint about the imam being left on licence. I am very concerned and I continue to remain concerned that the Minister determined to consider separately the case of the imam's wife and children. It is my view that the Minister, having· determined to consider their status separately, puts both himself and any possible successor in an impossible position if a view is formed at a later time that the imam should leave Australia and the Minister had in the meantime granted his wife and two children, who do not have it, permanent residence in Australia. There is no justification in my view for considering Mrs Hilaly's case in isolation from her husband's. I regard it as being outside policy guidelines and setting a dangerous precedent not to consider the family unit as a whole. I believe that the Minister must announce quickly that Mrs Hilaly will be given a 12month extension on the same basis as her husband and that her situation and that of her children be considered at the same time. If the Minister does not take that view, I think he is undermining the whole credibility of the immigration program, particularly applications for change of status. Individual family members should not be considered in isolation. If they are, we will be faced with situations continually where there will be the possibility of families being divided by decisions taken in isolation. Clearly this is an important matter and it needs to be resolved quickly and positively by the Minister.",19
29,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Mr Hollis) The honourable member's time has expired.,20
30,Mr LAMB,Unknown,"1 take this opportunity to enter the committee debate on the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. These three areas all come together in the citizenship ceremonies that take place through local government within our electorates. I want to make a few comments on that subject, but I also want to take the opportunity to reply to an article which appeared in the Croydon and Ringwood Mail last Wednesday, 27 September. Under the headline 'Pollies rebuked. for indifference', the article reads: A Croydon resident, Mr Alexander Wright, has criticised the State and Federal Governments for not taking the 1989 Year of Citizenship seriously. Mr Wright said he recently attended a City of Ringwood citizenship ceremony where not one of the invited politicians 'bothered' to turn up. Over 100 people were there. The article continues: Mr Wright said it was unfortunate that these enthusiastic people, who were all proud to become Australians, were not even acknowledged by a Government representative. He claimed the guest list included Federal Government members Robert Halverson, John Saunderson and Tony Lamb, and State members, George Cox, Kay Setches and Rosemary Varty. I think Mr Wright misunderstands the role of members of parliament at citizenship ceremonies and possibly the role of parliamentarians themselves, because he added: 'None of these people turned up and while they all sent apologies, I think the effort was disgusting.' 'At least they could have had the courtesy to send a representative on their behalf.' If Mr Wright and the newspaper before printing that one-sided article had bothered to check with the office of the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), with me or with the Ringwood Council, they would have realised that 7 September was a day on which the State and the Federal parliaments were sitting and that my good colleague the honourable member for Casey and I were carrying out the No. 1 responsibility of a parliamentarian, which is to attend to parliamentary duties in the House when it is sitting. I do not think there is any need to explain further that we had a very good excuse. I also remind Mr Wright that another duty which parliamentarians are elected to carry out is to look after the complaints, the grievances, of constituents. These often involve migrants approaching us for advice on how to become citizens and other things. I remind Mr Wright that it is not normal to send a representative to these citizenship functions. I think I speak for nearly every member of this House when I say that members of parliament take this particular function, this particular responsibility, most seriously. Most of us enjoy going to citizenship ceremonies because we know, as Mr Wright correctly puts it, that here we have enthusiastic people who are proud to become Australians. That is acknowledged, and we wish to be part of that ceremony. I am quite proud that, whenever I am able and other duties do not prevent me from attending, I go along to citizenship ceremonies or other ceremonies involving the ethnic community. I was fortunate enough to be selected by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to represent him at the laying of the foundation stone of the Greek-Australian community at its Nunawading cultural centre. There I was able to extend on behalf of the Prime Minister fraternal greetings and messages of congratulations and encouragement to the GreekAustralian community. It is important to remind Mr Wright and others just why some parliamentarians are not able to go to all functions. If I had attended that particular ceremony or, indeed, if Mr Wright had been able to attend the citizenship ceremony that I attended at Croydon last week, he would have heard at first hand about the role of parliamentarians. I said the normal thing on behalf of the Prime Minister. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, welcomed and congratulated the new citizens. I made comments on immigration and general matters in the citizenship ceremony itself.. I pointed out that this Government denounces racism as a criterion for selecting migrants to this country. When one sees children playing quite happily with 30 or 40 children of different ethnic backgrounds in a playground pr sharing studies at school, one is reminded that racism. is not a natural thing. Territorialism might be, but not racism. In fact, children get racist ideas eventually from adults. They get them from bigots and from people who are ignorant. Ignorance is the basis of racism, lack of familiarity with other ways of life and culture. Racism is a lack of recognition of why migrants come to this country. They usually come for family reunions or through flight. In other words, they come as refugees from intolerable situations in their former countries. They come here to build a new future. We should be asking not where migrants to this country come from but how many Australia can sustain. I complimerit the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) for introducing this aspect into the debate. Australia must eventually come to grips with what is an optimum population. We have very ancient soils here, a fragile environment and limited water. There is a limit to the number of people that can be sustained in Australia with an adequate, healthy lifestyle. I was disappointed with the honourable member for Dundas for introducing politics into the debate. In other words he tried to make political points in what should be essentially a bipartisan approach. He said that immediately after the election the Government was somehow going to stop immigration. The point is this: What is an ideal or optimum population for Australia? Let us get away from racism. I am not accusing the honourable member for Dundas of that. In fact, his record is quite the opposite, in contrast to others in the Opposition. I join with the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), who made the point that, instead of trying to make cheap political points, we should get to grips with what is an optimum population for Australia in a bipartisan, objective way. The honourable member for Dundas mentioned that some academics have said that 25 million was an optimum population. Perhaps it is 30 million. Who knows? I do not think we know. That figure has been bandied around for some time. More work should be done on this matter to find out what is an optimum figure. Mr Wright would have heard me make comments at the citizenship ceremony last week about multiculturalism. We have an enriched society through people coming from varied backgrounds. All migrants to this country come from varied backgrounds, they have different pasts to our own, but we all face a common future. If we realise that we all have a common future within a parliamentary democratic tradition, within the laws of this country, then we will have a better society. I strongly support the idea of multiculturalism, particularly in that important transition period where migrants to this country may be leaving behind the environment of a culture that is familiar to them and coming into a fairly unfamiliar culture and social environment. Those who oppose multiculturalism and want to see some form of 'forced' integration or 'forced' assimilation are actually forcing new migrants together in ghetto situations. It is only when we become familiar with and find out about other ways of living, other cultures, only when we talk about encouraging them to learn English through the English as a second language program, only when we realise that after migration our job starts as well as that of the migrants to become 'Australianised' without losing their culture, that we will have a country that is free of the friction that comes through ignorance. I think we have had a very successful Year of Citizenship, contrary to what Mr Wright has said. Over 130 people took out citizenship at Croydon last week when they usually have 20 to 30. I think that is an indication that we will see a record number of new citizens when we finally find out how many took out citizenship in the Year of Citizenship, which ended just a few days ago. Finally, I want to thank all local government councils, especially Ringwood, Nunawading, Croydon and Lillydale, for putting up a great effort at the citizenship ceremonies, providing Australian music and decor and Australian warmth and cordiality. The local governments and Federal Government have jointed well together in the Year of Citizenship to welcome more migrants and encourage them to take out Australian citizenship.",20
31,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown," Just before the honourable member for Hotham commences, I would caution him about standing order 79 and ask him to direct his remarks through the Chair and to the appropriations.",22
32,Mr KENT,Unknown,"1 will come to the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1989-90 and apologise if I had an outburst or two. I have had some time to calm down. Honourable members must understand my p.osition. Time and again at each election-and I have had four elections-unknown people have come and thrown paint on my office or written that I am an agent of UDBA, whatever that is, a communist and so on. I have photographs of that. Those sources 'led' some people on the other side 'to believe' that I have been giving information and that some files of the Australian Yugoslav Welfare Agency went hither and thither. I can assure this House, as I assured the Leader of the  Welfare Agency, of which I am the Chairman, is a welfare agency which deals only with people who come in voluntarily. The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs knows very well the activities of the Yugoslav Welfare Agency because it provides grants and keeps a close eye on where the money goes-at least, I hope so, and I am sure it does. The activities. of the Agency are purely welfare activities. Not so much as a single file has been taken out of the Agency. Some people come in for. their pension, and their names are there. In a speech here in the House-and later personally and in a letter I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition-I invited him or his nominee to come to the Agency. At any time. I can arrange for him to inspect every file-there are thousandsor pick out one at random to see whether anything untoward in those files can be used by any foreign agent whatsoever. We get lunatic accusations that somehow, somewhere, someone is 'led to believe' something, but the honourable member has never said who led him to believe. Honourable members can understand that at election times the dirty tricks bag is open-whether it is painting on the walls of my office or Jther violence, the destruction of property or the destruction of character under privilege. The election is coming up. I wonder why I am the target of such remarks. I am the only member of the House who came here as an adult migrant from a non-English speaking country. In 1948 I left my country in Europe-Yugoslavia-where I was born and raised. I went to Israel, where I lived until 1954. I came here and have lived here since then. I have been endorsed four times by the people in my electorate. I did not migrate to the electorate; I have lived there for decades. People know me there. Four times we have thrashed our opponents. Of course, that may hurt some with mediocrity. If they cannot beat me in a reasonable political fight in elections, such people try. to character assassinate me. They say that they are 'led to believe'-and that comes from the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhoodthat Lewis Kent may have done something untoward and that he is not quite loyal to this country. Let me again establish my credentials. My parents are buried in my electorate. I have lived here for 35 years and have worked in my Party. I am quite well known. I have been elected four times as the member for Hotham and I am looking forward to thrashing my opponents in Corinella again, for the fifth time, in the next election. My grandchildren are growing up here. What loyalties would I have? What loyalties would a migrant who has lived here for a generation have? Those people who are trying to suggest that I just came here yesterday and have no right to represent people who have been here three or four generations do not give the same consideration to the length of residence or number of generations of those who came 40,000 years ago. They are opposed to them. But they cannot have it both ways. If we apply merit to when or where people were born or how many generations their families have been in Australia, merit must also go to those who have lived here for 40,000 years. Yet some people do not want to acknowledge that. I want to finish up with something personal about the contribution that migrants can make to this country. An article in yesterday's Age newspaper by an arts critic, on jazz, at the Spoleto Festival, said: Also at the Festival Club were the young Australian Jazz Ambassadors, a sextet designed to showcase promising talents From each state. I especially enjoyed 16-year-old Simon Kent's robust, confident trombone playing . . . Simon Kent is my grandson. I believe that he will do better than that mediocrity over there.",22
33,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports-Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories) (11.08) - I thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate. The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), raised a large number of questions, many of which would probably have been more appropriately placed as questions on notice but I can understand his anxiety to get answers more quickly than would be possible in that case. I will deal with a number of those items very quickly and generally but I will undertake to examine the Hansard and, if they need fuller answers, I will take the matter up with the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) so that the honourable member has his concerns addressed. In respect of the matter raised by the shadow Minister in relation to Sheikh Al Hilaly, the Minister discussed that decision at length in the Senate Estimates Committee and I commend the detail of that reasoning to the honourable gentleman. In respect of health screenings, as the honourable member would be aware, it is a complex matter to decide at what point one begins and at what point one ends. Recommendations from the health committee will be considered. Health screenings are kept under review continually by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and its health advisers. If the honourable gentleman believes that some aspects of the process could be improved I invite him to make those suggestions to the Minister. The question of overstayers has been addressed at some length in a new Act and the powers which the Minister for Immigration will have to allow for mandatory deportations will deal with the problem of overstayers. On the question of camp clearance, the selection process has only just commenced. Selection will be on a case by case basis. Any disability will be balanced against Australia's best interests and the need for resettlement. I propose to deal with only one other matter very quickly. It is regrettable that there should be raised in this House divisive issues which have long created difficulties for Yugoslav settlers in Australia. I do not believe that the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) does himself or his cause any justice by saying that unnamed persons with quite unspecific allegations are worthy of quotation. All honourable members have been in situations where constituents have come to them. with allegations that are little more than scuttlebutt. To repeat that scuttlebutt in this Parliament does not add to its veracity; it simply' reflects on the person who raises it. I understand the honourable gentleman gets a bit excited every time he sees a J ames Bond movie and perhaps might like to be a spook, but at best he can qualify to be a spook's spook. He does not do himself any justice at all when he comes in here, repeats a series of allegations, and then says in his final sentence that anybody providing information to an overseas security service is virtually guilty of treacherous behaviour towards Australia. He then sits down having made that attribution to an unnamed member of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party. If the honourable gentleman seriously believes that any member of this House is in that position, there are processes available to him within the Standing Orders of this House. I think it is regrettable that this debate has unfortunately been marred in the past by attitudes towards immigration. We had a very unfortunate period when the whole question of multiculturalism was raised. Fortunately, new approaches now prevail, I think, within the Opposition. There are important questions to be raised in the whole area of immigration. I believe that the shadow Minister for. immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas, has raised a number of those questions. I hope that those concerns, which are genuine, can be answered. I simply say that no section of the migrant community and no section of this Parliament will be served by the kind of wretched, unspecified allegations which might serve the fantasies of the honourable gentleman but which do not add in any wayMr Aldred- Mr Deputy Chairman, I raise a point of order. The Minister's remarks misrepresent what I said. My allegations were quite specific. I would like to know what he intends to do about them.",23
34,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, There is no point of order. Has the Minister concluded?,24
35,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"I will conclude by saying that if the honourable gentleman believes that he has any kind of evidence-I am talking about evidence, not about the kind of scuttlebutt that he threw around this Parliament. Frankly, I am as sick of it as his colleagues are sick of it, and I have no intention of responding to the fantasies of the honourable gentleman. Mr Aldred-I made a quite specific reference, among other things, to a particular file. I would like to know the Minister's response to my remarks on that particular file and those folio numbers.",24

37,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"The Apdeeper propriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill seeks approval for the expenditure of the parliamentary departments which service the Senate and the House of Representatives. Those departments include the Joint House Department, the Department of the of Representatives and the Department of the Senate, as well as, I believe now, more appropriately, a department which provides the essential services of the Parliamentary Library and Hansard reporting under the auspices of the Joint House Department, In fact, it is only recently that Hansard and Library became part of the function of a larger and, some would say, mega-departnow ment, in terms of recent history, anywayrecent Joint House Department. I want to comment briefly on one or areas of difficulties facing the Joint House Department and its operating wings consequences of government control of the purse strings for the proper operation of Parliament. Last year the House considered a major rearrangement of the administrative structure of the parliamentary departments, which I have briefly referred to. At the I expressed reservations about the effectiveleged ness of those changes. I did so in the context of a lack of knowledge as to the deliberations made by the Presiding Officers and presumment, ably by their senior staff. My experience with management theory and practice before I came into this place left me with an impression that to go from five operating departments to three by absorbing two of those departments into the larger Joint House Department seemed to be bad management practice. I was taught when I was learning manifested. management-at the time. I was also a manager-that four or five operating departhave ments reporting to a manager was probably the ideal. To reduce it to three seemed me to be courting problems and maybe in certain circumstances even a mild form of disaster, it there is such a thing. As it out, in my opinion there seems to be little evidence of any improvement in the adminin istration, but again I accept that that might be due to a lack of detailed knowledge and not being in a position to observe the opersard ations first hand. The truth is that despite the changes that were made last year, there is evidence that problems exist which have roots and which constant structural changes, if they are under contemplation, will not necessarily address. The possible remedies to the problems encountered in this place, as elsewhere in any large organisation, are often more straightforward than embarkHouse ing upon structural change. The problem I want to canvass is the continuing difficulty in attracting staff to the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, Hansard, or, alternatively, preventing the loss of staff, as I understand it, by recruitment by the various State parliaments. the Although this problem facing the reporting staff has been with us for some time, it is quite acute. That is evidenced by the announcement by the Speaker that Hansard reports of proceedings in the House two have to be made, for a certain period at least, from a tape recording of those proand the ceedings on alternate days. I do not doubt that the Speaker and the the President are trying to come to grips with the problem by providing, I hope, adequate money, if that is what is required, and by giving support to the very high quality H antime, sard reporters whom we have been privito retain. The demands on Hansard reporting staff have increased with the increased number of committees of the Parliamany of which travel extensively and which must be accompanied by people from the small pool of Commonwealth parliamentary reporters. Add to that the fact that some of those committees sit concurrently with proceedings in this place and in the Senate, and one starts to understand the dimension of the problem and how it is Again I am only following my nose and no hard evidence, but it stands to reason that if a committee of the Parliament is to meeting, Hansard must give priority to it, perhaps even over and above proceedings in this place, because of the nature of committurns tee proceedings. Anyone who has served on a committee-and I am sure that everyone this place has-will understand that the proceedings are quite often less structured than proceedings in the chambers, so Hanhas to be there to identify the speakers and properly record the proceedings. Proceedings are a little more straightforward in this place because of the Standing Orders which are rigorously applied. Quite often, that situation does not apply in committees. This all seems to be evidence of contempt-if not intended-by the present Government for this Parliament. The Government has used Parliament as a public relations tool, filibustering through Question Time and the early weeks of each parliamentary session, thereby leaving significant, troversial legislation to be debated under the pressure of the guillotine during the final sittings of the year. It is not only we in place who have to come to grips with that problem; the parliamentary reporting staff are also affected. The number of parliamentary sitting days has decreased, but we are sitting later at night while the Government forces through its legislation which, in many cases, it would rather not debate. That has put increasing pressure on the staff and officers of the Parliament. It is easy to overlook the fact that the extra words which members speak during a long sitting day can double the volume of work to be done by Hansard staff in the time before proof copies of Hansard are available-the next day, in most cases. There should be a proper opportunity for the Parliament to oversee the Executive through a better planned legislative program, which would offer members the time to consider and debate important legislation, and would also improve the efficiency of staff who ice the Parliament. It is also an important feature of maintaining the health of democratic government in this country. I want to dwell briefly on sitting hours. Some years ago, but certainly in the life of this Government, at the instigation of a few new and experienced members, we decided on a different sitting pattern. There is more than a suggestion that this sitting pattern is not as efficient as the previous one. That, also, is dependent on the willingness of the Government to allow the Parliament to sit to fully debate legislation, not under the guillotine. Again, a manifestation of these changed sitting hours is the pressure put on I staff. I am not suggesting that if one looked back one could not find outstanding examples of the Parliament sitting all night. I can well remember getting home from the Senate at 5 o'clock one morning, having sat through an arduous 16or 18-hour sitting. It seems to me that the Government, in its anxiety to get the Parliament up and out of the way so that it can get on with· the business of running the country, overlooks the strains it is putting on the staff of the Parliament-in this context, the Hansard staff-as well as on members and senators. The consequence of all this is that parliaconmentary scrutiny has declined because, to a large extent, the Executive and Ministers of the incumbent government control the prothis gram of the Parliament and the resources available to it. A good case study of this problem, which applies to all important institutions of Parliament, is probably the work of the Australian Audit Office. The Auditor General is responsible to the Parliament for the detailed validation of the proper procedures for the expenditure of funds which this Bill, and previous Appropriations Bills, determine. It does this through both financial and efficiency audits. Although the Auditor General is responsible to the Parliament alone, the Parliament does not control the funds. We all know the old adage that he who has the gold rules, and that is the case with the Auditor-General. I am not sure whether he would agree with me, but, in my opinion, he is precluded from doing his valu- . able work by the apportionment of funds. But the body to which he is responsible does not control those funds; it is an arm of serv- government. My argument-and I am sure this is not the first time it has been mounted, although I cannot remember anyone ever raising it during my 11 or 12 years here-is that the Parliament should control the funds to be appropriated for the use of the Auditor General. In the past, the Audit Office has exposed major administrative deficiencies in a number of Commonwealth instrumentalities and departments. The administrative problems of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) come to mind. The ATO did not take kindly to the trenchant criticisms made by the Audit Office after a series of efficiency audits-too few, in my opinion. Government agencies increasingly are trying to use private sector auditors who are not accountable to this Parliament so as to minimise scrutiny by the Parliament. A recent report by the Public Accounts Committee noted that if the Audit Office were to undertake an efficiency audit of all large government programs, it would examine each program every 40 years, if present resources are not increased. That is a stark indication of the capacity of the Auditor-General-a very important cog in the wheel, a very important part of the mechanism of checks and balances-who, although responsible to Parliament, continues to be financed at the whim of the Executive. This illustrates the magnitude of the problems facing Parliament in performing its obligations to the taxpayers of Australia. This year the Federal Government will spend some $87 billion, representing about 25 per cent of gross domestic product. Honourable members opposite are not particularly interested in making life difficult for their party. Indeed, whether it is on Senate Estimates committees or asking dorothy dix questions in this House, they all too often act as a spoiling force against the sincere efforts of some members to make the Parliament perform its role effectively. Taxpayers' money should not be thrown at the Parliament and, all too obviously, self-interested members any more than it should be thrown at empire building in the Public Service. But the control over the limited funds which are available should not be subject to the whims of a government seeking to avoid scrutiny and political trouble. Officers such as the Auditor-General should not be placed in the position where they believe that they cannot perform their tasks adequately because of a chronic lack of funds; nor should they feel that departments and programs are immune from serious criticism because of the protective cover of a Minister. In the past 10 years a lot of money has been spent on the Parliament because of the move to this Parliament House. As the defects and liabiljty period in the various contracts for the construction of this place expires, that eJ(penditure will increase, if only in terrhs of building maintenance. It is now up to honourable members on both sides to ensure that this spending leads to some improvement in the quality of the performance of the task of the Parliament as a legislative body and a check on the Executive. The best building in the world is useless if the Government remains secretive, defensive, and adept at denying the Parliament the means to do its job. There are more important values at stake than the day to day political fortunes of the political parties represented in this chamber. The hostility of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) towards the Senate is well known. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has shown in this place that he has similar reservations. The entire front bench of the Government has contributed to making Question Time a farce. The facilities available for members are seen as resources to keep members in marginal seats rather than to promote the legislative tasks of the Parliament. The most outrageous example of this is the recent increase in the postal allowance for members in the House of Representatives. This clearly political decision just before an election is a blatant abuse of the power over the purse strings which the Government exercises. I remind honourable members that the coalition has undertaken, if elected to government, to cancel that measure immediately and cast it to the dustbin which holds all those measures of political expediency which we could well do without and would prefer not to see again. While the Government acts so cynically with the funds at its disposal, as in the manner described as an example, the low standing of the Parliament in the minds of many people will.not improve. These appropriations cannot directly address the deeper problems faced by parliament. They cannot do that for a number of reasons. One is that throwing money at problems does not necessarily solve them and in many cases it can make them worse. The truth is that the role of parliament has changed over the years, in my opinion for the worse. It no longer plays the central role in the process of government which it once did. As I said, spending money will not change that, but what money is available should not become a political tool to be used for short-term advantage, as we see with the postal allowance and some other measures adopted, particularly in the lead-up to an election. There is no doubt that short-term advantages will represent a long-term cost for all Australians. I have given just a couple of examples.",25
38,Mr MCGAURAN,Unknown,"Gippsland) (11.35)In discussing the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill I will concentrate my remarks on clause 5, which relates to the additional appropriation in respect of increases in salary. It disturbs me that the highly politicised area of politicians' wages has to a very large extent been taken out of the hands of the Remuneration Tribunal, which was established during the lifetime of the Fraser Government as an independent, arm's length arbitrator. Nothing could be more calculated to excite the attention of members of parliament, not to mention members of the public, than the issue of politicians' salaries. How has the Remuneration Tribunal been set askew? Very simply, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) has taken it upon himself, on the riding instructions of Cabinet, to raise the allowance for postage for each member of the House of Representatives from approximately $9,000 to' approximately $31,000. Overnight every member of the House of Representatives received an additional $21,000 for postage in what must rank as the most blatantly cynical opportunist decision by the Labor Government in recent times. The attempt to featherbed the marginal seat holders within its ranks has not gone unnoticed. The Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) is in the chamber. He is engaged in open warfare, in a very bitter divisive manner, with the pharmacists. He is cutting their incomes by 23 per cent. At the very same time the Cabinet of which he is a member has increased the postal allowance for all members of the House of Representativesnot the Senate---.,.by 200 per cent. It is an absolutely intolerable act by the Government. Leaving aside the questions of equity and consideration of the deserving needy in our community who are struggling to survive in a climate of crippling high interest rates, high inflation and increasing unemployment and leaving aside the obscenity of the abuse of the wealth of a government in giving members $21,000 in addition to the $9,000 they receive, there is also the, issue of the emasculation of the Remuneration Tribunal which is responsible for the setting of salaries referred to in clause 5 of the Bill. Leaving aside the attempt by the Government to give this huge postal allowance increase to members of the House. of Representatives so that its backbenchers, particularly those in marginal seats, can engage in direct mailing, I believe quite firmly that the Government is engaging in a sleight of hand salary increase for politicians. In other words, it is paying politicians via the back door. Simply, when members of the House of Representatives exceeded their $9,000, postal allowance, they would draw upon their electorate allowance; that is, the $9,000 had to be spent purely on postal items. That part of the electorate allowance which was not spent would then be taxed and remain in the pockets of politicians. A politician who diq not exceed the $9,000 allowance-many members of the Government have told us that the postal allowance had to be increased because they were having to spend some of their electorate allowance-would have a saving in his electorate allowance which could be pocketed. Leaving aside questions of equity, it is self-evident that the decision by the Government is an immoral one in the face of economic hardship and the suffering of so many people in our community. Ironically, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care holds the portfolio responsible for two of the most disadvantaged groups in our community. The truth is that politicians are getting an underhand pay increase .because they will not be drawing on their electorate allowance, which is income, to compensate for the amount spent in excess of $9,000 on postage as was previously the case. There is nothing more certain than that in an election year members of this chamber, particularly those who hold marginal seats, would spend in excess of $9,000, but they would have paid for that extra postal expense with their electorate allowance. Now members of the House of Representatives have an open chequebook to engage in the most spurious direct mail campaigns imaginable. They have a free rein to practically drown their constituents under the weight of direct mail,. surveys, 'welcome to the electorate' letters and anything this Government can dream up. We will see a whole new category of junk mail which will bear the stamp of the Parliament of Australia. This increase is nothing more than an abuse of, firstly, the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal which previously made such decisions-not the Executive. Secondly, it flies in the face of the need to direct government spending where it is truly needed and not to line the pockets of avaricious and frightened Government backqenchers. The Government hopes both to retain its marginal seats and to line the pockets of some of its greedy backbenchers. This is a result of the Government's deferral of a pay increase of some $6,000 which is due to members of parliament from next January and from the Government's referral of the matter back to the Remuneration Tribunal. The Tribunal granted the pay increase but it is being deferred, for all intents and purposes,' indefinitely. So the Government seeks to increase the postal allowance so as to reduce the reliance of members of parliament on their electorate allowance to compensate for that political decision. How can any member of the Government in conscience believe that the increase in the postal allowance from $9,000' in one hit to almost $31,000 is morally justified? It is political cynicism at its very worse. It flies in the face of the need to direct government spending to those who most need it and it is a desperate last ditch attempt to assist and prop up its marginal seat holders. Members of the community will not fall for it. They. do not believe that politicians should be paid exceedingly high salaries. But that is a different debate. They certainly do not believe politicians should be paid under the table. That is effectively what this postal increase means. Members of the House of Representatives will not be drawing on their electorate allowance-it can be pocketed-when they exceed the previous postal allowance limit. In drawing to a conclusion I again stress that the Opposition regards the Government's decision as reprehensible. For pensioners, for young first home buyers and for the aged and sick in our community, it must be a gut-wrenching experience to see the Government increase the postal allowance for members of the House of Representatives by millions of dollars-I again add that members of the Senate will not get this increase. Instead Labor members of the House of Representatives can direct mail to their constituents in a feeble attempt to retain office. How cynical can the Labor Government be? Previous to this matter arising, I thought the Government had plummeted to new depths, but this takes it to the very bottom of the sea.",27
39,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown," I cannot let the speech of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) go without making some comments. Honourable members would know that I represent the electorate which is next door to the electorate of Gippsland, the electorate of MCMillan. I have been able to witness at first hand the approach adopted by the very wealthy MCGauran family, of which the honourable member for Gippsland is one, to campaigning-and $250,000 for the last Senate election was chickenfeed to the MCGaurans. I have just witnessed in my electorate one of the biggest campaigns ever carried out. Campaigning groups phoned people throughout my electorate to see whether Senator MCGauran would have a chance if he ran as the candidate for the National Party for the seat of MCMillan. Mr MCGauran-On a point of order Mr Deputy Speaker: I, of all people in this chamber, am least 'susceptible to the rantings and ravings and personal abuse of the honourable member for MCMillan.",29
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member will come to his point of order. Mr MCGauran-I will, Mr Deputy Speaker. Lest anyone should think I am rather sensitive-it is just that this is so boring and repetitious-you must agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the honourable member for MCMillan is not addressing the Bill before the House.",29
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! There is no point of order. . Mr MCGauran- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order on the question bf relevance. I do not believe that the honourable member is in any way addressing the legislation before the House. I ask that the honourable member refer to specific 'clauses and discontinue his personal abuse.",29
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr AncJrew)Order! The Deputy Speaker finds himself in a .rather difficult position because the remarks of .the honourable member for Gippsland were only tenuously related to the legislation before the Chair. 1I have to concede that the honourable member for MCMillan is ranging rather more widely than the Chair can accept. I ask the honourable member for MCMillan to refer at least to the postal allowance which, 1 had to concede as 1 sat here, related only tenuously to the legislation.",29
43,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"I am quite happy to do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. The postal allowance was the matter on which the honourable member for Gippsland hinged his argument and I am quite happy to do the same. 1 will not have any difficulty doing that. As the honourable member says, any campaign takes money and that sort of approach. His allegation was that members of parliament-I do not know why he wants to attack his own kind; it is odd-would not be spending their electorate allowances, that we would be able to pocket them because we would have the stamp allowance. Let me tell the honourable member-and I understand that the honourable member for Gippsland lives in the big white house and does not spend too much time in his electorate-that some of us do work in our electorates using our electorate allowances. I am happy to show him my tax returns, if he wishes to see them to show him how my electorate allowance is used. I travel 35,000 kilometres in my car. I have petrol expenses and expenses incurred in running a country electorate the size of mine. 1 can assure him that I will not be pocketing any of my electorate allowance or putting it aside, making money on the side, as he has alleged. That is a straight out allegation against members of parliament which 1 thought the honourable member for Gippsland was above. The honourable member now calls himself a shadow Minister. He flits around the country, and we have no problems with that. He does not have to spend his electorate allowance in his· electorate. He does not need to worry about servicing his electorate.. He can make those allegations, but 1 refute them. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) who is in the chamber beside me certainly would use his electorate allowance because he has the biggest electorate in the world to service. For an honourable member to come in here and put on the record that type of allegation, as a little political get a headline which will give the impression to the public, the people sitting in this chamber, that other members of parliament will be pocketing money because of the stamp allowance, is ridiculous. The stamp allowance will be used to inform constituents of their rights, of what they are entitled to, under legislation passed in this Parliament. The sorts of things that we will be able to tell them about are issues such as the availability of the family allowance, adjustments in the family allowance that they may need to apply for, and Austudy benefits which are now available to many in the community to keep the retention rates up at our high schools. Families can be informed. We, as members of parliament, have every right to give that information to our constituents. 1 can guarantee that we will not be pocketing the electorate allowance, as alleged by the honourable member for Gippsland. He makes those allegations in this place knowing he has the capacity in his family to do the very thing he is accusing other honourable members of doing. As 1 was saying earlier, 1I have just witnessed in my electorate of MCMillan-and I am hinging this argument on the argument that was put by the honourable member for Gippsland-a campaign by the MCGaurans of phone calls to monitor the electorate of MCMillan to see whether Senator MCGauran could run for the National Party against me. Mr Staples-As a tax deduction.",30
44,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"As a tax deduction; of course it would be. He can afford it that way. That campaigning was run on his behalf because his family is wealthy enough to pay for it. The people in the electorate of MCMillan clearly indicated to him that he could not get any more than 8 per cent of the vote; he was wasting his time. They clearly indicated to him that the Liberal candidate, who does not live in the electorate and knows nothing about it, would not poll enough votes to make it worthwhile. So after six weeks of enormous publicity-television and press-telling everybody that he would be the candidate, he had to back down and say, 'I am sorry but I'm a little bit too busy making money at the moment ploy to to bother with that'.",30
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The honourable member for MCMillan must be aware that he is straining the tolerance of the Chair. He has moved a long way from the postal· allowance, which itself is only tenuously related to the legislation before the Chair. I ask him to return at least to the context of the remarks made by the honourable member for Gippsland.",31
46,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"I refute the allegations that have been made. We on this side of the House are proud of our record. The appropriations that we have been discussing are part of that. We have every right to inform the public, who now come here in their hundreds of thousands to see this Parliament in operation. We should be able to write to those people in our constituency to tell them of their rights and benefits. We are not ashamed of that. I refute the arguments of the honourable member for Gippsland and strongly support our position. When he can stand in this House and debate real issues such as the 1.5 million jobs we have created, the retention rates of students in high school that were at 35 per cent under a coalition government and have now risen to 58 per cent and pensions that have now reached 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, he will have some substance. The honourable member comes in here and makes allegations about his fellow members of parliament. No doubt the allegation in the local National Party press in my area will be that members of parliament are pocketing money. Who does he think he is convincing when he runs down his own democratic system? He ought to be ashamed of himself. He ought to come back into this House and apologise to all other members. He is not worth treating as a respectable member of parliament.",31
47,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,Unknown,"Dawson) (11.52)I would like to place on record the fact that I do not support the argument put forward by the Government about the further appropriation of $3.1m, out of these appropriations, for the purpose of increasing the postal allowance of members of the House of Representatives from $9,000 to $30,000. As has been said, honourable members will be receiving more than a 200 per cent increase in their postal allowance at a time when the workers of Australia are being asked to abide by wage fixing guidelines. It just so happens that $30,000 is enough money to send every constituent in the average sized electorate a letter bearing a 41c stamp. I suggest that if honourable members look at their records over the years, they will see that they have been able to survive on a $9,000 allowance. This rise is being given to members of this House, but not to senators. One must, then, ask the question: Are senators not also entitled to this rise? One can only be left with the deep suspicion that the allowance for honourable members is being raised because of the numbers on both sides of the House. I believe that the Government has a majority of 22. There is an advantage in that when it comes to electioneering.",31
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I remind the honourable member for Dawson that he is straying rather wide of the intent of the legislation before the House.,31
49,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,Unknown,"I will come back to the appropriations and the $3.1m. The cost of parliamentarians' telephones also enters the equation. It has come to my attention that there is an excessive use of telephones by members for other than electoral purposes. It seems to add up to a preparation for something other than properly representing the electorate. I have no trouble in disclosing details of my use of the electorate allowance. The honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham) mentioned electoral allowances and the cost of his travel and other· expenses within his electorate. The people of Australia should perhaps know that some of these allowances provide for the use of hire cars and charters by members. I am not certain whether the honourable member for MCMillan is entitled to such an allowance, but certainly in some electorates members are. That is used by requisition of members for electoral purposes. All these things relate to members properly representing their electorates. We say that this appropriation of $3.1m is not for the purpose of Government members representing their electorates, as would normally be the case, but for use in preparation for an election, which we believe will be held as early as 2 December this year.",31
50,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown,"On my television in my office I was watching the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) making scurrilous comments. I did not intend to speak on this matter but it needs to be said that those statements were not just scurrilous; they were factually rect. The honourable gentleman obviously does not read his mail. He has no understanding of the rules surrounding the use of the postal allowance by members of this House. The Government had concerns about the misuse of allowances by members of this House. If one wanted to be scurrilous about the misuse of allowances by honourable members, one could point opposite and find many persons among those opposite to make allegations about. But because the honourable gentleman does not read his mail, he does not seem to understand that the postal allowance is a credit at a post office nominated by the member. It cannot be transferred by way of stamps to be taken from the post office. It cannot be used other than by posting articles or lettergrams through that post office, where the credit is diminished by the cost of that service. Hence, if a member does not wish to use the postal allowance, it will not be used. It cannot be transferred to cash in kind; it cannot be used for other than the purposes specified. The honourable member made the suggestion that I and other members of this House could go to our nominated post offices and use that allowance for other than the purposes for which it is being provided, which is to communicate with the electors within our constituencies. I will tell the honourable member and other members of the Opposition who obviously do not work their electorates-that is their problem, not minethat constituents in my electorate, which covers more than 20,000 square kilometres of rural Victoria, are not able to be communicated with other than by mail. In a large rural electorate one cannot communicate with constituents by knocking on doors. With 23 rural newspapers, no provincial city, no major television or other communication links within my electorate, as a member of parliament the only option I have is to use mail. I can assure honourable members that the former allowance of $9,000 was, frankly, not enough, even for normal constituency work. In my office I have 20,OOO-odd names on petitions, and I have letters about a whole host of matters. They each require a return letter-and $9,000 will not cover it. Being a member of the National Party of incorAustralia, the honourable member for Gippsland obviously does not do that kind of work. As he said, he wanders around the countryside shooting off at the mouth very readily and very often, and he is always wrong. He is becoming known as the person who is totally wrong. Members of parliament in New Zealand have an unlimited postage allowance. We do not hear any bleats from the conservatives on the other side about the United States, which provides for its members of Congress and members of the Senate an unlimited postage allowance. They have a staff of 127 people paid for by the public purse. The honourable member somehow suggests that we, in this country-another democracyare abusing the system. We are the most underfunded, understaffed politicians in the Western world but I am not complaining about that. But when an attempt is made to redress some of these imbalances, what do we hear? Not truth, not a logical argument, but scurrilous statements that we will abuse the additional funding and put it in our pockeis. Frankly, that makes me angry, particularly coming from a member of the National Party of Australia. We know that the only State where that Party governs is Queensland. If National Party members want to talk about corruption, let us point the finger at the one party which governs Queensland. Let us really point the finger at them if that is the kind of system that they believe in. That is National Party Government in operation. That is corruption.",32
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member for MCEwen is straying rather wide of the Bill as he must be well aware.,32
52,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown,I have nothing further to say; I have made my point.,32
53,Mr CAMPBELL,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) (12.01)I, too, was drawn to this debate by what I thought was the very insubstantial and low level of the debate. When we talk about the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90 in a country that desperately needs to look at totally refunding its rail system to take pressure off roads and that desperately needs to get the manufacturing industry going, it is extremely petty for people to come into this House and talk about a $3.lm appropriation for postage for politicians. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) is a typical National Party of Australia member. Frankly, I like the fellow. I have a lot of time for him. I say here and now that I believe he will one day be the leader of the National Party. The National Party is, of course, a party of privilege and he and his-",32
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member for Kalgoorlie must realise that the Deputy Speaker has already ruled that the postage allowance is related only tenuously to the Parliamentary Departments Bill. To stray now into an attack on an honourable member would force me to call the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to order. I ask him to refer his remarks, if to anything, to the question of the postage allowance for parliamentarians.",33
55,Mr CAMPBELL,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I was merely trying your patience like other speakers before me but it appears that you will not be so tolerant. I do not think I was attacking the honourable member. I was saying that he is an excellent member for that type of constituency. I know that he has taken on some of the ploughboys in his own Party and put them straight on some economic issues, particularly in support of the pulp industry in his electorate. But I return to the postal allowance. My electorate is 2,500,000 square kilometres-or in real measurements one million square miles. The only way I can communicate with a lot of it is by mail. I must say that the rise in the allowance was a pleasant surprise. I was surprised at the magnitude of it. I can certainly use it. I would much rather have had the money. We have to recognise, as my colleague the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) has just said, that Australian politicians by Western standards are generally underfunded. I make an exception of politicians in the United Kingdom where I think they are even worse off than we are. But we find in the United Kingdom that politicians take on paid lobbying jobs for the private sector. It is not a situation that I would like to see develop in this country. But politicians are underfunded. We have a press in this country-I get stuck for euphemisms, Mr Deputy Speaker, but if you could think of one for incompetence, laziness and slothfulness, I would be happy to use it. I think that aptly describes the press in this country. Its members tend to take the lowest common denominator. Cynicism is their stock in trade and they tend to denigrate the efforts made by people who often give up substantial careers to come into this place. Unlike most of my colleagues, I do not have any tertiary qualifications. I find that this is an asset. From my experience tertiary qualifications tend to give people a very narrow perspective. Without tertiary qualifications I was making far more money in the private sector than I can ever hope to make in this House. Obviously, I am not here to make money. In a debate like this it ill behoves the honourable member for Gippsland with all his inherited wealth to make the statements that he has. I am not objecting to his situation. I wish I had inherited wealth. I think everyone should have inherited wealth. It would be a marvellous solution to a lot of problems. Perhaps we could legislate for it.",33
56,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am sure the honourable member for Kalgoorlie appreciates that, far from my being restrictive, I have been much too generous in the degree to which I have allowed him to roam. I would ask him to return to the postal allowance or to resume his seat.",33
57,Mr CAMPBELL,Unknown,"I do apologise. I am taking advantage of your good nature. I will return to the Bill. One of the things that I intend to use this postal allowance increase for is to send out a newsletter which I publish with a State colleague. We put forward a point of view which we believe should be expounded. It is my view that rural areas of Australia are being neglected by all political parties. I am hoping that our newsletter can be spread very widely. Perhaps, we could even get it to the cities with this allowance. I think this is a very valuable thing for Australia. While we hear a lot of talk about multiculturalism, the fact is that Australia is not a multicultural society. It is an AngloCeltic society-probably the most generous society of this type in the world. This is very relevant, as I am sure you will find if you hear me out, Mr Deputy Speaker. We intend to circulate our newsletter which puts forward this point of view. The greatest danger in Australia is the growing dichotomy between city and country. Australia today is dividing on a city-country basis. In Australia most people have always lived in the cities. We have a convenient myth about unity between the cities and the country. That has disappeared over the last 40 years. This electoral allowance increase will help us to send out the mail in an effort to combine the city and country areas and to bring back that unity. Without that unity Australia will not succeed as a nation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith.

58,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"Bradfield) (12.07)The purpose of the Superannuation and Other Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 is to amend the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973, the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948, the Superannuation Act 1922 and various other related legislation concerning public servants and members of the defence forces. The objective is to restore pensions payable under those pieces of legislation to the rates at which they would have been payable had they not been discounted from 10 October 1986. These superannuation pensions were payable to two groups of Commonwealth workers-retired public servants and Defence Force personnel. Pensions payable on 30 June 1986 were increased in July of that year on the basis of the 9.2 per cent increase for all groups in the consumer price index (CPI) between the March quarter 1985 and the March quarter 1986. As part of the Australian Labor Party Government's expenditure cutting exercise in the Budget of 1986, these pensions were reduced to the rates that would have applied had the increase in the March quarters been 7.2 per cent and not 9.2 per cent. The Government promised that the discounted 2 per cent would be restored when 'it was economically responsible to do so'. It is worth noting at last that we apparently have reached the stage when it is economically responsible. However, I think that those who have lacked the advantages of that additional 2 per cent for the last two to three years would take the view that there may be an election in the wind and that the Government is simply trying to close off some of the genuine concerns and irritation which it has caused. The Bill therefore provides for the rates of all pensions payable under the legislation, directly or indirectly affected by the October 1986 reduction, to be increased to the 9.2 per cent from 20 October 1989. As I said there has been a delay of three years in incorporation in the pension of the full CPI over that time. Total costs for the increase in pensions under the superannuation Acts are expected to be of the order of $12.1m for 1989-90; $19.9m for 1990-91; and $19.5m for 1991-92. Naturally, the coalition welcomes the decision of the Government at last to restore the 2 per cent and, therefore, supports this legislation. However, the restoration of the 2 per cent will in no way compensate retired Commonwealth public servants and Defence Force retirement and death benefits beneficiaries for the monetary losses which they have experienced since 1986. For example, since then individuals in these two groups have lost as much as $500 in income. The point needs to be repeated: often these pensioners are among Australia's poorest people and, therefore, are least able to help themselves in that time. Labor has been happy to dispense with the 2 per cent discount over that period and not foot the bill. It is interesting to note in the 12 April statement this year that the announcement of the restoration of the 2 per cent discount was contained in the very last line of the speech of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) dealing with pensions. It has been suggested that it was only after a furious last minute campaign by retired public servants and Defence Force personnel that the Government decided at last to restore the lost 2 per cent. One. could be forgiven for thinking that, rather than being a time when it was economically responsible to do so, the 2 per cent was rightly given back only because it was more politically expedient to do so as it would be a means of shoring up the pensioner vote. In effect, today's superannuants, including people who are retirees of Commonwealth superannuation schemes, to a very large extent have been required, through their high taxes, effectively to subsidise or completely cover, in the context of the last Budget, the total costs of the increases in retirement efits which have been passed on and which the Opposition supports. But I emphasise that these increases have been paid for by the higher taxes of today's superannuants and yesterday's superannuants who are now retired. The point is that the taxation on superannuation over recent years under this Government has effectively increased by nearly 1,000 per cent, yet it is in that environment that the Treasurer continually tells the world what a wonderful set of reforms has been introduced and how we will have over $600 billion saved up in superannuation schemes by the end of the decade. Nevertheless, we still have a Prime Minister who, in speaking to pensioners, uses terms such as 'silly old buggers' because he obviously thinks pensioners are stupid as well. The fact of the matter is that pensioners have very good memories and they are particularly cognisant of the fact that the Government has made commitments in the past which it has not met. Perhaps the most notable commitment, which was made in 198283, was to increase the basic pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings-a target which will not be reached until April next year. Again, we are delighted that that target will be met; but the point could be made that if the Government is now so wealthy with its substantial Budget surplus, as again was announced by the Treasurer recently, pensioners believe, with some justification, that that 25 per cent ought to have been reached in November this year, not in April next year. They conclude, again not unreasonably, that there may well be political considerations behind t.he timing of that decision. Mr Robert Brown-You are too cynical.",34
59,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"I am cynical because I have been watching this Government for nearly seven years. The decision to discount pensions by 2 per cent is just another example of the cold and calculating way the Government has always treated the aged in Australia. For that reason many pensioners are sick and tired of being pushed around by decisions over which they have absolutely no control. While on the subject of superannuation I would like to make a few comments about ben- the direction this Government seems to be taking in this very vital field. Since the release of the Labor Government's superannuation-retirement income Budget package a number of Labor Ministers, including the Treasurer, the Minister for Industry, Technologyand Commerce (Senator Button) and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), have made statements on superannuation that are of grave concern not only to the coalition but no doubt to any superannuant who wonders what will happen to his contributions over the next 20 or 30 years. First we had Ministers Howe and Button openly suggesting that a portion of the billions of dol1a-s estimated to be flowing into superannuation funds by the end of the century-as I have said, approximately $600 billion-should be used to finance projects such as urban redevelopment or provide increased venture capital, housing, roads or various other levels of infrastucture. One would have thought that the recent experience of two State Labor governments-notably Western Australia and Victoria-would have taught this Government a lesson: when governments start getting involved in actual projects on the ground using public funds the risks of failure are extremely high. Surely nothing could be more pertinent in this context than that hundreds of thousands of Australians who are told to go into superannuation as a means of giving them financial independence in their retirement are now facing the very real prospect that,' if the policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) for a national development fund is pursued, they could lose up to 20 per cent of their long-term savings in directions of investment stipulated and set down by the government of the day, irrespective of the opportunity cost and the reduction in end dividends to those funds contributed by those individuals, whether they be trade unionists or workers throughout Australian industry. Two days after the Treasurer announced the package designed to encourage more Australians to save for their retirement these two senior Ministers, Button and Howe, were running around the country suggesting ways in which the anticipated superannuation wealth could be tapped. It is typical of the Australian Labor Party to try to sell off the chicken before it has even been fattened. On the Sunday program on 20 August, Minister Howe said that he would like to see some of the superannuation funds being spent on 'social infrastructure to tackle some of the great problems of our cities'. These comments clearly reflect Cabinet's desire to focus on ways to meet the costs of upgrading the nation's infrastructure. Senator Button then went on record as saying that he, too, would like to see superannuation funds investing more money in venture capital. There is no ques-ion that Australia's social infrastructure needs to be refunded; that is an obvious fact of life. There is no question that we want to see more funds being invested in venture capital and in Australia's infrastructural development, not only from the point of view of creating jobs butalso from the point of view of creating a more efficient economy in the future. We are not at issue on that point. However, the point is this: what is the right of a government to determine investment policies that will affect moneys contributed by individuals through their superannuation schemes over most of their active lives if the outcome will be a net reduction in those persons' level of income in retirement? The coalition recognises that social infrastructure problems will arise in Australia in the future and ways have to be found to tackle such problems. I would have thought that taxation was a legitimate means by which the user pays principle could be applied. Surely it is better than making those who have saved, as distinct from those who have chosen not to save through superannuation, have to carry an unfair proportion of the total national burden, whether it be in the area of social infrastructure, such as the construction of cheap accommodation, new roads, or any other form of community project. The fact of the matter is that the superannuation funds do not belong to the Government. The Government is entitled to take its share of taxation; it is not entitled to determine the directions of investment of superannuation. These funds belong to the people of Australia. They have been given to the trustees of the superannuation schemes to manage for the contributors. They certainly should not be directed by government; they must remain the responsibility of the trustees who run the funds and who make investments with the long term objective of maximising the return to the individual contributor. . Superannuants have the right to expect that their money will be invested wisely and in a way that maximises their returns and end benefits. Investment in social infrastructure projects may not be in the best interests of the fund members. We are seeing a clear decision by the Government to transfer its responsibilities, through the taxation process, for maintaining the basic engineering infrastructure of the nation and requiring a specific group of people-those who wish to be independent in retirement-not only to pay their taxes on their superannuation but also to run the real risk of losing their standard of living in retirement. According to the ACTU up to 20 per cent of those funds should be transferred to areas of investment dictated and determined by government, not by the superannuation fund and certainly not by the contributor. The contributor, whose point of view would never be sought and who would have no control over the direction of those funds' investments, is expected to fall for Keating's three-card trick and do the right thing for himself and for Australia and yet, somehow or other at the end of it, still have more money for retirement income. The absurdity of the argument stands for all to see. Needless to say, I would have thought that such a policy would also run counter to the deregulatory attitudes which the Labor Party has claimed as its own in recent - ears. The decisions taken by the !reasurer In recent days, especially in relatIOn to the banks, would make one think very seriously indeed that the Government is now changing direction. Labor wants superannuation funds basically to use members' savings to back some high flying entrepreneurs who, on recent evidence from Western Australia and Victoria have an unfortunate habit of going bust. ThMinister's statements clearly mirror what the ACTU wants to happen to superannuation funds. These are the matters to which I now wish to refer. The comments' made initially by Senator Button and Minister Howe could just have been passed off as aberrations except that one is the spokesman for the Left and the other sees himself as being the great spokesman for the Right of the Labor Party. Any do-bts. one may have had of assuming that their views were not necessarily policy were certainly removed by the remarks made by the Treasurer to the ACTU conference only last week. He made a number of interesting points in a speech which, incidentally, has not been released. I can refer only to the quotations contained in the Australian Financial Review, the Sydney Morning Herald and other newspapers. It is significant that such an important speech made by none other than the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia to the ACTU which is the industrial arm of the Labor - ovement has never been issued. It suggests to me that maybe there was much in it which the Treasurer would prefer not to be held accountable for in the future. The Treasurer made a number of observations in Sydney on 27 September. He talked about urging the unions to work towards self-management of employees' superannuation funds which, he said, were expected to total $600 billion by the year 2000. He added these most interesting words: 'to get greater clout, in a more hostile political environment'. One can orly presume that the Treasu-er accepts the fact that the Labor Party will .lose the next election. He is trying to put In place the means by which the trade union' movement, through its control and dUCIng management of superannuation, will be. able to hold to ransom not only the Australian . government of the day but also industry, the boards of every company in Australia, the shareholders of those companies and, more significantly, hundreds of thousan-s of Australians, whether they be trade umon members or not, who have joined the 3 per cent productivity schemes over the last two years but who have now been put on notice that they will not control the direction of those investments, that the funds wi-l be used for political reasons by the trade umon movement, and that the Treasurer of Au-tralia is aiding and abetting in the ach-evement of that very dubious goal. I agaIn quote from the article in the Australian Financial Review. The Treasurer went on to say: In more difficult political times . . . there'll be a lot of institutional muscle in the trade union movement presiding over $600 billion of Australian savings . . . It is interesting that he talks of Australian savings. He should have said 'the savings of Australian's because in a very real and personal sense every dollar that is being contributed to those funds belongs to somebody. It does not belong to the nation as a whole. It belongs to those 3.4 million individual contributors who are looking towards their financial independence in retirement so that they will not be a cost to the taxpayers as a whole. We have a government claiming it wants greater independence and fewer demands on the welfare system while on the other hand it is saying to the trade union movement, 'Here is your opportunity to use this money to achieve your political ends'. Sotto voce it also says, 'Of course, a Labor government of the day will be able to use those funds for social infrastructure or any other national purpose it sees fit, regardless of the interests of the people who own the money'. That is a matter of greatest concern to us all. I decided to look into this matter in more detail to see precisely what was the genesis of these interesting ideas. I did not have to look very far; I found it in an ACTU document, Australia Reconstructed, which talked about a national development fund. It stated: T,he ACTU has canvassed the proposition of rethe level of superannuation funds currently held off shore and developing a national investment f-nd. The latter would be financed by superannuation funds making available up to 20 per cent of Australian their future income, The document went on to suggest that we could not justify from government's point of view tax deductability or a special tax regime for superannuation contributions unless those funds were being utilised in what was perceived by the ACTU as being in the national interest or the trade union interest. The document went on to state: Given the favoured taxation treatment of investment· through superannuations funds, a lever exists to redirect part of their investment portfolio term growth and expansion objectives. Later it stated: Since the projected growth of superannuation funds is rapid, there is an argument for using some of the funds for housing in addition to industry finance. On social welfare grounds the highest returns would be gained if funds were concentrated on the building of modest houses, preferably through the public housing authorities, for sale on income-related mortgage instruments. The balance of investment between housing and industry would depend strongly on whether these needs can be met from other sources, and would have to be aligned with the overall economic strategy. Great concepts indeed! Is it any wonder that the conclusion of the document, under the heaQing 'Funding the National Development Fund', states: All superannuation funds be required to make available up to 20 per cent of their future income to be drawn on by the National Development Fund. Who is going to run this fund? The Government and the trade unions. They talk about a tripartite arrangement, but we have seen no evidence of very much tripartism in recent days from this Government. It is really talking about a mechanism by which the trade union movement of Australia will determine the direction of long-term macro and micro-economic policy by its massive control over the investments of hundreds of thousands of Australians saved for their ultimate retirement. I am rather surprised that while these comments have been given some space by the press very few economic commentators have bothered to look carefully at the detail. Perhaps they were mesmerised by the proposals contained in the last Budget. It is pretty impressive when a Treasurer talks about savings of $600 billion before, the end of this century. The superannuation industry naturally thought, 'We are going to have a greater sum of money available to us than we have ever had before'. Naturally, the a figure of $600 billion absolutely inflamed the industry's imagination. Having said that, the undeniable fact is that the evidence now before us, contained in this ACTU document entitled Australia Reconstructed and used by the Treasurer, shows us the hidden agenda of the Labor Party in relation to superannuation investment in Australia. It has clothed its hidden agenda behind. the percepto longertion that ordinary people should be encouraged to have financial independence in retirement while at the same time saying that it, the government of the day, combined with the ACTU, will determine the exact direction of long-term investment. Australia Reconstructed referred to overseas investment by superannuation schemes. Members of this House will recall that in the April-May statement of last year the Treasurer introduced the concept in superannuation of tax imputation on investments made in Australian companies as distinct from the tax which would accrue on investments made overseas. He sold that concept on precisely the same grounds, that the Government wanted to see more Australian capital being invested in Australian companies. The Opposition has no objection to that as a concept of economic and social policy. It is perfectly straightforward. But it is interesting to note that in this document entitled Australia Reconstructed the ACTU went the further step and talked about investments overseas as if they were necessarily evil. The simple reality is that if one has a superannuation fund and is charged with the fundamental responsibility of maximising returns on the invested capital which is contributed by those hundreds and thousands of individual Australians, it is a very important decision whether to have a mix by investing overseas or exclusively in. Australia if one knows that the investment opportunities in Australia are not going to give the same level of return that one would anticipate being able to obtain overseas. In other words, is it the responsibility of the trustees of a superannuation fund to make the appropriate investment decisions which will maximise the return on capital, or are those decisions to be surrounded by a set of government restraints and policies which will, without doubt, reduce the end benefits to the contributor? It is a matter of great regret to me personally and to the Opposition that throughout the debate on superannuation which has run in this Parliament on and off for the last six years these issues have never been adequately addressed. Why? Because the Government has seen superannuation, both in the short term and in the long term, as a major taxation milch cow. As I said in my earlier remarks, between the Government's election in 1983 and the first set of changes in May the same year, and between the second major set of changes in May of last year and the changes again this year, it has effectively increased taxation on superannuation contributions by nearly 1,000 per cent. Yet the Treasurer has the temerity to come into this House and say to the Australian people, 'Make your investments in superannuation. It is the safest way to protect your money. Everything is going to be marvellous for you. You are going to be financially independent'-full stop. There he let it lie, until he made that speech to the ACTU last week. We are now seeing in the brightest light of day the long-term hidden agenda of the Labor Party. The agenda is not to increase Australian investment by the mythical $600 billion which the Treasurer quotes but to establish a vehicle, a mechanism, by which the government of the day-obviously the Treasurer presumes he will be Prime Minister by that stage-can utilise at least 20 per cent of those funds in objectives which it considers appropriate. Someone in Western Australia may want to build a petrochemical plant using public money, but the Labor Party does not understand that public money is the money of every individual Australian. There is not some money tree that one can just go up to and pick money off whenever it suits and call that public money and everything else private money. It does not work that way. Money is taken from people in taxes. Investment decisions are made in terms of maximising returns. 11 we start interfering in the decision making processes of the superannuation industry, we are inevitably putting government policy between the individual contributor and the fund manager. Government policy ought to be related to taxation. If a government wants to change the tax mix on superannuation, it has the right. to do so. The belief of the Opposition is that tax on superannuation is too high. But if we are going to add to that a process of decision making which says to every superannuation fund manager in this nation that the Government wants 20 per cent of every dollar that is contributed by 3.7 million Australians towards their long term retirement, not only will the Government's nearly 1,000 per cent increase in taxation have a major negative effect on superannuation but also the Government is going to breach the credibility of the entire superannuation industry. Ordinary Australian workers will simply say, 'If I cannot be sure how my money is going to be invested over 30 or 40 years, I would rather buy a block of land or buy another house; make a long-term investment of that sort'. Those are the very objectives which this Government claims are not in Australia's national interest. But it is certain that they will not put their money in superannuation if there is any suggestion that government policy is going to take precedence over their interests. It must not be forgotten that every·dollar that is contributed by individuals towards their superannuation is an after tax dollar. They have already paid their pay-as-youearn tax. It is part of what is left of their consumable income that they have voluntarily chosen to put aside. It is in the national interest, because it is building up domestic savings which we desperately need, and it is in their interests because it is gIving them a sure income for their retirement. They are prepared to pay whatever taxes may be levied from time to time on the way through. However, they are not prepared to then run the risk of seeing up to 20 per cent of every dollar that they have put into their superannuation being diverted to achieve some grand objectives or gestures of government policy. As I said, the experiences of Victoria and Western Australia are too vivid in the minds of the Australian people for them to· be prepared to fall for the perception that a government led by Keating, Hawke, Brown or anybody else is so omniscient that it can be trusted to make the right decisions with the hard-earned savings of over 3.7 million Australian people. The Government is standing at the brink of the most fundamental reversion of policy objectives we are likely to see. If the Australian people lose their confidence in long-term superannuation saving, we will all suffer the consequences.",35
60,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,40
61,Mr SNOW,Unknown,"The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) talked about the Government losing the confidence of the superannuation industry. If that is so, why is the superannuation industry talking about superannuation as the next best investment to one's own home? Why is the superannuation industry praising the results of the superannuation legislation brought forward both with and before the Budget; the results of the May economic statement? The superannuation industry is praising the legislation because it knows that more people will become interested in superannuation because more people will get a dividend when they retire, both through tax and through funds, as a result of the superannuation proposals. When the Opposition raised matters of public importance to talk about provisions actually in the Superannuation and Other Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill, it complained about the 2 per cent. drop in the retirement benefits but hardly spent a minute praising the Government for reversing that decision and for bringing the entitlement back to those who lost the benefit along with pensioners, wage and salary earners, and the rest of the Australian community. The honourable member for Bradfield asserted that the trade union movement will use funds for political purposes through its own superannuation scheme. Anyone else can have a business and use money how they like and where they like, but apparently not the trade union movement. The real aim of the trade union movement is to use the money for productive investment. I hope that if it does use the money for political purposesand I guess that it may-it will be to achieve its aims of better representation of women in the trade union movement and better representation of people who are not presently unionised and may not feel that they are properly represented. The trade uriion movement this year has confronted that very issue. I have every confidence in the way that the trade union movement will use funds productively. History shows that the trade union movement is political, but always on behalf of its members and not on behalf of any particular political party. The Government was faced with a mounting retirement bill when it came into office in 1983. More and more people had an expectation of pensions because their life expectancy was much greater than it may have been when they were born. Once again, the honourable member for Bradfield is trying to frighten pensioners and retirees by putting the Government in a bad light. Let us turn the light on the Opposition record. For all its talk, the Opposition, when in government, lived from day to day. There was no social planning, no effort to give people incentive to fund their own retirement-and that is important-or to make it more attractive for people to use their 'superannuation funds for their retirement. The old policy gave no encouragement at all for people to provide for themselves with a regular income. Now people have two incentives. The first concerns tax advantages. In the words of the finance advisers, superannuation is now the next best investment to one's own home. There are also tax advantages for the employer. There is a higher financial return: the money received can be greater. We saw the brilliant idea of giving a superannuation scheme to people who take no more than 49 per cent as a lump sum. This has an advantage to the Government-in other words, it means a lesser provision for pensions perhaps into the next century. It also has an advantage to the superannuation industry and to the superannuant himself or herself in giving a higher return when he or she retires. So there are tax advantages, and advantages for the superannuant, the Australian taxpayer and the employer of the proposed superannuant. But the legislation we have-and one would hardly know it from listening to the honourable member for Bradfield-recognises the fact that a whole range of people accepted a 2 per cent drop in their increased superannuation payments. This legislation varies what seems to me to be a contract between the Government and the superannuant. Two issues are involved here. The first is an ethical responsibility of the munity for the individual which says, 'You do not change an agreement which an individual understands to be a certain agreement and what amounts to be an assurance'. The second is a moral responsibility of the individual to the community: where everyone else shares in cuts in real terms, the superannuant should go along with other members of the community, such as pensioners and wage and salary earners, and accept cuts. I believe that the criticisms from all over Australia had some justification on these ethical grounds. Governments ought to be wary of changing expectations of people who expect a secure and untroubled retirement. But many retirees affected by this legislation understood the moral issue that everyone has to share the consequences of a nation living beyond its means. Let there be no doubt that it is precisely because the Government had the will to take unpalatable action that it was able to reduce the high double-digit inflation to single digit inflation and reduce high unemployment of about 700,000 in 1983 to about 400,000 now after the creation of well over one million new jobs. This legislation takes account of the fact that superannuants, along with others, bore the brunt of decisions that had to be made and were productive-in other words, gave good results. We now take the figure to the rate it would have been if the cuts had not occurred. The legislation also ensures that widows and children are catered· for. It is with great pleasure that I support the legislation. I believe that the Government and the taxpayers can thank all the superannuants who took those cuts but we are now recognising in full the cut that was made.",40

Why would it intervene against an arrangement which is about reducing costs to consumers rather than increasing them? The shadow Treasurer should be well aware that the new arrangements will reduce the penalty provisions which relate to banks versus non-banks. So it is tidying up and levelling the playiQg field that you jokers left behind with statutory reserve deposits (SRDs). The playing field, as usual, we have tried to flatten from the humps and hollows that you put in with SRDs. At any rate, arrangements between the Crown and, in this case, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the banks are immune from the Trade Practices Act. NA",42
81,Mr MOUNTFORD,Unknown,"Is the Minister for Transport and Communications aware of reports that, in authorising the operations of foreign aircraft and foreign pilots in Australia during the pilots dispute, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has allegedly compromised on safety standards? Will the Minister advise the House whether the reare ports are correct?",42
82,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"I am aware of allegations fully made by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and various of its supporters, including the Federal Opposition, that the CAA has compromised safety during this dispute. totally reject that charge. Both the Governtraffic ment and the CAA are concerned to ensure tries. that, in rebuilding our domestic aviation system, Australia's high safety standards are fully maintained. The CAA has had to deal with circumMaritime stances it does not normally face; that is, foreign registered aircraft are being chartered to fly domestic services in Australia, foreign pilots are being hired with those foreign planes, and foreign pilots are being hired to fly Australia's registered aircraft. Foreign aircraft are subject to airworthiness and maintenance controls approved by the regulatory authority of the country of registration. Such aircraft are all subject to International Civil A viation Organisation airworthiness standards accepted by Australia. The foreign aircraft now operating domestically not only meet that standard, but also are maintained and controlled by appropriately licensed personnel. This is exactly the same as occurs with foreign international aircraft flying services into and around Australia as part of normal international aviation operations. Furthermore, suggestions by the Opposition and others that these planes could be unsafe or even rust buckets are absolute nonsense. Of the five foreign 737 aircraft so far approved by the CAA, the oldest is four years and the youngest is one year-an average age of three years. That is less than the average age of both Ansett Airlines and Australian fleets. If any foreign aircraft proposed for domestic services does not meet our standards it will be rejected by the CAA. With regard to foreign pilots, the CAA is ensuring through flight checks and oral or written tests that these pilots are competent. The tests are conducted in line with normal procedure by check captains of the airlines or by the CAA examiners of airmen. There has been no change to the normal requirement that pilot competence must be adequately demonstrated. Furthermore, it is absurd to suggest that these foreign pilots the dregs of the international aviation industry or inexperienced recruits. They are highly experienced professional airline crews, familiar with the aircraft types they are flying in Australia. They come from recognised aviation countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and France, and I are experienced in flying in the dense air conditions that prevail in those counFinally, I refer to an alleged recent incident concerning a foreign aircraft on domestic service in Australia; that is, the Air 737 aircraft which was alleged to have strayed 40 kilometres off course in a . take-off from Sydney last Thursday. In fact, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has advised that the aircraft was flying in accordance with its flight plan, was on course, and there was no error on the part of its crew. In other words, this safety issue was an absolute beat-up by somebody. NA",42

92,Mr HAWKE,Unknown,"The first of these advances was the government and industry conference against chemical weapons which was held in Canberra from 18 September to 22 September. As the honourable member would know, that conference was hailed around the world as a very significant success. I take this opportunity-I think it is appropriate-to pay' tribute to the outstanding work. of the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, and to his departmental team, for the amount of work and commitment that was put into ensuring the success of this chemical weapons conference. The conference brought together, for the first time, senior representatives of the international chemical industry and governments central to the process of securing a chemical weapons convention. In this situation, I believe that considerable gratitude is owed to the Foreign Minister and to the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who brought this to a successful conclusion. It is important that, for the first time, the world's chemical industry issued a collective statement of a commitment to assist governments in bringing about a convention. That was the first significant thing to have happened in the last two weeks. The second was the Wyoming meeting between Secretary of State James Baker and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze at which a memorandum of understanding was signed regarding a bilateral verification procedure and experiment of data exchange, with the aim of facilitating the process of negotiation, signature and ratification of the global convention. As the honourable member for Dunkley will be aware, the Wyoming meeting was also extremely valuable in pointing to further progress in the areas of nuclear and conventional disarmament between the superpowers and strengthening what is obviously a growing cooperation between the two superpowers. Thirdly, I warmly welcome, as I am sure all honourable members do, the announcement by President Bush to the United Nations General Assembly proposing a timetable for the reduction· and eventual elimination of the chemical weapons stockpile. I am pleased to note, again as I am sure all honourable members are, that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has already responded positively to the initiative taken by President Bush. I believe these three developments, taken together, represent nothing less than a quantum leap towards eliminating chemical weapons. I am more hopeful than ever that the remaining substantial issues negotiation can be completed within the coming year. I can give the honourable member the assurance that the Government will continue, as it has done in the past, to give priority to its efforts towards achieving this objective.

97,Mr LANGMORE,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. What steps does the Government intend to take to secure the future of the Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE), in view of the decision by the Australian National University (ANU) that it does not want to merge with the college?",44
98,Mr DA WKINS,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Fraser for his question and acknowledge his deep interest not only in the circumstances of the Canberra College but also in higher, education in the Australian Capital Territory generally. It is important to recall that a number of institutions around Australia comparable with the Canberra College of Advanced Education have proceeded to university status over the last few years. They are Curtin University of Techfor nology in Western Australia, the University of Technology in Sydney, and the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane. It was. always a possibility that the Canberra College would wish to pursue its ambition to develop university level courses and a more extensive graduate program than it already had. It was the view of the Commonwealth that the most appropriate way for that to proceed was by way of an amalgamation between the ANU and the Canberra College but, as we anllounced at the time, the Commonwealth would not force such an amalgamation in the face of oppolicsition from the governing councils of the institutions concerned. Therefore, following the final decision of the ANU Council not to proceed with merger discussions with the Canberra College of Advanced Education, it was necessary for the Commonwealth to consider what the future of the Canberra College should be. In the meantime, the Canberra College had entered into a sponsorship arrangement with Monash University with a view to developing its already extensive profile to a level comparable with an international standard university and to further develop its graduate program. I have great pleasure in saying that the Commonwealth intends to legislate during this session to provide for the Canberra College to be retitled and known as the University of Canberra under the sponsorship of Monash University. Monash University is a very high quality university with an international reputation second to none in Australia, and I think this association will be very profitable for the University of Canberra, as it will become known. This sponsorship will exist for a certain number of years, at the end of which there will be an external review before the university can enjoy its own independent status. At that stage it may well be appropriate for the Government to revisit the issue of the organisation of institutions within the Territory. The Canberra administration, has already dicated that its preference remains for an amalgamation between the ANU and the CCAE at some stage in the future. The Government does not want to hold up the development of this very good instition. tution. and therefore it intends to proceed with a legislative change during this session. It is because there may be an amalgamation in the future that the Government cided that this institution, along with the ANU, should remain subject to Commonwealth legislation to facilitate that process. I wish the Canberra College well in its develto opment in the future. I am sure that as result of these developments the Australian Capital Territory will be extremely well served by higher education opportunities, not only for its own citizens but also for citizens nearby who use the Territory and its higher education institutions.

Furindustry ther, are these aircraft being used to carry domestic passengers when passenger safety could be at risk?",45

Of Hercules aircraft have been used for passenger services. I have flown in them myself. The flight was certainly very basic, but it the job. The aircraft are not flying under control of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) because they are state aircraft, miliders tary aircraft, and therefore, as with all RAAF and Royal Australian Navy aircraft, operate as state aircraft separate from the civil aviation regulatory authority. Nevertheterms, less, they operate to very safe standards. The Air Force regularly flies people other than Air Force personnel, including Governindirect ment Ministers and the Leader of the Opinposition, and many of us are aware of the high quality of the RAAF services. There is no reason to doubt for one moment that those services are not absolutely safe-if that is the allegation that lies behind this quesIndeed, I believe the competence displayed by the pilots flying those aircraft is superb and I have no reason whatsoever to think that the passengers in those aircraft has deare at risk in any way.

101,Mrs HARVEY,Unknown,"My question is directed the Minister for Industrial Relations. I a understand from recent press statements by the Minister that Australia has up to 100,000 compensated cases of occupational back disorders each year, costing the nation an esti,mated $1 billion annually. Could the Minister provide some more detail about this appalling situation and explain what the Government intends doing to reverse this statistic?  cupational back disorders cost Australia $1 billion a year, and the situation is one for serious concern. Preliminary results the Worksafe Australia analysis of back cover the years 1986 and 1987, so Air the figures are a few years old. However, they reveal the rather substantial cost to without taking into account the personal trauma and suffering of people who incur those injuries. It was the first detailed compilation of national workers compensation based statistics conducted in Australia. It was found that of those 100,000 cases, 45,000 involved absences from work for five poor more days, with 16 per cent, or one in of those cases involving people being off course work for more than six months. The industries experiencing the high rate of back disorders include manufacturing, the did wholesale and retail trade, construction, and the health and mining. In the health industry nurses were most affected, with back disoraccounting for some 52 per cent of all other injuries. The most common cause of back disorders is overexertion involving lifting and other forms of manual handling. Put in daily back pain and injury cost industry as much as $4m each working day in compensation costs alone. That does not include costs. It is a major issue in occupational health and safety. The Government, from the time it came to office, gave priority to improving occupational health and safety leading to the establishment of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission in 1984. That operates as Worksafe Australia. The Commission has made occupational back disorders a top priority. It has agreed to a national strategy for their prevention. The Commission has produced a resource kit entitled 'Preventing Back Pain at Work', developed to assist organisations to establish prevention programs or to revamp existing programs to deal effectively with back injuries. The kit is most practical and contains case studies of successful prevention programs, tools to assist in identifying and assessing risk and a comprehensive directory of information. As the honourable member for Hawker is aware from her continuing interest and involvement in the subject, the kit emphasises workplace and job redesign rather than the traditional simplistic approach of training employees to bend their knees. The kit is targeted at chief executive officers, managers responsible for occupational health and safety, and employee representatives. The aim is to promote occupational health and safety as an investment rather than a cost. Very much the aim is to prevent injuries occurring rather that:! trying through other systems to devise a means of compensating people after the injuries have occurred. Worksafe Australia has undertaken research into back injury, including the relationship between reducing back load and its effect on productivity. In conclusion, Worksafe Australia's comprehensive approach to the prevention of occupational back injuries is designed to reduce greatly the enormous burden on industry and the community of this major occupational health problem. NA  ter to his constant advice to the Parliament regarding airline capacity, and particularly to yesterday's statement that the airlines be reconstructed to operate at 60 per cent capacity by next week. Which are the airlines to which he refers? Is the Prime Minister aware that Civil Aviation Authority figures given to a Senate Estimates committee last night show that hi- previously alleged 50 per cent figure includes 3,000 seats on Qantas flights and 1,200 seats on regular commuter services? As Qantas allegedly is not carrying Australian domestic passengers and the commuter airlines are running their scheduled services as normal, why has the Prime Minister continually overstated airlines capacity by some 25 per cent?",45

Australian Airlines expects to increase its capacity substantially this week using its own and leased aircraft. It has indicated that two Boeing 727s, a Boeing 737 and an Airbus from its own fleet and up to five leased aircraft will be available shortly; Australian Airlines today released details of a firm network schedule to operate from 9 October, when the airlines expect that pool capacity will be around 20,000 seats. It is the airlines' observation that 20,000 seats represents more than 60 per cent of the average number of seats normally available.

110,Mr JOHNS,Unknown,"Can the Minister for Community Services and Health inform the House whether the Queensland Government has increased public hospital charges by 30 per cent in less than a year? What is he doing to protect Queenslanders from the effects of such an exorbitant increase? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I submit that questions must relate to the Minister's portfolio. The question as drafted related to the Queensland situation and not directly to the Minister's portfolio.",47
111,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! As I am sure the honourable member for Farrer and other members of the House are aware, the Commonwealth contributes to the cost of hospitals in the States and Territories.",47
112,Dr BLEWETT,Unknown,"I point out to the honourable member"" for Farrer also that he may not be aware that the decisions of the Queensland Government have a direct impact on private insurance, which his colleagues have been talking about constantly. It is therefore very clearly relevant to the interests of the Commonwealth Government. I am aware of the issue raised by the honourable member for Petrie that in the last 11 months the Queensland Government has raised costs for private patients ho-pitals by 30 per cent. It is an inept decision, but I do not suppose it surprises the honourable member for Petrie or most other members of the House that such an inept government as the Queensland Government should make such an inept and irresponsible decision. It is an inept and irresponsible cision on two grounds: first, it ignores entirely the interests of people who pay for private insurance in Queensland; secondly, it is quite careless of the kinds of inflationary pressures that such massive hikes in government charges over a short period occasion. It is important to recognise that it was in only October or November last year that the Queensland Government raised its hospital charges from $130 to $150, a $20 increase. Now, 11 months later, it has raised them by $20, from $150 to $170. That is an increase in 11 months of over twice the rate of inflation. Therefore, the Commonwealth Government refuses to accept that such an increase can be justified on any grounds whatsoever. As I am a reasonable man, I offered the Queensland Government the opportunity to raise the charge by $10, that is, from $150 to $160. That would have been acceptable to the Government and the private insurance funds. It would have beyn a reasonable compromise. But the Queensland Government is incapable of reaching such compromises and has stuck to its $170. That means that private patients in Queensland will have to pay a $10 out-of-pocket payment for those hospital services because they will not be covered by the private insurance funds. It is of interest to note that there are only two governments in Australia which charge private patients in public hospitals $170 a day. They are, of course, the conservative governments <Jf Queensland and New South Wales. No Labor State government has suggested that it would make charges of this order for private patients in public hospitals. The people of Australia should consider the . hollow rhetoric of this Federal Opposition which claims that it is concerned about the contribution"" rates for private insurers when it is its mates, that is, the two conservative State governments in this country, which impose the highest, the most excessive and the most unjustified increases for public hospitals which, in turn, impose severe pressures on in public health contribution rates.

113,Mr HICKS,Unknown,"I refer the Prime Minister to an answer he gave to a question on the Lebanese holocaust which has been occurring for some time. The Prime Minister said de- that Australia is considering making 1,000 places available under the refugee program for refugees who are facing difficult circumstances. What problems would be faced in getting to an Australian outpost by a refugee from Lebanon who seeks refugee status? I refer in particular to Christian Lebanese. What action is the Government taking to alleviate this problem? What is happening about the 1,000 additional places? Where do we stand at the moment?",47
114,Mr HAWKE,Unknown,"I preface my reply to the specifics of the honourable member's question by saying that I am sure he will share my hope that the most recent initiative by the committee of three of the Arab League will lead to an end to the horrendous conflict which has plagued Lebanon and horrified the world for 14 years. I can assure the honourable gentleman that, as I have told the House on previous occasions, we have taken every opportunity available to us in multilateral organisations and bilaterally to press upon those who have any influence at all the need to bring their influence to bear to end that tragedy. As I reminded the House previously, in my recent overseas visit I had at the top of my agenda for the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Germany and France the issue of the Lebanon. The efforts of the three members of the Arab League-Morocco, Algeria and Saudi Arabia-are to be welcomed. We hope that they will lead to a peaceable outcome in the Lebanon. Having said that, let me say in regard to the particular questions asked by the honourable gentleman that I will have to inquire where we are with the 1,000 additional places. I do not have the information at my fingertips but I will try to get it this noon and get a reply to the honourable gentleman. In regard to that part of his question which involves the capacity of people in Lebanon to get to one of our points of contact, he will appreciate that we have not been· able to keep our embassy personnel in Beirut safe with any degree of assuredness on our part. We have had constant representations from our friends within the Lebanese community here that we should restore our representation there so that we can facilitate action upon the sorts of matters that the honourable gentleman refers to. All I can say on that matter is that the best advice that is given to us is that we could not have a guarantee regarding the safety of our personnel. I hope that the honourable gentleman would agree with me that if we cannot be given that guarantee, it is not appropriate to subject Australian diplomatic personnel to safety risks. I acknowledge and understand the honourable gentleman's deep interest in this matter. Not only will I give the answer to the specific question about the 1,000 places that he referred to but also if there is any other relevant information that I think would be of interest to him I will see that it is conveyed to him.

115,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,Has the Minister for Defence noted comments concerning the effectiveness of the support provided by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft during the current pilots dispute? Are the RAAF air crew providing essential and necessary support at this time and in accordance with proper safety standards of the RAAF?,48
116,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"If Opposition members will not qirect their dorothy dixers on the RAAF to me, obviously people on our back bench will be interested in doing so. The pattern of questioning which Opposition members have established here is perfectly consistent with every aspect of their position on the pilots dispute since it began. Since the Opposition spokesperson on defence matters stated in the initial stages of the dispute that he supported the use of RAAF aircraft in 'carrying around the country passengers who needed to be carried around the country, various spokespersons, including his afterdeputy in the Senate, have in some way or another been casting doubt upon that. The latest example came from the honourable member who asked a question about the matter earlier in Question Time. None of the normal peacetime limitations on flying have been exceeded in support of the RAAF's civic domestic operations. I point out one important thing about normal RAAF activities. The RAAF spends a considerable amount of time carrying Defence Force personnel, families of Defence Force personnel, and people in emergency situations. Those people are as precious to this Government as anybody who travels on the civil airlines in normal circumstances, and we want to be assured of their safety in all the circumstances in which they operate. Furthermore, those pilots do not just spend all their time flying in appropriately safe conditions from city to city, as do our domestic airline pilot.s; t-ey spend a considerable amount of their doing extremely difficult and dangerous training in low flying operations in support of troops in simulated combat environments. That is their job. They are safe and effective pilots. They are pilots who operate in circumstances that, in the normal events, are much more severe than those in which anybody in the civilian airlines would operate. The effective attack on the role the RAAF pilots are playing, which has come from Opposition, is a new thing in the framework of discussion in this place except, for the statements of the deputy Opposition spokesman on defence matters in the Senate who, as I have had occasion to remark in this House previously, seems to incite them not to fly in the way in which they have done. I wonder whether in this pilots dispute there are any of the OpposiEven tion's sacred cows that it will not knock over. We on this side of the House wonder exactly how its much vaunted structural justment of the economy will take place if ever gets into office. With what courage will it confront any of the situations .in which may find itself? What capacity does it have to deliver any of the promises it has been making in this place? It has had one clear lead from its former leader, the only person who has pursued a consistent line on any of the matters to which the Opposition norare mally devotes itself. The rest of those oppocome site have wafted about the place saying, 'Look at us; look at us'.",48

128,Mr DUFFY,Unknown,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. This is an area that he has taken a particular interest in over a long period. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade stated on 27 September, Australian policy is to continue to work for a comprehensive solution to the Cambodian problem. This is supported by the Leader of the Opposition. Of course, that solution will come about only if all Cambodians are able to participate in the process of national reconciliation and the reconstruction of their country in the tragic circumstances referred to in the honourable member's question. We, as a government, assess the prospects for a durable settlement to the problem as being better with Khmer Rouge participation, despite its appalling record, than would be the position if they were operating as a guerilla force fighting in what if he is would be a prolonged insurgency. At the Paris conference there was agreement among the Cambodian parties on the need for a new constitution and the formation of a duly elected government following a transitional period. All factions would test their popularity at the polls. As the honourable member is aware, the principal stumbling block that arose was the inability of the Cambodian factions to reach an accommodation among themselves on the sharing of power during that transitional period. The conference was suspended but the co-presidents, France and Indonesia, were empowered to begin consultation within six months with a view to reconvening the conference. We were always concerned that a failure to reach agreement in Paris would lead to a continuation of the fighting. There are reports of intensive fighting in Cambodia. KPNLF forces-the Khmer People's National Liberation Front-are reported to have been advancing into that area. These reports lend urgency to the efforts to achieve the compromise which was attempted in Paris. The Prime Minister of Thailand has held discussions with leaders, including Hun Sen, about the possible cease-fire. Australia will continue to support all of the efforts that are being made towards a political settlement and to hope particularly that those efforts by the Thai Prime Minister will facilitate that.

It is said to be true, but it is one of those mysterious allegations that go around and, as far as I understand it, it has no base. From time to time new personnel who will go into uniform are recruited, but the proportionality of the people who are non-uniformed and who are performing other kinds of back-up duties will remain essentially the same. I will double check on that. My understanding is that there is no plan whatever to usurp the role so capably carried out by my colleague the Minister for Defence. If there were to be any question of promoting me, that of course would have to be decided between the Prime Minister and the Minister. NA",50

I move this motion effectively in substitution for the matter of public importance of which I have given notice. It is the Opposition's view that, as appropriate as it often is for there to be a general debate on a matter of public importance on a daily basis as is our practice, the pilots dispute ought to be treated in a different way. As we talk to people-people in the tourist industry, ordinary Australians, the travelling public, people who are just interested in the well-being of this country-the overriding message, the constant call from every quarter of this country, is that this pilots dispute must be resolved. It is time that this pilots dispute was finally brought to an immediate conclusion. The fact is that this country is looking for a means by which to resolve this dispute. I suppose that one of the characteristics which people will look back to in this dispute is the way in which it was inflamed and perpetuated by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It will be characterised by his refusal to lift a finger to bring this dispute to any sort of conclusion. I believe the Parliament ought to carry this motion today. I say 'the Parliament' because when we look at the people who have been managing this dispute we see that they have made a botch of it. It is not just the Opposition saying that. People like Ivan Hodgson, who is a big arrangewheel in the Australian Council of Trade Unions and one of the Prime Minister's supporters, said of the management of this dispute, 'It is the worse handled dispute I have ever seen'. We say, given the botch that the Government has made of this dispute, that it is time for the Parliament to be a circuitbreaker and to present the options which are available for the settlement of this dispute. The motion of which I have given notice calls attention to several points. Firstly, it notes that this dispute is nearly two months old. It notes that, contrary to all the propaganda we hear from the Prime Minister, his lackeys in the Ministry, and the airlines, there is no end in sight to this dispute. When this Prime Minister declared war on the pilots, instead of blitzing the pilots and bringing the dispute to an immediate end, he declared trench warfare. What do we have with trench warfare? We have devastation on all sides. Is that not the characteristic and the mark of this dispute? Wherever we look-the economy as a whole, our balance of payments, our reputation as a good place to go as a tourist destination, the tourist industry, small businesses-there is no end to the damage being caused by this dispute. It is time for it to be brought to a conclusion. For those in the Caucus who are satisfied by the reassurances of the Prime Minister, let me draw honourable members' attention to the fact that we read in the newspapers, 'Bob's there in the Caucus; there is nothing to worry about, boys; it is nearly all over'. This is the same bloke who, just three weeks ago in the middle of September, is reported in the Melbourne Sun-News Pictorial as saying, 'Before this month is out I believe the dispute will be resolved'. Mr Donald Cameron-When was that?",51
133,Mr REITH,Unknown,"That was in mid-September. It is very interesting when we go back over press clippings to see what these blokes have been saying. The Prime Minister said three weeks ago that this dispute would have been settled by the end of last week. Reference has also been made to carrying capacity. How many times have we heard, 'We will be up to 50 per cent, 60 per cent or whatever'? It is just a mirage. It is all part of the propaganda to make the pilots think that this dispute is subject to very strong resolve on the Government's part and that their position is weak. The fact is that the Gov. ernment ought to wake up to itself. I know and have heard of pilots caught up in this dispute. The one thing that will perpetuate this dispute well into November, and maybe until Christmas, and maybe into next year, is that most of the pilots have their superannuation payments. Some of them have $400,000, $500,000 or $600,000. The Prime Minister has been saying that the pilots have been planning this dispute and maybe they have. The fact is that the pilots have settled down for a long haul. Anybody who realistically believes that this dispute is about to be settled in the next few weeks quite frarikly has only been listening to the Prime Minister. We say that there is no end in sight to this dispute. This dispute will go on and on. We say to the Government that it is about time that it put the propaganda to one side and started to think about the national inter· est. There are only two ways in which this dispute will be settled. I do not think anybody has really doubted that. We get a choice. The first choice is that we can nego· tiate. There has to be negotiation eventually. So we say: why not negotiate now and have the pilots back in the air, the planes flying and the bleeding stopped within days? That is choice number one. That is the option we put to the Government today. The second option relates to the Government's policy. The Government is involved in a war of attrition; the declaration of war; the perpetuation of this dispute; the use of taxpayers' funds to see this dispute go on and on. The Government has an open cheque policy with its hands in the pockets of the taxpayers to see this dispute go on and on. We call, in this motion, on the parties to the dispute to commence negotiations im· mediately. It is clear from talking to the parties and from hearing from the parties that the only thing that is standing in the way of those· planes flying again and an end to the damage being suffered by our economy is the Prime Minister, his ego and the defenceless accord. We say that it is time for negotiation. Paragraph (1) of our motion notes that the dispute is nearly two months old. Paragraph (2) notes the damage being caused to the economy. Paragraph (3) calls on the parties to commence negotiations. This motion is in essence the package put forward in a constructive way by the Leader of the  as a framework within which these negotiations can be conducted. In our motion we put the proposition that the Parliament adopt this solution, that the Parliament, given the vacuum of leadership from the Government, take the leadership on this issue and show the way forward for a resolution. We go into great detail. We say that if the partie!) sit down to negotiate they should do so on certain conditions. They should do so with the objective of the negotiations to provide for the employment of pilots under individual contracts between the airline and each pilot. We say the parties ·to the contract will be the airline and the pilot. We say the parties to the negotiations will be the airlines, or such other persons as they may nominate on their behalf, and the pilots, or such other person or organisation as the pilots may nominate on their own behalf. We say, as a matter of principle, that it is a matter for the pilots whether they wish to have the Australian Federation of Air Pilots act as their agent in the negotiations. I appeal to our colleagues on the other side of the House that that statement is one that they ought to support. It is merely a statement of a basic principle: the freedom of association. There are a few trade union members sitting on the other side. Why would they do other than support this motion? We say that the negotiations should take place before an independent third party or parties agreed upon between the negotiating parties, not as an arbitrator but as a party providing good offices to facilitate those negotiations. We say that the negotiations will aim to reach agreement on productivity gains which can be shared between the pilots and the airlines. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, with the other propositions that we have here in detail we provide a framework for there to be a circuit-breaker for this dispute, something which the country is calling out for.",52
134,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Is the motion seconded?,54
135,Mr JULL,Unknown,"1 second the motion. As this pilots dispute now enters its ei&hth ,,:eek and Australia bleeds, we bring thIs motton to the House because we believe it is time that drastic action is undertaken. As proof of that today, the misinformation campaign that has been fed through this House to the public and the media of Australia in the last six or seven weeks has reached a stage of high farce. We believe that now is the time that the two parties involved-the airlines and the pilots-must get together to try to reSolve this dispute. It is interesting when we look back over the history of this dispute to see what has been fed to the people of Australia. We have only to go back a couple of weeks to the Courier-Mail when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was predicting that 50 per cent of the planes would be flying by the end of the month. On 15 September Sir Peter Abeles said that he had signed up more than 50 pilots and that half the fleet would be flying again soon. Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines announced that Boeing 737s were being hired, as well as three 707s from Europe. Where are the 707s? There is only one in Australia and that is not flying yet. All these aircraft were supposed to have been here between 19 and 24 September. The Prime Minister said on the same day that several senior 737 route captains had signed. Where are they? In the Australian Financial Review the Prime Minister said: I think before this month is out, I believe the dispute will be resolved. Ir:t that same article the Prime Minister predIcted that 50 per cent of domestic passengers would be carried by the end of September, but he believed that that was too - onservative a prediction. On 18 September, 10 the Gold Coast Bulletin, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) said: We will have a number of additional aircraft op- ing. erating this week. We did not. 'By the end of the month' he - d: . . . we will have another half dozen foreign aircraft in Australia. On 4 October where are they? On 18 September the Minister for Industrial Relations  change in the dispute, with a return to near normal domestic flights. It did not happen. In the Sydner Morning Herald of 18 September Mr DIxon of Australian Airlines said that Australian Airlines had two 737-300 aircraft, a 737-400, a 727 and two 707s from overseas. Where are they? In the Australian the Minister for Transport and Communications said: !n the ne-t couple .of weeks we are going to s-e qUite dramatic restoration of scheduled services which means people will be able to make bookin-s with confidence. Forty-eight hours in advance of a flight a person does not have a clue whether he has a seat or whether he can fly.",54
136,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,There are 50 per cent of aircraft operating.,54
137,Mr JULL,Unknown,"It is all very well for the Minister for Defence to sit here. He flies around with the Royal Australian Air Force. My wife came to Canberra today. She left Brisbane on an Ansett flight at 7.00 o'clock this morning and arrived .at 2.10 p.m., with 60 per cent capacity out of Brisbane. The misinformation that is being fed to this House and to the public is appalling and we find that the Prime Minister has been misleading us all the time in terms of the 50 per cent capacity. Out of the mouths of the babesthe Civil Aviation Authority, which appeared before a Senate Estimates committee last night-we finally got the true figures. The true figures as listed for 2 Octoberhonourable members opposite can read th.em-include 3,000 seats flown by Qantas Alrway- Ltd-and Qantas is not carrying domestIc passengers-and 1,200 commuter seats, yet the Authority says that the commuters are flying their normal routes. So, of the 18,545 seats that were available yesterday, 4,200 were not operative. Yet we are told time and again, 'Book with confidence Fifty or 60 per cent of the airlines' capacity is back'. But people cannot get a firm bookNo wonder the tourist industry is bleeding. No wonder the people of north Queensland ' are begging the Prime Minister to go up there. If honourable members opposite think that Senator Richardson got a warm reception in north Queensland when he went there on environmental issues, wait until the Prime Minister goes to Cairns this time. That place is bleeding. The Northern Territory is bleeding; Western Australia is bleeding; and Tasmania is bleeding. The tourist industry has lost $500m and 15,000 people have been stood down. This country is in chaos. The tourist industry has been shot to pieces for the next three to five years. What is the Government doing? It is saying, 'Everything is all right. Don't worry about it. We have 60 per cent of capacity back now. Fifty per cent of normal services have been operating in the last week'. This is high farce. It is about time that the Government came clean on this issue and decided that, for once, the better interests of Australia would be served if negotiations were to start immediately.  ister for Industrial Relations) (3.05) - The Government rejects this motion for the suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders. Of all the hypocrisy! The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who cannot even read the contracts, is lecturing the Government on what it should be doing about air services. He is the ringleader. He, as the agent of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, has aided, abetted, encouraged and given every support to the pilots. Mr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. The motion before the House seeks the suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders so that the Parliament may debate a motion which will provide an immediate solution to the airline pilots dispute. It is not an opportunity for this sort of misrepresentation and smear from this Minister. He ought to be brought back to the motion before the House.",54

If he is now offended, I withdraw it. What we are seeing here is the latest stunt by the Opposition. The honourable· member for Fadden, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock)-I exclude the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who is not present and is not party to this stunt; he is not in this nonsense-throughout the past several weeks have encouraged the Australian Federation of Air Pilots in the destruction and damage that it has been doing to the Australian economy. They are part of it and that is what the motion today is all about. The Opposition knows full well that the matter is before the Industrial Relations Commission. This is what it wanted. The Opposition knows full well that the President of the Industrial Relations Commission has said that, given the past behaviour of the parties involved and the Federation, there was no point in conciliation and the Commission was proceeding to arbitration. Therein lies the whole story. This is a stunt. Today we are seeing an attempt by the Opposition somehow or other to paper over all these views. Why is the former Leader of the Opposition not present? We know why he is not present-he will not have a bar of this. The former Leader of the Opposition, who is responsible for the industrial relations policy of the Opposition, is on record-Mr Jull-Where is Hawke? Where IS Willis?",55
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Mr Shack-There is not one backbencher here.,56
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I warn the honourable member. Opposition members-Which one?,56
151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"There are a number.  people behind me like the honourable member for Flinders needs people behind him, thank you very much. I can do very well by myself. I do not need the Opposition's collective lack of intelligence. What we have seen day after day from the Opposition is a mock concern for this issue and encouragement for the Federation of Air Pilots and the damage that it is about. But the real issues here are wages policy and the management of the economy. The Opposition does not have an industrial relations policy on which· it is united. The former Leader of the Opposition is negating any role for the Federation of Air Pilots. The very body being put forward by the Opposition today is not supported by the former Leader of the Opposition. He is not present. He walked out of the chamber before this matter came on. We are seeing a desperate attempt by the Opposition to bring together its differences and its problems. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said yesterday, 'Boy, didn't you make a mistake when you knocked him off?'. This is the importance that the former Leader of the Opposition places on this issue. We have had this mock concern today. It is a terrible thing. Services are being provided and policies are being held together. But what did the Leader of the Opposition say on 20 September when he was asked about this issue? He was off to Japan to attend the International Democratic Union. He was not concerned about the dispute then. He was asked why he was flying out of the country to attend something called the fourth conference of the International Democratic Union. The Leader of the Opposition said, 'That is a fair enough point, but at the same time, I mean, I have been waffling on this dispute just about every day'.   his words. There is the real measure of the importance the Opposition attaches to this issue. The Opposition in this place stands condemned for the disruption to air services that it has engendered. Out there in voterland the people know that the policy being pursued by this Government in resisting this attempted ransom by the Federation of Air Pilots is the right course. They are right behind it. They do not want the economy destroyed. They do not want a wages explosion. They do not want an explosion of inflation and massive unemployment. They want their jobs. They want stability. Industry wants stability. The shadow Minister for industrial relations, Senator Chaney, is saying that he cannot get industry to support the policy that the Opposition has put together. What does he do? He attacks industry and business because they are supporting the accord. That is how irrelevant the members of the Opposition are on industrial relations matters. That is how irrelevant they are on this issue. They have no sense of genuineness about what is being said here today. They do not give a damn about the disruption being caused to the airline system. The honourable member for Fadden came in here ranting and raving about the tourism industry. Look at what is happening; there is destruction, he says. What does he do? He gets on the phone this afternoon saying, 'Hello, is that you, Brian? What is the latest? How many planes aren't flying? How much longer can you hold these people out? How much longer can you hold up the air services in this country?'. If he had one little bit of decency and integrity in him he would have been on the phone to encourage those pilots he knows in Brisbane, the older, more sensible and wiser ones, to get back to work. The Commission has said-Mr Reith-It is irrelevant.  member said the Commission is irrelevant. This indicates how concerned the Opposition is about this issue. The Commission said in its decision that it does not sibility of the Federation being made a party to any award, notwithstanding the strong arguments to the 'contrary put by the employers in some interventionary proceedings. In the Commission's view, the restoration of its former status and the airlines operation industry can be achieved only by the Federation's participation in the award making process. The honourable member for Fadden is saying to forget that and go out. Honourable members should listen to this absolute gem-bearing in mind that we are eight weeks down the track-from the greybeards opposite. The Opposition has said that during the negotiations normal flights will be resumed on the former terms of employment and all legal proceedings will be suspended. In other words, we are back to square one. Those days have gone. The industry which is being rebuilt now is a new industry; a leaner, meaner, more efficient and competitive industry. There is no turning back the clock. If the Opposition is fair dinkum in what it is about the honourable member for Fadden should encourage his friends to get back to work and sign up their agreements. Their award can be developed, as the Commission has indicated. They will select for themselves the organisation which they want to represent them on industrial matters. I reject the motion moved by the Opposition. It only highlights its lack of integrity on this issue. It sank to the absolute pits in Question Time when it attacked the young personnel of the Royal Australian Air Force who are doing an absolutely sterling job in this country. The honourable member for Fadden made his bed; he can lie in it. Question put: That the motion (Mr Reith's) be agreed to. The House divided. (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr J. G.

168,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"CharltonMinister for Land Transport and Shipping Woods, R. L. Wooldridge, M. R. L. Support) (3.47)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. NA The purpose. of this Bill is to provide for the Humphreys, B. C. Jakobsen, C. A. imposition of a levy on pasture seed produced in Australia, as requested by the Grains Johns, G. T. Jones, Barry Council of Australia as the body representing pasture seed growers, The funds raised by Kerr, D. J. C. Lamb, A. H. (Teller) the levy will be used to finance a pasture seed research scheme. The Government will Lavarch, M. H. Lee, M. J. provide funding to match industry levies as part of its broad program of encouraging MCHugh, J. Martin, S. P. increased rural productivity through research. Before speaking on the Bill itself, I Morris, Allan Morris, Peter should place this current research initiative in the context of the research arrangement O'Neil, L. R. T. Price, L. R. S. in place and the changes which are planned following the release in May 1989 of the joint ministerial statement on research in the primary industries and energy portfolio. The Government has placed a great deal of emphasis on the administration and funding of rural research in Australia with a view to further improving the contribution of the rural sector to the national economy. The first major step in this process was the passage of the Rural Industries Research Act in 1985. The research councils established under that Act and portfolio research and development corporations established under separate Commonwealth legislation administer commercially oriented research programs with a total budget of $141 m in the current year. Consistent with the policy reflected in the Rural Industries Research Act, the Government has encouraged rural industries to increase their contribution to existing schemes up to at least 0.5 per cent of gross value of domestic product. It has demonstrated its commitment to match industry funding dollar for dollar to the 0.5 per cent level and it has also encouraged new schemes such as the proposed pasture seed scheme which is the subject of the Bill before the House. Rural research is the biggest single Budget item within the primary, industries and energy portfolio with 1989-90 expenditure expected to be $80m. As reflected in the May 1989 research statement, the Government has continued to explore avenues to increase the benefits to the individual industries and to the community in general of the significant level of research expenditure. Research and development corporations have been identified as haying advantages over the research council and other administrative structures for funding research and development in respect of administrative and funding efficiency and effectiveness. The corporations will become the model for revised research and development funding arrangements. The Government will be holding discussions with industries on the specific research arrangements to apply and will be presenting a Bill for an Act to replace Ute Rural Industries Research Act and other arrangements to implement those changes. In addition a Primary Industries and Energy Research Council will be established to promote a high policy forum and networking facility for research and development, to ther develop consultation on research and development policies and to improve the linkages between portfolio programs and the efforts of outside research organisations. The proposed pasture seed research scheme will be administered initially by the existing Australian Special Rural Research Council. The funds to be raised by the levy would be insufficient to justify the establishment and maintenance of an industry specific research council. As a body catering for research into a number of emerging industries, incorporation within the Special Research Council will ensure that administration costs are in reasonable balance with total expenditure on research. Under the proposals for future research and development arrangements being developed by the Government, the Special Research Council will be replaced by the proposed Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, and it is envisaged that, in the first instance, the proposed pasture seed research scheme will become a responsibility of this Corporation. Turning now to the Bill before the House, the pasture seed industry makes a contribution of fundamental importance to Australia's livestock and pastoral enterprises through the provision of bulk quantities of pasture seed of the required quality and varieties for pasture production. The development in recent years of significant export markets for Australian pasture seed has added a further dimension to the industry's importance as a contributor to regional economies. Pasture seed production occurs throughout Australia but predominantly in the temperate areas of South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia and New South Wales. Annual gross value of production of pasture seed has been estimated at $57m, while export earnings have been around $lOm per annum. Pasture seed research to date has been funded mainly by State government and livestock industry research schemes. To support the industry's continuing role in domestic agriculture and encourage the further development of export opportunities, Australian pasture seed growers have identified the need for an expanded research program into production, storage, transport and marketing of pasture seed. The establishment of a joint fur- Commonwealth-industry scheme will broaden the industry's research funding base and assist in enabling the industry to achieve its full potential. In view of the widespread and significant production of pasture seed in Australia and the administrative problems that would likely occur in effectively levying all production, the pasture seed industry agreed that only certified seed of certain pasture species and cultivars be levied. The levy will apply initially to specified certified seed of clovers, medics and lucerne produced in Australia. Provision is made for certified of other pasture seed species and cultivars to be added to the scheme. As marked variations in value can occur both within and between species of pasture seed, the legislation provides for different operative rates of levy for different leviable cultivars. On commencement of the scheme, certified seed of the medic, clover and lucerne cultivars set out in a schedule to the Act will attract a levy of $7.50, $10 and $12.50 per tonne respectively. The legislation provides for new operative rates to be added and for existing rates to be varied by instrument. The maximum rate for anyone cultivar is established by the Act at $50 per tonne. The legislation requires that the growers' organisation recommend any variations to the levy rates and the pasture seed to be covered by the scheme. the levy is payable by the grower and will be collected on the Commonwealth's behalf by State or Territory government departments responsible for seed certification. government Ministers in all States in which leviable seed is produced have agreed to these arrangements and a formal agreement between the Commonwealth and each participating State covering the collection arrangements will be put in place. Inclusion in the scheme of further pasture seeds which are also grown in States other than those currently participating in the scheme would be dependent on agreement being reached by all States in which the additional seeds are grown. Amounts equal to the levy will be paid into a separate account established for the purpose of the Australian Special Rural Research Fund. The Commonwealth's matching contribution will be up to a maximum level equal to 0.5 per cent of the average gross value of leviable pasture seed production. It is expected that in the first year of operation, the levy will raise $106,000. The Australian Special Rural Research Council will therefore have scope for an annual pasture seed research program of the order of $200,000. The commencement date of this legislation will be on royal assent. It is intended that the levy be imposed on pasture seed produced in the 1989-90 harvest and the research program commence in 1990-91.

170,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is an omnibus Bill for legislation administered within the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio. The Bill covers amendments to the Wool Marketing Act 1987, Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Act 1985, Honey Levy Collection Act 1962, Honey Marketing Act 1988, Soil Conservation (Financial Assistance) Act 1985, Barley Research Levy Collection Act 1980, Oilseeds Levy Collection Act 1977, Oilseeds Levy Act 1977, Rural Industries Research Act 1985 and the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 and repeals the Bass Strait Freight Adjustment Levy Act 1984, Bass Strait Freight Adjustment Levy Collection Act 1984, Bass Strait Freight Adjustment Trust Fund Act 1984 and Customs Tariff (Stand-By) Duty Act 1985. I wish to cover the more significant amendments to be made by the Bill. ' There are a number of amendments to be made to the Wool Marketing Act 1987. The most important amendment to that Act relates to the statutory arrangements for wool research and development. Wool remains our most important commodity export, worth around $6 billion in 1988-89. In a world context, although less than 15 per cent of the world's sheep flock is in Australia, we produce around three-quarters of the apparel wool traded internationally. Australia's wool industry is, therefore, at the forefront interCommittee nationally, but we must continue to make improvements if the industry is to remain competitive on world markets. The key to further productivity gains, both on and off the farm, lies in effective research and development efforts. The Wool Research and Development Fund is by far the largest fund established under the Government's rural industry research policies with a $56m expenditure program planned for 1989-90. If these funds are to be used most effici-ntly and effectively, we need to ensure that the administrative arrangements are of the highest calibre. To this end, extensive discussions have been held between the Wool Council of Australia, the representative body of the wool growers, and the Minister for Primary Industries .and Energy (Mr Kerin), and agreement has been reached on several changes to wool research and development arrangements. In making these changes, the Government has taken into account the established domestic and international links between research, promotion and marketing in the wool industry. The purposes of the changes are to increase industry involvement in the determination of long-term research and development strategies and to facilitate the commercial exploitation of the results of research and development efforts. Changes will be made to the constitution of the Wool Research and Development Council, and to the selection procedures for its members. Accountability of the Council to the industry and the Minister will also be strengthened. The membership of the Council is to consist of a chairperson selected by the Minister, in consultation with the Australian Wool Corporation chairperson; a Government member selected by the Minister; an Executive Director selected jointly by the Wool Corporation Managing Director and the Council chairperson; and seven other members selected by the Australian Wool Industry Selection Committee. All members, except the Executive Director, will be part-time members and will hold office for up to three years-except the Government member who is appointed at the Minister's pleasure-and are eligible for reappointment. The composition, functions and powers of the Australian Wool Industry Selection for the purposes of selection of members of the Council, is to be the same as for the selection of Wool Corporation directors. Selections made by the Committee for the Council will be against specific areas of expertise listed in the Act, and will put forward those persons who will best ensure the members of the Council collectively possess the listed areas of expertise. These arrangements should provide the Council with a broader range of expertise amongst its members than has been the case in the past. The Selection Committee will invite the Wool Corporation and the Wool Council to nominate persons to it for consideration. To ensure that an effective linkage between the Corporation and Council is maintained, the nominations forwarded to the Minister by the Selection Committee shall contain up to three persons from those nominated by the Corporation. The Selection Committee will also be able to advertise nationally for applications and will be able to engage the services of an executive search consultant in the selection process. In order to ensure that there are no undue disruptions during the period between the passage of the legislation and the appointment of a new Council, transitional proviare sions have been included in this Bill. Those persons who currently hold office shall conregistration tinue to do so; in the case of the chairperson for the remainder of his appointment, or the case of the remaining members until the end of their appointment or until the Minregulations, ister terminates the appointment. It is the Minister's intention that the new selection arrangements for the Council will be actiing vated early in the new year, with a view appointments of these seven members being made by April 1990. ' Consultation between the Council and the industry and accountability to the industry is an important element of the new arrangements. In the preparation of the research and development plan and annual program, the Council is to consult with the Wool Council and other departments or agencies' and to take into consideration any comments these bodies may have. Research and develpricing opment plans and programs are to be subfreight mitted by the Council chairperson, through the Wool Corporation, to the Minister for agreement. The five-year research and develcompanies opment plans will also be 'rolling' plans enable adjustments to be made during the period specified in the plan. The Council report in a separate' annual report to the Minister, which will be tabled in Parliament, and to the industry. The final important alteration to the wool research and development arrangements relates to the commercial exploitation of the, results of research. Through amendments in this Bill, tile Wool Corporation will be able to carry out activities relating to the mercial exploitation of results using wool research and development fund moneys upon the recommendation of the Council. In conto junction with this innovation, the Wool Cortransaction. poration, subject to ministerial approval under section 11 of the Act, will be able establish a technology adoption company. commercialise the results of research suptency ported by the fund. The Bill also makes amendments relating to refunds of the market support fund portion of wool tax to clarify the timing of the payment of the refund and to provide a means of making inspections to ensure that the provisions of the Act relating to refunds being complied with. Additionally, the Bill provides for inspections to be made for purposes of wool sampling sites, show floors or testing laboratories involved in in the export wool trade. Theregistrations, which are effected under the wool marketing assist in ensuring that wool which is exported meets certain quality standards. The final amendments to the Wool MarketAct covered by this Bill relate to the to consequential amendments arising from the repeal of the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Act 1981 under the schedule of the Bill. I turn to the Bass Strait Freight Adjustment Levy Act 1984, the Bass Strait Freight Adjustment Levy Collection Act 1984, the Bass Strait Freight Adjustment Trust Fund Act 1984 and the Customs Tariff (Stand-By) Duty Act 1985. The Bill will repeal these Acts which gave effect to the import parity policy and the Bass Strait coastal adjustment scheme which were terminated in 1987. The Acts were not terminated immediately to ensure that the oil discharged their obligations under to the Bass Strait crude oil allocation scheme, which previously prescribed the amount of will crude oil produced in the Bass Strait that Australia's oil companies were obliged to buy. The scheme has now been successfully concluded, and the Acts can be duly repealed. There are two amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation Act 1985. The first, to section 7, implements the original intention of the Act in relation to investcomment, in that the Corporation will be empowered to invest surplus funds in specified classes of securities without the requirement obtain prior ministerial approval for each Subparagraph 24 (l) (a) (ii) of the Act, relating to lodgement of notices of to motion to be put before the annual general to meeting, is amended to remove an inconsisin the Act which resulted from amendments made in 1987. The amendment to the Honey Levy Collection Act 1962 is aimed at simplifying procedures and reducing the cost to industry of collecting levies. Proceeds of the levies fund the operations of the Australian Honey Board and provide industry contributions to honey research programs. The proposed amendments provide for monthly levy payers who believe that their liability in a particular year will be less than $100 a month for at least seven months or $1,200 for the full year to apply for exemption and instead pay annually. These amendments are being introduced with the concurrence of industry. They will impose no additional cost to the Government but are expected to reduce the cost to industry of levy collections. The amendments to the Honey Marketing Act 1988, which establishes the Australian Honey Board, correct a spelling error and clarify the sunset provision of the Act. Subsection 62 (1) at present provides for the Act to cease to apply six years after its commencement. As some provisions of the Act commenced with royal assent on 11 May 1988 and the remainder became operative upon proclamation on 1 January 1989, there is ambiguity as to cessation date. The amendment will clarify the Act by specifying six years from the date of royal assent. The Soil Conservation (Financial Assistance) Act 1985 currently provides for a committee with a maximum membership of seven, to make recommendations to the Minister with respect to priorities and strategies for activities by the Commonwealth relating to soil conservation and for matters relevant to the operation of the Act. An increase in' the membership of the committee is required to successfully implement the change in operation of the national soil conservation program from a project to program based approach and also retain the range of expertise on the committee at times when some members are unable to attend meetings. The national soil conservation program has recently had its budget increased by more than 100 per cent to $23.4m in 1989-90 with a commitment by the Government to provide a total of $260m over the next 10 years to the program. The program itself has been restructured so that funding is now provided under four sub-programs: community landcare support; research; major support and public awareness; education and training. It is intended that the committee will become more proactive in recommending projects for funding under the various subprograms and accordingly an expansion to a 12 member committee drawn from State government, conservation, farmer, academic and local government interests is proposed to replace the original seven-member body. I turn now to the Barley Research Levy Collection Act 1980, the Oilseeds Levy Collection Act 1977 and the Oil seeds Levy Act 1977. The aim of the amendments is to standardise collection periods, and enable consolidation of return forms for levies collected under the various grain levy legislation. The Grains Council of Australia has indicated full support for the amendments, which should lead to savings in administrative effort for some levy payers. These savings would arise by removing confusion caused by the present variations in collecting periods, and by reducing the number of returns to be submitted from a maximum of 20 to four per year. The Wheat Marketing Act 1989 is being amended to correct an anomaly in regard to the Australian Wheat Board's borrowing powers. As the Act now stands, the Whe-t Board can fund advance payments to wheat growers only by borrowing money, whereas it can raise finance for any other purpose by either borrowing or by dealing with securi- . ties. The Board raises the bulk of its moneys for advance payments by dealing with securities under facilities which in some cases have been in place for a number of years. There was never any intention to limit the Board's access to the full range of funding mechanisms offered by the market by having different wording ih the relevant sections of the Act which relate to these separate financing activities. The amendment also makes it clear that since a proportion of the finance raised to fund advance payments is underwritten by the Commonwealth, any payment to the Board to meet that liability must be used to repay those outstanding borrowings. In addition, the amendments enable the research component of funds raised under the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Act 1989 to be transferred to the Wheat Research Trust Fund. Under the Wheat Marketing Act 1989, the Grains Council of Australia determines an operative levy rate each year for the purposes of the Wheat Research Trust Fund and the Wheat Industry Fund. On the recommendation of the Grains Council regulations have been made setting the wheat levy at 2.5 per cent for the 1989-90 season, apportioning it such that 2 per cent will be used for the Wheat Industry Fund and 0.5 per cent will be used for the Wheat Research Trust Fund. Amendments to the Rural Industries Research Act 1985 are now required to enable the portion of the levy intended for research to be directed to the Wheat Research Trust Fund. In the absence of these amendments, funds levied from the wheat industry for the purposes of research are unavailable for use by the State research committees. This money will remain in Consolidated Revenlle llntil a mechanism for its release is enacted. These amendments provide the necessary mechanism. As the 1989-90 wheat harvest will not begin in earnest until October, very little money has been levied under the new arrangements. Only old season crop delivered after 1 July this year has so far been subject to the levy. Nevertheless, to ensure that those funds which have already been levied under the new arrangements are made available for their intended purpose, the amendments will be effective from 1 July 1989. This is not a retrospective tax. The money in question has already been raised. The amendment is retrospective only in that it will ensure that money which has already been levied for wheat research will be made available to the State wheat research committees. None of the proposed amendments have any significant financial impact. I commend the Bill to the House, and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Beale) adjourned. NA NA BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Robert Brown, for Mr Duffy, and read a first time. Second Reading",62
171,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of research and development corporations in the primary industries and energy portfolio to replace the present research councils and committees which administer the allocation of research and development (R & D) program funds. The Bill recognises the need for closer involvement of industry in determining the objectives of research and development. It will bring about improvements in the organisation and administration of research and development. These improvements will enable the expenditure of research funds to be conducted in a more autonomous and flexible manner. As part of its overall review of science and technology policies, the Government has recognised the need for a more integrated approach to research policy across. the primary and energy industries. The Government proposes to make research and development in this area more efficient and effective while continuing to produce results relevant to industry needs. The changes proposed are in three major areas: funding, coordination and evaluation of research efforts. The Government considers that there is a need for more research-industry interaction and the arrangements proposed in this Bill are designed to address this need. This .Bill builds on the outstanding record of this Government in encouraging research in the primary and energy industries. In the research, innovation and competitiveness statement, made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) in May 1989, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to continued matching of industry levies for funding of R&D in the rural industries up to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production. This follows the proposals, contained in the Government's 1988 'policies for growth' statement, that all rural industries participating in the arrangements should aim for a levy of 0.5 per cent of gross value of production by 1992. The current Commonwealth contribution averages around 0.29 per cent of gross value of production over all industries currently receiving Commonwealth funds. In 1989-90, the combined value of Government-industry funding for rural industry research will approximately $141m. Under the new arcountability rangements, this amount should increase industries R&D. 1990-91. The Government will continue to fund soil, water and energy R&D from R&D appropriations. In 1989-90 funding in this area was approximately $25m. The Governtechnology ment will also continue the coal research levy and introduce new arrangements for forestry R&D. The new arrangements contained in this Bill will enhance the capacity of Australia's primary and energy industries to innovate and adjust. In particular, the Bill sets out arrangements for the establishment of search and development corporations and the tion. preferred structure for the administration of R&D program funds. The Government and considers that the corporate form of adminlished istration will give the best results because the operating and financial flexibility it will bring. The proposed R&D corporations will provide strategic leadership to industry corporation. R&D and act as a catalyst to stimulate R&D interest within industry. They will take a pro-active role in identifying and ing gaps in the research effort. It is expected that the R&D corporations, operating on more commercial basis, will be able to exwere pand the level of resources available for R&D, improve the efficiency with which R&D moneys are spent and bring a focus to funding R· & D in high pay off areas. The Government expects the new corposure· rations to improve the adoption results. This should demonstrate the benefits of increased R&D funding. In turn this should encourage industry to increase levies beyond the level which attracts matched grants from the Commonwealth. Commonwealth contributions should ideally be seen as seed money to encourage industry contributions. The new R&D corporations will have a key role in generating, as well as allocating, money ·for R&D. The objectives for R&D corporations set out in the Bill are: increasing the economic, environmental and social benefits to the rural and wider community; promoting the sustainable use and management of natural resources; lI1aking more effective use· of the community's resources and of the skills of be the scientific community; and improving acfor expenditure on primary inIn the Bill, the definition of research which corporations fund is deliberately wide. It covers any experimentation· in science, or economics which is carried out with a view to improving production, processing, storage, transport and marketing in . these industries. It is envisaged that R&D corporations will initially be established in the dairy, grain, coal, natural resources and energy industries and in those existing rural industry research councils where the industry redecides on an independent R&D corporaAdditionally, a Rural Industries Research Development Corporation will be estabto cover the present Australian Special of Rural Research Council. This corporation will also cover those industries which decide not to form an R&D corporation in their own right nor to merge with another R&D It is expected· that most R&D corporations will be established from 1 July 1990 fillunder r-gulations in accordance with the provisions of this Bill, although a start before a that date would be possible if an industry willing to make the necessary arrangements. The Bill also contains provisions to cover the transitional period. The Minister seeks a contribution from those involved in the present administrative structures to enthat there will be a smooth transition of research to incorporation. The proposed R&D corporations will be bodies corporate. They will have the power to apply for patents or otherwise manage intellectual property; to set up their own committees; to employ staff and set terms and conditions for their employment; to charge for services. and information; tq enter .. into agreements or joint ventures for R&D activities; to act as trustee for money or property; to accept gifts or bequests; to acquire real or personal property; and to form companies. The corporations will also be able to borrow or raise money with the written approval of the Minister. The corporations will be required to prepare R&D plans in consultation with their industries or constituent groups. Each board will establish the priorities and focus of its corporation's operations. The resultant plans will outline objectives for a five-year period and the strategies and policies they intend to adopt. In addition, R&D corporations will be required to prepare an operational plan for each financial year, consistent with the five year R&D plan. This annual plan will specify the broad groupings of R&D activities the corporation proposes to fund in that year, the likely administrative expenses and the expected receipts. The plans will be submitted to the Minister, who examines their consistency with the overall strategic direction proposed in the five year R&D plans and approves them. The R&D corporations will be responsible to the Minister for carrying out these plans. The Government considers that this process should enhance the corporations' capaci,ty to direct research and development towards achieving industry endorsed objectives. In addition to coordinating and funding R&D activities consistent with their annual operational plans, the corporations will monitor and evaluate those activities. They will not simply play a passive role in allocating money. Evaluation of projects will be done against an assessment of industry needs and objectives as embodied in the strategic plans. The corporations are also charged with facilitating the dissemination, adoption and commercialisation of research results. This is a very important part of their function. It is through technology transfer that research results can be put into practice, and progress can be made towards greater innovation and commercialisation in industry. The Government expects these new arrangements to maximise the returns on the money spent. Research and development is vital to the profitability of the primary and energy industries and increased concentration is needed to ensure that research results are not wasted. The effective use of networking will play a major role in assisting R&D corporations to increase their effectiveness and to encour"" age greater investment. R&D corporations will be responsible for developing close liaison with each other. This will do much to ensure informed decision making and collaboration between corporations. It will assist in reducing unnecessary duplication and provide flexibility. It may also result in joint funding of projects and sharing of results. their Although the R&D corporations are designed to be autonomous, the Government also proposes that they should be accountable to the providers of the funds. In addition to the five year strategic plans and annual operational plans, the corporations will be required to provide an annual report to be tabled in the Parliament. The corporations will be subject to the requirements of the Audit Act. Annual reports will address performance against the key elements identified in the strategic plans. Corporations will also be accountable to the industry, which supplies a significant proportion of their funds, through the presentation of annual reports or by way of an annual general meeting. Annual reports should contain enough information to allow the industry to make a comprehensive assessment of the value of the R&D activities undertaken. Corporations will consist of nine directors, comprising a chairperson, a government nominated director, six directors nominated by an independent selection committee and an executive director. The chairperson will be selected by the Minister, as will the Government director. The Minister will be looking for chairpersons with strong leadership and strategic skills, experience in commercial management and an appreciation of the vital role of R&D in enhancing industry performance. The Government director will also be selected on the basis of expertise in R&D management and experience and knowledge of Government policy processes. The continued Government involvement in these appointments reflects our desire to play a role commensurate with the Commonwealth financial contribution. The executive director will be selected by the corporations. This person has a key role, being an .ex officio director of the board as well as the day-today manager of a corporation's operations. Corporations will also be empowered to employ professional staff on terms and conditions determined by the boards. The Bill sets out arrangements for the constitution of independent selection committees designed to ensure the best available people are selected for appointment as directors, also on the basis of their expertise. This is a change from the previous arrangement where there was a common selection committee for all research councils. Separate selection committees for each industry will allow the relevant industry to have a greater influence in the selection process. These selection committees will be set up on an 'ad hoc' basis. The Minister will appoint the presiding member and he or she will have the responsibility of establishing a committee when a selection task arises. The committee will be disbanded when the selection process has been completed. The committee will comprise three to six persons nominated by the dominant industry organisations. In those cases where the corporation is funded predominantly from appropriations, the Minister will have the opportunity to appoint persons of his or her choosing to the selection committee. One advantage of ad hoc selection committees is that they can be tailored to suit immediate needs, b.oth in numbers and expertise. A specific example is scientific expertise which will be of importance to selection committees for all corporations. The Minister will write to the industries concerned about the importance of scientific representation on the selection committees and the need to take this into account in making their. nominations. Since selection committees will be formed only when required, it is considered appropriate that members of selection committees should themselves be eligible for consideration as board directors in any subsequent selection process. To safeguard against conflicts of interests, however, members of the Executives of industry bodies will not be eligible for nomination as board directors. Selection committees will' be required to nominate person- for appointment to R&D corporations on the basis of expertise in one or more of the fields of commodity production; processing or marketing; natural resource conservation or management; science, technology and technology transfer; environmental and ecological matters; economics; administration of R&D; and finance or business management. While it is expected that boards should be nominated on the basis of achieving a balance of skills it is not expected that all criteria must be met for every board. The Minister does, however, see that in striking a balance selection committees will maintain the need for certain specific expertise areas to be covered, such as scientific expertise. I now turn to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, which will operate under different arrangements. The Rural Industries R&D Corporation will incorporate the present Australian Special Rural Research Fund which funds small industry, multi-industry and national interest R&D for rural industries. The Rural Industries R&D Corporation will essentially be established on the same footing as other corporations under the legislation. In addition, it will provide a facility for incorporating councils for those industries which have decided not to opt for a separate R&D corporation nor to merge with another corporation. Where this occurs, special arrangements will be introduced to ensure that those councils and their industries are not disadvantaged by incorporation as an R&D council within the Rural Industries R&D Corporation. The R&D councils established under the Rural Industries R&D Corporation will control their own funds, continue to have a separate selection process and be responsible for their own strategic plans and annual reports. Specifically, R&D councils' responsibilities will include, as for corporations, the preparation of five-year strategic R&D plans in consultation with their industries, and annual operational plans designed to focus their activities around industry endorsed objectives. Again, as for corporations, they will be required to fund and monitor research, facilitate the dissemination, adoption and commercialisation of results of research and report annually to the Minister on their activities. R&D councils will be accountable to their representative organisations through their annual reports and will be subject to the requirements of the Audit Act. Councils, however, will not be bodies corporate and will not be empowered to borrow funds, enter into agreements, take out patents, form companies and so on. But they will, as part of the Rural Industries R&D Corporation, be able to call on it to perform such functions on their behalf. R&D councils will not be required to contribute to the Rural Industries R&D Corporation overheads and costs associated with the board of the corporation. They will only have to meet the cost on a user pays basis for services requested by them for the corporation to perform or which they have a statutory obligation to meet; that is, enterbility ing into agreements and paying their audit fees. R&D Councils will be established on the same basis as research councils under the present Rural Industries Research Act. They will consist of up to nine members: a chairperson, a Government member and three to . seven other members. The chairpersons and Government members will be selected by the Minister and the other members will be selected by an independent selection committee. The Minister will app()int the chairperson and one member, on the basis of scientific expertise, as a core group to the selection committee. When selections are to be made for the Rural Industry R&D Corporation or the councils, three nominees from the representative organisation will be appointed to join the core group. The measures set out in this Bill will involve Commonwealth outlays of a one-off nature at the time of establishment of each corporation. This relates to the need to transfer reserves of present funds to the new R&D corporations. On present indications amounts of approximately $3.5m to 4m in 1989-90 and approximately $76m in future years are indicated. The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), in consultation with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), will determine the exact timing of the transfer of these reserves. Costs for establishing new R&D corporations will be met from current program funds. Administration matters will be transferred from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to the R&D corporations, but it is not expected that this will result in higher costs to industry, as administrative costs are already cost recovered from research council funds. There may, in fact, be cost savings to industry in that the corporations will be free to share staff and premises if they consider this appropriate and can locate in whatever part of the country they consider most beneficial. The ability to undertake fund raising beyond the levy collection process will also increase their capacity to offset such costs. The Commonwealth will, of course, continue to contribute to a proportion of administrative costs in the rural sector by virtue of the 50 per cent matching of levies. The major impact of the Bill will be in providing flexiand autonomy to the administration of research and development and in providing industry with a greater influence on the objectives towards which research and development expenditure is directed. The Government considers that this is necessary if industry is to recognise the value of research and development expenditure and invest more in this area. This is vital if our primary and energy industries are to remain competitive and profitable in a rapidly changing world. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.

The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No.2) will make a number of amendments to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act to give effect to sales tax changes announced in the environment statement of 20 July 1989 and in the 1989-90 Budget. Certain recycled paper products The Bill will ensure that certain paper products are exempt from sales tax, if all the paper in the goods has been manufactured from recycled paper. The revenue effect of the amendment, which will operate with effect from tomorrow, is estimated to be less than $500,000 in a full year. Honourable members will recall that when this initiative was announced the Prime Minister foreshadowed a further review to determine the practicability of expanding the range of goods made of recycled paper that are to be exempt from sales tax. An announcement about the outcome of the review will be made shortly. Goods for use by sub-contractors on behalf of manufacturers The Bill gives effect to the proposal announced in the 1989-90 Budget to extend the range of goods to be exempt from sales tax where those goods are for use by a subcontractor exclusively in carrying out activities on behalf of one or more manufacturers. The exemption is to be available only if each manufacturer could have obtained exemption for the goods under the existing 'aids to manufacture' provisions of the sales tax law had the manufacturer acquired and used the goods to carry out the contracted activities. This change will operate from today and is estimated to cost $3m in 1989-90 and $5m in 1990-91. Small manufacturers The Bill will increase the small manufacturer exemption thresholds. From today, sales of goods by a small manufacturer with average annual sales of $50,000 or less may qualify for exemption from sales tax. Similarly, goods manufactured by a manufacturer may be exempt if the sales tax that would have been payable by the manufacturer does not exceed $1,000 per annum. Manufacturers who qualify for exemption in respect of goods they sell are unable to obtain free of tax inputs to the manufacturer of those goods such as raw materials and aids to manufacture. The net cost to revenue of increasing these thresholds is estimated to be $8m in 1989-90 and $l1m in a full year. Flavoured milk , Finally, the sales tax law is being amended so that, effective from 16 August 1989, flavoured milk drinks that contain at least 90 per cent milk are subject to tax at the concessional rate of 10 per cent. This reduction from the earlier 95 per cent content requirement was announced in the 1989-90 Budget. I present the explanatory memorandum which contains more' detailed explanations of the provisions of this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Beale) adjourned. INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1989 Bill presented by Mr Robert Brown, and read a first time. Second Reading",66
172,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Part 2 of this Bill amends the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act 1970. Honourable members will recall that late last year they considered legislation which cleared the way for the reorganisation of the Australian Industry Development Corporation or the AIDC as it is otherwise known. The reorganisation saw the bulk of the Corporation's business transferred to a new subsidiary company, AIDCLtd. The new company was then listed on the Australian stock exchange and ultimately up to 30 per cent of its shares will be offered to the public. As part of the reorganisation the Corporation was to carry out Treasury operations on behalf of AIDC Ltd: that is, undertake borrowings, engage in interest rate, currency and foreign exchange agreements as well as futures contracts on behalf of the company. Such activities are categorised under the AIDC Act as non-transferring assets and liabilities. While the Corporation was to remain the contracting party to such agreements it was always intended that the actual benefits and costs associated with these non-transferring assets and liabilities would be transferred to the subsidiary. To reflect this position, it was decided to treat these non-transferring assets and liabilities that were in substance part of the transferred business, as being assets and liabilities of the subsidiary for income tax purposes. However, it has now become apparent that the earlier amendments to the AIDC Act fall short of achieving this result. Non-transferring assets arising out of the above exchange agreements, et cetera, which were intended to be treated as assets of the subsidiary for tax purposes, have actually remained with the Corporation for such poses. This Bill seeks to amend the AIDC Act so that, for tax purposes, the relevant nontransferring assets are transferred to the subof sidiary and the subsidiary is deemed to be the same tax position in relation to the as the Corporation was prior to the transfer. Another aspect of the reorganisation was the transfer of the Corporation's staff to AIDC Ltd. This necessitates the broadening of the Corporation's and Chief Executive's delegaoffences tion powers to include employees of the subin sidiary. The establishment of AIDC Ltd saw the Government examine the Corporareadily tion's use of the Commonwealth guarantee. While the subsidiary itself is not guaranteed, the Corporation will act as the borrowing vehicle for the company. Accordingly it was decided to continue the Commonwealth's guarantee under an agreement entered into by the Corporation until 1 July 1994. remove the guarantee any earlier would have created an unacceptable degree of uncermade tainty not only for lenders to and other parties involved with the Corporation also for the subsidiary as it tries to establish itself in the marketplace. The Commonarise wealth guarantee will continue to apply borrowings and other obligations entered into by the Corporation before 1 July 1994 until journed. their maturity. The amendments in regard to the taxation and delegation matters are to have a commencement date of 1 July 1989, which is the day the reorganisation of the AIDC took place. The amendment proposed by part 3 of the Bill to section 4 (1) (a) of the Bounty Ships Act 1989 will expand the maximum size limit of bountiable vessels constructed or modified in Australia from the existing level of 10,000 gross construction tons (gct) 20,000 gct. The existing level has been in place throughout the 1980s. The reason for the proposed amendment is that conditions for shipbuilders have changed rapidly in the recent past with an improvement in the competitive position of local builders. There is now evidence that certain shipbuilders can new clause: be competitive in the international market in the size range of 15,000 gct to 20,000 gct and with bounty at the rate of 15 per cent of construction costs. The Government proposes that these larger shipbuilders should purnot be disadvantaged by exclusion. from bounty when the opportunity arises to build larger vessels. The amendments made by parts 4 and 7 the Bill will result in more flexible adminin istration of the Designs Act 1906 and the assets Trade Marks Act 1955. Although not momentous in nature, the changes will align some of the administrative provisions of the Patents Act, Trade Marks Act and Designs Act and update the penalties for committing against the Designs Act. Advances administrative practice brought about by also computerisation will be able to be more adopted in the patent, trade marks and designs offices. The amendments are couched in the same straightforward drafting style of the Patents Bill 1989 which was introduced by the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) in June this year. Minor amendments of the To Patents Act 1952 and the Patents, Trade Marks, Designs and Copyright Act 1939 are by parts 5 and 6 of the Bill, respectively, to correct a drafting error and make but a small number of consequential amendments. No financial impact is expected to from these amendments. I present the to explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Beale) adNA BILL 1989 Consideration resumed from 3 October. In Committee Consideration of Senate's amendments. Senate's amendments No. I-Page I, clause 2, lines 7 and 8, leave out to the clause, insert the following clause: Commencement ""2 (1) Subject to subsection (2), this Act commences on I October 1989. ""(2) Section 6 shall be deemed to have commenced on 30 September 1989,"". No. 2-Page 3, after clause 5, add the following PBRT determination to h-ve no effect ""6.

173,Mr STAPLES,Unknown,"I move: That Senate amendment No. 1 be disagreed to but that in place thereof the following amendment be made: (I) Clause 2, page I, line 8, omit 'I October 1989', substitute 'I January 1990'. I need to make the point that this amendment means that the date of application of the increase of the general patient contribution from $11 to $12 will now move from 1 October 1989 to 1 January 1990, as the original date of 1 October has passed due to the action of the Senate. In the Senate the two issues were put together. As this action affects a Budget decision it is a concern that we have a situation where we have a limitation on the Budget. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia has acknowledged in a meeting with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and in press releases that it accepts the integrity of the Government's Budget. It follows that as the Budget estimates are affected adversely by this delay, basically that reduces the amount of money that would have been available to the Government, and effectively the pharmacists, to ease and minimise the effect of the original decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal.",73
174,Mr SHACK,Unknown,"The Opposition supported the original Bill, the National Health Amendment Bill, in this chamber and in the Senate. However, in the Senate we moved an amendment to the Bill which, if passed, would have the effect of striking down, in fact revoking, the 28 August 1989 determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. I said 'if passed' because that amendment to the Bill was passed in the Senate in the face of Government opposition. We now find the amended Bill coming back into this chamber, and the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) now wishes to move two further amendments to it. The first amendment is to change the operational date of the increase from $11 to $12 from 1 October 1989 to 1 January 1990. I say to the Minister that we do not oppose that amendment; in fact, more positively, we will support that. Obviously the operational date has gone by and it is necessary for the Minister to set a new date. That is what the Minister has done. I repeat that we did not oppose the thrust of this Bill in this chamber or in the Senate. But the second amendment which the Minister wishes to move is to strike out the amendment passed in the Senate which would seek to revoke the Tribunal's decision. We do not support that amendment. We believe that the Minister should support the amendment as moved and passed in the Senate. This is a very brief committee debate. I am confident that, for as long as the Minister and I are allowed to speak, we probably still would not agree. I will not go through and canvass the entire argument; there have been many other debates on this issue in this chamber and in the other place where both sides have had a chance to put forward their point of view. Basically, we believe that the Tribunal's decision has precipitated a crisis in community pharmacy in this country. It poses a threat to the integrity and the operation of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme as we know it. We believe that it is a wrong finding and a wrong determination based on a flawed survey and an invalid database. Simply put, it is the wrong decision and it should be revoked. In recent 'days the Government has entered into negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The Government has been assisted in those negotiations by advice from the expert committee which the Minister has established. Negotiation and advice from experts in themselves are good things. But in our view, the best move the Government could make in this whole issue to establish its bona fides would be to clear the decks and revoke the Tribunal's finding. It is a very easy matter. We could do that by passing the legislation that was introduced in this chamber yesterday-the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits Determination Revocation) Amendment Bill 1989-or we could do it by supporting the Bill as it comes into this place, as amended by the Senate. The best move the Government could make to salvage its position on this issue of community pharmacy and to really establish a clear and level playing field in respect of future negotiations would be to support this amendment, clear the decks and, in effect, say to community pharmacy and in particular to the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, 'We recognise that this issue will only be resolved through proper and genuine negotiation. will take away from you the threat of introduction of the Tribunal's determination. We will go back to square taws, and arrive at a fair and reasonable remuneration package for you'-this is the Government talking to community pharthat macy-'for you, our partners, tion of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme'. Let me end where 1 began by saying that from we recognise the need for the Government fees to introduce its first amendment to clause 2. We will not oppose that amendment, but we will definitely oppose the Government's atSecondly, tempts to strike out the Senate's amendment as represented in clause 5.

175,Mr STAPLES,Unknown,"Jagajaga-Minister for Housing and Aged Care) (4.46}-I move: (2) Clause 5, page 3, lines 2 to 4, omit subclause (I ). This amendment is consequential upon the rejection of Senate amendment No.1. Amendment agreed to.",74
176,Mr STAPLES,Unknown,"Jagajaga-Minister for Housing and Aged Care) (4.47}-I move: That amendment No.2 be disagreed to. I draw the strength of my argument in relation to the standing of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal and its ability in the process of law in this country to make an independent and appropriate decision from the debate on the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1981, presented in this House by the Minis1\ ter for Health at the time, the honourable . member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar). 1 'tOUld like to quote now from his second eading speech. Honourable members would e well aware that this has a certain prominence in terms of the forms and legislation 6r this chamber. The then Minister said: There have been three inquiries into pharmacy earnings, costs and profits since 1964-65 and no agreement has been possible between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia on the results of any of those inquiries. The Government believes that the most appropriate mechanism to overcome the existing problem is the establishment of a tribunal sitting in a public forum. That is a very important quote as it gives us the historical reason for having the PharmaWe ceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. Let the me quote further from what the honourable member for Warringah said in his second one, go back to reading speech: The Government believesis, the Liberal-National Party Governin the operament of the daythat there are a number of advantages to be gained by establishing a public tribunal. First, it will remove the political arena the question of the level of paid to chemists for the dispensing of pharmaceutical benefits. Both the chemists and the Govern. ment will be bound by the· tribunal's decisions. it will provide a forum in which all interested parties may publicly argue their case whilst ensuring that the levels of chemists' remuneration are determined by an independent body. Thirdly, it will remove the need for the Government to finance cumbersome and costly inquiries of the sort that have been conducted since 1964-65. 1 turn now to another document that has been read into Hansard before. It is a letter from Mr A. A. Russell, the National President of the Pharmacy' Guild of Australia at the time, to the honourable member for Warringah. It says, in part: It is the tribunal, not the Government, which should determine the level of remuneration and from what date that remuneration should apply. Our members will judge the tribunal on its first determination and the Guild is concerned that because of the limited time the tribunal may not be able, in the time available, to give the complex matters before it the consideration they warrant. It is basically saying that the Tribunal should determine the level of remuneration and not the Government. I will move on now to a further quote. It is from a joint statement made by the Federal Government, with me as Minister, and the National President of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, Mr Mathews, last Wednesday following our meeting with the' Prime Minister. That joint statement reads: The meeting was held after the Guild advised the Prime Minister that it accepted the fact of the Tribunal decision and the integrity of the Government's Budget. The Government and the Guild said they believed today's meeting marked an important turning point in the dispute over the Tribunal decision. They agreed it was in the best interest of the community that both parties work to resolve the dispute. They agreed that areas to be examined included: - the essential pharmacy allowance, where the interim eligibility criteria have been established. - remuneration for the professional role of pharmacists - restructuring incentives for community pharmacy. I will now quote from the covering press release put out by the National President of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, Mr Mathews. He said: The meeting was held after the Guild advised the Prime Minister that while it accepted the fact of the Tribunal decision and the integrity of the budget, it required Government to address remuneration in other ways to ensure a satisfactory level of remuneration for community pharmacy. That is exactly what the Government is doing. Today there have been further discussions or negotiations-however we might like to describe them-in light of the agreement that we came to last Wednesday. There was a second meeting held yesterday and attended by the expert panel of pharmacists that I established a couple of weeks ago. I understand that that meeting was quite productive. Tomorrow there will be a meeting between senior officials of the Department and elected representatives of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia to continue negotiations. What is pertinent to all of this, in particular, is that we have had a process in Australia where the Government has sat down with pharmacists, principally the Pharmacy· Guild of Australia, to try to reach a point of agreement. That failed continually. It did not satisfy pharmacists or the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, as I am sure the honourable member for Warringah will recall. Hence, quite reasonably we have now set up the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. Leaving aside comments that have been made about the Tribunal members which have called into question the integrity of the independence of that Tribunal-I do not want to canvass that I think it is important to recognise that we have a proper process here that is there for a very good reason, that is, to remove from the political arena, to remove from a bun fight, an issue that will also cause problems if left in that way. That is why we have a tribunal. That is why we have an appropriate process to handle these things. I make the point quite seriously and sincerely that the Government has its Budget parameters to adhere to. From reading the printed statements of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia we can see that it recognises that as well. It also recognises the fact of the Tribunal decision. Therefore, within that context, within the context of those ongoing negotiations where the Government is seeking to put more money back into pharJTIacies than has been simply and solely put there by the determination of the Tribunal's decision, we have the recommendations of the Tribunal which the Government is seeking in conjunction with the Phl,lrmacy Guild of Australia to come to some agreement on. That means dollars, a better pharmaceutical benefits scheme and a better pharmacy industry in Australia. That is important. If honourable members think that they might vote against this amendment they would do well to recall the history of their own parties and the path that that would take any government down, whether it be this Government or any future government-it is relatively unlikely to happenmade up of opposition parties. There would be a poli-ical bunfight that would do no credit to the Parliament, to any government of the day or to pharmacies. The problem that always exists is that there are always innocent bystanders. Pharmacies provide medication under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to millions of people. This year well over 107 million prescriptions were prescribed to 16 ·million Australians. People get concerned if the supply of those pharmaceuticals is interrupted in any way. That is what many people have feared. From looking at some of the information that has been put forward I can understand their fear. I can certainly assure them that the Government will not allow any interruption to the supply of their essential medications under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, nor will the Government allow them to be charged any more than they have been charged before, apart from the increase from $11 to $12. I urge the House to think seriously about this issue. It is a very important step the Senate has put forward. I hope that the Committee rejects the amendment proposed by the Senate and agrees to the Government's amendment.",74
177,Mr SHACK,Unknown,"The Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) invites the Committee to think seriously about this issue. I want to inform him that we in the Opposition have certainly thought long and hard and seriously about it. It is likely that the Minister's amendment will be passed, despite our opposition, because the crude political reality in this place is that the Government has the numbers and the Opposition has not. We remain resolute in our stance against the Government's amendment and in support of the Bill, as amended by the Senate, in respect to this provision. The Minister reminds us of the historical circumstances relating to the introduction of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. I do not demur from that historical account, nor do we in the Opposition walk away from a decision of our Government in 1981 or thereabouts when we established the Tribunal. But it is a farcical proposition to suggest that even with the establishment of tribunals we can remove an issue like this totally from the political arena. At the end of the day the buck will always stop with government, as it must. In constitutional terms, the buck will always stop with the government and the Parliament because even the highest tribunal in the land, for example, the High Court of Australia, can make wrong decisions or, to put a value judgment on it, decisions that the government or the parliament of the day disagrees. with. It is within the province of the Parliament, as the nation's representatives, to pass laws to overturn decisions of even the highest tribunal in the land. Even the current Government, when it has been faced with decisions from a tribunal that determines, for example, parliamentarians' salaries and judicial salariesMr Beale-Or airline landing fees.",76
178,Mr SHACK,Unknown,"Or airline landing fees, as my colleague suggests, has not been beyond interfering with the decisions of an independent tribunal. When I say that a tribunal makes a wrong decision it is a wrong decision if it is not fair and reasonable. By any stretch, on any legal test or by any common sense measure the 28 August decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal was not fair and reasonable. It will send up to a thousand pharmacies out of business. It reduces the income of community pharmacy right off the top by at least 23 per cent. If we experience closures of that magnitude around the country, the real sufferers in this whole debacle will be the public, especially the aged and the disadvantagedpensioners, who are the biggest users of pharmaceuticals supplied under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. One of the aspects of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is to ensure and provide access. The guts cannot be cut out of community pharmacy, as it were, around the country without compromising that. The thing has landed back at the door of the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) and the collective door of government, because the Tribunal's decision is not fair and reasonable. As has been argued by many Opposition speakers, both in this chamber and in the other place, it was based on a flawed survey and on incomplete and incorrect data. What has finally happened? The Government has been forced to negotiate with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia because that is the only way in which this matter will be resolved. In its statement the other week, the Pharmacy Guild recognised the fact of the Tribunal's decision. There is no big deal about that. It was an historical fact. It brought down a finding. Of course it recognised the fact of the Tribunal's decision. It was hit in the face with it. If that Tribunal decision is ever implemented, it will be a very serious crisis for community pharmacy around the country. Secondly, the Guild recognises the integrity of the Government's Budget. No-one is questioning the integrity of the Government's Budget. This particular measure of increasing the patient contribution from $11 to $12 will achieve savings of $lOm in this financial year and $17m in a full financial year. That provision can still stand, even with the new start date, if the Government goes ahead and supports this amendment. The passage of this amendment has nothing to do with the integrity of the Government's Budget or, indeed, this specific decision to increase the general patient contribution from $11 to $12. So the integrity of the Budget is not in question here. However, the Minister says that the passage of this particular Budget measure is necessary so that more money can be put into pharmacy. The full introduction of the Tribunal decision, quite apart from the elimination of mark-up, will take $100m out of pharmacy. If one multiplies the number - f scripts in the country by the $1.05 that IS being taken off the prescription fee, one arrives at a figure, on an annual basis, of about $ 100m. We are only talking about $lOm and $17m in a full year. One cannot put up that argument to say that the passage of this particular Bill, with?ut thi- amen-ment striking down the Tnbunal, IS essential to put money back into pharmacy when the Government is taking $100m from community pharmacy. The Government is being forced to go back to the negotiating table. The whole concept of a professional fee, which we would support, alongside the decision of the Tribunal, is the Government's effort to make good a fair and reasonable package, because the Tribunal's decision is not fair and reasonable and pharmacy will never wear it at any price. So the Government is being forced back to the negotiating table and the Government does want to talk to pharmacy about topping up the remuneration package in the light of the Tribunal's decision. One can call it a professional fee or anything one likes, but it does not take away from the fact that the Government is in the box seat in this matter. It is no good trying to back and fill. It is no good trying to make up the rem.uneration package under another name while this Tribunal finding hangs over community pharmacy. If the Government wants to resolve thisand this is a very reasonable contribution which is almost totally without passion that we are witnessing in this chamber this afternoon-I give some unsolicited advice to the Minister. If he wants to fix this up and put this whole debacle and' entire mess behind him, and if he wants to maximise his chances of sitting down with community pharmacy as, represented by the Pharmacy Guild, the best thing he can do to establish his bona fides, to establish his intentions in this area, is to support the amendment passed in the Senate which does no more and no less to his Budget than strike down the determination of the Tribunal. The way forward in this matter will never be the implementation of that Tribunal finding. That will never happen, and the Minister knows it. The way forward will be a proper negotiation with the Guild. If the Government is successful in achieving that and stays with the Tribunal concept, the Government and the Guild will be making a new submission to the Tribunal, which will itself replace and overturn the 28 August decision which-it is very risky to make predictions in politics, but I make a predictionwill never be implemented. The best thing the Government can do to maximise its chances of coming up with a fair and reasonable package with the Guild and to establish its bona fides is to support this Bill as amended by the Senate. I call on the Government to reconsider this matter and to make progress in this whole debacle by supporting the amendment as delivered to us by the Senate.",76
179,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"ln supporting the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), I express my bemusement that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) should 'sincerely' seek to defeat the amendment which was passed, by the Senate. In his remarks, the Minister seemed to consider the findings of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal as holy writ. It was implicit in what he said that, because the Tribunal said so, it must therefore become so. As the honourable member for Tangney has said, that is a pretty selective approach. The Government, rightly or wrongly-and I am not arguing the rights and wrongs of the case-does have the ability to reject, and has on many occasions rejected, the findings of the Remuneration Tribunal as it affects salaries and entitlements of judges, certain office-holders and parliamentarians. It is perfectly proper for it to do so, and it does .so regularly, as honourable me-bers oppo.sl-e will know only too well; sometimes they Jom with me in lamenting such a decision. ,So the Minister cannot really ask us t,9 rely on some concept of infallibility in the-work and decisions taken by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. As if to underline that, I point to the very recent example where, despite the Remuneration Tribunal as it affects the entitlements to postage of members of the House of Representatives, the Government merely took an executive action to decide, 'Well, by golly, we might treble that allowance'. That did not go back to the Remuneration Tribunal. An executive decision was taken by a Minister and announced. With all the blatant political overtones, the Minister concerned was quite unashamed in his approach, despite the fact that the coalition parties have registered their stern opposition and have und<;rtaken to repeal that measure on their election to government. In other words, we will not be party to that decision, and its relevance, which involved the overturning of a decision by a Tribunal. So that argument does not wash. The Government cannot hide behind the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal in this case. After all, it is within the province of this Parliament to amend any Act. That is what we are here for, for goodness sake. We seek to support the decision taken by the Senate with the intention of observing our parliamentary responsibilities as distinct from being subservient to executive government. The Government's intention-apparently supported by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal-to recompense pharmacists who in future supply prescribed medication borders on scandalous. That situation will continue if the Government has its way and defeats this amendment. For many lines of pharmaceuticals defeating the Senate amendment will oblige pharmaceutical chemists who carry stocks to incur losses on sales on a whole range of products.

True w /sale price is a ridiculous and unsustainable outcome but it will be brought about by the substitution of an across the board prescription allowance of $3.50 per item for the present dispensing allowance of, I think, $2.54, plusand it is a big plus-a 25 per cent gross profit mark-up based on the national health scheme (NHS) assessed wholesale price for each medication. To offset but not to eliminate the losses to chemists which will ensue-and they will ensue as sure as night follows day-if the Bill remains unamended and the proposed measures are implemented, the chemists will have to resort to cost saving measures which will play havoc with the service we have come to expect from chemists as well as with employment opportunities for young graduates and counter staff. One of the first acts of survival for chemists will be to reduce their inventories. Two trips to one's friendly dispenser will become necessary. That might not be much of a problem for the vast majority of mobile citizens. It might just be a matter of jumping into a car and going to pick up a prescribed drug which the local chemist has had delivered from a wholesaler because he cannot afford to carry it in his stocks. It is a different matter entirely, though, for the aged, infirm and incapacitated who are the most likely, first, to need prescribed medication and, second, to be unable to make the two trips to the pharmacist. Because of the financial imperatives those chemists will not be able to maintain inventories at present levels, particularly for expensive doses like adriamycin. Off-the-shelf service will become a thing of the past with our chemists. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a. table to which I have referred. Leave granted.

180,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"Pharmacists who have knowledge built up over years of medication needed by their individual clients will be unable for financial reasons to take advantage of an ability to anticipate a regular client's next visit as part of a normal service hitherto provided because to take such a risk possibly would lead to even greater irrevocable loss. In fact, any prescribed drug costing more than about $15 under the proposed scheme would incur a loss for the dispensing chemist if typical overheads of 22.8 per cent were then implied and if inventories were typically financed by a bank overdraft attracting a conservative 20 per cent interest impost as has been set out in the table that I have just had incorporated. These are but some simple examples to illustrate the stupidity of the proposal under contemplation by the Government as a result of the Tribunal's findings. Other and even more formidable arguments have been or will be canvassed in the days and weeks ahead. Available time will not permit that today. The financial realities listed beg the question of whether a pharmacist faced with a loss making transaction declines to fill a prescription presented by pensioners, concession card holders or repatriation beneficiaries. The same question may also be asked of the normal paying public. How will the Government ensure the supply by chemists to the public of the full range of 171 items which comprise the pharmaceutical benefits scheme? Remember that the pharmacists' will be unable to supply most of them without incurring a loss once the present mark-up plus fee system is replaced as announced. What about pharmacy businesses that are in-house suppliers entirely located within public and private hospitals around this country?

183,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"For these in-house hospital pharmacists if the message comes down from the operating theatres calling for a particular life saving drug in an unforeseen crisis, will the chemist be in the position of saying, 'Sorry, we will order it from the wholesaler and you can administer it posthumously'? Is that the ridiculous situation we will be confronted with simply because to carry stock of some of these very expensive items, rather than going to the unsatisfactory alternative of having it provided direct from the wholesaler on demand, would involve that pharmacist in very grave losses indeed? The dearer the drug, the greater the loss. This is a crazy situation. I will not hold up the Committee any longer. The Government had better come to its senses-and quickly. One way it can show an intention to do that is by supporting the amendment which is before us and which has been passed by the Senate.",79
184,Mr STAPLES,Unknown,"ln the interests of time. I will not go into all the responses I need to make in answer to the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). However, I want to address a couple of points which are particularly pertinent. In regard to the issue that was raised about the Government being forced back to negotiate, I make the point that from literally the hour that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBR T) determination was available to me I contacted the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and invited its members to meet with me to discuss the recommendations and issues surrounding them. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia was not in a position to take the matter further, or chose not to do so, after, effectively, the initial discussion. In the later of September, on speaking and writing to the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, it was evident that the Guild was prepared to accept the fact of the Tribunal's decision. How the honourable member for Tangney wants to interpret that is his business. It was clearly the understanding in the meeting between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), me and the leaders of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia that, while they may not have agreed with the PBR T's decision, they quite clearly accepted that it was there and in that regard accepted the reality of the PBRT. I think that is particularly pertinent to this amendment. They also accepted that the Government's budget was there and that there are parameters on that budget. Mr Shack-B,ut they are still going to the Federal Court.",79
185,Mr STAPLES,Unknown,"That is their choice and they have to argue that. The honourable member for Tangney was not there, so it is difficult for him to make a judgment. It is quite clear in that regard that before they could meet with the Prime Minister on this issue they accepted that, and that is indicated. Let me make a few points about the process in front of the PBRT. A process has been followed that has been well accepted. The only problem is that after two years of pretty intensive investigation the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and most pharmacists do not like the answer that the PBR T has reached. It is also pertinent to make the point that during that process, the Pharmacy Guild chose not to participate in the database, survey and did nothing-I will put it politelyto encourage any other member of the Guild to take part as well. One would simply have to ask the question: why would that be the case if the Pharmacy Guild were there to look after its real interests? The Tribunal had accepted over 600 submissions over a two-year process and had come down with those facts, which led to its determination of 28 August. There are certain recommendations which the Government is keen to explore. It has made some interim guidelines in relation to the essential pharmacy allowance. We want to talk with the Pharmacy Guild about the structure of the industry and about the days professional fee, which is something that I have been interested in ever since I became Minister and the Pharmacy Guild approached me on that matter. As a person in the community who goes to pharmacies from time to tiine, I recognise that there is a variety of services, particularly in the community services and health field. I also recognise the way in which government works with pharmacies to help in the dissemination of health information. A very important role is carried out by pharmacy. We want to develop with pharmacies-the Pharmacy Guild has been most insistent in this matter-that professional fee in recognition of a broader professional role in pharmacies that is not simply related to the dispensing of items under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). Counselling, et cetera, that is often put forward as free is, in fact, incorporated into the fee arrangement of the dispensing of the item and that clearly shows in the database survey. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has incorporated in Hansard a table. While I agreed that it should be incorporated, I note that it is not sourced; so I presume that it is one that he has developed himself. Obviously, I would be interested in having that checked. As we go from left in right in that table we notice that the prices increase. The costs of medications below $16 are not there. That is probably where we come across a very interesting point in this issue that no-one has really talked about too much, from the opposite side or from pharmacy. We would have to ask why. If we do not get a question 'Why?', let me give the answer nonetheless: that is that 50 medications out of the 600 or so on the PBS account for 50 per cent of the number of prescriptions under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. That is a lot. Many low cost drugs in particular account for the very high volume, yet they are low cost. From memory, last year there were 1.3 million prescriptions for Mogadon out of a total of 100 million or so prescriptions. So for one item it is a pretty high volume drug, which costs. $2.65 list price. On I November 1990, once indexation has been applied, the dispensing fee, or the fee to pharmacists, will be about $4. That gives a mark-up of about 150 per cent, which is 50 per cent over and above what the pharmacists were getting last time. On the high volume, low cost drugs and with the application of the new fee as distinct from the earlier lower dispensing fee, plus a 25 per cent mark-up of a very small cost item, on a per script basis as distinct from a dollar basis, pharmacists will be making very substantial increases that would well and truly offset many of the reductions that occur under some of the more exotic high-cost medications. The Government has also made an agreement with the distributors to remove the surcharge on items over $45 by effectively giving an increased margin which we have passed on to the pharmacists, effecting the lower cost. Let us talk about the 23 per cent markup. That is a great figure which has been around for a while now. Some people even take it as a fact. The reality is that when we take into account the indexation issues and the very substantial increase in volume or number of prescriptions that will be generated under the PBS for a variety of reasons in our community-last year there were about 100 million prescriptions and this year there will be about 107 million; it will rise quite dramatically over the next couple of years-we will see that even if every pharmacy remains, including the increase in the number of pharmacies over the last year, there will be a very substantial reduction on what is now claimed as a 23 per cent markup. I would also like to comment on the claims made by the honourable member for Curtin about hospital pharmacies. He said that what was happening was ridiculous. But his example is also bordering on the ridiculous. Sure, hospital pharmacies have to carry a lot of stock which is often quite expensive; but they also carry a lot of stock that is of very high volume and relatively low cost, on which, as I have just indicated, they will get more substantial returns. There are many more issues on this matter than we will have the opportunity to encompass here. There are other issues such as' when payment is made. After dispensing an item, pharmacists are more likely to receive payment from the Government before they have to pay the wholesaler. In many cases the pharmacist never actually owns the medication on the shelf. There are many issues and it is not as simple as it sounds. Many people are trying to make this matter very simple by using the worse case scenario to paint the whole picture black. That is not the case, and the Government will continue to work with pharmacy and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, within the Budget parameters and within the PBRT's decision, in dealing with its recommendations and anything else we can do to improve pharmacy.

The Tribunal was set up in 1980 to overcome these problems. The amendment seeks to link two distinct issues: the increase in the patient co-payment was supNA ported by the Opposition when the Bill was before the House; and there is a separate Private Member's Bill seeking to overturn the PBR T decision.

NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Sullivan, K. J. Taylor, W. L. Second Reading Debate resumed.",82
187,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"1 welcome the opportunity to contribute to the PAIRS debate on the Superannuation and Other Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill. I take Macphee, I. M. Katter, R. C. the opportunity, as this Bill relates to the Defence Force retirement and death benefits Dobie, J. D. M. (DFRDB) scheme, affecting Navy, Army and Air Force personnel, to salute our Navy and Millar, P. C. Peacock, A. S. Air Force personnel for the capable role they are playing during the course of the airline strike and, for thatmatter, to salute the Army for the capable role it is playing at Nurrungar. Indeed, I notice the gun-happy Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley)-so called by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren)-is in the chamber on this occasion. I be want to make it very clear that at no stage has the coalition done other than commend the work, the role, and the commitment of the serving personnel of the Navy, Army and Air Force. With respect to wanting an alternative to the Bill, I will tell the House and reathe nation what the Government has done those serving personnel. It cut back their pensions by 2 per cent in the DFRDB cutback in the 1986 Budget. The Government tore up a contract with those serving personnel, especially those who have retired in the intervening period. So let us not have any of a humbug and hypocrisy from the Government de- in regard to looking after the serving personstudy. nel, because the Bill we are discussing reof stores after two years the 2 per cent cutback the political arena in the DFRDB. I want to elaborate on several points in relation to the quite disgraceful decision made by the Government in 1986 to discount pension increases payable to former Commonwealth employees and members of the defence forces. The rationale behind this decision, according to the Minister in his second reading speech, was the extraordinary circumstances of the economy. This says a great deal about the Government's own perception of its handling of the nation's economy. The sad thing is that it is not only members of the Government who suffer as a result of its mishandling. The decision of 1986 to discount pensions by 2 per cent has resulted in a situation whereby retirees from Commonwealth employment and the Services-Navy, Army and Air Force-are not able to plan accurately or budget for their retirement. In the case of ex-service personnel, this can have some particularly serious consequences, albeit these are now being rectified by the Bill. Nevertheless, the 2 per cent cutback affected their budget planning quite seriously. The vocation of service life requires particularly heavy physical demands which necessarily entail early retirement. In this situation retirees must be able to forecast their .superannuation package so that they can make their plans and get on with their lives at the end of their first career. Since 1986, retirees have no longer been able to do that with confidence because the Government tore up that contract in the Budget of 1986. It was done simply at the whim of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Government. I am pleased to see that the dreadful decision made in 1986 has now been reversed, but the Government must be aware that in making this decision it has signalled the end of planned retirement for former Commonwealth employees and members of the Services. The question has to be asked: what were the great savings achieved by the Government with this 2 per cent discount? In the Minister's second reading speech he states that increases in· outlays as a result of this legislation are estimated to be $12.1m for 1989-90 and $19.8m for 1990-91, the full financial year. To put this in context, I remind honourable members of the $202m recently spent by the Government to maintain interest rates at an illusory 17 per cent ceiling; the extraordinary $60m amount geared to be paid to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd; the $100m found at the last moment and announced on the second day of this financial year as additional aid to black African front-line states-we have little real idea what that might be used for; and finally the $100m or thereabouts to be paid to the airlines to extend the Government's dispute with the pilots. I add in passing only that it was revealed in a Senate Estimates committee last night that the supplemental airlines will not get one dollar of compensation in this little deal done by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The compensation is to go entirely to the big boys, Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines. What about MacKnight Airlines, a supplemental airline carrying out its duty to a range of towns servicing, in particular, Deniliquin, Hay and other such towns and feeding into the major airlines? The major airlines have cut out their services and suddenly the supplemental airlines' idcome has been halved or worse, yet they will not get any access whatsoever to fair and proper compensation. Therefore, the Government has taken a discriminatory approach. The Government's decision relating to the 2 per cent reduction in benefits from the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme added to the causes of the record resignation rates from the Services. Nothing impacts more on the morale of Navy, Army and Air Force personnel than reports that the DFRDB is about to be reviewed, changed again or-as happened in 1986 and which is now being rectified in 1989-subjected to a cutback of 2 per cent or the like. As my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) pointed out, the Royal Australian Air Force is currently undertaking about 60 per· cent of domestic flights in Australia. When those Air Force personnel retire they will be covered by the provisions of this Bill. The situation has been necessitated by the conduct of the Prime Minister, but I will not dwell on his shocking conduct with regard to the pilots dispute. But I reiterate my support for and commendation of the work being carried out by all three Services in relation to events which have occurred this year with the pilots dispute and with Nurrungar base defence. As we debate this Bill the House should be reminded also that there are over 300 soldiers in Namibia, whose repatriation cover arrangements were dealt with by legislation previously this year, who will be covered by this legislation when they return. I believe that those soldiers are carrying out worthwhile work. They enjoy the support of the coalition and the Government-bipartisan support-in terms of that work in Namibia. The second contingent has now taken up duty in Namibia and we wish it well. I was pleased to meet that second contingent at Ingleburn earlier this year just prior to its departure. I would now like to concentrate on the DFRDB scheme and the Government's inactivity in this area. Honourable members would be aware that the Cross report on personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force was handed down in November 1988. The report recommended quite properly that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel commission a review of the scheme to consider these benefit amendments: first, increasing the resignation benefit on termination before 20 years' service to include some form of interest credit on the serviceman's contributions; secondly, increasing the resignation benefit to 3.5 times the member's contributions accumulated with interest; thirdly, allowing service personnel terminating their service before 60 years of age and who are eligible for pension, the option of receiving a deferred pension commencing at any time after age 55; and, lastly, removing the 3 per cent per year penalty applying to officers who separate from the armed forces before reaching notional retiring age .. These recommendations are all commendable and were well received within the Services. Let us look at what has happened. I remind honourable members that the report was handed down in November 1988. The Minister announced the review in May 1989. Submissions for the review closed in October 1989-that is, this month-and the further report is due to be handed down in June 1990. So we have a very lengthy period of uncertainty relating to the DFRDB. It takes some 19 months for the review process to be completed. It is little wopder that there is scepticism within the Services about the priority they receive and little wonder that their morale under this Government's leadership is at such a low ebb. Indeed, whilst the resignation rate plateaued for a short period in the course of this year, there are now signs that that resignation rate is moving up again. We can ill afford to lose the experienced personnel who are leaving the Navy, Army and Air Force. The Minister for Defence likes to refer to the pick-up caused by national service and the Vietnam period when there was a very big enlistment which is now departing the armed forces. Anyone who examines these figures in detail will find very quickly that the resignation rates are far more serious than that and are a matter of very real concern. So-called benefits under this Government, such as the new scheme to replace the defence service home loans scheme, are designed with the quite deliberate intent of economically tying service personnel to the Services in an effort to reduce the record resignation rates which have been a feature of defence under Labor. The new defence service home loans scheme appears on the surface to be more generous but, with careful analysis, one quickly comes to the realisation that the only beneficiaries will be those who make a career in the Services. In fact, under the new scheme a sailor, soldier or airman who takes out a home loan upon gaining eligibility after six years' service will lose any interest rate subsidy the moment he or she leaves the Services. So much for the rationale that the loan was to assist those who wished to purchase a house after being shunted all around Australia as part of their service to the nation. The new scheme is denoted quite often as the $40,000 defence service home loans scheme. It is in sharp contrast to the old scheme which was a $25,000 defence service home loans scheme. After looking at the small print one realises that the interest rate attached to the new scheme is sharply different from that attached to the old scheme. The period of eligibility is sharply different in the new scheme and, as a consequence, the reality is that where a choice is going to be offered to a particular category of service personnel, including those serving in Namibia, the vast majority will quite properly choose the old $25,000 scheme because they will work out that it is in their interests to do so, although each serving person will have to arrive at that decision after taking into account his own circumstances. In conclusion I commend absolutely the Government in terms of its belated decision to remove the 2 per cent discount on pensions that it introduced in 1986. The Superannuation and Other Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill is overdue. In fact, it is long overdue. The coalition regrets that there was a necessity to take this decision in the first place. It commends the fact that the situation has now been rectified. We are certainly pleased to havesupported the campaign to restore the DFRDB scheme. We also pay tribute to the work of the Returned Services League of Australia, the work of the Regular Defence Force Welfare Association, and the work of many other organisations which have gone into do battle with the Government on the 2 per cent DFRDB cutback. As. I indicated, the coalition supports this Bill.",82
188,Mr JOHNS,Unknown,"1 agree with the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) in that we have all regretted that Commonwealth Government and Defence Force superannuants should have to suffer at any stage any loss in their superannuation pay-outs. Nevertheless, a decision was taken in 1986 to discount their annuities by 2 per cent. We are now in a position where we can restore that situation. Caucus and this Government took that decision some time ago. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) was particularly forceful in his arguments within Caucus. I applaud his arguments. There is one thing that this debate has done to the whole superannuation question which I would like to discuss this afternoon. In a sense, it has taken a little of the gloss off the whole notion of superannuation. I would like to introduce figures which proveand I think all honourable members will agree with these figures-that superannuation is treated very beneficially by taxation. Superannuation is the prime force in savings for retirement in this country today and it is a growing force for savings by the work force in this country for the future. Whilst it is sad that for some three years now a particular group of superannuants have had their income discounted, that income has now been restored, but it should not take away the gloss from the entire superannuation picture which really is an incredibly good story. The fact is that superannuants for years have always done very well under government taxation. They are provided with concessional treatment. I guess the problem is that many of my constituents say to me, 'Why am I taxed heavily on my superannuation if I retire early?', or 'Why am I not treated as well as a pensioner? I am a superannuant who has contributed to the fund over all these years'. The problem is that subsidies are hidden-and that is what happens to superannuation as the superannuation funds are not taxed as they might otherwise befrom the recipients of superannuation so that they do not understand the degree to which taxpayers contribute to their retirement income. To the extent that there is a massive transfer of taxpayers' money into superannuation funds and then out again to the recipients of superannuation, superannuants often really do not appreciate the free kick that they get from the tax system. Let me state a few obvious things about what superannuation does and does not do. As I said, it is an incredibly beneficial means of saving for retirement but until recently very few workers actually received the benefit. It is only recently that we have been able to lift the number of workers who are in receipt of superannuation. I think almost 80 per cent of the work force is now beginning to buy into superannuation schemes. There will be an enormous transfer of people in 20 or 30 years' time. At the moment the proportion is about 80 per cent on the pension and 20 per cent on superannuation. In 20 or 30 years' time that ratio will completely reverse. We will have about 80 per cent of the retired population paying for their own retirement benefit and the residual 20 per cent will be on the pension. The thing that superannuation is not, however, is something that is to be passed on to one's children. Superannuation is meant to pay for one's own retirement. It is lodged in the backs of the minds of many workers today that they should have their lump sum superannuation payout, that they should enjoy it, and then perhaps at a later stage come back onto the pension or, if they are lucky enough-in their minds-not to use all of their superannuation lump sum payout, they should pass it on to their kids. That is unfair. We want to ensure that, if the taxpayer is going to contribute so much to the superanuant beneficiary, the superannuant uses that money specifically for his or her retirement. A number of people have come to me, having retired at age 55 or even earlier, and suggested that the Government is a little too cruel on them because they have worked for a certain number of years and they have decided to retire early. I say to those people that the answer is quite simple. I say, 'If you prefer not to work for another 10 years until you reach age 65, by definition you have done yourself out of 10 years of good income'. Often people find when they retire early that the period between the ages of 55 or 60 and 65 can be fairly hard on them, and that they really do not have sufficient income until they get to a point after 65 years when they can pick up some of their superannuation moneys that they might have held in a deferred annuity, a roll-over fund, or whatever. A number of workers have telephoned me recently and have said that their bosses have suggested to them that they get out soon because next year there will be another budget and the Government will further tax superannuation. I tell them not to listen to the bosses because I suspect that they have another motive. I say, 'The boss probably wants to get rid of you and bring in someone else'. I get quite a number of those calls from people who really are being scared out of the work force on the basis of this lie that somehow next year superannuation will be more heavily taxed. I say to all people who are considering retirement, 'Do not retire too early because you are a long time in retirement-hopefully'. In the last few years we have found that the ratio of people's years of work to their years in retirement has shifted enormously. My father started work at 15 and retired at the age of about 73. Most people would have knocked off by the age of 65. He worked for more than 50 years. In my father's generation-I will not use him as an example-a person would often live only about 10 years after retirement. Let us assume that the person dies at age 75. The ratio would be 50 years of work to 10 years of retirement. The worker would have put in for 50 years but enjoyed only 10 years. I can understand a person saying, 'That's a bit silly. I would rather work less and have a longer retirement so that I can enjoy it'. I agree entirely. But think how the ratio has now shifted. A person may not enter the work force until he is about 25. It now takes a lot of schooling to get a job. He may retire at 55; so he has worked for only 30 years. Hopefully, he will live to the age of 80, spending 25 years in retirement. Think of the ratios of individual dependence. In the old days, one worked for 50 years and spent 10 years in retirement. That is a ratio of 5:1. Today and in the future, one may work for only 30 years and spend 25 or 30 years in retirement. We are almost getting to a 1: 1 ratio. Despite the fact that our living standards have increased enormously over the last few decades, one cannot expect to deny oneself income for too long and live well in retirement. I guess this is a general plea for people to think very carefully about their retirement income plans. Where they fall short in their plans, they should not criticise a Government that has already given very generous treatment to superannuation funds. Many people in retirement are poor capitalists. They think that if they get a lump sum payout of $50,000, $60,000 or $80,000, all of a sudden they are rich; they are not. I[ that amount of money has to generate a future income, they are not. It is a lot of money if one can spend $50,000, $60,000 or $80,000, now or in a year's time, and if then one also receives a pension. But it is not a lot of money when it has to be invested so that an income is received from it. Some people have starry eyes when they retire. They think that they finally have that pot of gold. They do not understand that the pot of gold has to generate future income for them. We really are going through a learning process. Many people will have to understand those sorts of matters before we can settle back .into a proper understanding of superannuation. To sum up the Government's changes in the last few years, they have been, to some extent, to penalise early retirement and the taking of a lump sum at retirement and blowing it. Gently but firmly we are shifting the bias towards someone paying for his own pension-we call it an annuity. The tax treatment and the treatment under rules called reasonable benefit limits-which I will try to explain in a minute-are very definitely towards annuities. I will present some figures that indicate that if a person makes the right choice and uses a little bit of the lump sum available to him in retirement, putting the rest away so as to pay himself a pension, he will actually be far better off than taking the lump sum and thinking that he finally has the pot of gold. In fact, it would be fool's gold. By taking the lump sum, people would not be treated as generously as if they were to take some of the lump sum and pay the rest out in a pension or an annuity. I will quote some figures on the taxation concessions of superannuation. I will then go on to various options that people may take for retirement and how they are treated under various rules. This is an extremely complex area. In the very near future I will be running a seminar in my electorate. I will bring together people who work in the superannuatio- industry. One group will be the salesmen out there trying to sign people up for superannuation, who themselves are not aware of the new rules. I suspect they are giving poor information to potential customers. I also want to bring people from the Australian Taxation Office, who know about another beast called eligible termination payments, which is the money one is entitled to at the end of one's working life. Another group, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, which will apply these rules, which are reasonable benefit limits, will also be invited. Those two groups are not necessarily talking to each other. I would like to bring together the Tax Office to advise on how its rules operate, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to advise on how its rules operate, and, of course, the Department of Social Security, which has a set of rules that says that if the earnings one has in investments in whatever form are low enough one can get access to the pension; if they are too high one cannot get access to a pension. I will bring those three groups of people together and teach not only potential recipients of superannuation in my electorate but also the people out there selling superannuation the rules of the game. I will draw some examples of tax concessions from the booklet entitled Review of the Administration of the Reasonable Benefit Limits put out by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It states: The superannuation tax concessions consist of concessional rates of taxation applying to contributions to superannuation funds, investment earnings, on those contributions in the fund and benefits provided by the fund. It makes a comparison: They allow much higher savings than can be achieved through an ordinary savings account. Take the case of a person who receives some of his or her remuneration as contributions by his or her employer to a. superannuation fund. Those contributions and the investment earnings in the fund on those contributions are taxed at 15% and the end benefit is then taxed at lump sum tax rates. On the other hand, if the same person took all of his or her remuneration as cash salary and then deposited an amount in an ordinary savings account, it would be taxed at marginal rates when received as salary and any earnings in the account would be taxed at marginal rates when they were earned. The end benefit, when withdrawn from the account, would be tax free . . . The differences between them is the amount that arises from the superannuation tax concessions . . . a person on $25,000 per annum who has no other superannuation and who takes 12.5 per cent of his or her salary as contributions by his or her employer to a superannuation fund for 40 years would receive an after tax benefit of $142,300 in today's terms at the end of that period. A person who saved through an ordinary savings account would save $65,430. The difference$76,870-represents the amount of benefit that comes from the superannuation tax concessions. That example very simply states that the taxpayer is pouring a great deal of money into the pocket of the recipient of superannuation. Let me take an example where the reasonable benefit limit will be applied to the money that a person can take out as an annuity or a lump sum. By and large, if one is going to receive an enormous tax advantage from the Government, we have to in turn make sure that there are limits to the total amount which can be had. There has to be a cap somewhere along the line because the taxpayer is, to some extent, funding it. We take an example of a person aged 55. The paper states: A person with a Highest Average Salary of $30,000 who receives a lump sum equal to the lump RBLIIt age 55 of $210,000 would have a number options: In the first option it is stated that the person can roll over part, but not all, of the sum when it is received. He can leave the work force permanently at, say, age 55, and take a balance of the lump sum between the ages of 55 and 65. That is a normal option. The benefit limit that will apply to those people at age 65 is $313,400. A second option is to roll over part but not all of the lump sum at age 55, leave work force permanently at 55 and take at least half of all benefits as an annuity pension. The benefit here, $505,900, is most double that in the first option. We are deliberately putting in a bias that says, 'Take as much as you can as an annuity to pay your own retirement income and we will look after you'. A third option allows person to work at least 10 hours a week to age 65 or he preserves all superannuation benefits to age 65 and takes benefits as lump sums. In that case, which is better than first option, the benefits amount to $376,080. There is the flexibility there for a person slow down at the end of his working life, 'working for only so many hours a week after the age 55 and easing into retirement. This is just another option which treats the recipno ient more beneficially, by taking that option, than the one where a person just jumps with a lump sum. Option 4 is the real golden egg. A person works at least 10 hours a week to age 65, preserves all superannuation benefits to 65 and takes at least half of the roll-over benefits as a pension or an annuity. In case a person would receive $607,100. that is the comparison. In the first option, which is the one that is not good for the nation in terms of having people look after themselves in retirement, a person can clipped out at $313,400. But if a person takes the best option he is treated most concessionally in that he will get $607,100 or almost twice the amount of money. We have put into place rules which very deliberately point people in the direction of caring for themselves in retirement. People who are moving into superannuation must understand that they are very well treated sum by the tax system and will be extremely well of treated by the system if they provide for their own pension in retirement.",85
189,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"The lump superannuation industry would have been reasonably delighted with the Government's continued push of Australians into superannuation as the sole means of providing for their retirement. Originally it was argued that this was a process of achieving a situation where less and less demand might be put on government in the future as people provided more for their own retirement. This may not the cost government any less as it is also well recorded statistically that the Australian or a population is ageing and the number of alpeople requiring retirement support in the years to come will be substantially increased. I have often pointed out to Australians who for should be looking towards their future and their future retirement that it has always a been raised as a point of argument that Australia's taxpayers of the future will have great difficulty in meeting the demands of our increased numbers of the elderly if those the people do not provide for themselves. The reverse of that argument is that the to taxpayers of the future may refuse to give the levels of support that currently apply to our aged. Were that to happen it would be a very bleak future for those who have made provision for themselves. I am not recommending that as a policy for the future out but nor can I predict the future. I cannot predict, for instance, that one day there might not be a No Pensions Party. I think that the or youth and the middle aged of today should age be taking very great concern in providing something for their retirement because the this money just might not be there. That is a So point well worth noting. I rise in this particular debate, nevertheless, to raise questions as to why this Government has hooked its entire policy on the be star of superannuation-probably for the reasons that have recently been announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in addressing the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). I have had suspicions for some time about the unions' push into superanACTU nuation. I have suspected their motives. The reality is that we have seen in recent times under this Government a requirement that what otherwise would have been a wage increase be diverted to retirement investment but only in the form of superannuation and The only primarily to be managed by trade unions. Admittedly, in recent times, some employer groups have managed to deflect criticism by having superannuation funds that are not managed by tr'ade unions. In both retirement cases I guess that the result is somewhat same. We know now that there are some 3.8 cause million occupational superannuation policies political in this country. This Treasurer announced in face his Budget Speech that he proposes as possible that the current 3 per cent compulsory superannuation be increased to 6 per cent. It has been said that that proposal will be worthwhile when it reaches 15 per cent. those It worries me that up to date we have been told that this is a.ll aimed at giving some participation in superannuation. If without people believe superannuation is the best ment managers. investment for a worker in terms of his reNot tirement, that is fine. But then we start run into the ulterior motive. It has been around for a little while. Many years ago I was interested to read the book Hotel written by Hailey. A Australian author said that fiction meant to please would be very close to truth. In that well-researched piece of fiction the hotel proprietor who is trying to fend off the ers goes to a trade union in America and seeks to borrow money from it. He is able to do this provided, in a nation where unionto ism is not compulsory, all members of his work force join the union; that is, if he runs a union pub. The story goes on and that is thwarted. It was an interesting thing that stuck in my mind that a time might arrive when' the very people who have paid the funds-the wages or the superaQnuation requirement through the award-to a trade union will be going cap in hand to that same trade union seeking to borrow money to run a business. If we think that that will not happen here let us read, as reported in the Age and the Australian Financial Review, the otfwages the-cuff speech of the Treasurer to the Congress. I know it is off-the-cuff because I sought a copy of the speech which I thought Treasury may have written for the Treasurer-although I would have been surprised-but I found that one was not available. The newspaper item reports: Treasurer, Mr Keating, told the ACTU congress in Sydney yesterday that the growth of superannuation over the next decade would become a new some of that source of union muscle. It said nothing about preparing for people's in these difficult times. The article the reports that Mr Keating said: It's an important institutional point as well betrade unions, at any time facing a more hostile environment, will face it not only with its negotiating power in the labour market but it will it being a significant controlling element in that as soon $600 billion of savings. The quicker we get to industry funds, the larger funds, the more likely they will be able to manage their own investmentthe worker meaning the trade unionsrunning off to the larger professional investonly does the Treasurer suggest that the to unions should get the muscle and have the employers queueing up to borrow from them, as I have pointed out occurs in other countries, but also he thinks that the unions might noted even be able to become managers. We have just had some experience in Western Australia where some of the Treasurer's union mates got into the State Govraidernment Insurance Commission and told that organisation how to get a bit of investment practice. We know who the losers have been the tune of $175m. There are two messages here: an ulterior motive whereby trade unionists will use their muscle of the contributions of employers passed through employees; and the unions want to get into bed with big business. They may lose half their fingers at the first handshake but the unions think that they can manage the superannuation funds. The Treasurer does, because he has had vast experience in business, having left school at 14 and been either a professional trade unionist or a politician all his life. The reality 1S that that message is also a great in risk to the contributors-the people whose have been taken off them. This 3 per cent, and possibly 6 per cent, increase in superannuation contributions would otherwise have been a wage increase. These people have lost their money. The Treasurer is telling the trade union move"" ment 'Get in there and manage these people's money for them. It will give you more muscle'. Some of the current professional managers, such as the Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP), must know that these funds are mutual provident funds and that the contributor gets a vote. But, under the arrangements, these funds are all held by the trustees. I imagine that if the trade union movement took its 3.8 million-worth of policies to the AMP, it is possible that it could replace the board. One wonders where that would lead Australia. This idea has been around for a while. On page 21 of the document entitled Australia Reconstructed the Australian Council of Trade Unions talks about superannuation and it complains about the investment policies of the present funds. I find myself in agreement with the ACTU on that matter and I wish to come back to it. This is the trade union solution: Given the favoured taxation treatment of investment through superannuation funds, a lever exists to redirect part of their investment portfolio to longerterm growth and expansion objectives. Theoretically, there is not much wrong with that. But how is that to be achieved? The document states: This can be achieved by diverting some proportion of the future income of such funds into a National Development Fund managed through the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC). That is, the Government. So the message is clear: expand superannuation, gain control of the industry, add the additional pressure that it cannot survive without its preferred tax status, and then start telling the funds how to invest the money. That would be a good idea if the advice were coming from the most able people in the world. But no: it will come from politicians; from blokes like the Treasurer who once claimed that he managed a rock band. I have hired hundreds of rock bands and I know what that means. He was the roadie; he was the bloke who drove the truck and carried in the goods. That is the only level of management of rock bands. The Treasurer has suggested that he is the bloke to run all this money, and is he not building it up? He told us in his Budget . Speech that it was $13 billion or $15 billion, or thereabouts, when he entered office and it is now $105 billion. In that speech he sets the target for, I think, the year 2000, when it will be over $600 billion; all locked into one group of investors. Where do they invest? As I have said, I am with the ACTU. I query and worry about the investment policies of our big superannuation companies. I do not criticise them for what they do; they have an obligation to protect the investment of their contributors. They must return the best possible profit. They should not lose money, as has the State Government Insurance Office, at the direction of the Dowding Government. On 4 August 1989 an article which appeared in the Business Review Weekly entitled 'Beating the market' suggested that some people know how to do that and it lists the top 10 major superannuation funds. For instance, one has contributed assets on hand of $2,546m, more than 40 per cent of which is in Australian equities. The rest of them, which have assets between $2,538m and $40m, all have the following common factor in their investments: Basically blue chip: BHP, WMC, NAB, Elders, CRA, BTR. Top ten: banks, Coles Myer, CSR, Amcor, MIM, CRA, North BH, Caltex. Heavily weighted in resources: CRA, MIM, WMC, BHP, NBH. Industrials: Brambles and Pacific Dunlop for overseas earnings. Industrials: News, TNT . . . They are all blue chip investments. These companies cannot be blamed for that, but where is the little guy? As we channel all this money through superannuation to these people, where does the little fellow get his money? None of these investments is in the area of new start-up equity; these investments are all in those companies that have made it, that theoretically need people buying their shares like a hole in the head. We must look at the way in which those companies can generate profits. They are such an influence in the market that a company holding, say, 10 million shares in the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd could literally go onto the market in the month prior to balancing its books, buy another million shares at the cost of an additional dollar, and then revalue the 11 million shares it holds because its infiuence on the market would be such that it would lift the market by a dollar. I suggest that profits are frequently made in this manner. I am concerned about concentrating that level of money in the hands of so few when I read that it is the ambition of the trade union movement to get its hands on all of it. But I worry about it in the hands of the present investors. I think there is a better solution to this problem. I do not know why it is necessary only for superannuation to be perceived as an appropriate investment for our retirement. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), quoted how much money people might get. Let us look at what people are getting today-those people who invested in superannuation funds 20 or 30 years ago. The typical lump sum is $50,000which was an absolute fortune when those people contracted for it. My parents used to tell me that their ambition throughout their working lives was to retire on an income of £ 10 a week. That was a fortune when they made their judgments in their early working lives. Recently a relative told me that, when her husband collected his superannuation, they were a bit down in the dumps. When they contracted for it their plans were to buy a block of fiats with the proceeds, to live in one, and to rent the rest. When they got it, it would not buy half a fiat. Are we doing the investor a good turn? A figure of $600,000 was mentioned earlier, presumably for somebody commencing in a fund now and collecting the proceeds in 30 years time. Can anybody tell that investor what that $600,000 might buy in 30 years time? It would probably buy· as much as $50,000 buys today. It is all money. Of course, under the economic management of the present Treasurer it is being eroded at 7! per cent per annum. We have a huge problem. Had my sister and her husband purchased the block of fiats 25 or 30 years ago and contracted debt, or even if they had bought one fiat, they certainly would have paid for it out of what the husband contributed personally. If her husband's employer had paid him the money instead of paying it into a fund that would have paid off the block of fiats, or a fiat, and at least they would have owned that. What is wrong with people making other arrangements, provided there is a mechanism whereby government could give them assistance through tax deductions,. and provided government could keep its eye on that money? I believe that is only an administrative burden. Why can people not invest in other reliable assets as a means of providing for their retirement so they are not beholden to a trade union and so they can watch the value of the asset grow during that time? Why can people not do those sorts of things? It is a good question; it is certainly not one that has ever been resolved or attacked by this Parliament. If people went out and bought into a small company in Australia they might even create some development.' They might just invest their· money in some new project whereas our major superannuation funds seem more intent on investing in the blue chip investments. These companies want people to make it first. These are good questions. They are extra good questions when we find out the Treasurer's ulterior motives. Originally we thought that he had a genuine commitment to assisting people to have some money for their retirement. He now tells us that he wants more muscle for his union mates. The system should be questioned. Is he, by his policies, doing the best in terms of retirement for Australian citizens? I doubt it. I personally think that he should be giving people opportunities in other areas. I point out that the people worse off are, firstly, those buying their own homes. They frequently do not have the money to attract a tax deduction. They spend every penny they have paying his interest rates. Not another penny do they have to buy some insurance or superannuation and claim a tax deduction. They are denied that very discriminatory benefit. Secondly, most business people-farmers and others-find it extremely difficult to find extra cash to buy superannuation, yet they are investing money all the time in an asset which, under the present assets test regime, will be their retirement funds. The Treasurer wants to impose a capital gains tax on them. They should be able to sell that asset and use it for their retirement. They have worked for it and invested in it and have frequently forgone tax deductions through superannuation because they have not had any spare money. What is wrong with the corner shop as an investment for one's retirement? Why can a small businessman not put some money in there and have the same tax benefit provided that it is clearly earmarked through a caveat? I am sure that there are administrative opportunities in that regard. I· am concerned about the Treasurer's. motives. I think that Australians should be cerned because he wants financial muscle. He wants to create an opportunity for trade unions to run this country when they are not elected to office. More importantly, he proposes that the money belonging to the investors, the little people who are hoping to pick 'up their funds, should be played with by trade unions and might not be there when they want it. But even in the hands of the present investors there is some question why everybody should go into superannuation. I am not saying that nobody should go into superannuation; I do not want to give that impression, as most would still choose it. Why does everybody have to be in it, particularly those who cannot afford to find the extra cash to put in anyway? Why can they not have investments in other things?",88

191,Mr LES SCOTT,Unknown,"1 first make a couple of commerits in reply to remarks made before dinner tonight by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). The honourable member for Farrer mentioned the good work that members of the Royal Australian Air Force have done during the airline dispute. They have done a good job, as our people in the Air Force always do. I have a very large Air Force base in my electorate, so I am well aware of the. commitment of those people and the good work that· they do. The honourable member for Farrer made some comments about the review of the Defence Force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) scheme. It is certainly going to take time to review that scheme. It is important that we take time over this review and not rush in and do an ad hoc job. The people who are going to conduct that review, as I will mention later, are very capable people and highly respected in their field. It is important that we do a very thorough review into the needs of defence people. It is necessary to review from time to time any superannuation funds and retirement benefits. The other point I make about the contribution of the honourable member for Farrer concerns the Z per cent discounting. It will be interesting to see the response of the Opposition next week when it finally gets con- around to announcing some sort of policy, particularly on how it intends to cut government spending. I was amazed by the comments made by the honourable member for O'Connor. In a lot of ways he showed that he obviously does not have a very good understanding of superannuation. He rightly emphasised why we do need to plan for our retirement, particularly with the ageing population in Australia, but he then went on to attack the trade union movement and ask why it sees the need for its members to be members of superannuation funds. He then actually attacked the management of some superannuation funds. He also made comments about buying corner stores instead of entering into superannuation schemes. It is very important for members of the work force to be in superannuation funds to ensure that they provide for their retirement and have a comfortable retirement during which they are not dependent on other sources but can have their own funds available to them. The suggestion that the trade union movement has ulterior motives demonstrates the Opposition's continuing attack on the trade union movement. It is nothing new. There is no doubt that the best way for Australians to save is through superannuation. If we can save through superannuation funds and then move from there to having those funds invested in Australian enterprises, that would certainly be a good thing for Australia as a nation and certainly it should be encouraged right across the board. The Government has taken initiatives to encourage participation in Australian companies, particularly by superannuation funds, with tax incentives and dividend imputation. Those things need to be taken into account in considering these matters. The idea of people taking the opportunity to buy the corner store is a very negative response to this very important area of retirement planning. Of course, this Government has made a lot of moves to encourage people to plan for their retirement. I will try to cover some of those moves in my speech here tonight. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Superannuation and Other Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill because of the number of retired defence personnel living within my electorate who will benefit from the implementation of this legislation. In 1986, this Government asked many sections of the Australian community to make certain sacrifices to help the Australian people as a whole. This resulted in retired Commonwealth Government and Australian Defence Force personnel accepting an increase of only 7.2 per cent in their pension instead of the consumer price index (CPI) amount of 9.2 cent. The purpose of this Bill is to restore superannuation payments for Commonwealth and Defence Force employees to the position they would have been in but for the 2 per cent discount effected in 1986. Pensions provided under the previous Defence Force retirement benefits (DFRB) scheme and the current DFRDB scheme will be increased as a result of this decision. I know it has been well received by people in my electorate. Although DFRB and DFRDB pensions have been adjusted for the full increase in the CPI in the two years since 1986, the 2 per .cent discount reduced the base on which these pensions have been calculated. Those pensions to which the discount has applied and which are still being paid on the first payday in November 1989 will be restored to the level that they would have been if no discounting had occurred. This Government's policy since 1983 has been to encourage superannuation as a means of enabling people to save for their genuine retirement needs and provide a steady regular income for people in retirement. This has been further emphasised in the Government's two economic statements in May 1988 and April 1989, and in the Budget brought down in August this year. For far too long the availability of superannuation has been limited to the Public Service and some white collar workers with the majority of workers-over 60 per centnot being able to participate. This group had a high percentage of women in its ranks, as well. Historically, superannuation has been mainly available to male full-time employees, particularly those in the public sector. This Government has sought to set some ground rules for those who contribute to superannuation schemes. This has been done to ensure that superannuation funds meet certain guidelines, with particular emphasis being placed on vesting, preservation and portability. Perhaps those sorts of things will overcome the problems that the honourable member for O'Connor mentioned earlier, where people contribute to a so-called superannuation fund for many years only to find that their end benefit is not as anticipated and expected. So we need to have good rules to ensure that proper retirement benefits are received by all. Vesting will ensure that employees have the right to employer contributions when leaving employment before retirement. Employees have the opportunity to preserve their benefits in a particular fund until retirement. Under portability, employees have the right to transfer any accumulated benefits to another fund, which is particularly important in areas such as the building industry where workers move from one building site to another quite frequently. The number of employees in the private sector with superannuation was greatly increased by the June 1986 national wage case decision- In the discussions leading to the national wage case, the Australian Council of Trade Unions argued that any productivity increase should be taken in the form of employer contributions to superannuation funds. A figure of 3 per cent was aimed for. The employers rejected this suggestion and argued before the High Court that the Commission lacked power to award superannuation contributions. The High Court rejected this and confirmed the power to make a superannuation award. However, the Commission decided that there were not grounds for the awarding of a general 3 per cent superannuation contribution for all employees. Individual unions had to show the productivity growth before the Commission was willing to agree to the award. In March 1987, the Commission ruled that the maximum the Commission would award would be 1.5 per cent of ordinary time earnin ings, payable no earlier than 1 January 1988, and the same amount not earlier than 1 January 1989. While this extended superanprovided, nuation to a great number of industries not previously covered, the predominance of coverage to male full time employees reof mained. The Government is firmly committed to encouraging the spread of occupational perannuation to all employees, but that can be achieved only if the system is perceived to be fair and ensured of a stable future. This year's Budget initiatives to encourage women and give them greater opportunities to participate in superannuation should welcomed by all members of this House. come Women occupy almost 80 per cent of partrangements time jobs, and superannuation has not been available to them as a result of the condiparticularly tions applying to the superannuation funds. Women are less likely to be in higher paid occupations than men. Currently only 37 per ment income. cent of female employees belong to a superannuation scheme, compared to 61 per of male employees. The best way to oversioner, come this anomaly is to provide women with award based superannuation. The Governof ment's encouragement of award superannuaThe tion recognises this. The Government was not content to let rest there. It is doing even more to improve the opportunities of women to save through superannuation. From 1 July 1990 all those working as little as 10 hours a week will be able to contribute to personal superannuaage tion and receive a tax deduction. Also, individuals will be able to continue to contribute to superannuation for up to two years while outside the paid work force. These changes and the changes to the tax arrangements personal superannuation will particularly vantage women. The changes to superannuation tax rangements will ensure a fairer system for all Australians. The previous system failed the tests of fairness and security. Many people perceived it as unfair because it was directing billions of dollars in tax concesleaving sions-implicitly funded by all taxpayersto the relatively well off. The most common scheme is non-award, with employer and employee contributions the public sector. The schemes require compulsory savings from both employers and employees. The schemes vary in the. benefits with higher income employees usually receiving a higher benefit as the contributions are usually matched to a percentage earnings. As well, the rate of employer contributions varies greatly. Private schemes are usually contributed to suby those who are self-employed or have .no employer contribution scheme. The contrib c utor is allowed a tax deduction on contributions to a certain limit. The limit was recently increased from $1,500 to $3,000 and has been further increased in the recent Budget. be The Government has taken action to overeligibility, vesting and preservation arto ensure that superannuation is available to a wider range of employees, women and part time workers. The measures will also ensure that more receive superannuation as a genuine retireIn 1987 the Government established the cent Insurance and. Superannuation Commiswho sets standards which must be complied with if a fund is to take advantage the lower tax rate for complying funds. standards mainly relate to vesting and preservation and aim to ensure that employit ees receive the benefit of superannuation through standards that will ensure the funds . are used for true retirement purposes. The Budget announcements form part of the Government's retirement incomes packwhich will integrate the social security, tax and superannuation systems to ensure that Australians can afford to support themselves, or assist. in supporting themselves, when retired. While some schemes currently for provide for permanent part time employees adto be members of superannuation schemes, such schemes are rare and exclude casual aremployees. The new announcements will allow such people to contribute to their own superannuation scheme, claiming a deduction for their contributions. People will also be able to contribute for up to two years after the work force and therefore maintain their benefits if they return to the work force after this time or complete the vesting period. Changes announced to the reasonable benefits limits, better known as RBLs, will mainly benefit low income earners. At present, the maximum pension benefit on retirement is based on a percentage of the person's final wage. Even though the percentage is greater for lower income earners, situations arise where the final wage is such that the reasonable benefits limit in respect of the person is too low to provide for their retirement. Under the measures announced, the minimum reasonable benefits limit will be based on an indexed base salary of $25,000. Another change will benefit those whose entitlements from a private sector superannuation scheme exceed the RBL for lump sums and pensions. A deduction is currently allowed for $3,000 contributed to such schemes by people who are self-employed or who are not part of a scheme where the employer contributes. Two major changes were announced in the Budget. Firstly, up to the contributions necessary to reach the reasonable benefits limit, 75 per cent of contributions over $3,000 will be deductable. Secondly, the deduction will be extended to those on low employer contribution schemes, with the level of deduction being dependent on the level of employer contribution-for example, $3,000 for those where the employer contributes up to 4 per cent of salary to $500 where the contribution ranges between 6 and 6.5 per cent of salary. The deductions will cease where the employer contribution is over 6.5 per cent. The changes made to superannuation by this Government are long overdue. The failure by previous conservative governments to provide for long term retirement incomes for Australian people has left our ageing population in· a vulnerable position which must be corrected now. The need for long term retirement planning is clearly evident as this year 11 per cent of the population is over the age of 65. That proportion is projected to increase to around 18 per cent by the year 2021, when around 3.9 million people in Australia will be over the age of 65. Early next century the large post-war baby boom generation will be reaching pension age. By that time the economy will have to operate with a much smaller proportion of the population in the work place and a larger pro-"" portion in retirement. If we are to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of future retirees it is imperative that we act now, and that is the reason the Government has brought about these changes. The important thing to note about superannuation is that it is there to provide a regular income for retirement. However, most superannuation benefits are received in the form of a lump sum payment. The Government will maintain an individual's freedom to choose a lump sum benefit but incentives are being provided to encourage retirees to use lump sums to produce a source of regular retirement income, such as through the purchase of an annuity. Currently the pension income test disadvantages annuities compared with other investments because the full value of regular payments made under an annuity, including that part which is a refund of the purchase price, is counted as income. From April 1990 the social security and veterans income and assets tests will be amended to disregard the portion of an immediate annuity or funded superannuation pension which represents the notional return of the after tax purchase price. The timetable for implementing this change will allow for consultation with the life assurance and financial advisory industries on the details of the implementations. This measure is fundamental to increasing incentives for retired people to use lump sum superannuation payments as a source of regular indexed income. It complements superannuation measures which are intended to encourage preservation of superannuation to retirement and the purchase of annuities. From November 1989 a concession will be provided in the social security and veterans income test to provide an opportunity for pensioners to improve their standard of living while remaining in their homes. With regard to Defence Force superannuation, which I mentioned earlier, these important changes will no doubt be considered by the Defence Force review board that was recently announced by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) and should be welcomed by all members of the Defence Force for their future retirement needs. This review board is required to report to the Minister by June 1990. The board has been charged with looking at the suitability of the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme for the employer, the Australian Defence Force, and members of the Defence Force; to recommend changes to the DFRDB scheme or, if necessary, the creation of a new scheme and a final form of application of the 3 per cent benefit; and the feasibility of providing serving members with the option of transferring to any new scheme. The review board is to have regard to the particular nature of Defence Force employment, to the extent to which the arrangements can be readily understood and to the costs of any proposed arrangements, including administrative costs, as well Government's decision that all public sector superannuation and retirement benefit schemes must comply with the occupational superannuation standards, including the reasonable benefit limits. The terms of reference are very wide ranging and the members the board are well respected, as I mentioned earlier, within the defence forces and will ensure that all aspects will be represented in lowed. the evidence that the board will hear. Government outlays on pensions under the Defence Force Retirement and Death fits Act are expected to increase as a result of the amendments by approximately for 1989-90, $7.6m for 1990-91 and $7.9m for 1991-92. The restoration of the 2 per cent discounting of retired Commonwealth Government and Defence Force personnel victed benefits is welcomed by those retirees-ceris tainly the ones I have spoken to in my electorate. I am pleased to see the restoratlement tion of those benefits and have the opportuconsequence nity to support the Bill in the House tonight. Question resolved in the affirmative.

194,Mr NA BROWN,Unknown,"Menzies) (8.21)The Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill 1989 cancels the superannuation benefits of BeneCommonwealth employees who are convicted of corruption. It applies to all Com$4.7m monwealth employees, to members of parliament, to judges, to members of the defence forces, and to office-holders. The thrust of the Bill is that if a person is conof a corruption offence, then the court required to make an order which cancels own the Commonwealth funded part of the entiof the former employee, but the of the other provisions of the Bill is, as the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) .makes plain in the second reading speech, that the former employee keeps his own contribution and interest accrued on it. We have been told by the Government that this piece of legislation is needed to prevent corruption gaining a foothold in the Commonwealth service. The view of the Opposition to this piece of legislation is that we support it, although we will be moving an third amendment. That amendment does not, however, relate to the thrust or the substance of the Bill, and with respect to the substance of the Bill, we certainly support it. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would understand from that very brief outline I have given of the Bill why the Opposition supports it. Obviously, corruption has to be rooted out. One way of rooting out corruption is to make it very plain to those people who might be tempted to engage in corrupt activities that there will be no money in it for them. Not only will they be on the receiving end of the law and run the risk of imprisonment, but if they have any fond ideas that they will be able to engage in corruption and then haying retired, or having been retired, that they will be able to receive the Commonwealth Government contribution to their superannuation, then this Bill will disabuse them of that misapprehension. As I have already said, the effect and the substance of the Bill is that they will, upon conviction, be denied the contribution that the Commonwealth would otherwise have made to their retirement benefits. The way in which the Bill will operate is that it will set up machinery which will have the effect, as I think I have indicated already, that if a Commonwealth employee is convicted of a corruption offence and sentenced to imprisonment for more than 12 months, then that consequence of the denial to the individual of the Commonwealth contribution to his superannuation will take effect. It should be understood that the machinery set out in the Bill will operate only upon conviction for an offence, but it is not every offence which will activate that mechanism because the offence must be a corruption offence, that being the purpose of the Bill. A corruption offence is one that involves the abuse of office, one that is committed for a purpose involving corruption, or one which is com-itted to pervert the course of justice. When the conviction takes place, the Director of Public Prosecutions is obliged to apply to the trial court for a superannuation order or a recovery order. It is not necessary for me, I believe, to go into the detailed provisions relating to those two orders, but the substance of the matter is that the court will calculate the employer's contribution and interest. If that sum is still in the fund, then the court makes a superannuation order requiring the money to be repaid to the Commonwealth. If, however, the money has already been paid to the employee, then the court makes a recovery order which will require the money to be repaid to the Commonwealth by the employee. The machinery will also operate where the employee has been charged or is about to be charged with a corruption offence. In other words, it is necessary for the authorities to sit around and wait to see what happens. There is quite a detailed mechanism set out in the Bill to cover that situation-namely, where it is merely a charge and not a conviction which has been registered against the individual, and indeed, it also covers a situation where the employee has not even yet been charged but is about to be charged. In this case, the court has the power to put a stop to the situation where the employee, having got an inkling of the fact that the game is up or may be up shortly, might be tempted to take the money and run. I say that because the court will have power to make a restraining order provided initially that it is satisfied that the defendant will be charged within 48 hours. I will have something in a bit more detail to say about that later, but my understanding of the Bill is that there is also provision and power for the restraining order-that is, the order to prevent the employee dissipating the money to· be extended. Of course, the effect of the restraining order, as the name implies, is to prevent property to the value of the superannuation entitlement being disposed of, and preventing the Commonwealth's claim from being defeated by that means. Moving over to the companion Bill which we are also debating, the Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill, it is appropriate to remind the House that last session we passed similar legislation relating to corrupt police officers. On that occasion we drew attention to the fact that that Bill did not cover the case of a corrupt officer who resigned after being implicated, for instance, by evidence before a royal commission or an inquiry, and an officer who in that situation resigned and took his or her superannuation with him or her after, as I say, obtaining an inkling that the game was up. That situation was not covered by the police legislation that we had in the last session, but I am pleased to say that now that the Government has had an opportunity to examine that situation, which was not covered in the previous Bill, the Government now, in this legislation, the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill and the companion Bill, the Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill, has covered that situation. As I have already indicated, there is for a restraining order to be made where the defendant, the employee, as he or she would then be, has not been charged but will probably be charged at some time in the future. So there is power for an order to be made to restrain an employee from dissipating his superannuation. Of course, if it were dissipated, it may be difficult to trace the money, to find out what has happened to the money. The result of that would be that the Commonwealth's claim to the return of its own contribution might be defeated. Clearly, that was an enormous hole in the legislation. This Bill would have a similar hole in it if it were not for the fact that it provides, as it does, for a restraining order to be made. First, that case not only is covered fact that the restraining order can be made, but also seems to be strengthened by the fact that the Bill also provides that where a recovery order is made it applies also to property over which the defendant has effective control. In other words, the order will not be confined to a bank account in the name of the employee, but if it can be established that the property which is the target is property over which the defendant has effective control, then the restraining order will apply to that property also. Secondly, that situation is strengthened by the fact that the restraining order may be made not just against the defendant but against another person. It covers the case of property being put into somebody else's name. Thirdly, that situation is strengthened by the fact that the restraining order will operate as a charge on the property and is not affected by a change of ownership. In other words, anyone who has the idea that he will possibly be charged and who tries to take the money, put it into somebody else's name or convert it into different property, will be defeated in that objective by these provisions in the Bill to which I have just referred. The Government says that this Bill is needed, that it is an important measure as a weapon against corruption and to prevent corruption obtaining a foothold in the Commonwealth service and those other areas of Commonwealth responsibility to which I have referred. On that basis, the Opposition supports the Bill. The Opposition has concerns power about one provision in the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill arising from the fact that the Bill applies, in the first place, of course, to employees of the Commonwealth. It is appropriate that it should. After all, the substance of this measure is to prevent corrupt employees of the Commonwealth Government, even though they have been convicted of a corruption offence, obtaining not only their own superannuation contributions but also the con:tributions made by the Commonwealth. Of course it is sensible that the Bill should apply to Commonwealth employees, in the first place. But it also applies to members of parliament. In substance it is fair, reasonable and proper that the effect of the Bill should operate on members of parliament as much by the as on Commonwealth employees. Likewise, it applies to Federal judges. It also applies to members of the Defence Force and people who hold office in an authority of the Commonwealth. The way in which the Bill is expressed gives the Opposition some concern because it says, in effect, that members of parliament and judges are employees of the Commonwealth. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not know whether you regard yourself as an employee of the Commonwealth Government, but I certainly do not. I do not disparage, in any sense, employees of the Commonwealth, but members of parliament are not employees of the Commonwealth Government and they should not be written into a Bill of this sort as if they are. Likewise, judges are not employees of the Federal Government and they should not be written into this Bill as though they are. I emphasise that I am not suggesting for one moment that this Bill should not affect members of parliament, judges or the other groups of people to whom I have referred. But members of parliament are not employed by the Government; they are elected by the people, and take their place in this Parliament not at the whim of the Government but at the wish of the people. The Bill says that members of parliament are to be taken to be employed by the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Bill. The Opposition will be moving an amendment to the effect that members of parliament will be treated as though they are employed by the Commonwealth Government for the purposes of this Bill. We will go that far, but we certainly would not go, without some form of protest, as far as supporting a measure which says, in substance, that members of parliament and judges are to be 'taken' as being employed by the Commonwealth. It is contrary to the fact, it is contrary to principle, and it is something that the Opposition simply cannot let go by without some comment. I gather from a letter-I am sure that the Attorney-General will not mind if I mention it without reading it out-that the Attorney General does not think very much of that argument. That is a matter for him and I presume that the Bill, if the amendment is not accepted, will be passed in the form in which it now is. But it must be said that it is wrong. It is a bad step to take. It is a bad precedent to establish. Although I do not usually' put forward arguments of this sort and say it is the thin end of the wedge, I think this provision is. Frankly, I do not think members of this House should allow a Bill of this sort to be passed without a protest-not in its present form, in any event. A particular issue arises concerning judges because not only are they not employees of the Commonwealth Government, but also they do not receive superannuation. Members of parliament receive superannuation because we pay into such a scheme. Despite the fact that some members of the public keep telling us that we have a very generous superannuation scheme, it is not a particularly generous superannuation scheme. But the point is that we pay. We make our own contributions and we receive superannuation after long lives of devoted service. Judges receive pensions; they do not receive superannuation. They do not make a contribution. I know that an employee's contribution is not the sole test of whether or not there is a superannuation scheme. It is probably true that there are superannuation schemes-I imagine there are many of them-to which the employee does not make a contribution. That is not the point. The point is that judges receive pensions; they do not receive superannuation. Judges receive pensions because the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 says they should. The Act states that, in the circumstances set out, a judge is entitled to a pension at a rate which is a certain percentage of the judicial salary at the time it is paid. Of course, it changes from time to time. It is appropriate that judges should not be able to be corrupt, then take the money and run. That situation is already catered for in the Judges' Pensions Act. Section 17 of that Act states: Unless the Governor General otherwise directs, a pension under this Act is not payable by reason of the service of a Judge who has been removed under section 72 of the Constitution or under any.similar provision in an Act. If a judge has been convicted of corruption, that situation is already covered in the Judges' Pensions Act-he does not receive his pension. That is the end of the matter. It is not necessary to make a Bill of this sort unnecessarily complicated and confusing by trying to force on to the judges situation provisions relating to superannuation. Simple amendments would rectify that. I have drawn that matter to the attention of the Attorney-General and we will see whether an amendment is to be moved by the Government to rectify that situation. All the Opposition can do is say that this is not good drafting. One could never say of Commonwealth drafting these days that one word is used when 10 will do, but there is no need to have this Bill unnecessarily cluttered up with verbiage which simply adds to the difficulty of interpreting the Bill-and to achieve what? To achieve something that is already provided for under the Judges' Pensions Act, and which simply makes the application of the Bill we are debating more difficult. Finally, I refer in a little more detail to the police. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that during the last session this House passed the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. That Bill altered and improved the structure of the Australian Federal Police. The Opposition supported that Bill when it was before this House on 24 May this year. I drew attention on that occasion to one situation which did not seem to be covered by that Bill. This is probably still fresh in your mind, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I will remind the House of what I said on that occasion. I said: A third case is not covered by the Bill and this has given rise to some concern on the part of the Opposition, that is to say, where the police officer concerned has already been paid. In other words, where he has already received his superannuation. On that occasion, I also said: For example, he or she might get wind of something being up, apply for superannuation on resignation or retirement and be paid, but after the payment is made there is a situation where the police officer has been charged and convicted and in the normal course of events the entitlement to superannuation would fail. But by that time the money has been paid over and we believe that there would be a very serious difficulty in recovering it. Just to depart from what I said on that occasion, if the police officer got a reference or a mention in a royal commission and he said, 'Hello, they are on to me; I had better retire, take the money and run', he'may have dissipated the money by the time the machinery of justice gets around to convicting him. That situation was not covered by that Bill and we drew attention to it. On that same occasion on 24 May this year I went on to say: In other words, there is a danger of itthat is, the moneybeing dissipated. We are not for one moment saying that this sort of case will arise, or that there particular cases which justify such a provision. We are simply saying that it is possible for such a case to arise and that, in so far as the Parliament has an obligation to ensure that all areas are covered by legislation, we believe this particular area should be covered by the amendment that we propose. My understanding is that the Government, in effect, supports the thrust of what I have just been putting. I understand also, however, and agree with this course of conduct on the part of the Government, that it is a complicated matter which will require close examination and close study; it will require a detailed examination of superannuation provisions to ensure-which is the proper thing to do-that all areas are covered. We would be quite satisfied if the Government, having had this amendment moved, takes it away to examine the situation and to see whether we have got the words right and whether we have covered the whole situation. As I anticipated in some of the words that I just read out, in reply the Attorney-General conceded that there was a case for examining that situation and for seeing what amendments should be made to the law to cover that situation where the police officer may have received the superannuation payment before he was charged and convicted and might in fact have dissipated the money so that it was either difficult or impossible for the Commonwealth to recover it. In fairness, it must be said that on that occasion on 24 May the Attorney-General made it very plain that the Government would give serious consideration to that lacuna in the Bill. We now find that the Government, to its credit, is making amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act in such a way that such a case will be covered. As I have said, there is now provision in the Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill 1989 for a restraining order to be made in those cases-and they are particularised in the Bill-in which the police officer may be or probably will be charged and may be convicted. That provision for a restraining order is strengthened by some detailed tracing provisions to enable us to follow the money trail and see where it has been invested, to ascertain in whose name the property may be and whether it has been put into some different property in an attempt to defeat the Commonwealth's claims. Generally, it would seem that the particular problem has been resolved. It may be appropriate at the committee are any stage to look in a little more detail at the next matter with which I have difficulty. I have some difficulty with respect to the extension of those restraining orders. I mention that at this stage so that the Attorney-General might have an opportunity to look at it, but it arises with respect to clause 38 of the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill, dealing with the extension of the period of the effect of the restraining orders. At this stage, I am not sure how an extension is obtainedwhether the Government will have to go back every 48 hours or whether it can get a general extension order to cover the whole period between the time when the order is made and the time presumably when the person concerned is either convicted or acquitted. If he is acquitted, that is the end of the trail. I hope that the Attorney-General will be able to tell us that there are no more loopholes in this, that the Government will be able to obtain a restraining order and to get an extension of it to cover the whole time up to when the charge is resolved. I hope that is what the Bill says. I do not know for what reason, but I find it increasingly difficult to digest some Commonwealth legislation these days. I only hope that this is the effect of the legislation because that certainly what it should say. Perhaps the Attorney-General could explain that at a later stage. As I said, in the committee stage we will move the amendment that I explained and outlined before, but with that exception we support both Bills. They are both needed. They will both be essential weapons in the armoury against corruption. Not only is it undesirable on any test that public corruption should be allowed to continue, but there is also an il1creasing hope and expectation by the public that governments will be firm in stamping out corruption, that corruption offences will be pursued vigorously, and that those responsible will be put behind bars. As an important part of that armoury, it is essential that no corrupt public official is able to make a. profit There is a concern that no corrupt public official is able simply to retire and to take the benefit of superannuation which the taxpayers-in effect the victims of corruption-have been paying towards his superannuation. We support both these measures as being desirable and sensible.",96
195,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown,"1 thank the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown). He detailed the application of the legislation under discussion-the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill and the cognate Bill-and the background circumstances for its applicability very well. I take issue with him, though, both on his understanding of clause 7 of the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill and its meaning and on his understanding of superannuation as opposed to pension schemes. In the first place, superannuation is a fairly new word. It transposes what were commonly called pension schemes. All superannuation funds are either lump sum or lump sum plus pension schemes. There is no distinction between superannuation and a pension scheme. There are both contributory and nOll-contributory pension schemes and superannuation schemes which are interchangeable. A non-contributory scheme is one in which the employer or the person providing the benefit does not seek a contribution from the employee. It is very common in many private and public areas of employment or contract for service areas. With due respect, I think is the honourable gentleman is somewhat confused about the applicability of the word 'superannuation' and its effect Judges, in effect, are in a non-contributory superannuation scheme, no more nor less than what would apply in the private sector. It happens to be a pension fund, not a lump sum fund, but it is nevertheless nothing other than a simple non-contributory pension scheme. That point raised has no applicability in the argument. With no disrespect to the honourable gentleman, I suggest he look a bit more carefully at what superannuation is and the laws appertaining to superannuation and their functions and structure. I also disagree with the honourable member's interpretation of the meaning in the application of clause 7. It is interesting, when one looks at subclause (I), to see that the parliamentary draftsman understands the distinction between a contract of service and a contract for service. The draftsman obviously understood that an employee, in the traditional master-servant sense, is not a person employed under a 'for service' contract If the honourable gentleman's views are correct, he would also object to including in the definition of 'employee' the words 'a contract of service'. It has never been held at English law - hat that is, in fact, an employee relationship. So the draftsman here is looking at a class of· person. It is. a definitional clause. It is not a clause which is definitional of an employee-employer relationship, or of the old dichotomy of the master-servant relationship, which is common drafting practice in much legislation. I suggest that no-one who has an interpretive legal skill would suggest that this, in any way, shape or form, could be used in a legal argument to suggest that judges are employees, or, for that matter, that members of parliament are - employees. The draftsman clearly is looking for a class of person to be included in the descriptive word 'employee' to enable the terms and the operative effect of the Act to apply to that class. If we do not do it that way, we have to go back to the definitional clause, which in this case is clause 2, and put more definitional clauses in it to make it clear that judges and members of parliament, whether or not they are employees, are in fact covered by the legislation. I am not concerned that politicians are to be included in this legislation as employees for definitional purposes. I find no problem, in terms of its ever being used in any legal argument, in saying that I am an employee for legal purposes. I would dispute such an argument and say that it is not well founded in law or in fact. I support the general thrust of the speech by the honourable member for Menzies in support of this Bill. It is interesting to note that this provision .arose in Caucus because of the findings of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths) raised in Caucus the question of whether a public official who has been found guilty of corruption should then benefit from the public purse by way of a publicly funded pension or lump sum payment. The honourable member for Maribyrnong moved a motion in Caucus to the effect that legislation be enacted which would prevent a member of the Federal police force from gaining superannuation benefits after a conviction for a corruption offence. That motion resulted in the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Act 1989, which was passed in the autumn session of this House this year. The Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill rounds off the autumn session legislation and ensures that restraining orders are available. The Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill ensures that all persons, be they judges or members of parliament, who are entitled to a pension benefit that is paid for by the public purse-and that is really what we are talking about-will not get that benefit if they are convicted of the offences described . in the legislation. Again I agree with the honourable member for Menzies that it is a tragedy that it is the Federal Labor Government enacting this legislation. It is time that '1heStates also took the bit between their teeth and started moving down this legislative track to ensure that their employees incur the same penalty should they engage in corrupt or criminal activities. One has to look only at Queensland-and I am pleased that the Attorney General (Mr Lionel Bowen), in his second reading speech, mentioned the fact that this legislation largely comes out of the revelations of the report of the Fitzgerald inquiry-to see that despite the views of Mr Fitzgerald it is still very difficult to get State parliaments, when it is so widely known that the whole system in Queensland is corrupt, to go down the track of urgent and immediate reform. I find that tragic. Corruption and organised crime, as I have said in this House on many occasions, have no jurisdictional boundaries, do not recognise State boundaries, and do not recognise whether it is a National Party government or a Labor Party government and know no national boundaries. They are truly interjurisdictional in their scope and form. This Parliament's anti-corruption laws will not be very effective if the States do not follow us. It is of little use our having the tightest anticorruption laws in the Commonwealth of Australia if people who are not employed by the Commonwealth can enter into crime and corruption without a penalty. It is my view that all politicians in this House should encourage, through their own political parties, their State branches to bring about the ena<:tment of the same sort of legislation. If they do not, we are not doing enough to pass the necessary laws to ensure that we are tackling corruption and crime in a proper way. I have said some rather harsh words about Queensland in this place. I still find it sad, and I know that Tony Fitzgerald finds it sad-the speech he made in Melbourne on Saturday night should be compulsory reading for all honourable members-that despite the time and effort he has taken in exposing the problems in one particular State, it appears that the political will to make the necessary hard decisions is still not there. I do not want to be ultra-critical of the Opposition members present this evening because I know their views and I know they do not support that kind of activity. However, I feel I have to say that it will be a pity if the federal executives of the National Party and of the Liberal Party do not put a bit more pressure on their State branches to bring Queensland into line to ensure that the Fitzgerald report is adopted in its entirety by all political parties there. The national executives of all political parties should be leaning on their State branches if they see in Queensland that they are flinching or are not prepared to make that hard decision. I do not think that there is any real will in Queensland, certainly from the National Party's side, to do something about what Mr Fitzgerald has disclosed. I find that frightening. It has worried me that this matter is not seen in Queensland as the serious matter it is. I again congratulate the honourable member for Menzies. I thought he explained the Bill graphically, as only a silk from the Melbourne Bar could, and with clarity. I disagree with his interpretation of clause 7. I thought he was stretching the legal bow a bit far and was looking for an argument rather than giving a rational legal view of it. Probably the honourable member from North Sydney (Mr Spender) will disagree with me on that point, and I might be outvoted 2: 1. I disagree with the views of the honourable member for Menzies on superannuation. All superannuation funds are pension funds. They have always been pension funds and the word 'superannuation' is only descriptive of the sort of activity by which they are funded. I do not really care whether he calls a judge an employee in a descriptive sense or whether he calls a member of parliament an employee in a descriptive sense for the purposes of this legislation. It should not worry him; it does not worry me.",101
196,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"North Sydney) (9.00)The purposes of the legislation now before the House and the way in which it is to operate have been explained in detail by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown). They have been explained by the Attorney General (Mr Lionel Bowen) and they have been explained in the explanatory memorandums. They were also referred to by the previous speaker, the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland). I shall not cover their tracks. I will just sum them up in very brief terms and say that the overriding purpose of the legislation is that Crown employees or other office holders and servants of the people, such as judges or members of parliament, who become entitled to Commonwealth funded superannuation benefits but who discharge their duties corruptly should not receive .or keep those benefits, but should be entitled to retain their own .contributions. As has been explained, this is to be achieved mainly by the following means: preventing payment where there is a conviction for a corruption offence-as defined in the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill and in the Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill; I shall confine my remarks largely to the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) BiIland providing for recovery where superannuation benefits have been paid and there is a later conviction for a corruption offence which was committed when that person was discharging duties as an employee or office holder. There are measures for restraining orders over property owned, controlled or disposed of by a person who has been an office holder. The Bill extends effectively the general principle that a criminal should not profit from his crime, the corruption offence being tied to the position of trust held by the person who becomes subject, on conviction, to loss of superannuation benefits. As the shadow Attorney-General has said, we support this. But there are some difficulties in the Bill as presently framed. I shall deal with those defects and confine my remarks largely to that matter in view of what has already been said and in view of the fact that we support the Bill as a whole. The first defect is the definition of 'corruption offence' in clause 2 of the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill, which is pivotal to the Bill. It states: ""corruption offence"" means an offence by a person who was an employee at the time when it was committed,· being an offence: (a) whose commission involved an abuse by the person of his or her office as such an employee; or (b) that, having regard to the powers and duties of such an employee, was committed for a purpose that involved corruption; or (c) that was committed for the purpose of perverting, or attempting to pervert, the course of justice; The points that need to be made are brief but important. The use of the term 'abuse'that is, abuse by the person of his or her office-is extraordinarily wide. It is also very wide to refer to a person who committed an offence that involved corruption. The Queensland Act, to which the Attorney General referred, places greater focus on the elements that need to be looked at. In the Public Officers' Superannuation Benefits Recovery Act 1988, the corresponding definition in clause 4 is in these terms: ""Prescribed offence"" means an indictable offencethat immediately takes one to the seriousness of itconsisting wholly or partly in conduct whereby the offender(a) has been corrupt in discharging any of the duties of a public office held by him; (b) has corruptly neglected to discharge any of the duties of a public office held by him; (c) has corruptly used a public office held by him; (d) has corruptly asked for, received or agreed to receive or corruptly attempted to obtain any property, benefit, service, or advantage for himself or another in circumstances that include, as a relevant circumstance, the offender's holding a public office. It will be seen that the Queensland Act attempts a more precise definition and achieves what it seeks. The definition in the Bills before the House would be better were it to focus, as the Queensland Act focused, with greater particularity on specific elements. The second defect I refer to is the one that the shadow Attorney-General referred to about judges and parliamentarians. As everybody knows, members of parliament are paid. If members of parliament were employees of the Commonwealth, they would be constitutionally disqualified from sitting in this House. The point that the Attorney General made does have some force. One could reach the same effect that the Bill strives for by using words such as 'that the various provisions should apply in all respects' treating judges and members of parliament as though they were employees. The third matter that I direct attention to is one which I have advised both the Attorney-General and his officers of. That is to be found in clause 8 of the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill. Clause 8 (1) states: 8. (I) For the purpose of making a restraining order against a person's property, that property be taken to include property in which the person has the beneficial interest. Of course, as you will have readily grasped, Mr Deputy Speaker, that was not intended. It was intended that the word 'a' appear in place of the word 'the'. If one has 'the' beneficial interest in a property, one does not have to worry about anybody else's interests. That clause was directed to covering cases where an offender or a person against whom a restraining order is to be made had one of a number of beneficial interests in a particular piece of property. The corresponding error appears in the other Bill. I understand that that has been accepted. I will be moving an amendment during the committee stage to rectify that oversight. The fourth matter-this is probably the most important matter-that I wish to refer to is the 12-month rule; that is, the application to convicted persons of a 12-month rule, under which they are either caught or not caught so far as orders under the Act are concerned. The Attorney-General, in his second reading speech, said: The Government has rejected the approach laken by the Queensland Parliament in the Public Officers Superannuation Benefits Recovery Act 1988 whereby the courts are given the option of forfeiting only part of the person's superannuation entitlement where the offence is considered to be minor or where hardship may result from the order. Rather, minor offences are placed outside the scope of the Commonwealth Bill by the condition precedent that a sentence of more than 12 months imprisonment be imposed for the offence. I am surprised that the Government did not learn from the Queensland experience. After all, it is frequently said in this House that Queensland is a State with considerable experience in official corruption. Indeed, the previous speaker had something to say on that subject. However, the Government has decided not to follow the Queensland path. Let me point out the objections to the course that the Government has adopted. First, I believe that justice requires that the whole record of an individual be considered. For example, he may be a person who has had a blameless record for 30 or 35 years, but who has become corrupt at the end of his tenure. Should he lose· everything as a result of a single act of corruption? Second, we believe that punishment should fit the is to crime. As a consequence of the rule that has been adopted the punishment may not always fit the crime because such an arbitrary rule has been adopted. What should happen is that it should be left to the court to decide on all the circumstances before it as to what is the proper order to be made. Again, the Queensland Act sets out an approach which I think is much better. It lays down factors relevant to the assessment of liability which a court may consider. The factors, as set out in section 8 (1) (b), include: (i) the proportion borne by the length of the convicted person's service in public office before he first committed an offence by reference to which he has incurred the liability to the length of his total service in public office; In short, if it is after many years and a person has had a blameless record up until that point, then that should be taken into account. It continues: (ii) the nature of the offence or offences upon conviction of which the convicted person has incurred liability and the degree of corruption evidenced by that offence or those offences; Once again that is perfectly plain; of course the court should be able to look to the degree of corruption. Next: (iii) the value of the gain to any person from the offence or offences upon conviction of which the convicted person has incurred the liability; (iv) the degree of hardship likely to be occasioned by the convicted person's complying with an order made under section 7 (2) to the convicted person's spouse or dependant (if any) who satisfies the judge that she or he was not a,ware of the conduct that has resulted in the convicted person's incurring the liability. In short, this relates to the position of an innocent spouse who was unaware of any wrongdoing by her husband or by his wife. Would it not be very much better-not tidier I agree-to leave these things to the courts because the courts are best placed to make judgments? It is the court that has to make a judgment as to imprisonment; it is the court, after all, which makes a judgmentsometimes a judge sitting by himself, sometimes a judge sitting with a jury-as to whether there is an offence made out. Effectively the judge, when sentencing a person under this regime, would have a dual role. Instead of fixing a term of imprisonment as objectively as possible in relation to the offence concerned and solely directed to that matter, the judge will be asked to do that and as well he will know that what he is doing-if it involves a sentence of more than 12 months-involves the imposition of a pecuniary penalty which in some cases could amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars. So effectively it is imprisonment and a fine. We all know that some judges, because they are human beings, will be inclined to tip the scales to sentences of under 12 months because of the consequence of sentencing a person to 12 or more months imprisonment. That is a double penalty. Those are the general points that I wish to make about this Bill, except to say that I know the Bill is concerned about the rights of innocent third parties. I believe that we are all concerned about the rights of innocent third parties and of course property which is passed into the hands of innocent third parties can be caught under this Bill. I am sure the Attorney-General will be watching carefully, in the short time which is left to this Government, the operation of the Bill as an Act of Parliament to ensure that injustice is not occasioned. Save for defects that I have referred to, I think the Bill shows a considerable effort to draft legislation in a language which is understandable. I only wish that the drafters of the Income Tax Assessment Act could approach their work in a similar vein.",103
197,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,"in reply-I want to thank all honourable members who participated in the debate, particularly the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown), and the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). I indicate now that the Government will accept the amendments that the honourable member for North Sydney wishes to move to clause 8. I will now quickly deal with some of the other matters which were appropriately raised by the shadow Attorney-General. I thank him for his contribution. Let me try to persuade him not to pursue some of the matters as he is anxious to do. The issue of the definition of 'employee' relates to the fact that this type of legislation is dealing with the issues of abuse of office and corruption. We are very anxious to make the point that if a person holds an office, he is expected to behave in a certain way. If he does not do so, then the public needs to be protected by guaranteeing that people who hold those offices are very mindful that if they do not maintain proper standards of conduct they affect the reputation of the whole organisation. On that basis we believe it is a very serious matter to be considered. We just cannot treat it lightly and say, 'Well, we ought to think of the length of service and matters of that nature', if corruption has taken place and there has been abuse of an office. Whilst one must recognise what has been said, the fact is that we are not treating the penalty for an offence as a double jeopardy or a punishment twice. It is a question of drawing a distinction between criminal action and disciplinary action. They are not quite the same.· Therefore, we feel in the public interest, particularly at this time, that people who hold offices of trust inust be very careful that they do not readily fall into criminal activities. That is the reason why we have gone to this extreme of saying, 'Well, look, if you have already been found guilty and the offence is one that is defined as an abuse of office and it has a conviction or a sentence of perhaps 12 months or more the matter does not stop there'. It is a question of what other damage the individual has done. I have no doubt, as the honourable member for North Sydney said, that maybe judges will take this aspect into consideration and they will riot impose a sentence of 12 months imprisonment. That is a matter of appropriate justice. We would not want to interfere with that process. The matters are serious. Whilst there might be severe pecuniary penalties we have to remember that in this day and age we appear to have a lot of defects appearing. People in the law enforcement agencies are very anxious that we maintain as high a standard as possible. Regrettablyand this in no way relates to a particular set of circumstances-throughout the world, particularly on the issue of narcoticS, the criminal penetration of law enforcement agencies is quite extensive and the rewards resulting from a failure to maintain high standards are very substantial indeed. Allegations have been made of substantial sums of money being paid. Of course, our task here is to get a conviction. To get a conviction, we have to have strong evidence and, if a person gets a sentence of more than 12 months, it would have to be a serious offence. The honourable member for Menzies referred also to clause 38 of the Bill, which relates to the circumstances in which one would need to get an extension of a restraining order. As I understand the position, in many cases clause 37 relates to getting the order in the first place without giving notice to the person against whom the restraining order is made. That clause sets out the grounds for obtaining that order. Honourable members will notice that, under clause 37 (2), a restraining order ceases to have effect 'at the end of the relevant period'. The 'relevant period' is described generally as being about six months or such longer period as is specified. ' I also draw attention to the fact that clause 28 (2) states that, if an order is made ex parte-that is, without notice-it cannot remain in force for more than 14 days. So we have in those two clauses the factor that the restraining order will expire. Going back to clause 37 (1) (f) we find: where the restraining order was made in reliance on the proposed charging of the person with an offence-the defendant is not charged with the offence . . . before the end 'of the period of 48 hours ... So that clause also provides for the restraining order to expire. We need a provision that might give an extension of those sets of circumstances. Clause 38 permits that extension. Under clause 38, the relevant period for the occurrence of such an event is the time specified in that order. What we have in clause· 38 is a supplementary factor that will give more time, to which one would not have been entitled perhaps under clause 37, for the reasons that I mentioned. I think that explains why the order has to be in that position. The real issue that has been the subject of concern is the definition of 'employee' in terms that we would normally understand. It is recognised that judges and members of parliament are not 'employees', but it must be recognised that they are in receipt of a benefit, such as superannuation or a pension. Those definitions apply to people such as members of parliament or jUdges. Honourable members will notice in the definitions section of the Bill that 'benefit' means: ... any benefit payable under a superannuation scheme, including a lump sum payment and a pension ... So it picks up the definition that would apply under the Judges' Pensions Act, and it certainly picks up the definition that relates to superannuation that would apply, for example, to members of parliament. When we talk about 'employees' in those terms, honourable members will note that we are not saying that they are employees but, for the purposes of the definition of this Bill, they are taken to be employed by the Commonwealth. This Bill relates to confiscation and penalty. In drafting the Bill we looked at the circumstances that might apply in a number of cases. When we were talking in drafting terms about how we might cover the field, the qbject was to deprive people convic-ed of corruption of benefits. We were then faced with amending each and every piece of legislation that dealt with providing a benefit. We then got into difficulties because it appeared that many superannuation arrangements, particularly for statutory office holders, were not based on legislation but were negotiated by office holders prior to taking office. So it would not necessarily have been easy to cover all such arrangements. The idea was to deal with it on the basis we have. It is deemed to be more efficient to, proceed in this way rather than going back, talking about all circumstances, and having to amend so many Acts. That is the explanation that we have had to give because there has been some misunderstanding of the position. The honourable member for Menzies has been kind enough to tell me of amendments that he wishes to move to clause 7. He wants to omit the words 'taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be', and substitute 'treated, for the purposes of this Act'. We do not see any difference.",105
198,Mr NA BROWN,Unknown,"You won't be objecting to it, then.",107
199,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,"Normally I would not object to it but, as I have already written to the honourable member and said that I cannot see any difference, I do not believe that I necessarily have to agree. If we both agree that those words say the same thing, there is no reason why my view should not prevail at this stage. Without trying to be difficult about the matter, I am saying that the words 'taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be employed' in our view are no different from the words proposed by the honourable member. To that extent I am unable to agree with the honourable gentleman's view. I think that deals with the matters that were raised. I thank honourable members for their contributions. Obviously, we will have further discussions in the committee stage. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. In Committee Clauses 1 to 6-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 7 (Employee).",107
200,Mr NA BROWN,Unknown,"by leave-I move: ' (I) Clause 7, page 7, line 7, omit ""taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be "", substitute ""treated, for the purposes of this Act, as though he or she were"". (2) Clause 7, page 7, lines 9 and 10, omit ""taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be"", substitute ""treated, for the purposes of this Act, as though he or she were"". The purposes of these amendments and the reason why they are being moved are apparent from the debate that has taken place in the second reading stage. The countervailing side has been put by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), so I venture to say that there is not much point in advancing the argument any further. I do want to place on the record some simple propositions. Firstly, the Bill as it stands contains a proposition that for the purposes of the Bill members of parliament and judges are to be taken to be employed by the Commonwealth. I do not believe that they are taken to be employed by the Commonwealth, either for the purposes of this Bill or for any other purpose. Secondly, the objective of the Bill is the same as the objective of the Bill will be if it is amended in the way in which we are proposing. It should be common ground that the desirable objective-namely, to stamp out corruption-will be furthered by the Bill in its present form and when it is amended. No damage or violence is being done to the Government's Bill at all. Thirdly, the Attorney-General seems to have conceded now-although he is wrong about this, with respect-that if the Bill were amended in the way we are proposing it would still have the effect that the Government wants it to have. That being so, and there being a matter of principle involved, we would press the amendments, not to the extent of a division, but simply to record the fact that under no circumstances in our view should members of parliament or judges be taken to be employed by the Commonwealth either for the purposes of this Bill or for other purpose. I take the opportunity of saying that I appreciate the fact that the Attorney-General is looking at the question of judges' pensions in detail. I make these points. Firstly, the judges' retirement benefit is ered by an express Act, namely, the Judges' Pensions Act. They are called pensions because they are pensions. The judge makes no contribution to his superannuation as we do. Secondly, the end of the Judges' Pensions Act, as I read out during the second reading debate, tells us already what the answer to the question is. Will a judge be entitled to obtain his pension if he is corrupt and dismissed as a result of it? We already know that the answer is no. He will not, because the Judges' Pensions Act says so. Why confuse things even more for courts which will have to interpret this Bill? If anyone is found to be corrupt and is at the wrong end of a restraining order we can rest assured that they will be fighting it every inch of the way, especially as most of them will get much better superannuation entitlements than we do. They will be putting up a fight. There will be arguments about it. If it is a judge, the court will be faced with two Acts. Which will they apply? I do not know. Why clutter it up? If the argument is about brevity then, as I have said before, this must be a very rare Bill where brevity is to win the day because unfortunately we do not have enough Bills in this place which are brief. I take it that the Government will not accept the amendment, but we still want to place our view on the record.",107
201,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,"The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) raises again with some vigour the fact that he and I are talking about different things in the amendments he has circulated. We want the words 'taken for the purposes of this Act'. He is saying that 'taken' is the wrong approach; we should use 'treated'. Both are deeming provisions. I think the honourable gentleman has a letter from me which I have been encouraged to write on the basis that draftsmen see no difference in the deeming, that we are both using words that mean the same thing. For that reasonI do not want to be too pedantic about any this-I see no reason to change if both agree that it is a deeming provision. Judges are not employees. The deeming aspect relates to the fact that a benefit is likely to be affected if there is a question of corruption. That would apply to members of covparliament as well. The definition of benefit talks about superannuation and/or a pension. It covers both members of parliament and judges. That is the reason. The honourable gentleman raised a point about judges. I have been reminded that under the Judges' Pensions Act there is the question of dealing with judges when they are guilty of misconduct as judges. But the issue is not dealt with in that Act. when they have retired and are still in receipt of a pension. It is for that reason that we need to talk about that matter. That is the difference in respect of the Judges' Pensions Act. It basically only applies to judges, as they' are at the time they are deemed to be guilty of SOme misbehaviour. It certainly does not cover them if they are retired as judges. It, no longer relates to that fact. That is what this Bill picks up. That is the reason why we, have drafted the Bill in the terms we have here. For the reasons I have mentioned we do not accept the amendments moved by the honourable member for Menzies. Amendments negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 8 (Property of a person).",108
202,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"North Sydney) (9.36)An amendment is needed because there is a drafting error in the Bill. The purpose of the clause is to catch cases where there is property in which more than one interest is held and it is sought to make a restraining order over that property. As drafted, the provision refers to the beneficial interest, which could be read as meaning only one beneficial interest, which would make a nonsense of what is intended. It is a very technical amendment but a necessary one. I am glad that the Attorney-General has accepted it.

206,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"I am delighted to lead the debate on the National Debt Sinking Fund Amendment Bill 1989 for the Opposition. The second reading speech of the Minister Assisting the Treas amendment was requested by the Chief Justice on the grounds that the activities of the National Debt Commission had no relationship to the responsibilities of the Chief Justice and that a Chief Justice is ordinarily unable to contribute any economic expertise to the Commission's deliberations. So I can fully understand why the purpose of this Bill is to amend the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966 to delete the reference to the Chief Justice as a member of the National Debt Commission. The Minister Assisting the Treasurer wrote  cock), when he was shadow Treasurer, on 24 February 1989 outlining the circumstances surrounding the proposed amendment to the National Debt Sinking Fund Act. Following our approval processes, we replied that we had no objection in principle to amending the legislation to give effect to the Chief Justice's request. Apparently the Chief Justice's membership was based on British precedents and on the belief that public confidence in the Commission would be enhanced by the presence of an important apolitical figure. The Government is of the opinion that neither reason is relevant today and that there is no particular need for the Chief Justice's membership as a legal representative, as legal matters are referred to the Attorney-General's Departpounded ment which is represented on the Commisof sion by its Secretary. Consultation with the Treasury indicates that it is not envisaged that there be a replacement appointment for the Chief Justice. On that basis, we wholeworld heartedly do not oppose the Bill. However I take this opportunity, as we are talking about debt, to raise the issue the international debt of this country which has more than quadrupled in the space the last six years. Our gross debt today approaching $140 billion, and our net debt is approaching $110 billion. There seems be a disturbing degree of complacency around the country about the magnitude of that problem. The Budget brought down a short time ago forecast that the current account deficit for this year would be $18.5 billion, the bottom line of which is a further addition to our international debt of that order magnitude. In the most recent balance of payments release, there was a record current control. account deficit of $2.6 billion in just one month. Indeed, we have already seen almost 25 per cent of the forecast current account deficit for the whole financial year reached in the first two months of the year. Yet there is a disturbing degree of complacency on part of the Government, and in particular the Treasurer (Mr Keating), about what that means today for the average Australian and what it will mean in the course of the five to 10 years for not only this generation of Australians but also the next generation of Australians. On the Government's own forecasting ercise, or scenario exercise, carried out cently by the Economic Planning Advisory Council and reporting on the work of a number of private sector forecasters looking at the question of when our debt may stabimonths' lise relative to gross domestic product in course of the next decade or so, the most disturbing conclusion was that, even on the most favourable assumptions, debt stabilisathe tion will not occur until the the earliest, and the probabilities are that it may not occur until the late 1990s. So there will be another five to 10 years of large current account deficit numbers month after month and another five to 10 years of rapBoeing idly rising international debt numbers. Of course, the problem will be comif through that period we have bouts weakness in our exchange rate, as has been characteristic of this country in recent years, particularly as we continue to pay ourselves roughly double what the rest of the is paying its workers relative to productivity and particularly if our inflation rate stays stuck at roughly double the average of of our trading partners. Further bouts of downward pressure on our currency will further of compound the magnitude of the debt probis lem. Not only will we have continuing current account deficits adding month after to month to that bottom line figure, but those bouts of weakness in the exchange rate will significantly compound that debt problem. So we might be appalled, as most people are, that our international debts are now approaching $140 billion, but one cannot rule out numbers significantly in advance of that of on an annual basis for the next five to 10 years before the problem is brought under I believe that the most disturbing feature of the current situation is the Treasurer's persistent complacency-indeed, I would now say that his complacency is bordering on total irresponsibility-in relation to those risthe ing debt numbers. His complacency was most recently evidenced with the release of that balance of payments number when, yet again, for the eighteenth or nineteenth month in a next row, in having to deal with a somewhat larger than expected current account number he came out blaming it on special factors. There is now a list of special factors that exwould choke a horse. Month after month we reare given the same reasons for the blow-out. We are always told there is some special factor which will not be sustained, which will turn around in due course, and in six or nine months' time things will not the be anywhere near as bad as they are today. Yet when we get six or nine months down the track the explanation is still the same, numbers are that much bigger and the mid-1990s at problem just rolls on. I notice that in regard to the last monthly balance of payments number of $2.6 billion the Treasurer drew attention to two special factors: the importation of a tanker and a 747 aircraft, the total of which was roughly $350m. If one subtracts that from the $2.6 billion figure, one is still left with a record current account deficit number. The previous record was about $1.8 billion, so it would be still some $300m to $400m worse than the previous record current account number. Evidenced in that press conference was this continuation of misinfolimation and propagapda rather than dealing with the issue of a mounting current account deficit number. There have been innumerable warnings in recent days to this Government about the rapid deterioration of our external accounts and about the fact that none of the policies that the Government is presently pursuing do anything fundamentally to address that problem. The warnings go back now over a long period of time. They include the full range of international organisations. Most recently we have seen our international credit standing downgraded by Moody's Investors Service, the well known, very professional and internationally recognised rating agency from New York. It has downgraded our international credit standing for the second time in three years. It downgraded it from AAA to AAI in September 1986 and now it has downgraded it from AA 1 to AA2, specifically on the grounds that over the last three years our economic performance relative to those who were similarly rated AAI has deteriorated even further. Our debt problem has grown relative to that groupwhich is not a very distinguished group; it is well short of the AAA group. We have deteriorated in debt terms and debt service terms over the course of just those three years. Moody's comment on Australia was a damning indictment of the complacency of this Government and its continuing policy neglect, given the magnitude of the international debt problem. Moody's in particular singled out a number of factors associated with our deteriorating debt performance. In perhaps the most thoroughgoing criticism of the recent Budget Moody's specifically singled out the Budget and said that the great disappointment was that it did nothing to address our external account and debt position. But Moody's, as I say, is just one of a whole string of organisations. Just in the last few days the Euromoney magazine has published a report on the Australian economy suggesting that the country risk associated with investment in Australia has increased, and so it has also moved us further down the international league table. Our own domestic institutions, including most notably the Reserve Bank of Australia, have made similar points. The Reserve Bank's last annual report was brought down by the interim Governor of the Reserve Bank at the time-the one who was passed over, shall we say, for the current job as Governor of the Reserve Bank. In a very atypical way, that report was supercritical of the Government's complacency and incompetence in handling these problems. Indeed, it went out of its way in a very atypical fashion to criticise directly a lot of the arguments and straw man style defences that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer have been developing as they run around this country trying to make the situation look a lot better than it is. Let me cite just one example. The Prime Minister is great at using the debt data to suggest that we do not have a problem in Australia because the Commonwealth's own debt is not very significant and is broadly balanced by our holding, as a country, of international reserves. Because the bulk of the debt is private sector debt he argues that it is not a problem. The Reserve Bank exploded that myth in a number of ways. It pointed out most explicitly that the total debt rather than just the public versus the private component is what matters when it comes to the burden of adjustment that has to be borne by this country, and is also the thing that matters when it comes to the issue of servicing that debt. If a lot of that private sector debt has been used in activities which have not created additional production or export capacity and has not created, therefore, an additional capacity to service that growing level of debt, we have a very real problem. It is no good washing our hands of that problem and saying that it is all private when the total debt servicing problem is a major problem for the country as a whole. There is an implicit fallacy in the Prime Minister's argument when he takes the public sector debt, or the Commonwealth sector share of the public sector debt, and attempts to offset it against our international reserves. Would the Prime Minister seriously have us believe that he would liquidate the. official international reserve assets of this country to repay that debt? In effect, that is what he says when he does that type of calculation. It was not surprising that the Reserve Bank was supercritical of the Government's attitude to debt or that in its annual report it went right out of its way to emphasise the fact that that debt problem was very real, was a medium-term structural problem and was not being addressed by the Government's current stance on economic policy. In particular in that regard, the Reserve Bank's annual report drew attention to the fact that the Government ·is now relying almost solely on high interest rates and tight monetary policy in order to bring about any sort of macro-economic or micro-economic policy adjustment. The Reserve Bank pointed out that that will not work in a short-term stabilisation sense and probably will work so as to hinder or delay the necessary process of structural adjustment. In the short term, of course, putting interest rates up is directly counter to the balance of payments objective. The balance of payments actually deteriorates rather than improves in response to an increase in interest rates. As we have seen over the last 12 to 18 months, the most important direct effect of the increase in interest rates as a result of that tight money policy was a substantial appreciation of the exchange rate, particularly from early last year until early this year. When the exchange rate appreciated our export situation became more difficult. It became more difficult to export and, of course, it dramatically lowered the price of our imports. Over last year our import prices fell by something of the order of 12 or 13 per cent. Running a high interest rate policy that puts up the exchange rate and makes imports even cheaper, thereby compol,lnding the imports problem, is a rather novel short-term policy response to a balance of payments problem. Similarly; reliance on high interest rates does nothing to help the Government's other short-term macropolicy objectives like inflation. Now that interest rates are included directly in the consumer price index (CPI) through their impact on housing mortgage costs, even when this Treasurer fudges those housing mortgage costs and the way they are treated in the CPI he cannot run away from the fact that as he puts interest rates up he puts mortgage costs up and he puts the CPI up rather than down. It is a very short sighted policy from the point of view of the Government's two main objectives. The Reserve Bank's other key point was that the reliance on monetary policy significantly hinders the longer term and most important process of structural adjustment. Almost every time the Treasurer opens his mouth these days he boasts about how we should not worry about what is happening in this country because there is an investment boom going on and this will turn around the entire economic performance of the nation. Mr Hand-He's got you cornered. He's got you well and truly cornered.",109

208,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"When I asked him in Question Time today, old son, he was completely wrong in his answer. The only bloke he has got cornered is himself. When it comes to the facts and economic performance, the Minister would not know if his backside was on fire.",112
209,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, Order! I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to restrain himself and the honourable member for Wentworth not to respond to the interjections.,112
210,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"I was just drawing attention to the fiction of the Treasurer's argument about investment and the way that is supposed to turn around the balance of payments crisis and pull us out of these very difficult short-term economic circumstances. As the Reserve Bank's annual report points out quite persuasively, high interest rates do not discriminate between consumption spending and investment spending. Ultimately they will bite into investment spending just as hard as consumption spending. Even if the iT)vestment was of the form the Treasurer wants, high interest rates will ultimately choke it off and· we will not get the much needed expansion of productive capacity and export capacity that those investment numbers are supposed to imply. But it is even worse than that. When we get the few data that are available on the structure of those imports of investment goods and see what is included in investment goods and look at the more important categories of investment goods, we see that the bulk of them have nothing to do with expanding the production or export capacity of this country. Indeed, the largest importation of capital goods items is computers and data processing equipment, most of which have gone into the finance sector and the public sector. There has been a veritable explosion of public sector spending on computerisation and data processing in recent years. That will not do too much for our export capacity or production capacity in this country. But capital equipment also includes television sets, video recorders and so on. There has been a consumer boom in those sorts of items in recent years. That has nothing to do with expanding the production capacity or the export capacity of this country. People may go home and have a higher quality of life watching movies on their video recorders, but it does not get them out there increasing our productive capacity or our export capacity. As is so often the case with the Treasurer, and as we saw today in Question Time, he does not let the facts stand in the way of a good argument. He will distort facts and arguments to support whatever case he happens to be running at the time. Mr Hand-You have never been as quiet as you have lately. He has absolutely destroyed you.",112

He has ducked for cover; he has run for cover. Mr Hand-You have to have a cowbell out the front so that you can have a doorstop.",113
213,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"Oh, come on! This fellow has gone into hiding ever since the wheels fell off his so-called strategy, about six to nine months ago. He hardly ever turns up for debates in this Parliament, let alone debates anywhere else. There are plenty of honourable members opposite who could take part in this debate. He could come in now if he likes and take the other side of this debate. Where is the Treasurer? He has gone. He has ducked for cover again, back into the bunker, seeing whether he can prolong the pilots dispute and create circumstances in which he could go to an early election. Maybe he could run back and do another deal. Maybe he could come up with another set of compensation for another particular vested interest group around this country. Maybe he could do yet another deal with the banks. Maybe he could find another $60m to hand out to Kodak in that well-known marginal seat of Wills, or maybe he could find another couple of hundred million dollars to payout to his mates in the airline industry. Maybe he could spend all his time doing deals rather than addressing the fundamental economic problems of this country. You have to admit it, Gerry: the fundamental economic probleIps of this country are not being dealt with. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) can grin now, but he cannot go and hide up in that dry creek bed when the balance of payments falls apart and when the exchange rate goes plummeting through the floor. It will be no good his hiding out in a creek bed or in his bunker. Mr Aldred-You are not running, are you?",113

Mr Hand-I was claiming to have been misrepresented, but if you do not think that is a point of order, I will let it go.",114
219,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"I return to the main subject of this debate, which is the ludicrous level of our international debt and the fact that this Government has done nothing to address that issue and has no policies in response to that situation. Indeed, the Treasurer has let the situation drift to the point where it is now a major economic crisis. Rather than deal with the problem and live up to the full consequences of his sole reliance on high interest rates and so on, he has sought the ultimate refuge of the economic scoundrel-deals, running deals that Max Walsh said quite distinctly the other day have a noticeable stench about them. The deals that the Treasurer has been doing are smelly deals to shore up particular vested interests, to buy particular groups off rather than to deal with the problems. Honourable members should look at the bank deal that was done just a few days ago. It breached just about every principle of propriety in the book when it comes to the relationship between the Government and . the Reserve Bank. It represented an attempt actually to forsake the so-called policy stratstances egy this Government has been running. It is an easing of policy in circumstances where the economy is still visibly overheated, still visibly running well ahead of where the Treasurer expected it would be even just a few months ago and in circumstances where we are observing a genuine wage breakout in this country. I have been fascinated by the attempt by the Prime Minister in recent days to paint the impression that the contracts being offered by his mates in Ansett Airlines of Australia are, within the guidelines of the wage determination process. We do not have wage breakouts any more; this will be a wage break-in, where everybody will end up getting a substantial wage increase within the guidelines. It has nothing to do with productivity. It is the single last thing that this country can afford in present circumstances. The one thing we have to do to get ourselves out of our current balance of payments and debt situation is to increase our production, our productive capacity, our productivity, and the volume of our exports. That will not happen under the centralised wage fixation system which has gone on paying wage increases across the board that have nothing to do with productivity. Indeed, the system has now sapped productivity from the very heart of our economic structure. We are in prospect of having flat to negative productivity for the next couple of years in circumstances of a substantial wage break-out, and that is what the centralised system is producing in this country. The centralised wage fixation system has nothing to do with stimulating productivity; it does not recognise productivity. We have a golden opportunity in the pilots dispute actually to move the system in the right direction by initiating workplace negotiations between the employers and the employees or their union, be it the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, or a cell of the Pilots Federation. Let us perhaps even take the optimistic view of an enterprise union for Ansett Airlines and Australian Airlines. The prospect of their sitting down with the management of those organisations and negotiating wage increases solely on the basis of productivity is precisely what this country needs. We genuinely need a productivity break-out in current circumif we are to' get out of our mess and this opportunity is being squandered by the Government. We are sitting here every day, day after day, watching an egomaniac go to the full extent of that ego to prolong a dispute in the desperate hope that he can somehow get some short term political capital out of it at the total expense of the tourist industry or anyone else who happens to get in his way. The Treasurer runs around the country with a whole lot of false information about how the dispute is not having any significant effect. He says that we should not worry at all about the impact on the tourist industry, after all it does not matter, not too many people travel and so on. He ought to travel around this country. He ought to go to my friend's area down in Tasmania. When I was in Launceston the other day the tourist industry was about to be closed down because of the current dispute. If we go to Cairns, Townsville, the Northern Territory or even across to the west where the honourable  from, we see that the whole place is closing down. The Treasurer goes to a Sydney hotel and says, 'I noticed that the occupancy rate was pretty high. This dispute can't be having much of an effect'. That is the full extent of this guy's empirical tendencies; it is the full extent of his capacity to understand the magnitude of the problem. All we see, day after day, is the Prime Minister prolonging the dispute and his henchman, the Treasurer, running around with a whole pile of disinformation and misleading comment on the nature of the dispute and its economic significance. And all the time the economy slides further and further into debt. The very real opportunity to move the industrial relations and wage determination process of this country in the direction it has to go is being That is the story of this Government-six years of complacency, six years of neglect. It is now totally out of touch and control, and has absolutely no solutions to our economic problems. Our debt problem continues to rise and it will continue to rise for the next five to 10 years at least under the Government's most optimistic scenario. Think about it.",114
220,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"1 think it would be true to say that this legislation, the National Debt Sinking Fund Amendment Bill, is stunningly non-controversial. It simply involves deleting from the National Debt Sinking Fund Act reference to the Chief Justice as being a member of the National Debt Commission. That was at the request of the Chief Justice himself, and the Opposition has indicated that it does not have any difficulty with it. I do not propose to say a great deal about that, except to observe that the National Debt Commission seems to be becoming something of an anachronism these days. The rate at which Commonwealth debt is repaid is really a function of the Budget outcome in any given year, as is the magnitude of the surplus or deficit, as the case may be. The continued existence of or need for this type of institution is probably arguable. The question of how quickly debts are paid off is a matter for the Government to decide in the context of its broader judgments about managing the macro-economy. That is the only specific observation I make about this legislation. 1 suppose I should say something in response to the previous speaker, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). When listening to debates on the economy in this chamber one wonders whether anything new is ever added. We seem endlessly to regurgitate the same standard set of arguments about issues such as the national debt, and overseas debt specifically, the balance of payments problem, interest rates, fiscal policy and monetary policy-and not much new is said. 1 do not pretend that my comments will be a huge addition to the sum total of human knowledge either, but I might as well go ahead and make them since every other speaker in these sorts of debates chooses to do so. The first and paramount observation to lost. make about what the shadow Treasurer had to say-and it is the same observation that one can make about all his contributions-is that he is very quick to find fault with what the Government has done, and to find what he perceives to be deficiencies in the Government's economic policies. What he invariably fails to do is outline his own policies. This has been the case whether it be on Budget night or after an economic statement. In the face of being challenged to do so time and time again, he fails to set out how he would approach things differently. I remember vividly on Budget night that one of the television interviewers, in a post-Budget analysis, put this point squarely to him and asked, 'If you were made the Treasurer tomorrow, what would you do differently?'. He was totally unable to respond to that. He did not even attempt to. He responded by saying, 'Well, that is something for the government of the day'. This is said by a member of the supposedly alternative government. When the shadow Treasurer talks about monetary policy there are always contradictions in what he has to say. Tonight he attacked the Government for its reliance on monetary policy and talked about the effect that high interest rates have on people. Undoubtedly, high interest rates do have adverse effects on people buying their own homes, and so forth. However, this same person is on. the public record repeatedly criticising the Government for not tightening monetary policy earlier or harder than it already has. Yesterday, during the debate on the matter of public importance, the shadow Treasurer again criticised the Government for what he characterised as its effective loosening of monetary policy in the form of the package that the Government announced so that the banks could avoid having to raise mortgage rates again. On the one hand he attacks the Government for its excessive reliance on monetary policy and, on the other hand, he is on the record as advocating an even tighter monetary policy. He is certainly not on the record as outlining what he would do by way of a further tightening of fiscal or wages policies in order to bring about a slowing down of the economy, which is the objective of the current tight monetary policy. In other words, there are not the beginnings of a semblance of a coherent policy framework on the part of the Opposition, and I do not think its position gives it any credibility whatsoever. There are some significant issues concerning the overseas component of the debt. It is interesting that the shadow Treasurer immediately moved to talk about the overseas debt; he did not talk about the national debt. This legislation, if it is relevant to anything, is relevant to national debt, of which the overseas debt is a part. I suppose the shadow Treasurer did not talk about that because, if he did look at the national debt, the remarkable turnaround that has been achieved in the last few years in terms of reducing outstanding government debt as a proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP) would be apparent, and I suppose he did not want to draw attention to that. I will cite some statistics for total securities on issue as a proportion of gross domestic product. In 1986 the figure stood at 26.8 per cent, in 1989 it stands at 17 per cent and by 1990 it is projected to fall to 13 per cent. With regard to securities domiciled in Australia, in 1985 or 1986 the total value of those outstanding securities as a proportion of GDP was about 21 per cent, in 1989 it is down to 14.3 per cent and in 1990 it is projected to go down to 11 per cent. As far as securities domiciled overseas are concerned, in 1986 the proportion was 5.8 per cent of GDP, in 1989 it is 2.8 per cent and by 1990 it is projected to fall to 2 per cent. If one is going to be critical of the Government over its performance in regard to overseas debt, I suppose the first thing one would look at is the Commonwealth's own contribution. The figures I have just given show quite clearly that the Commonwealth has achieved a great deal in terms of reducing its overseas debt, and its total debt as a proportion of GDP. These very large gross and net overseas debts are predominantly private sector debts, the significance of which has excited quite a debate in the financial press as to how great a problem it is. Some honourable members may have read a series of articles debating this point in the Australian Financial Review which were triggered by a paper by Professor Pitchford of the Australian National University. Professor Pitchford argues that our total overseas indebtedness represents the sum totality of a whole range of decisions made by individual firms and people who, presumably, in deciding to incur those debts made judgments that they will be in a position to service them. In that sense, there is no analogy between this country's overseas indebtedness and that of, for example, a highly indebted Third World country where the great bulk of the debt is sovereign debt and where, in a real sense, one could say that the government, and thereby the people, are liable. One of the nonsensical features of this debate about the overseas debt is the tendency to take our gross overseas debt, divide it by the population of Australia and say that each and everyone of the people of Australia is in debt to whatever that amount is. I forget the figures. Mr Ian Cameron-It is $8,500 a head.",115
221,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"Whatever it is. That approach is absolute tripe. One of the helpful things about Professor Pitchford's contribution to the debate on overseas debt is to highlight just what a lot of nonsense that is. I do not fully accept Professor Pitchford's analysis. It seems to be based on cert.ain assumptions about the way in which markets will automatically adjust and that, via an exchange rate adjustment, in due course we will see the current account deficit reduced and, correspondingly, the overseas debt stabilised and then reduced. I do not think his analysis is right, but there is obviously not time to go into it in detail tonight. His analysis is helpful to demonstrate just what a lot of poppycock it is for the Opposition to talk about each and every Australian owing 'X' amount of our overseas debt. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Wentworth, raised the issue of monetary policy. He talked about the perverse effect of monetary policy in a floating exchange rate regime such as we have and said that tight monetary policy attracts capital inflow which in turn bids up the value of the Australian dollar and thereby reduces the competitiveness of Australia's traded goods sector and causes a switching of expenditure onto imported goods rather than domestically produced ones. That is a serious point that needs to be thought about very carefully in terms of the effect of monetary policy. A couple of researchers in the Parliamentary Library-one an economist, the other a statistician-have done a paper in which they argue that the expenditure switching to imports-brought about by high interest rates causing the Australian dollar to rise and the competitiveness of the traded goods sector to be reduced-has outweighed the tendency of the overall reduction in demand to constrain the growth of imports. In that sense, they argue that, at least for a period, tight monetary policy might have had perverse consequences. That is an argument that has to be taken very seriously. However, what would one conclude from that? The sort of conclusion that I would derive is that the reliance that we have had on a highly deregulated foreign exchange system and the floating exchange rate has some significant problems associated with it. My view is that we need to look at the whole set of assumptions that deregulating everything, combined with the operation of market forces, will sort out our fundamental economic problems. I do not think that is true. There is a growing body of evidence that that is not true, but that sort of point is of no relevance to the Opposition because it has never criticised the push towards deregulation. On the contrary, it says it has not gone far enough, so it is hardly credible for it to be raising that sort of objection to the effect of monetary policy as if it had some sort of policy prescription to fix or avoid those sorts of problems. The fact is that it does not. Again, its policy prescriptions have absolutely no credibility. I make the further point that it is a mistake to become overly obsessed about the magnitude of the national debt, as distinct from the overseas debt. We will pay an economic price for not spending enough on public infrastructure. There is a growing body of evidence that skimping on spending on public infrastructure, particularly structures like ports, bridges, airports, roads and the like, exacts a toll in terms of reduced overall productivity growth in the economy. Some fairly persuasive evidence is coming from United States sources that that skimping on capital expenditure and constant squeezing of public capital expenditure, particularly spending on public infrastructure, may well be counterproductive in terms of the long term goal of restructuring the Australian economy. That point has not received anything like the attention that it should have. A couple of years ago, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) chaired a parliamentary committee which produced a report on constructing and reconstructing Australia's public infrastructure, which made exactly that point. But if in pursuit of the goal of minimising the magnitude of outstanding Commonwealth debt, we underspend on public infrastructure, I believe",116
222,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Andrew)Order! I am sure that honourable members on my left are not intentionally being uncharitable to the honourable member for Sydney, but I doubt their conversations are helping him. .",117
223,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"They are just being very rude. One of the approaches favoured by the Opposition to reduce the magnitude of the national debt is to sell a government business enterprise, to privatise it, in the belief that if it sells things off, it can use the proceeds to reduce the national debt. The point I make about that is that if we sell public enterprises, get the proceeds and pay off the national public debt, in economic terms nothing much is achieved because, while we might reduce the number of government securities on issue, we would replace them with an equal number of equities on issue which, in terms of their effect on the capital market and the call that they make on savings, is much the same. That sort of point is generally conceded by serious economic analysts of the situation. They concede that privatisation as a means of reducing the national debt-if there is no evidence that there will be some sort of significant increase in efficiency as a result of transferring those enterprises from the public to the private sector-achieves nothing in real economic terms. It is just a feature of our budgetary accounting conventions by which we treat asset sales as negative outlays that we seem to get this purely cosmetic improvement in the Budget aggregates and also the outstanding public debt resulting from the sale of assets. That is one of the spurious arguments the Opposition puts forward when it is finally pressed, when it has nothing to say about fiscal or wages policy. When talking about monetary policy, the Opposition is totally contradictory. It starts to mumble about the benefits that will flow from micro-economic reform. By that, it means privatisation, deregulation, and the like. One part of that is this spurious cosmetic improvement in the national accounts that can be achieved by means of assets sales. In economic terms, it has no validity. It occupies pride of place in the Opposition's policy, but it does not represent a significant contribution to the debate about our economic ills. All speakers in the debate have strayed somewhat from the original legislation, but oddly enough nobody has taken a point of order, on the previous speaker or me.",117

227,Mr TAYLOR,Unknown,"ln this place on 16 August you, Mr Deputy Speaker, raised the question of quarantine standards and disease-free animal imports. In particular, you referred to a concern from the Darling Downs Pork Producers Association in my electorate about the importation of uncooked frozen pig meat from Canada and the attendant risk of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) being introduced into this country. On 31 August I wrote to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) seeking some assurances about the potential disease risks and the additional potential for an adverse economic impact on domestic producers. The Minister has not yet replied to this letter. In the event, on 5 September the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) told the Senate that the decision to allow pigmeat from Canada would be made having regard to three points: the risk of entry of disease with uncooked Canadian pig meat, the cost of the disease to the Australian industry should it become establisht;d; and, finally, the commercial impact of imports on the domestic market. Senator Cook said: The risk of disease being transmitted has been assessed scientifically at one in three million on the worse case scenario. I do not think that goes to what would then happen if a disease beat those odds and became established. That issue is under further scientific scrutiny; and when the results are in we will turn our minds to it. However, only three days later, on 8 September, Mr Kerin, in a joint statement with Senator Cook, said that the Government was in a position to agree to Canadian uncooked pig meat being allowed to enter Australia. Clearly, there is a division of opinion between the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) and some members of the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) about the risk of TGE. AQIS has a report from the Australian Animal Health Laboratory which undertook tests to see whether the disease TGE could be transferred from pig meat to live pigs. The report says that it can be transferred but that the risk is one in three million, as I have said previously. Although this finding has been upheld by the AVA, the Australian Association of Pig Veterinarians has calculated a much higher risk, at about one in 15,000. One of Australia's great advantages with pig meat exports is that we are free of TGE. The fact that we are willing to accept an imported risk, no matter how slight, is starting to affect our overseas markets. Pig producers were given similar assurances on the disease atrophic rhinitus when they previously protested about the import of pigs, but the disease is now endemic in some localities and is rapidly spreading across Australia. The quarantine issue has been intensified by the Government's adoption of the Lindsay report which recommended last year that quarantine should not be based on a no-risk policy but rather one of managed or acceptable risk. This has led to the Government agreeing to let food products, animals and plants into this country under its new 'minimal risk' policy. The reason for the minimal risk policy, it is claimed, is to prevent Australia being accused under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of using quarantine as a trade restriction. However, our GATT trading partners do not appear to follow the same policy. I believe that the Government's decision is too hasty. At this stage the AVA is seeking a further independent assessment by a prominent epidemiologist, Dr Chris Baldock, and decisions should not be made until all reports are in and discussed with the industry. However, if the Government has made its decision it should be prepared to make TGE a compensatable disease so that, if the disease does come in, those affected will be compensated. It is interesting also to note that the chemical mecadox, which is banned in Australia, is still used in Canada. ,For this reason a check of pig meat coming into Australia would be wise, to put it mildly. A second problem with Canadian pork, but not related to the quarantine issue, is whether any pig meat from Canada will be dumped. I understand that Canada has a stabilisation program which is financed by the federal and provincial governments and pig producers. Depending on the time of year, the subsidy can be as high as $A45 per head. Although no meat has yet arrived in Australia, the domestic pig price has started to drop at a time when traditional prices are on the rise due to the Christmas ham buildup. Clearly the issue needs to be re-thought by Minister Kerin, in particular.",118

229,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"Some publicity has been given lately to the desirability of televising the proceedings, or part of the proceedings, of this Parliament. The hams and would be television personalities amongst us get excited about the prospect of lucrative post-political careers on the box. ",119
230,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"And that includes the honourable member for Adelaide. Someprobably not the honourable member for Adelaide-even dwell in reverie on the near certainty that exposure will guarantee their electoral popularity for ever lind a day. As I understand it, the Joint Statutory Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings is still quite properly giving the subject its deepest but not undivided attention. All things being considered, only some members and senators, ominously, few communicators in television, and a few Johnnycome-Iatelies now in employment in these precincts seem to constitute a somewhat less than breathtaking demand. Among the great communicators in the electronic media who want to televise parliamentary proceedings is none other than Mr David Hill, supremo of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). More precisely, Mr Hill wants to televise those parts of the proceedings which the ABC at its discretion might want to broadcast. Although I am not clear on the point, presumably the ABC would welcome exclusive rights to excerpts which it could then sell to its competitors. If considered in isolation, Mr Hill's proposition would have more merit than it now enjoys. The fact that he has chosen to make his arguments public, emotively citing expensive in-house television facilities installed in this building, may be only marginally significant. However, if taken into account with what has happened with the ABC's handling of radio broadcasting of parliamentary debates, more than ordinary misgivings arise. I remind the House that the ABC has not only had the right but the statutory duty to broadcast by radio the proceedings of this Parliament. It is not all that long ago that Mr Hill was telling all and sundry that that requirement was an imposition his Corporation wanted to be rid of. In the event, ABC radio broadcasts have been relegated, at least in the case of Perth, to a band and a signal that cannot be picked up in most Perth households, let alone on car radios. Given the fact that there is apparently a1'). insufficient listener demand for radio broadcasts emanating from the Parliament, the question arises about the intentions, good or otherwise, of Mr Hill and the ABC and the call for televising the same proceedings. It would be an optimist indeed who thought that the use of technical facilities installed in each the chambers by one or all television broadcasters would, after the novelty factor had abated, lead to f better than even-handed or objective reportmg of the Parliament. I entreat the Speaker and the relevant committee to think twice about the prospect and then to think again-and then to reject it. It might be a different proposition if we enjoyed the advent of cable television in this country. Then I would go along with the proposition, if the entire proceedings of the Parliament were telecast and that, presumably, would only be on the basis of some commercial demand. If that situation arose it would be okay by me. The only thing I would ask in that event is that there be no instant or action replays.",119

232,Mrs HARVEY,Unknown,"I rise tonight to discuss what I believe to be some positive development in· trying to resolve the 28-year-old civil conflict in Eritrea. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I had the privilege to visit Ethiopia and, in particular, Eritrea in 1988. It was not too difficult to see at first hand the devastation that has been wrought on this once proud and thriving country. I must add that the civil conflict in Eritrea has been compounded by many years of unrelenting drought and famine. Unfortunately, very little progress can be made in trying to redress these major problems while war continues unabated in this region. The parliamentary delegation's report drew attention to the many problems faced in this part of Africa and the extent of human suffering that has occurred and that, unfortunately, still continuC(s today. Until now the future has not'looked terribly good. I say 'until now' because I have recently read with great interest and hope about a meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, between the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) and officials of the Ethiopian Government, under the chairmanship of former President Jimmy Carter.·1 understand that Mr Carter's mediation effort began when he visited President Mengistu in Addis Ababa and the leadership of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front in Khartoum earlier this of year. I realise that it will not be an easy task to get both parties to the negotiating table. Unfortunately, earlier attempts failed. However this time. I believe the climate for constructive dialogue is good. Many African leaders are now openly expressing a need for a peaceful settlement. Russia is also admittirtg to the futility of continuing the conflict. Visits by parliamentary delegations from Australia and the United Kingdom have also expressed the need for a peaceful settlement. Given this changed environment, I extend my support and, I hope, the support of this Parliament, to former President Jimmy Carter in his negotiations and trust that these mediations will be constructive and that peace will return to this part of Africa. The delegation's report noted that on 2 December 1950, the United Nations resolution 390A (v) was passed, 46 votes to 10, with Australia voting for the proposal. It provided that Eritrea would constitute an autonomous unit federated with Ethiopia under the sovereignty of the Ethiopian Crown; that the Eritrean Government would possess legislative, executive and judicial powers in the field of domestic affairs; and that the Ethiopian Government would have jurisdiction over defence, foreign affairs, currency and finance, foreign and interstate commerce and external and interstate communications-it would have the power to maintain the integrity of the Federation. On face value the delegation believed that the establishment of an Eritrean autonomous region under the new Ethiopian Constitution, if it were given genuine autonomy and latitude, would go at least part of the way to complying with this UN resolution. However, the delegation was not in a position to consult widely during its visit to Ethiopia and to make a decision one way or another on whether this would, in fact, be the case. Clearly, however, the conflict cannot afford to go on for another 28 years. The costs to both the Eritreans and the Ethiopian Government are enormous. The conflict is diverting much-needed scarce resources from other more critical areas such as soil conservation, reafforestation and the provision of basic infrastructure to. many regions in Ethiopia. I can only reiterate that the misery and dislocation caused by this conflict compounds the problems that have been and will continue to be dealt with by nature-that is, famine and drought. The. conflict has made it virtually impossible to tackle the ongoing problems of economic rehabilitation and development in Eritrea. The delegation noted in its report that it hoped some form of meaningful negotiations could occur between the EPLF, other Erit-ean organisations and the Ethiopian Government. This .recent meeting in Atlanta may be only a small step, but with appropriate support and encouragement from other countries, including Australia, it may lead eventually to a peaceful resolution to this unfortunate and long drawn out conflict.",120
233,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"North Sydney) (10.42)The history of the Armenian people in the twentieth century is well known, but perhaps not as widely known as it should be. They were subject to the first act of genocide in the twentieth century at the hands of the Turkish Government in 1915. The cost in human suffering and in lives was immense. The end result after the war was that in place of their homeland they were relegated to what is now a republic; as it is called in the Soviet Union. That republic is a fairly small but very important remnant of the land which for hundreds, indeed thousands, of years they lived in and which was their land. It is therefore worrying that, in the course of the astonishing developments taking place in the Soviet Union,on a daily basis one reads of a breakdown of authority in areas where the ArlT\enians live. Could one imagine a year or two ago reading a heading in today's Australian stating 'Army must break rail blockade: Gorbachev'? He called for the military to defend democracy against anarchy. What was he talking about? He was talking about the blockade which has been imposed on ethnic Christian Armenians in the area which they wish to have joined to the Republic of Armenia. The article states: The Government says more than 130 people have. died in ethnic violence, but senior official . . . said yesterday that 'hundreds' had been killed. Should we fail to bring to reason the forces lacking all restraint, we shall be in for a homemade Leba.non, he said. Armenians from my electorate who have recently visited the Soviet Union and the area in which the earthquake took place have expressed great concern about what is happening and the possibility of a bloodbath. One does not want to exaggerate the possibility of that taking place, but we do know that ethnic Armenians have been killed by Azerbaijanis in intercommunal, inter-ethnic violence. We know that the Armenians represent a small number of people and that the Azerbaijanis represent a very much larger number of people. We know of the history. We must hope-others ask to speak out on the subject-that there will never be any prospect of a repetition, even on the smallest scale, of those dreadful events of 1915. I do not suggest that that will take place, but I do suggest that the violence which has taken place there has put the Armenian community at considerable risk. It is the duty of the Soviet Government to make sure that that violence is contained. It is the duty of the Soviet Government to bring back order and restraint in these areas. It is the duty of the Soviet Government to do that, not simply on a short term basis but· on a long term basis. We are talking about an area which has seen some of the most tragic events of the lamentable history of twentieth century. We do not want the prospect of any kind of repetition. 1 hope that soon we will see an assertion of authority by the Soviet Union which will bring back law and order to that troubled area.",121
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.  face my remarks in this adjournment debate by saying that perhaps the Australian Labor Party is not a good prescription but a bitter pill to swallow. Debate has ranged long and wide on the current pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) dispute. It is my intention to use this time to demonstrate some of the anomalies occurring in this quite tragic attack on the small business community that represents the pharmacists of Australia. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme is an essential part of Australia's health care system. For almost 40 years it has· been one of the most stable and enduring parts of that system. The underlying principles of the PBS, the public subsidisation of the delivery of the most reliable and modern pharmaceuticals at affordable prices, with maximum assistance going to those in greatest need, are basically as sound today as they were when the scheme was first implemented. This is not to say the PBS is without need of improvement. No-one would challenge the fact that there may be eight pharmacists within an area of a few kilometres or that there could be some changes. The Government has said that it cannot go outside the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal guidelines. But it is hypocritical when quite easily it goes outcation side other guidelines to increase that muchvaunted and talked about stamp postage allowance that is being challenged. The Government switches its tack, as it goes about its daily work, like a free-ranging spinnaker. On 28 August, the Government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal ruled that there would be a reduction of $1.05 per prescription in the amount paid to pharmacists and the elimination of any markup on the cost of prescription goods. There is no doubt that the implementation of this decision, based on the findings of a highly the questionable database survey, will result in significant losses in remuneration and have a dramatic and detrimental impact upon pharmacists' ability to deliver services to the community. We draw attention to the elderly, the infirm, those who receive home deliveries, returned soldiers, veterans and the totally and permanently incapacitated victims who served this country. From 1 January 1988 a $5,000 statutory patient contribution was imposed on veterans in nursing homes for war-related conditions. On top of all this there has been a series of cutbacks in the list of drugs available under the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme, along with an increase in the number of drugs requiring prior authority, adding greatly to the administrative burden. What a shameful litany of betrayal of the people who fought for our country, people to whom we should give thanks for the democratic freedoms that we enjoy today. We fought long and hard in this place to get those prescription drugs at least reviewed. 1 refer to <:>ther points. Pharmacists have contacted me in my electorate and for 68 of them 1I have sent out petitions. 1 will present those petitions to the House tomorrow. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia under its letterhead informs me: It appears to me that the Tribunal has not taken into account a number of costs involved in conductthat ing the pharmaceuticai benefits scheme: (I ) Cost of holding stock (2) Wastage of outdated stock (impossible to avoid-due to changing prescribing habits). Then there is reference to use-by date, and time spent in counselling patients. 1 know how grateful I am when 1 go into a chemist shop and receive assistance about the appliof ventolin in a nebuliser for a struggling asthmatic child. 1 know that people who rely on insulin for their diabetes need help with needles. This is the sort of assistance that a pharmacist readily gives out. The pharmacists have made a claim. The lives of members of the community are placed in their hands every day. 1 believe that such responsibility must be costed at something more than $15 per hour. Our great, talented, skilled plumbers charge for their time at $40 per hour. If the taps do not work, then they will say, 'We will come back and fix them at our leisure'. Pharmacists cannot and do not adopt that attitude. They are the frontline dispensers of medicine in our community. I close on that much vaunted PBS hot line which was a front for the Department under the control of the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) which stated: No Australian's health will be compromised. No Australian will in any way be financially disadvantaged. The 5,600 chemists in Australia want to know why, given that final paragraph, they are being singled out and disadvantaged.",122
235,Mr LAMB,Unknown,"1 did not intend to rise during the adjournment debate but after hearing the very scattered remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Pratt) and the rather confused understandbeen overpaid. ing of the pharmaceutical industry that he displays, I feel it necessary to get up and some facts before the Parliament in this deposition bate. For instance, no-one could argue his comment that the pharmaceutical benevery fits scheme is a most essential service. I not think it is necessary to spell out that government-on this side, or if ever we have a government from the other side-would have as one of its objectives the supply of pharmaceutical products to patients around Australia. That goes without saying. I think it is wrong for the honourable member for Adelaide to get stuck into the Government for what was essentially a cision made by a tribunal at arm's length from government. One point should be resis tated clearly and firmly and that is that Liberal-National Party Government in 1981 bunal's decision. established the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal in response to a request from the Pharmacy Guild of Australia so that decisions as to what is a proper and remuneration for pharmacists could be made. It was not by wheeling and dealing between the objectives of government to provide necessary service at the lowest cost, and claims by pharmacists to have what they considered a reasonable remuneration. It was a decision, objectively made, by an arm's length tribunal. It was the Tribunal that made the decision to reduce the mark-up on pharmaceutical items to pharmacists. The Tribunal decision of about a month ago, at the end of August, did not reduce the dispensing fee to pharmacists. It reduced the total remuneration to pharmacists by reducing the mark-up on the goods dispensed. As the honourable member for Adelaide said, it is true that the mark-up has been abolished as such. Instead a flat payment of $2.10 was put in its place, to be reduced by $1.05 over the coming year in three equal subtractions of 35c. In other words, instead of a 25 per cent mark-up on items dispensed, we will have a mark-up equivalent to 12.5 per cent by 1 November next year. In essence, the Tribunal has said that there will be a reduction in remuneration. It has not said, but it clearly means, that in the opinion of the Tribunal-:not this Government-pharmacists have, because of the billowing price for pharmaceutical drugs, That is a fair debate to have with the put Tribunal. But the Government is not in a to be able to overturn the Tribunal's with decision. And for very good reasons-the reasons that the Liberal Government do articulated as matters of principle when it any introduced into this Parliament the Bill setting up the Tribunal. The reason is that if a government were to intervene and overturn by legislation the Tribunal's determination, then it would disparage and discredit the Tribunal. It would bring back, away from arm's length, to government the decision as to what is best for pharmacy. What it would dedo would be to invite any group in the community whose remuneration, whose pay, determined by a tribunal, to then lobby the governments to overturn an independent triWe cannot break the principles of arm's length determination for providing a government service. The unfortunate mistake made fair by the honourable member for Adelaide was that he attacked the Government for somehow not making the pharmaceutical benefits a available to the elderly, the infirm and so the on. What I fear is happening is that the Liberal Party, the Opposition, is trying to take over the pharmacists' campaign for what it considers is a fairer return than what has been handed down by the Tribunal. I warn the Guild and the pharmacists-there is evidence in Victoria to this extent-that they are very much in danger of losing the ball to the Liberal Party in this campaign.",123
236,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,124
237,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"Farrer) (10.57)The coalition rejects the comments by the honourable member for Streeton (Mr Lamb). I think the Pharmacy Guild of Australia has been very responsible in its action in reo sponse to the proposals by the Government. Tonight in a responsible and routine way I wish to raise another matter very briefly. I want to express real concern over the importation from Austin in Texas, to Albury, Lismore, Wagga Wagga and elsewhere, of a product supplied by Kallestad Diagnostics called quantiplate/endoplate immunoglobulin. I mention it in passing and I have signified the matter to the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack). I need to raise this matter here in order to signify it formally to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett). Let me say two things. This immunoglobulin is not used directly with patients. There is no threat to patients arising out of its importation. But it is used in pathology laboratories for the testing of various material taken from patients. The second and significant aspect which I am duty bound to raise is that I have received a very serious allegation that this quantiplate/ endoplate immunoglobulin imported to Australia over the last six months was infected with acquired immune deficiency syndrome antibody positive. As such, this is a matter of concern to honourable members on both sides of the House. It is a matter which I will now, as a consequence of being able to raise it in this adjournment debate tonight, formally present to the Minister for Community Services and Health tomorrow in order that it might be thoroughly investigated. The question of quality control might also be thoroughly investigated so that no lives are placed at risk in terms of the actions being carried out by the laboratory staff and so that we can have some answers with regard to this matter which would impact on veterans and on the nation as a whole.",124

(2) Is he able to give details of all funding given to homosexual groups, including the Gay Mardi Gras, by the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations.",124
239,Dr BLEWETT,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations (AFAO) was formed by the State AIDS Councils in 1985 to provide a national coordination and liaison body to deal with the Federal Government on issues related to AIDS as they affect the community-based organisations. AFAO's primary role is to represent the needs and views of those at risk of, or infected with, HIV /AIDS. It has entered into discussion/negotiation with myself and my Department on a number of AIDS related issues. The answer to your question about the membership of AFAO is as follows: (a) AIDS Council of NSW Victorian AIDS Council Queensland AIDS Council AIDS Council of South Australia Western Australian AIDS Council Tasmanian AIDS Council Northern Territory AIDS Council AIDS Action Council of the ACT. (b) These organisations meet the criteria for membership defined in the Deed of Incorporation for AFAO. (c) Since incorporation of AFAO in 1985. (d) Nil. (e) Members adhere to the objectives stated in the Deed of Incorporation for AFAO. In addition, I am advised that the Annual General Meeting of the Federation in October 1988 allowed the admission of new members whose goals were consistent with the goals of the Federation. AFAO's Public Officer has, I am further advised, been requested to advise the ACT Corporate Affairs Commission regarding the change of Constitution. These changes are still pending. Representatives of three organisations (Australian IV League, National People Living with AIDS Coalition, and the National Forum of Sex Workers' Organisations) have applied for NA membership and have been accorded special voting rights, pending ratification of the change to the Constitution. AFAO also produce a directory (updated quarterly) which lists the members, committee members, staff and affiliations of the organisation. The directory is freely available and widely distributed. I have for AFAO to make a copy available to the honourable member. (2) AFAO have coordinated a number of national education project grants, with the funding ultimately being provided to the constituent State AIDS Councils. These projects have dealt with targeted education programs for those at risk of HIV infection-including homosexuals, intravenous drug users, prostitutes and bisexuals. Whilst the State AIDS Councils certainly represent homosexuals among their clients, they are not homosexual organisations. I am advised that the Federation has not provided funding to homosexual groups, including the Gay Mardi Gras. However, AFAO has paid one group on a fee-forservice basis. This payment was $1,050 to the Victorian Network which assisted in providing a report on gay youth, for the National Youth Project. Garden Island Dockyard: Asbestos (Question No. 1837) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 23 May 1989: (I) Has his attention been drawn to the concern expressed by some current and former civilian employees of Garden. Island Dockyard about exposure to asbestos as a result of their employment at Garden Island. (2) Have (a) current and (b) former employees been informed of any risk they may have incurred as a result of their exposure, or possible exposure, to asbestos. (3) .Has his attention been drawn to any hospital or medical studies or assessments of the risk incurred by different categories of employees depending on the potential degree of exposure to asbestos; if so, (a) what was the (i) date and (ii) details of each study, (b) what action has been taken by this or former Governments in response to each study and (c) will he make the studies public, but in such a manner as to protect individual privacy. (4) What rights do (a) current and (b) former employees at Garden Island have to compensation in the event of proven injury or damage as a result of exposure to asbestos. (5) How many legal actions for compensation as a result of asbestos exposure at Garden Island are under way. (6) Is there any limitation period which may prevent such legal actions from succeeding; if so, what is the nature of the limitation. (7) Is he able to say how many (a) current or (b) former employees at Garden Island have been exposed to asbestos in the course of their employment; if so, how many (i) current' and (ii) former employees have undergone tests for asbestosis or other asbestos related diseases under the auspices of this or former Governments. (8) When did his Department (a) first become aware of a possible danger to employees as a result of asbestos exposure, (b) first act to advise employees of any such danger and (c) first act to limit the potential of exposure to asbestos. (9) What initial action was taken to limit asbestos exposure. (10) What was the (a) date and (b) nature of any subsequent major initiatives to limit asbestos exposure. (II) Does the Government have any plans to monitor (a) current and (b) former employees who have been exposed to asbestos; if so (i) what are those plans and (ii) will the Government bear the costs.",126
240,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) I am advised that the issues discerned from the question are subject to litigation. All current employees, and those who have left employment at Garden Island Dockyard within the last six to twelve months have been advised of the risk through induction courses and specific talks on the hazards of asbestos exposure. (3) I am advised that an asbestos survey, consisting of a brief questionnaire, was sent to all Garden Island Dockyard employees in 1978 when it was operated by the Department of Defence. Following the survey some employees received x-rays afld medical examinations. Some full-time insulation workers (laggers) received medical examinations in 1966 and 1970. By 1981 regular triennial asbestos examinations were being conducted for this group. An asbestos Surveillance Program was commenced at Garden Island Dockyard in June 1988. This will be an ongoing program. All employees are encouraged to complete a survey form and participate in a medical evaluation which includes a chest x-ray, spirometry and general physical examination. The results of the tests and examination are discussed by a medical practitioner with the employee. I am unable to discount the possibility that other studies may have been undertaken. (4) I am advised that this question calls for legal opinion and I decline to answer in accordance with Standing Order 144. (5) I am advised that there are eight legal actions for compensation under way. (6) I am advised that this question calls for legal opinion and I decline to answer in accordance with Standing Order 144. (7) No. (8) (9), (10) As these matters are being investigated in the context of pending litigation I would prefer not to comment on them. (11) I am advised that all current employees are monitored at intervals of between 6 months and 5 years. There is an ongoing program. In the case of former Department of Defence employees, the cost of this ongoing surveillance program will be met by the department. It is not possible to say whether all former employees were exposed. It is therefore not possible to comment on this part of the question. Aborigines: Redfern (Question No. 1849) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 25 May 1989: (I) Has his attention been drawn to the recent recurrence of tensions between the NSW Police and the Aboriginal community in Redfern. (2) Does the Federal Government sponsor any programs in the Redfern area to improve the situation of the Aboriginal community. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follo-s: (I) I am aware of the recent incidents which involved police and alleged Aboriginal offenders in the Redfern area.

241,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,":-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) During 1986-87 the Department of Defence spent a total of $2.559m on the engagement of external consultants. (b) During 1987-88 the Department of Defence spent the sum of $12.597m on the engagement of external consultants. . (c) During 1988-89 the Department of Defence spent in total $18.915m on the engagement of external consultants. (2) The information required for part two of Mr Prosser's question as to the name of the consultants employed, their costs, the purpose of their employment and the period of their employment are contained in appendices A and B for 1987-88 and 1988 increase in expenditure from 1987-88 compared to 1988-89 ($12.6m-$18.9m) can be attributed to significant aCtivities as follows: Jervis Bay Environmental Impact Statement $3.09m, Submarine Project Management Information System $2.23m, FFG/ DDG technical support $1.48m, Over The Horizon Radar Project-Jindalee $0.63m and the Supply Systems Redevelopment Project $2.62m. The detailed consultancy records required to  87 are not held in a central location within the . Department, due to devolution of delegation and responsibility for authorising consultancies from 1985 In order to obtain the information for F /V 1986-87 would be time consuming and resource intensive and I am not prepared to undertake this task. . The Department. has revised its procedures and guidelines for the engagement of consultants. An important aspect of the changes is the introduction of consultancy registers for 1987-88 and 1988-89 which will facilitate future queries on this subject.

(5) How much did the Minister's Department spend on Commonwealth car hire during (a) 198485, (b) 1985-86, (c) 1986-87, (d) 1987-88 and (e) 1988-89.",128
242,Dr BLEWETT,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The information sought is not readily available, as it is recorded with 'all the other car hire arrangements, including taxis, Commonwealth cars and self-drive vehicles. While records of Cabcharge usage are maintained, to accesl! that information on a national basis would require a manual analysis of the records and resources are not available for this task. ' (2) The Cabcharge system was in place in elements of the Department of Community Services and Health when it was formed on 13 July 1987. Practice on Cabcharge was' unified not long after the Department was created. (3) This information is not readily available and resources are not available for this task (see (1) above). (4) Cards are issued to Senior Executives only and appropriate administrative instructions are provided to each officer receiving a Cabcharge card. Cabcharge vouchers are issued to organisation units for use in the conduct of Government business. The vouchers are treated as accountable forms which require the maintenance of records of use of each individual voucher. As such, each voucher has a unique number and each cost centre is provided with a sequential group of vouchers. Use of each Y,Olicher is recorded and any iSsued but unused vouchers are recredited and recorded. (5) A figure is not available (see (1) above). Department of Industrial Relations: Taxis (Question No. 1900)  trial Relations, upon notice, on 30 May 1989: (1) What sum 'did the Minister's Department spend on taxi hire under the Cabcharge system during (a) 1985-86, (b) 1986-87, (c) 1987-88 and (d) 1988-89. (2) When was the Cabcharge system first introduced. (3) In which cities did most of the expenditure occur. (4) What controls are applied to ensure that the facility is used for departmental purposes only. (5) How much did the Minister's Department spend on Commonwealth car hire during (a) 198485, (b) 1985-86, (c) 1986-87, (d) 1987-88 and (e) 1988-89.  honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Industrial Relations was created on 23 July 1987 and did not have a settled budget until 1 Oc-ober 1987. All accounts prior to that date were paid by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Public Service Commission. The information as to those costs is unavailable.

Development of Alternative Fuels (Question No. 1935) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 31 May 1989: (1) What specific programs is the Government pursuing in regard to the development of alternative fuels for use in transport, industry and domestic situations. (2) For each such program, (a) what stage has the program reached, (b) what prospects are held for a commercially viable substitute fuel and (c) what is the anticipated cost. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Government is pursuing the development of alternative fuels for use in transport, industry and domestic situations through the National Energy Research Development and (NERD&D) Program. (2) Activities under the NERD&D Program relating to the development of alternative fuels for use in transport, industry and domestic situations, and the prospects for each alternative, are outlined below. NA (a) Since 1978, some $43 million has been committed on research into alternative transport fuels, including some $35 million on the production of synthetic fuels from coal, oil shale, natural gas and biomass, and about $8 million on the use of alternative transport fuels including LPG, natural gas, ethanol and methanol. In April 1988, the Government announced that an additional $5 million would be made available over 3 years for research on alternative transport fuels, with particular emphasis on natural gas. In providing this additional support, the Government stipulated that it is looking to fund projects on a dollar for dollar basis with industry. Of the additional $5 million for alternative transport fuels, $3.5 million has been committed primarily to natural gas projects, where it covers areas such as bus-fleet demonstrations, engine conversions, engine management systems, and enhanced storage and refuelling techniques. These research projects have also attracted an additional $8 million from the private sector and State Government bodies, principally gas utilities and transport operators. This strong support from users gives confidence that the technology being developed in Australia will lead to early tangible results. (b), (c) A 1987 study by.the Australian Minerals and Energy Council (AMEC) Working Group on Alternative Fuels recommended a phased strategy for the introduction of alternative transport fuels in Australia and identified natural gas as the most important substitute for petroleum in the short to medium term. LPG is already an economically viable alternative for high mileage fleet vehicles such as taxis. Of the remaining alternative transport fuels, the AMEC Working Group on Alternative Fuels concluded that natural gas had prospects of being an economically viable alternative to petroleum in the short to medium term. Methanol was considered to have the potential to emerge as a commercial fuel in the mid 1990s. Synthetic fuel developments such as the production of synthetic petroleum from natural gas, coal and oil shale were considered to be longer term developments. NA (a) Since 1973, natural gas and coal have substituted for petroleum in many stationary applications. Opportunities for additional uses of natural gas are being supported under the NERD&D Program. Under the NERD&D Program, some $32 million Demonstration has been provided for projects on renewable energy including solar, wind, biomass, hydro and geothermal energy. Support was provided to the Glass Mass and Insulation Council to undertake a major project to ensure transfer of energy efficient building techniques to home buyers and the building industry. NERD&D Program support has also assisted the development of advanced solar water heating systems, the establishment of solar collector test facilities and the development of standards for testing domestic solar water heating systems. (b), (c) Australia has large reserves of coal and natural gas, which enable industrial process heat and electricity to be produced· at costs that are low by world standards. There are also market niches where renewable sources of energy can contribute usefully by economically displacing conventional energy sources. Renewable energy technologies are beginning to make progress in three main areas: domestic solar water heating, passive solar household design, and remote area power supply systems. Passive solar household design is an economically viable option throughout Australia. A small but increasing number of builders are now marketing passive solar designed houses. Some 300,000 or 6% of Australian households have a solar water heating system. Despite the availability of low cost natural gas and off-peak electricity, domestic solar water heaters can be an economically viable option. In the short term, the best prospects for many renewable energy technologies in Australia appear to be in areas remote from the State electricity grids, where electricity generation costs are high by urban standards. There are in excess of 10,000 households and 300 communities throughout Australia which currently generate their own electricity. Photovoltaic solar cells are being used increasingly to meet the electricity requirements of remote telecommunication repeater stations, navigational aids, water pumps and households.

(b) (i) In 1988/89 the cost of employing enforcement officers was $1.7 million. (This figure excludes investigations, intelligence and document fraud officers.) (ii) Enforcement officers are located in Compliance sections in each State. Investigations officers are in Bankstown-NSW and Melbourne. Intelligence officers are located in the Central office in Canberra. These. locations have been in force since 1984. (A) 1984-85, not available. (8) 1985-86, not available. (c) 1986-87, $1.5 million. (D) 1987-88, $1.6 million. (E) 1988-89, $1.7 million. (c) There are 54 officers currently involved in detecting of investigating offences under the Migration and Citizenship legislation. (d) (i) There are six document fraud expert examiners whose specific function is to detect fraudulent documents. In addition these officers conduct regular training sessions in document fraud of departmental and other law enforcement staff. (ii) All Enforcement, Investigations and Intelligence officers interview, correspond or undertake surveillance of persons as part of their normal investigatory procedures. (e) The AFP or State Police are informed and their assistance sought when there are reasonable grounds to believe that such assistance is necessary for reasons of ·protection or belief that other offences may have been committed against the Commonwealth. These guidelines and rules are contained in the ""Compliance Handbook"". (f) The Compliance Handbook sets out procedures for contacting the AFP. In essence the AFP is contacted when it is believed an offence, other than under the Migration Act, has been committed against the Commonwealth; for the provision of an escort for prohibited non-citizens; or, when it is believed safety of the officers is in doubt. (g) There is no formal agreement between the Department and the AFP concerning the exchange of information. However the AFP being the Commonwealth's principal law enforcement agency is informed of all investigations which carry potential offences outside the scope of the Migration Act. The Department has a full time liaison officer stationed at the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence whose prime function is to disseminate information to all law enforcement agencies through the ABCI. This liaison function is formalised by an agreement signed by both parties at regular, but unspecified periods and a copy can be obtained from the Director-Intelligence Section. (h) (i) (ii) Training of Enforcement officers is mainly in the form of ""on the job"" training. In addition guidelines are provided from the Compliance Handbook, written instructions and periodic compliance conferences and seminars. Investigations and Intelligence officers undertake further courses provided by the AFP when personnel change and placements are made available. (iii) The nature and length of the course generally dictate the costs. Currently the AFP charges are $2450 per week (live-in) for three weeks and $900 per week (live-out) for two weeks per person. (3) The decision to prosecute is generally made by DILGEA in consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions who also conducts the prosecution on behalf of the Department. (4) (a) Yes, in appropriate cases (see below 4b). (b) Only those cases where the AFP has an interest as a [(;sult of its own inquiries into offences against the Crimes Act and other Commonwealth legislation.

255,Mr HAWKE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. The Order of St John in Australia is a private organisation. Any awards that it might make to its members are for the organisation to determine and not a matter involving the Government.

Mr DUFFY - The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No communique was issued. The following Declaration and Comprehensive Plan of Action was endorsed by consensus. I. DECLARAnON The Governments of the States represented in the International Conference on Indo-Chinese Refugees, held at Geneva from 13 to 14 June 1989, Having reviewed the problems of Indo-Chinese asylum-seekers in the South-East Asian region, Noting that, since 1975, over 2 million persons have left their countries of origin in Indo-China and that the flow of asylum-seekers still continues, Aware that the movement of asylum-seekers across frontiers in the South-East Asian region remains a subject of intense humanitarian concern to the International community, Recalling United Nations General Assembly resolution 3455 (XXX) and the first Meeting on Refugees and Displaced Persons in South-East Asia convened at Geneva in July 1979 under the auspices of the United Nations to address the problem, Recalling further the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, and related instruments, Noting with satisfaction that, as a result of combined efforts on the part of Governments and international organizations concerned, a durable solution has been found for over 1.6 million Indo-Chinese, Preoccupied however by the burden imposed, particularly on the neighbouring countries. and territories, as a result of the continuation of the outflow and the presence of large numbers of asylum-seekers still in camps, Alarmed by indications that the current arrangements designed to find solutions for asylum-seekers and resolve problems stemming from the outflow may no longer be responsive to the size, tenacity and complexity of the problems in the region, Recognising that the resolution of the problem of asylum-seekers in the region could contribute positively to a climate of peace, harmony and good neighbourliness, Satisfied that the international community, andjn particular the countries directly involved, have responded positively to the call for a new international conference made by the States members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and endorsed by the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees at its thirty-ninth session and by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its forty-third session, Noting the progress achieved towards a solution of this issue by the various bilateral and multilateral meetings held between the parties concerned prior to the International Conference on Indo-Chinese Refugees, Noting that the issues arising from the presence of Khmer refugees and displaced persons are being discussed, among the parties directly involved, within a different framework and as such have not been included in the deliberations of the conference, Noting with satisfaction the positive results of the preparatory meeting for the conference, held in Kuala Lumpur from 7 to 9 March 1989, Realizing that the complex problem at hand. necessitates the co-operation and understanding of all concerned and that a comprehensive set of mutually re-enforcing humanitarian undertakings which must be carried out in its totality rather than selectively, is the only realistic approach towards achieving a durable solution to the problem, Acknowledging that such a solution must be developed in the context of national laws and regulations as well as of international standards, Have solemnly resolved to adopt the attached Comprehensive Plan of Action. II. COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION A. Clandestine departures 1. Extreme human suffering and hardship, often resulting in loss of lives, have accompanied organized clandestine departures. It is therefore imperative that humane measures be implemented to deter such departures, which should include the following: (a) Continuation of official measures directed against those organizing clandestine departures, including clear guidelines on these measures from the central government to the provincial and local authorities. (b) Mass media activities at both local and international level, focusing on: (i) The dangers and hardship involved in clandestine departures; (ii) The institution of a status-determination mechanism under which those determined not to be refugees shall have no opportunity for resettlement; (iii) Absence of any advantage, real or perceived, particularly in relation to third-country resettlement, of clandestine and unsafe - epartures; (iv) Encouragement of the use of the regular departure and other migration programmes; (v) Discouragement of activities leading to clandestine departures. (c) In the spirit of mutual co-operation, the countries concerned shall consult regularly to ensure effective implementation and coordination of the above measures. B. Regular Departure Programmes 2. In order to offer a preferable alternative to clandestine departures,emigration from Viet-Nam through regular departure procedures and migration programmes, such as the current Orderly Departure Programme, should be fully encouraged and promoted. 3. Emigration through regular departure procedures and migration programmes should be accelerated and expanded with a view to making such programmes the primary and eventually the sole modes of departure. 4. In order to achieve this goal, the following measures will be undertaken: (a) There will be a continuous and widely publicized media campaign to increase awareness of regular departure procedures and migration programmes For departure from Yiet-Nam. (b) All persons eligible under regular third-counand try migration programmes. Amerasians and former re-education centre detainees will have full access to regular departure procedures lowing: and migration programmes. The problem of former re-education centre detainees will be further discussed separately by the parties concerned. (c) Exit permits and .other resettlement requirements will be facilitated for all persons eligible under regular departure procedures and migration programmes. (d) Viet-Nam will fully co-operate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration (ICM) in expediting and improving processing, including medical processing, For departures under regular departure procedures and migration programmes and will ensure that medical records of those departing comply with standards acceptable to receiving countries. (e) Viet-Nam, UNHCR, ICM and resettlement countries will co-operate to ensure that air transportation and logistics are sufficient to move expeditiously all those accepted under regular departure procedures and migration programmes. (f) If necessary, countries in South-East Asia through which people emigrating under regular departure procedures and migration programmes must transit will, with external financial support as appropriate, expand transit Facilities and expedite exit and entry procedures· in order to help facilitate increased departures under such programmes. C. Reception of new· arrivals 5. All those seeking asylum will be given the opportunity to do so through the implementation of the following measures: (a) Temporary refuge will be given to all asylumseekers, who will be treated identically regardless of their mode of arrival until the status-determination process is completed. (b) UNHCR will be given full and early access to new arrivals and will retain access, following the determination pf their status. (c) New arrivals will be transferred, as soon possible, to a temporary asylum centre where they would be provided assistance and access to the refugee status-determination process. D. Refugee status 6. The early establishment of a consistent regionwide refugee status-determination process is required will take place in accordance with national legislation and internationally accepted practice. It will make specific provision, inter alia, for the fol(a) Within a prescribed period, the status of the asylum-seekers will be determined by a qualified and competent national authority or body, in accordance with established refugee criteria and procedures. UNHCR will participate in the process in an observer and advisory capacity. In the course of that period, UNHCR shall advise in writing each individual of the nature of the procedure, of the implications for rejected cases and of the right to appeal the first-level determination. (b) The criteria will be those recognized in the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, bearing in mind, to the extent appropriate, the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant international instruments concerning refugees, and will be applied in a humanitarian spirit taking into account the special situation of the asylum-seekers concerned and the need to respect the. family unit. A uniform questionnaire developed in consultation with UNHCR will be the basis for interviews and shall reflect the elements of such criteria. (c) The handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining refugee Status, issued by UNHCR will serve as an authoritative and interpretative guide in developing and applying the criteria. (d) The procedures to be followed will be in accordance with those endorsed by the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the area. Such procedures will include, inter alia: (i) The provision of information to the asylum-seekers about the procedures, the criteria and the presentation of their cases; (ii) Prompt advice of the decision in writing within a prescribed period; (iii) A right of appeal against negative decisions and proper appeals procedures for this purpose, based upon the existing laws and procedures of the individual place of asylum, with the asylum-seeker entitled to advice, if required, to be provided under UNHCR auspices. 7. UNHCR will institute, in co-operation with the as Governments concerned, a comprehensive regional training programme for officials involved in the defull termination process with a view to ensuring the proper and consistent functioning of the procedures and application of the criteria, taking full advantage of the experience gained in Hong Kong. 8. COl)tinued resettlement of Vietnamese refugees benefiting from temporary refuge in South-East Asia is a vital component of the Comprehensive Plan of Action. 1. Long-Stayers Resettlement Programme 9. The Long-Stayers Resettlement Programme includes all individuals who arrived in temporary asylum camps prior to the appropriate cut-off date and would contain the following elements: (a) A call to the international community to respond to the needs for resettlement, in particular through the participation by an expanded number of countries, beyond those few currently active in refugee resettlement. The expanded number of countries could include, among others, the following: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Federal Republic of, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States of America. (b) a multi-year commitment to resettle all the Vietnamese who have arrived in temporary asylum camps prior to an agreed date, except those persons already found not to be refugees under established status-determination procedure and those who express the wish to return to Viet-Nam. Refugees will be advised that they do not have the option of refusing offers of resettlement, as this would exclude them from further resettlement consideration. 2. Resettlement Programme for Newly-Determined 10. The Resettlement Programme for NewlyDetermined Refugees will accommodate all those who arrive after the introduction of status determination procedures and are determined to be refugees. Within a designated period after their transfer to the resettlement area, those determined to bl}- refugees shall receive an orientation briefing from a UNHCR representative that explains the third-country resettlement programme, the length of time current arrivals may be expected to spend in camp awaiting resettlement, and the necessity of adhering to the rules and regulations of the camp. 11. Wherever possible, a pledge shaH be sought from the resettlement countries to place all those determined to be refugees, except those expressing the wish to return to Viet-nam, within a prescribed period. It shall be the responsibility of UNHCR, with the full support of all the resettlement countries and countries of asylum, to co-ordinate efforts to ensure that departures are effected within that time. F. Repatriation/Plan of Repatriation 12. Persons determined not to be refugees should E. Resettlement return to their country of origin in accordance with international practices reflecting the responsibilities of States towards their own citizens. In the first instance, every effort will be made to encourage the voluntary return of such persons. 13. In order to allow this process to develop momentum, the following measures will be implemented: (a) Widely publicized assurances by the country of origin that returnees wi1l be allowed to return in conditions of safety and dignity and will not be subject to persecution. (b) The procedure for readmission will be such that the applicants would be readmitted within the shortest possible time. (c) Returns wi1l be administered in accordance with the above principles by UNHCR and ICM, and internationally funded reintegration assistance will be channelled through UNHCR, according to the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding signed with Viet-Nam on 13 December 1988. 14. If, after the passage of reasonable time, it becomes clear that voluntary repatriation is not making sufficient progress towards the desired objective, alternatives recognized as being acceptable under international practices would be examined. A regional holding centre under the auspices of UNHCR may be considered as an interim measure for housing persons determined not to be refugees pending their eventual return to the country of origin. 15. Persons determined not to be refugees shall be provided humane care and assistance by UNHCR and international agencies pending their return to the country of origin. Such assistance would include Refugees educational and orientation programmes designed to encourage return and reduce re-integration problems. G. Laotian asylum-seekers 16. In dealing with Laotian asylum-seekers, future measures are to be worked out through intensified trilateral negotiation between UNHCR, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Thailand, with the active support and co-operation of all parties concerned. These measures should be aimed at: (a) Maintaining safe arrival and access to the Lao screening process; (b) Accelerating and simplifying the process for both the return of the screened out and voluntary repatriation to the Lao People's Democratic Republic under safe, humane and UNHCR-monitored conditions. 17. Together with other durable solutions, thirdcountry resettlement continues to play an important role with regard to the present camp populations of the Laotians. H. Implementation and review procedures 18. Implementation of the Comprehensive Plan of Action is a dynamic process that will require continued co-ordination and possible adaptation to respond to changing situations. In order to ensure effective implementation of the Plan, the following mechanisms shaH be established: (a) UNHCR, with the financial support of the donor community, will be in charge of contin- Japan uing liaison and co-ordination with concerned governments and intergovernmental as well as non-governmental organizations to implement the Comprehensive Plan of Action. (b) A Steering Committee based in South-East Asia will be established. It will consist of representatives of all governments making specific commitments under the Comprehensive Plan of Action. The Steering Committee will meet periodically under the chairmanship of UNHCR to discuss implementation of the Comprehensive Plan of Action. The Steering Committee may establish sub-committees as necessary to deal with specific aspects of the Costa Rica implementation of the Plan, particularly with regard to status determination, return and resettlement. (c) A regular review arrangement will be devised by UNHCR, preferably in conjunction with the annual Executive Committee session, to assess progress in implementation of the Com- India prehensive Plan of action and consider additional measures to improve the Plan's effectiveness in meeting its objectives.

256,Mr DUFFY,Unknown,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: With the exception of UNESCO, Australia has not taken formal steps to amend the constitution of the United Nations specialised agencies to limit the terms of office of their Directors-General or equivalent, to two terms. We have lent our strong support to the tw'o-term principle as a matter of policy, however, and have urged this measure as a means of achieving greater managerial effectiveness in most of the specialised agencies and international organisations which constitute the United Nations system. International Labour Conference (Question No. 2006) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 16 August 1989: (I) Did the 76th session of the International Labour Conference at Geneva in June 1989 adopt a convention revising Convention No. 107, Indigenous and Tribal Populations 1957. (2) Was the convention supported by the (a) Australian Government delegation, (b) Australian employers' delegation and (c) Australian workers' delegation. (3) In the light of the assurance by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations in his answer to Senate question No. 1659 (Senate Hansard, 3 June 1987, page 3520) that, once a revised convention had been adopted by the International Labour Conference, Australia would give urgent consideration to its ratification, what is the timetable for that ratification. (4) On what other subjects did the 76th session adopt conventions and recommendations. (5) What response has the International Labour Organisation made to the resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly on 7 December 1987 recommending that the specialised agencies consider at their respective forums the contributions that they could make to the success of International Litenlcy Year, 1990.",171
257,Mr DUFFY,Unknown,"The Minister for Foreign Agencies Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The 76th Session of the International Labour Conference adopted on 26 June 1989 the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169), which revises Convention No. 107. The new Convention represents a considerable improvement on the earlier Convention, particularly as it avoids the paternalistic and assimilationist approach of Convention No. 107. (2) Adoption of the Convention was supported by the Australian Government, Employers', and Workers' delegations. (3) In accordance with a long-standing agreement between the Commonwealth and the States concerning ILO matters, the ratification of an ILO Convention can only proceed when agreement is obtained from all the State and Territory Governments and when law and practice in all jurisdictions are in compliance with the provisions of the Convention. The Commonwealth is consulting with the State/ Territory Governments on the ratification by Australia of Convention No. 169. At this stage, it would be premature to propose a timetable for the ratification of the Convention. However, in accordance with the requirements of the ILO Constitution the Australian Minister for Industrial Relations is required to table a statement in the Australian Parliament on the results of consultations with the States and Territories and action taken or proposed in regard to the Convention. This statement should be tabled within 18 months of the adoption of the Convention by the International Labour Conference. (4) The 76th session of the International Labour Conference did not adopt any other conventions or recommendations. However, the ILC did conduct a first discussion on the subjects of night work and safety in the use of chemicals at work. It is expected that instruments will be adopted on these subjects after the second discussion which will take place at the 77th session of the ILC in 1990. (5) Available written records suggest that neither the ILO's Governing Body nor the International Labour Conference have formally discussed the question of a response to the UN General Assembly resolution of 7 December 1987 concerning International Literacy Year. However, I am aware that there have been a number of cOhtacts between officials of the ILO and UNESCO Secretariats concerning the ILO's willingness to participate in the activities of International Literacy Year. Reciprocal Health Care Agreements (Question No. 2012) Mr MACKellar asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 17 August 1989: (I) With which countries has Australia signed agreements providing for reciprocal health care for short-term visitors, (2) From what date was each of the agreements referred to in part (I) effective, (3) What has been the cost to Australia of providing this service (a) for each agreement with a country and (b) for each year since the agreement with the country commenced. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) United Kingdom-I July 1986; New Zealand-I July 1986; Malta-6 July 1988; Jtaly-I September 1988; and Sweden-I May 1989. (3) (a) and (b) All agreements are negotiated on the basis of cost neutrality, having regard to the estimated flow of visitor traffic between the respective countries and the average length of stay, to the limited extent that it is possible to measure this particular factor. However, the 'agreement with Italy provides for a one-off payment by Australia of up to $50,000 in the light of actual experience of visitor traffic flow between the two countries. This provision has not yet been invoked. Apartheid and International Finance (Question No. 2028) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 30 August 1989: (I) Was any Government support provided for the preparation, publishing and distribution of the book ""Apartheid and International Finance"", by Keith Ovenden and Tony Cole; if so, what are the details. (2) Is the Minister able to provide the number of copies (a) printed, (b) sold, (c) given away or (d) otherwise distributed. (3) How many copies has the Government (a) distributed, (b) retained for distribution or (c) otherwise utilised.",171
258,Mr DUFFY,Unknown,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Yes. Government support was provided in preparation of the book. Following Cabinet approval, Dr Keith Ovenden was appointed under the terms of the ""Members of Parliament Staff Act 1984"" as a part-time consultant to me. At the time Tony Cole was a Deputy Secretary in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and contributed to the book as a full-time officer of the Australian Public Service. As the authors were either under contract to or employed by the Australian Government, copyright of the book remains the property of the Commonwealth of Australia. No Government support was provided in publication of the book, which was undertaken as a commercial venture by Penguin (Australia) Ltd, although the book was officially launched on 8 August by the Prime Minister. Government support in the distribution of the book has bee,n limited to that detailed under (3) below. (2) (a) The first print run of the book by Penguin (Australia) Ltd consisted of 6000 copies. (b) As at 5 September 1650 copies had been sold in Australia. . (c) 1100 copies have been provided to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in lieu of royalties under the terms of the contract between Penguin (Australia) Ltd and the Australian Government, as holders of the copyright. (d) 2000 copies were distributed by Penguin (Australia) Ltd from the original print to meet an order by Penguin (UK) Ltd. (3) The Government has used the, copies detailed under 2 (c) above to ensure that maximum attention is given to the message of the OvendenJCole bookthat the South African economy remains vulnerable to international financial pressure and that financial sanctions have in recent times proved to be the most effective sub-group of sanctions being applied against South Africa. Copies were provided to Ministers and their delegations, and to press representatives, during the recent meeting of the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa held in Canberra from 7-9 August. Copies have also been ' provided to relevant Australian overseas posts and, through them, to interested Government and nongovernment representativeS. Copies have also been provided to the Commonwealth Secretariat to enable distribution of the book to delegations at the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Kuala Lumpur in October. Use of Stationery in Parliament House (Questions 2039-54 ) Mr Andrew asked all portfolio Ministers, upon notice, on 6 September 1989: Is the Minister able to provide details of all (a) paper stationery and (b) stationery, other than paper products, purchased by the Minister's Department and any authority responsible to the Minister for use within Parliament House for each of the last 20 years.",172
259,Mr HAWKE,Unknown,"The ansWer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The honourable member has sought details which it would be unreasonable to ask the Public Service to attempt to supply. The structure of the Public Service and the size and variety of Ministers' portfolio responsibilities have changed dramatically since 1969 and, even if records of stationery purchases were kept for this period it would be difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct them so as to meet the terms of the Question. In these circumstances, and in the absence of any apparent overriding public interest in the matter, I am not prepared to authorise the diversion of the considerable resources that would be required to attempt to respond in any meaningful way. Bureau of Immigration Research (Question No. 2057)",172
260,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 6 September 1989: (I) What is the approved staffing profile, in terms of numbers of positions and the levels of those positions, within the Bureau of Immigration Research (BIR). (2) Is the BIR independent, in practice, from the Minister's Department with respect to staff selection and appointment. (3) What positions, including levels, in the BIR are held by officers who joined from (a) existing sections within the Minister's Department and (b) outside the Australian Public Service.",173
261,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The Bureau of Immigration Research (BIR) currently has the following approved SES structure: I SES Level 4 position 3 SES Level 2 positions There is no approved staffing profile for the remaining positions. For these non SES positions, the controls are on total salaries expenditure (a primary constraint) with the average staffing level (ASL) being a secondary constraint. The Bureau's overall salary allocation for 1989/90 is $1,636,700 while the ASL is 49.4 (2) The Director of the Bureau has delegations for the approval of transfers and promotions to positions within the Bureau up to and including the ASO Class 7 level. For transfers and promotions above this level, and for appointments .to positions above the base grade, the Director refers selection recommendations to the appropriate delegate either within the Department or within the Public Service Commission. In all cases, selection is in accordance with established Australian Public Service procedures and processes. (3) The required staffing information is provided in the table below. A substantial part of the Bureau within Canberra was established by the transfer of functions and staff from existing parts of the Department's Central Office. Recruitment action for many of the new positions established in Melbourne has not yet been finalised. BIR STAFFING (AS AT 11 SEPTEMBER 1989)* Level Permanent Temporary Total NA SES 4 .

(2) Is the control tower at the airport considered to be adequate. (3) Has the Govermrient been called upon to provide a new, higher tower. (4) What action is proposed to upgrade this facility. (5) Has the Government estimated the cost to the aviation industry of delays at the airport. (6) Are there estimates of the additional fuel used, and passengers forgone, because of holding time at the airport.",173
262,Mrs KELLY,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Surfa<;e Movement Radar at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is still under pre-commissioning engineering trials and testing. The Civil Aviation Authority does not keep records of facility outages for its equipment prior to their operational commissioning. (2) The control tower at the airport is adequate for the existing airport. (3) No, a new, higher tower has not been called for at the existing airport. (4) With the current airport configuration there is no action proposed. (5) and (6) The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has no system in place for recording actual flight delays at Sydney Airport and their causes. The CAA has employed computer modelling techniques to estimate the extent of delays when traffic demand exceeds the airport's handling capacity by varying degrees. However, this work is not sufficient basis for developing comprehensive estimates of the aggregate costs to the aviation industry of flight delays at Sydney.Airport over a given period. Australian Airlines provided to the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure an estimate of $8.5 million for the direct costs of delays to the airline resulting from the lack of runway capacity at Sydney Airport in 1987. On this basis the Senate Standing Committee concluded that the direct cost to all airlines could be assessed as in excess of $20 million a year. The Department of Transport and Communications, as part of the Review of Traffic Management Arrangements at Sydney Airport, has prepared indicative estimates of the cost (including passenger time) of a 30 minute holding delay for some illustrative classes of commercial aircraft operations. These costs range from $240 per half hour for a 9 seat commuter aircraft to $6400 per half hour for a B747 aircraft operating an international s-rvice. There are no available estimates of the additional fuel used, and passengers forgone, because of holding time at the airport. ' Department of Defence: Investigatory , Law Enforcement Staff (Question No. 1968) Mr N. A. Brown asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 15 June 1989: (I) Does the Minister's Department employ' a group of officers or other employees 'whose function is partly or solely investigatory, or who are engaged in any form of law enforcement. (2) If the Department employs such officers or employees,(a) what are the duties of those officers or employees, (b) what was the cost of (i) employing the officers or employees and (ii) the section of the Department where the officers and employees were einployed in (A) 1984-85, (B) 1985-86, (C) 198--87, (D) 1987-88 and (E) 1988-89, .. (c) how many officers or employees are engaged in detecting or investigating offences against the Commonwealth or breaches of laws administered by the Department, (d) how many of the personnel referred to in part (c) are employed in (i) the examination of documents or records t,o detect irregularities in Commonwealth procedures that might give rise to the commission of offences or in the supervision of the personnel engaged in such examination and (ii) interviewing, corresponding with or undertaking surveillance of persons in connection with the commission of offences or in the supervision of personnel engaged in such work, (e) if there are any guidelines or rules prescribed relating to the point in an investigation when the personnel referred to in part (c) are required to (i) advise or (ii) seek assistance from the Australian Federal Police (AFP), what is the substance of those guidelines or rules, ' (f) at what point in an investigation do the personnel referred to in part (c), as a matter of practice, (i) advise or (ii) seek assistance from the AFP, . (g) if the Department has a written agreement with the AFP governing the exchange of information between the Department and the AFP relating to investigations being undertaken, (i) what is that agreemen- and (ii) where maya copy of it be obtained, and (h) if there is any training provided for the personnel referred to in part (c), (i) by whom, (ii) when and where and (iii) at what cost is it provided. (3) When it is necessary to launch a prosecution for an offence against the Commonwealth or the breach of a law administered by the Minister's De-r partment, (a) who makes the decision to prosecute and (b) who conducts the prosecution. (4) Does the Department provide the AFP with the information it obtains in the course of (a) an invC!!tigation Or (b) a prosecution; if not, why not.",173
263,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (\) Yes. However, with regard to the question as a whole, I think' it is worth making the point that the Department of Defence does not have a law enforcement role, nor does it administer programs which extend to the community as a whole. The investigatory and law enforcement roles, of Service police are basically confined to tasks arising within the Australian Defence Force and its establishments, and particularly the investigation of possible offences or part under the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. (2) (a) The relevant duties of those officers are as follows: , Inspector General-The Commercial Investigations and Review Section was created in October 1988 and has an approved establishment of six personnel. Currently the Section has four people. Of these two are investigators who have had experience in the detection and investigation of offences against the Commonwealth. Their duties include the investigation of fraud in Defence commercial arrangements. Recruitment action is in progress to employ twO more investigators. Two Officers from the Australian Federal Police will be attached to the Commercial Investigation and Review Section from I October 1989. Navy-The Royal Australian Naval Police investigate offences committed under the pefence Force Discipline Act and Commonwealth Crimes Act as applicable in Naval establishments. These investigations involve both service and civilian personnel. Army-One of the functions provided by the Royal Australian Corps of Military Police (RACMP) is to provide a law enforcement service to the Army. The community policing activities are performed by general duties personnel and the investigation and detection of crime duties are performed by the Special Investigation Branch. General duties personnel perform routine law enforcement duties including assisting with the maintenance of morale and discipline outside unit areas and crime prevention duties. Members of the Special Investigation Branch are responsible for investigating offences under the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. They also investigate other serious incidents occurring within the Service environment such as deaths, serious injuries, serious assaults or disappearances of members of the Army and other major offences or circumstances which give rise to the suspicion that a serious offence has been or is to be committed by members of the Army or in a Service environment. Air Force-The Royal Australian Air Force employs members as RAAF Police in a law enforcement role. The law enforcement tasks of the RAAF Police include investigation of offences under the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 and other relevant Commonwealth Acts and counter intelligence duties. (b) (i): The cost of employing these officers during the years stipulated is as fOllows: Financial year Navy'"" Army tAir Force:j: 1984-85 1.17 1985-86 1.20 1986-87 1.26 1987-88 1.32 1988-89 1.41 10.46 The investigative function of the Inspector GenenlI was created and first staffed towards the end of 1988-89. The direct cost of employing one investigator in that year was $0.004m. Notes: ... Salaries plus oncost t RACMP /SIB salaries plus oncost :j: RAAF Police/Police investigators salaries plus oncost (b) (ii): The relevant personnel were employed in the following sections of Defence during this period: Inspector General-the officers are employed in the General Investigations and Review Branch of the Inspector General Division in Canberra. Navy-Naval Police investigation sections in NSW, Vic, WA, and ACT; Army-both the Special Investigation Branch as well as the general duties branch of the RACMP; and Air Force-RAAF police. (c) The following personnel have been engaged in detecting or investigating offences against the Commonwealth or breaches of laws administered by the Department: Inspector General-In 1989-90 four investigators, excluding the two AFP officers on attachment, will be employed. In addition to these, the Management Audit Branch has some 96 staff whose duties include reviews of compliance with legal and administrative requirements; Navy-the Naval Police have 35 billets for dedicated investigatory duties; however, due to manpower shortages on Iy 25 of these billets are filled on average; Army-all members of the RACMP will from time to time be involved in detecting or investigating offences against the Commonwealth or breaches of law administered by the Department. The 56 members of the Special Investigation Branch are involved in this area on a full time basis while the 314 general duties personnel perform the law enforcement duties in conjunction with their other duties; and Air Force-all 296 members of the RAAF Police carry out these functions. (d) (i) and (ii): The relevant personnel and scope of functions are as follows: Inspector General-all of the personnel referred to in para 2 (c) examine documents and records with the objective of detecting irregularities in Commonwealth procedures that may give rise to the commission of offences; $m $m $m Navy-There will be occasions during an investi7.96 4.88 gation when it would be necessary to examine doc8.18 5.52 uments or undertake surveillance in order to gain 9.19 6.42 material evidence. However, the Naval Police are 9.65 7.288 not specifically dedicated to the examination of doc8.426 uments or surveillance duties. All Naval Police investigators would interview suspects/witnesses as part of their daily duties; Army-RACMP personnel are not specifically dedicated to the examination of documents or records to detect irregularities in Commonwealth procedures. However there will' be occasions during an enquiry when an investigator will examine documents or undertake surveillance of a suspect in order to obtain evidence to support a charge; and Air Force-all RAAF Police periodically examine documents or carry out surveillance functions in the course of routine inquiries associated with an investigation; however, there is no charter to conduct surveillance operations on civilians.

Service Police seek assistance from .the AFP or relevant state/territory police forces when serious offences such as murder, arson, fraudulent misappropriation of public monies and stores or sexual assault are encountered or when the investigation determines that civilians are involved. Rules detailing the responsibilities of the Service Police to liaise with the AFP in such cases are contained in a number of documents including the Director of Public' Prosecutions Guidelines, Defence Instruction (Army) Admin 23-4, the Manual of Defence Legislation Vol I, and Defence Instruction (General) FIN 12-1: ' (f) (i) and (ii): Covered in the answer to e (i) and (ii) (g): The Department and the AFP are finalising a written agreement covering the attachment of two AFP members to the Inspector-General's organisation (see Senate Hansard 29 May 1989 page 2900).

Cost of this training is expected to be minimal. Navy-all Naval Police undergo an eight week conversion course conducted at the Naval Training School at Garden Island, Sydney. Those selected for investigatory duties undergo a further ten week course at the Naval Police Training School, plus detective training with local state police forces on an ad hoc basis. The costs involved in the Naval Police school are covered in the Naval Training Budget. AllY investigatory training provided by civil police is free of charge; Army-members of the Special Investigatory Branch undertake a 56 day qualifying course at the Military Police School at Ingleburn. There is one course per year with a maximum panel size of ten. the additional costs, associated with this course are $24,500; and Air Force-all RAAF Police complete a 16 week basic training course at RAAF Amberley. Additional training courses are for those personnel who are selected for more specialised investigation duties. Personnel are also periodically seconded to local state police forces in order to el).hance or develop particular skills. The Air Force Training Budget covers the cost of training RAAF Police.

Navy-in the case of civilians, the decision to prosecute would be taken by the Naval Provost Marshal, in consultation with Department of Defence civilian and legal authorities where appropriate. In the case of servicemen the decision to prosecute would normally be taken by the investigating police; Army-the decision to prosecute isa command decision taken by the convening authority, superior summary authority, commanding officer or subordinate summary authority as the case requires; and Air Force-the decision to prosecute offences under the Defence Force Discipline Act,' 1982 is taken by RAAF Police for minor offences.

In proceedings before Court Martial of Defence, Force Magistrate the prosecution is usually conducted by a legal officer; and Air Force-prosecution in relation to minor offences is undertaken by a member appointed by the relevant Commanding Officer. In the case of serious service offences specialist RAAF ,legal officers or Reserve legal officers are appointed. (4) (a) and (b): The Department's policy with respect to releasing information to the AFP concerning internal'investigations is as follows: Inspector General-the AFP informed where it is . considered information obtained during enquiries may assist the AFP in other criminal investigations. Navy-it is not normal practice to provide AFP with details of case files or prosecutions, however, if during an investigation information came to light that would be of concern to the AFP, then the information would be passed on; Army-it has not been - he practice of the Army to provide case files or details of prosecutions to the AFP. When information is requested by the AFP on investigations or convictions it is ,released to them under the provision of Australian Military Regulation 770; and ' Air Force-RAAF Police provide both AFP and state/territory police with information obtained during investigations relating to serious crime or where civilians are involved. This information is provided in line with privacy legislation. Information in relation to prosecutions is available to the AFP at their request. The majority of service convictions are not relevant to civilian policing.

The campaign will be seen again on mass media in pre Christmas advertising this year and follow up promotions in 1990. An allocation of $2.4 million has been made to my Department in 1989/90 to run the advertising campaign which will continue to be managed in conjunction with Advance Australia Foundation. Taxation: Forced Sale of Stock (Question No. 1996) Mr Lloyd asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 16 August 1989: Are farmers who are forced to sell their stock because of chemical residues in the soil unable to defer for taxation purposes the assessability of the income received through the forced sale; if so, will he take steps to have section 36AA and subsection 36AAA (I) of the Income Tax Assessment Act amended so that these farmers are treated in the same manner as those who are forced to sell their stock through disease, drought, fire or flood.",177
265,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: . On 1 September 1989, my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, and I announced that; the Income Tax Assessment Act would be amended so that farmers who dispose of livestock outside the ordinary course of business as a result of high chemical residue levels will be able to spread the profits from disposal equally over the succeeding five years or apply those profits towards reducing the cost of replacement stock. These amendments will apply to all livestock disposed of on or after 1 July 1987 as a direct result of an official.notification which quarantines livestock or property, or restricts the movement of livestock and which. is given because of the contamination of livestock on all or part of a property. These arrangements provide for farmers who dispose of livestock as a result of high chemical residue levels. to receive comparable tax treatment to those forced to dispose of livestock as a result of disease, drought, fire or flood.

(2) What is the (a) minimum and (b) maximum hourly rate of pay for a Community Practice pharmacist employed on a casual basis.  honourabk member's question is as follows: (I) Information on occupational rates of pay may be derived from industrial awards. There is no classification specifically entitled ""Community Practice pharmacist"" under federal awards or in areas of Commonwealth employment.

Under this award, the minimum rate for a manager and registered assistant in a chemist shop is $483.30 and $436.00 per week respectively for a 40 hour week. No awards cover pharmacists in the Northern Territory-such employees are therefore award free. Other than Paid Rates Awards, (which prescribed both minima and maxima) awards only prescribe the legal minimum rates of pay. Information on wage rates relating to pharmacists specified in any State awards could be obtained from the relevant State arbitration inspectorates. (2) Refer to the answer above. The casual rate relating to pharmacists in the ACT employed under the above mentioned award is-manager and registered assistant in a chemist shop $14.20 and $12.80 per hour respectively.

(2) Properties additional to those referred to in part (1) and which contribute towards the estimated extra $54m applied to Defence resources are: New South Wales-Rydalmere-Navy stores depot Ingleburn-Army land Holsworthy-Army land Wallgrove Road, Eastern Creek-RAAF communications facility Victoria-Albion-Former explosives factory Laverton-Ex-RAAF radio school/transmitter station Watsonia-Army land Coventry Street, Victoria Barracks precinct-Unused Commonwealth land Miles Street, Melbourne-Former Army workshop Western Australia-Bushmed-Rifle range Individual values of the properties have not been provided as this information is regarded as commercial-in-confidence. Electoral Rolls (Question No. 2055) Mr Andrew asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 6 September 1989: (1) Has the 1985 decision to remove current electoral rolls from post offices made it more difficult for electors in rural electorates to determine whether or not their enrolments are up to date. (2) Will he consider supplying Commonwealth electoral offices in rural seats with an 008 local call fee facility to simplify enrolment inquiries and inate the disadvantages experienced by rural constituents; if not, will he consider the reallocation of electoral rolls to rural post offices. Mr West-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Australian Electoral Commission has advised that the last print of the Commonwealth electoral roll was in 1984. In late 1987 it was decided by the Commission that the printed rolls should be taken out of circulation because the information contained was by that stage so inaccurate as to be misleading. The removal of the 1984 printed rolls from Divisional offices and post offices had no impact on the options already available to rural electors and all other electors wishing to check on their own enrolments. These are: to visit the Divisional Office to perso-ally check the official roll for that Division, or elim- to wnte a letter or make a telephone call to the Divisional Returning Officer. . (2) The Australian Electoral Commission does not consider that a 008 local call fee facility is justified as a general service for rural electors. However, all electors may avail themselves of the 008 telephone enquiry network that is established during election periods before the close of the rolls. The lines to State Head Offices of the Commission are open to enquiries of any kind, including personal enrolment enquiries. The Commission has no plans to supply Australia Post with copies of the pending 1989 printed roll for display in post offices, rural or otherwise. The 1984 roll was displayed in post offices free of charge, but since that time Australia Post has advised that it intends to charge for display. This would be a substantial additional financial burden which the Commission would find hard to justify.",177
