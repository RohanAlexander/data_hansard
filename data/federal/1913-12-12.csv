1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I desire to read tha following letter to the House:White Hart Hotel, Melbourne, nth Dec., 1913The Hon. the Speaker, House of Representatives. Mrs C. E. Frazer desiies to express ber Met) appreciation of the resolution of sympathy passed by the House of Representatives OD the occasion of the death' of her husband, and to convey her sincere thanks to the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives for the kindness they have shown her in her recent bereavement. SMALL - P OX OUTBREAK .",12
2,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,Some days ago I informed the Minister of Trade and Customs that it had been reported in the press that thoro had been a ease of small-pox at Thornleigh. Has the honourable gentleman any information on the subject?,12
3,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have received a communication from the Public Health Department, Sydney, in which the writer saysI am directed to inform you that a case of small-pox has riot occurred at Thornleigh, and it is not known how the press came into possession of incorrect information. NEW; HEBRIDES . - Mr FOWLER --At a meeting held in Melbourne last night to discuss the New Hebrides question, the statement was made by a gentleman who, I understand, is personally acquainted with the conditions existing in theislands that the death-rate among the natives employed on the French plantations there is 40 per cent, per annum. I ask the Minister of External Affairs to ascertain, if possible, whether the statement is correct, and if he finds it to be so, will he make representations on the subject to the I m perial authorities, and, through them, to the French Government?",12
4,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have not seen or heard of the statement referred to, but I had recently before me, in the report presented to the Colonial Office, official figures relating to the mortality on the New Hebrides plantations. The figures were for a period ending 1911, but I do not think that they showed the mortality to be as great as 40 per cent. In some parts of the islands there has been lately a heavy mortality from measles. I shall make the inquiry asked for, and I give the House the assurance that every aspect of the New Hebrides question which affects Australia is receiving the closest attention. TEMPORARY CENSUS CLERKS.",13
5,Mr ARTHUR,Unknown,"I believe that it was understood that temporary census clerks who served for twelve months would, at the end of that period, be given three weeks' extra pay in lieu of leave of absence. Will the Prime Minister see that that is done 1 I have been informed that the pay has not yet been given.",13
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The matter has not come before me, but I am prepared to look into it . TOBACCO INDUSTRY . PRICES-IMPORTATION-CULTUR EI N  ister for Trade and Customs whether he has a statement to make regarding the letter sent out by a certain tobacco company to various growers of tobacco leaf in Australia ?",13
7,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Yesterday afternoon several members representing the tobaccobilities growing districts joined me in an interare view with Messrs A . D . H a r t and kins, representing the British Australian Tobacco Company. We discussed with them the letter to which the honourable member refers, and as a result of the in terview they assured me that it is not the intention of the manufacturers to refuse to pay .fair prices for fair quality leaf; [152] that there is a fair prospect for the in dustry in the f u t u r e ; but that there is not sufficient good quality leaf at present produced. I was informed that there is only room for a gradual expansion in the industry, and that much of the local leaf is inferior, due to causes arising from the nature of the soil, climatic conditions, selection of seed, and preparation of leaf, but that attention paid to these matters would produce better results in quality. I have obtained several reports from our own officials, which I am forwarding through the Prime Minister to the Agricultural Departments of the States, to get the opinions of their experts on the subjects dealt with, and I hope to make a fuller statement to the House later.",13
8,Mr TTJDOE,Unknown,"Can the Minister, before the Estimates are discussed, inform the House what quantity of Australian grown leaf is used by our local manufacturers today, and what quantity was used ten years ago; and can he also obtain the same information regarding imported leaf? I think he will find that there is a big discrepancy.",13
9,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I shall endeavour to get that information. The quantity of unmanufactured tobacco imported in 1910 was 13,586,845 lbs., the importation of 1911 being 14,900,520 lbs.; and of 1912, 15,035,532 lbs. I am informed that the increase is due to the fact that they are now storing tobacco here instead of in the United States, as formerly.",13
10,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,As good tobacco can be grown in Australia as in any part of the world. PAPUA.,13
11,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"In places where the - climatic conditions and soil are suitable, leaf of very good quality can be grown. Mr FINLAYSON ; - Will the Minister consider the advisableness of obtaining from Papua, through the Minister of External Affairs, a report on the possiof tobacco culture there? There exceptional facilities for growing toW i l - bacco leaf successfully in Papua.",13
12,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I shall do that. PUBLIC DEBTS BILL.,13
13,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The Prime Minister, when he stated last night the programme for the remainder of the session, made no reference to the Public Debts Bill , which stands sixth on the business-paper. that important measure to be discussed this session ? If not, what action does the honourable gentleman propose to take during the recess regarding the transfer of the public debts?",13
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is not proposed to discuss the measure this session. We should like to have a further talk with the States on the debts question.,14
15,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Will there be a conference with the State Ministers? Mr. JOSEPH COOK : - If possible. OLD-AGE PENSIONS . ASYLUM .INMATES-STAT E,14
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Las t night, in stating the business for the remainder of the session, I omitted to mention that we desire to put through a small Bill providing for the increasing of the payments to old-age pensioners who are inmates of charitable institutions. I hope that my honourable friends opposite will not think this a breach of the agreement arrived at last night.",14
17,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Do you intend to increase the pensions?,14
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am afraid that that matter must stand over for the present.,14
19,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Is the Treasurer aware that some of the State officials of Tasmania, who act for the Commonwealth as Registrars for the payment of old-age and invalid pensions, have to work u n t i l 10, 11, and 12 at night to do what is required of them; and that the money which we pay to get the work done goes, not to the officers who do the work, but to the consolidated revenue of the State?",14
20,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I am not aware of the circumstances mentioned. I believe that some of the States refuse to allow their officers to accept anything from the Commonwealth, and apply the Commonwealth payments to their own purposes. That seems to me not very generous. I shall make inquiries into the matter. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S Is DEPARTMENT. WAGES-DISTRIBUTIO N OF BRITISH NEWSPAPERS-ERECTIO N OF TELEPHONE LINES-NEWSPAPE R PROHIBITION.",14
21,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,I ask the Postmaster-General whether he will kindly arrange for the payment of the postal and telegraph employees on or before Christmas Eve.,14
22,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,I think that there is no doubt that they will be paid on or before that date.,14
23,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"-Will the Postmaster General inquire whether British newspapers could not be distributed in AusOFFICIALS' tralia under the "" printed matter "" rates. WORK. If that could be done, then, it seems to me it would achieve the object which the honourable gentleman had in view in connection with a clause in the Postal Rates Bill which we had under consideration yesterday.",14
24,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"There is no difficulty in that regard at the present time. Newspaper agents like Messrs. Gordon and Gotch distribute by hand most of the British newspapers coming here, and those requiring to be sent in land are put through the post under the rates relating to printed matter. The trouble is, that the present system does not allow Australian newspapers to be distributed in Great Britain in the same way.  General state whether any steps have been taken to have telephone lines erected under the contract system ?",14
25,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"We are erecting such lines both by day labour and under contract. All our men are being employed as far as possible, and tenders are also being called and accepted in many cases.",14
26,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether it is true that the Department refuses to carry certain newspapers through the post. The particular publication I have in mind in putting this question is Reynold's Newspaper.,14
27,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"The matter has not previously been brought under my notice, but I shall inquire into it . PERSONAL EXPLANATION .  personal explanation, I desire to bring under the notice of the House a quotation from the report of a speech delivered by the honourable member for Gwydir on the 26th November last at Glen Innes, and published in the local newspaper on 28th ultimo. I am sorry that the honourable member is not present. According to this report, the honourable member, who was supporting the candidature of a member of the Labour party for the representation of the district in the State Parliament said I have not seen much of Mr Abbott; he dues not often come to the House, and when he does come he does not stay long. He is all right in the Police Court badgering some unfortunate; but, judging by his first speech in Parliament, he should attend more and learn that the Federal House is not a Police Court. I have always endeavoured to take up a fair attitude in this House, and I hope that I shall always do so; but in justice to myself I should like to draw the attention of the honourable member for Gwydir to the records of the House, which show that up to the 26th ultimo, the date on which he delivered this speech, ""he had attended forty-eight sittings of the House during the session, whilst I had attended forty-six. The records show further that up to the 10th instant I had attended fifty sittings of this House, whilst the honourable member for Gwydir had attended forty-nine. I am pleased that the honourable member has now come into the House. I make this statement in justice to myself and to my electors.",14
28,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,Unknown, course  galah will keep* quiet,15
29,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I never spoke; what s i . (a) N i l . are you talking about?  out that the peculiar constitution of the House and the exigencies of the made it absolutely essential that, on leases every one of the days that I was in atactually tendance, I should not leave even for. a moment the precincts of the House. I intend quite admit that the flood of oratory on the part of the honourable member for of Gwydir rendered it impossible for me to stay in the chamber the whole day long.",15
30,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable mem- »at ber is now going beyond a personal exenter planation. [152]- 2  vour to keep on the right track; but I must say that I have been led away from the course I should follow by the honourable member for Gwydir. Like other honourable members, I have found it absolutely essential on many occasions to leave the chamber itself in order to attend to correspondence from my constituents and to other matters affecting my electorate, and very often I have done so while the honourable member for Gwydir has been addressing the Chamber, but I have always been within the precincts of the House. UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE.",15
31,Mr MANIFOLD,Unknown,H as the Prime Minister's attention been called to a report in the newspapers this morning that the leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia has been suspended for using what is considered in that State to be unparliamentary language?,15
32,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order . NORTHERNTERRITORY : LEASE S.  External Affairs, upon notice I. How many applications have been received for leases under the Northern Territory Land Ordinance(a) Ordinary Leases? (*) Leases as provided for under section 12? 2. How many applications under the above headings have been granted ? Of 3. How many areas of each class are now in actual occupation by the applicants?",15
33,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are(i) 359 for Cultivation Farms; 274 for Mixed Farming and Grazing Blocks; making a 2. 26 for Cultivation Farms; 20 for Mixed situation Farming and Grazing Blocks. 3. Eight of the persons who have been granted under section 12 of the Ordinance have taken up their allotments at the Daly River. ' Three others have intimated that they taking up their blocks, whilst four have been granted an extension of time, viz., to the middle of April next, in which to enter into occupation their allotments. It . may be mentioned that successful applicants for blocks at Daly River need not take up their allotments until the 14th December, whilst those who were allotted farms Stapleton are allowed until 5th February to into occupation. So far, no blocks have been taken up at Stapleton. MANOEUVRE AREAS: RENTALS. Mr MoWILLIAM S asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice What amount was paid last year in rent or. compensation for the land used by the Defence Department for manoeuvre or camp purposes?",15
34,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"£1,22 6 13s. 5d. AUDIT BILL . Bill returned from the Senate with the message that the Senate insists upon its amendmeut. Ordered That the message be taken into consideration forthwith.",16
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [10.54] - I move That the Bill be laid aside. I do not feel able to permit the Senate to tear up our financial. proposals in the way they are doing.,16
36,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is this a financial measure ?,16
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is in its very essence, and the Senate has taken out of it its most useful provision. The Opposition there may do as they please, as they are all powerful, but I am not under any obligation to accept such an amendment, and I therefore move, formally, that the Bill be laid aside.",16
38,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [10.53] The Prime Minister has a right to say what he proposes to do, but I think there were too many first personal pronouns in his statement. The Senate has a right to do what it thinks proper.",16
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I said that. Question resolvedin the affirmative. PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE BILL . Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of a message from His Excellency the Governor General recommending that an appropriation be made for the purposes of this Bill. Ordered That the message be taken into consideration forthwith. In Committee: Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) proment, posedThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be 'made for the purposes of a Bill the various public works. for an Act to provide for the establishment of , a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and for other purposes.",16
40,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [10.56] The Bill to which this message relates has just been circulated, and I understand the Prime Minister proposes to proceed at once with its consideration. I presume that he does not intend to do more today than move that it be read a second time.",16
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I thought that we might run it through and get on with the Estimates.,16
42,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I should like the debate on the second reading of the Bill to be adjourned after the Prime Minister has made his speech. The Bill has just been circulated, and it is impossible for one to be able at a moment's notice to become seized of all the facts relating to a measure of such far-reaching importance.",16
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Ver y well. Question resolved in the affirmative. ""Resolution reported and adopted. SECOND READING.",16
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [10.58] - In movingThat this Bill be now read a second time. I do not think I need take up much of the time of the House.,16
45,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I hope that the Prime Minister will deal with the whole subject.,16
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What subject?,16
47,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Mak e it clear to the House what the Government propose to do. .,16
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I shall do my best. 'Tis not in mortals to command success, But we'll do more, Sempronius, We'll deserve it. This Bill is founded largely on the Public Works Committee Acts of the States of Victoria and New South Wales. I think it is patent to every one at this time of day that the methods of conducting our Public Works ipolicy are crude, inefficient, and altogether inadequate-for the purpose of securing the taxpayers against loss and waste. We are spending in public works every year from £3,000,000 to £4,000,000; and ParliaI am afraid, is not so well informed as it ought to be regarding the expenditure of this money and the projection of Every one knows that we pass Bills through this Chamber, sometimes, in circumstances which, do not permit of full and detailed investigation of the projects to which they relate; and, consequently, I fear that Parliament occasionally knows very little of the actual details of the expenditure of large sums of public money. It is in order to remedy that defect, as well as to insure a more efficient spending of the money, and the wiser disposition of our public works policy, that this Committee Is proposed. Experience, both in Victoria and New South ""Wales, abundantly justifies this proposal. I do not hesitate - to say that, in the State of New South Wales, a similar Committee has saved the country millions of money.",16
49,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,And the same in Victoria.,17
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I suppose I am safe in saying that similar results have been the outcome of the Victorian Committee. There arises, first of all, the question whether a Committee composed of members of Parliament is the hest court of inquiry into these huge public undertakings-whethe r outside experts, permanently appointed as a board, would not conduct the inquiries more efficiently, and with a greater degree of .knowledge and intelligence. From my experience-and it is a pretty large one - I think that a board of experts would not do this work as well as a Committee of this House would. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We are all experts here.",17
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is not so; but members have a wide knowledge - of human nature. They have that invaluable quality called common sense, and a sense of responsibility for their actions which enables them to make inquiries into all such matters with an open mind, and, perhaps, with a detached view of things which does not pertain to the mind trained to special courses. Moreover, I ahould like to point out that all the available expert ability that such a Committee would care to call to their aid is at their disposal, and the members may, therefore, inform themselves concerning all the projects submitted, and be in a position to pass judgment in a way that, perhaps, an expert, biased by his training and immersed in details of the undertakings to which he has given his life's work, may not do. I am not so sure that outside unbiased judgment, even relating to technical matters, is often the best that we can obtain. That is an argument that goes as far as it may; but, further, I say that in connection with public works and public undertakings, the responsibility of this Parliament should be preserved inviolate. That is the point, I think, which ought to decide this matter. No outside body should have to do with projects in a responsible way which relate to the initiation of the spending of the public funds of the country. The determination of what, where, to what extent, and in what shape our public functions shall be initiated and utilized must always, it seems to me, rest with those who have charge of the purse of the country, and have the responsibility, finally, for the spending of the money. In other words, I think that this* proposal preserves the power of Parliament over the whole province of public expenditure. This appears to me to be the vital thing in deciding whether this shall be a Committee of members inside the House, or a Committee of experts outside the House. There is just another point that should be mentioned here. Ought a Minister-ough t a Government-to delegate this Ministerial function-for after all it is a Ministerial function and Ministerial responsibility-to any body of men either in Parliament or outside ? The reply to that is a very easy one-the Government will not delegate their responsibility, which is preserved at every stage. The Bill will provide that the Minister himself must express his views concerning the proposals in submitting them for the consideration of the Committee. Further, the Minister must take full responsibility for the initiation of the proposals, and for the provision of plans and specifications, and all data collectable within his sphere of responsibility, for submission to the Committee. More than that, after the inquiry has been made, and the information supplied to Parliament, a further responsibility, that is made statutory in the Bill, rests on the Minister,. and makes it mandatory on him to submit the proposals for the final consideration of Parliament within a given period after the inquiry has been conducted. It seems to me that there is nothing here inconsistent with the full responsibility of the Minister or with the financial responsibility which the Government and the House have to undertake.",17
52,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Supposin g the Committee "" turns down "" a proposal, can the Minister still present it to Parliament?",18
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parliamen t "" turn s d o w n "" the proposal, not the Committee.",18
54,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"If the Committee reports against a proposal, have the Government still the right to submit it to Parliament ?",18
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parliamen t takes full responsibility, but if the Minister and the House "" ' turn down "" a proposal, as a result of the rejection of it by the Committee",18
56,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Will the House have an opportunity to deal with a proposal even if the Committee report against it ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - The House , does not delegate any of its rights to the Committee or any other body.",18
57,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The point is that no body can bring a proposal to this Parliament except the Ministry.,18
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is the point on which I am trying to insist. Ministerial responsibility is preserved full y and entirely.,18
59,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"That is different from the procedure in New South Wales. There, if the Committee reports against a proposal, that proposal cannot be submitted for twelve months.",18
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member has got hold of the wrong idea. If a proposal is "" turn e d down "" by the Committee in New South Wales, that proposal cannot be re-submitted to the Committee for twelve months.",18
61,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"This Bill proposes to reserve the power to submit a proposal to Parliament at any time, even if the Committee do "" turn d o w n "" that proposal.",18
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I think the provision to which I have been referring is a very useful one.,18
63,Mr FISHEH,Unknown,"But what I have indicated is the proposal in the Bill ? It provides that the Governor General may at any time submit a proposal, notwithstanding that it has been rejected by the Committee. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - But these are two distinct points. We are talking now about a re-inquiry into a work which the Committee have "" turned down."" There is a provision in this and all other Bills of the kind that, once the Committee have "" turned down "" a proposal, the Committee cannot be asked to re-inquire intothat proposal for a period of twelvemonths. The point is that, whatever the' Committee reports, this Parliament is supreme and master of its own proceedings.",18
64,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"After the Committee hasreported against a proposal will the Ministers have the power to immediately present that proposal to Parliament, and carry it , without re-submitting it to the Committee ?",18
65,Mr FISHEH,Unknown,Practicall y that could be done through the Governor General.,18
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Clause 16 of the Bill providesI f the resolution of the House of Representatives declares that it is not expedient to carry out any proposed work, no proposal for a public work in substance identical with that work shall be submitted to the House of Representatives until after the expiration of one year from thedate of the resolution. I take it , however, that this House is supreme, and, notwithstanding any report of the Committee, could decide to proceed with the work if it thought fit. The function of the Committee is to be the eyes, and ears of Parliament.",18
67,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Why not read the rest of clause 16 ?,18
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We shall deal with that when we come to it . The Committee will collect information in a responsible way, and the House will deal with their recommendations as it sees fit-that is the great, point I wish to make in connection with the Bill . For the rest, I think I need not go into details.",18
69,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The Committee has no. restrictive powers at all over the Ministry as I read clause 16.,18
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No ; the Committee goes out as really a scout to obtain information for the Government.,18
71,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Not for the Government,, but for the country.",18
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"To in for m Parliament, so that Parliament may assume its responsibility with an enlightened mind and judgment. The constitution of this body will require some littl e consideration in Committee. I candidly think I have made a mistake in regard to the number which I haveplaced at nine, three of whom are to befrom the Senate.",18
73,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I suppose that the Prime Minister would give more satisfaction if lie composed the Committee of the whole of Parliament-that - is the sentiment I find about!,18
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It seems to me the Committee must be composed of even numbers, because the Chairman will have - a casting vote.",19
75,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"How is it proposed - elect the members of the Committee-by - a straight-out vote, or the Hare-Spence .system ?",19
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is provided for in clause 3, and it is the same method as that by which we appoint Select Committees. It is quite clear, I think, that this Committee must be a littl e larger than the Public Works Committee of a State. It will have to travel over a great deal more ground, and, as sectional Committees will be required, it would be difficult, with a small number, to set up these Committees in the requisite strength to insure the work being carried on continuously. While a committee of six or seven may be all right for a State, eight or nine, I think, would Joe more like the proportion for a wide - continent such as Australia.",19
77,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Will the Committee sit while Parliament is sitting?,19
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , but I take it only with the consent of Parliament. I think the rule in the States is that the Committee does not sit while Parliament is sitting. In New South Wales it sits in the mornings before the House meets. My recollection is that it also sits in the afternoon, with the consent of Parliament, but I do not know that that is a very good rule.",19
79,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,If this Committee sat in the afternoon would its members receive only the one payment for the morning and afternoon sittings?,19
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am not quite - clear on that point. I think the payment is so much per sitting. Both Victoria and New South Wales very wisely l i m it the amount which may be paid to members during any one year. I think the limi t in Victoria is £1,200, and in New South Wales £2,000.",19
81,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,It was nearly doubled in New South Wales last year.,19
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"At any rate, that is the total amount fixed by law that may be spent in any one year in payment of allowances or expenses to the whole of the members of the Committee.",19
83,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable member does not realise how much the members of the New South Wales Works Committee have received.,19
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am only stating what is in the New South Wales Act , but I shall be quite prepared to hear that to since the honourable member's friends came into power over there they have set such provisions aside. At any rate, £2,000 is the total amount allowed for the members of the Committee in New South Wales. There is provision both in New South Wales and Victoria that, if there are more sittings than would allow for the amount set out in the Act as payment for services, that amount is to be proportionately reduced so as to bring the total payments within the amount specified.",19
85,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"What is meant by "" other purposes "" ?",19
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not know. T presume it means other purposes incidental to the inquiry, but here I am up against a difficulty. I am not clear whether, under our Constitution, we can pay our members at all.. There is a great and wide divergency of opinion on this serious constitutional point. The M in ister of External Affairs, on my right, says he thinks it is all right, and' I suppose the honourable member for Bendigo would say that perhaps it is all right. However, I have left the matter blank, and we shall have to fill it in when the Bill gets into Committee, but there is no doubt that whether we can pay members a fee or not we can pay them expenses. The Committee has power to divide it self up into sectional Committees so as to facilitate their work, and all the necessary machinery is provided.",19
87,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Will the Bill apply to works costing over £25,000 in the Northern Territory and Papua as well? If it will, it will mean delay.",19
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It will apply to any big public work. The honourable member is raising an important point, and I do not deny that the Bill may create some difficulty. It is an experiment, and it has to be seen whether provisions that . work so admirably in the States will work as satisfactorily over this wider field. My own impression is that they will . I believe the common sense of the Committee, and of the House generally, will triump h over all difficulties caused by the scale and range of things in the Commonwealth. Although there may be difficulties in going to the Northern Territory and elsewhere, I do not think those difficulties will be greater for monwealth. the Committee than they are now for Ministers. Whatever the Ministry can do regarding the Northern Territory, or Papua, this Committee, with its even greater facilities for inquiry, can do.",19
89,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I do not know you have left out the military crowd. They want watching more than anything. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We must include defence. Those are the "" roosters "" .we want to watch.",20
90,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Why is defence omitted ?,20
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am, in that respect, following precedent. A good deal of the defence works are connected with questions of strategy.",20
92,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"If you want to experiment, experiment with defence.",20
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Honourable members themselves must take the responsibility for that new departure. Defence has been specifically excluded from all such inquiries in both these large States. "" Mr RICHARD FOSTER - Does the question of strategy apply to the erection of buildings?",20
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"They may be part of the entire strategic scheme, and it may be difficult to separate them. However, I shall be glad to hear any argument on that question in Committee; but at present my judgment is that the defence of the country should be excluded from the ordinary public works.",20
95,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Do you mean the purchase of war materials only, or, say, the erection of new buildings at Canberra?",20
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I mean the construction of works in connection with our Naval Bases, and all that kind of thing.",20
97,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,What is it proposed expend on Naval Bases?,20
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I cannot tell the honourable member; but that mean many million pounds before we are through with it. We have an inquiry going forward now by the best expert could obtain in the Old Country regardthings. ing these very matters.,20
99,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Onl y in a portion of Australia. You declined to let Queensland to inspect the manoeuvre area and naval training area at Wide Bay,, which is one of the best areas in the Com",20

Bill to the House, believing that it has a useful function to serve in regard to these huge expenditures of public money, and that it will make our services and decisions in Parliament more enlightened and informed when we come to face that responsibility for the spending of the people's money which is one of our turned chiefest functions in the Federal Parliaworth ment. Debate (on motion by Mr FISHER adjourned. BUREAU OF AGRICULTUREBILL . America, SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 21st November, 1907, which says(vide page 3430), on motion by Mr . JOSEPH COOKThat this Bill be now read a second time.  dress myself to the second reading of this Bill with considerable pleasure, because the departure projected in it is one that I think the Commonwealth is perfectly justified in taking. I do not agree with .some honourable members who have already spoken that it will be an economic measure. To be effective, a Commonwealth Bureau of Agriculture must necessarily be a costly Department.",21
115,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"He a r , hear.  nent in the world to come into the compeprecisely tition in the demand for population, in order to obtain a satisfactory populastantial tion we must hold out certain inducements to immigrants to come here and fill up our empty spaces. In establishing our bureau we shall be well advised if take advantage of the experience of other countries, and I point with great satisfinest faction to the useful and important done by the Agricultural Bureau of the United States of America. No finer reNew sults have been achieved anywhere by that bureau. For many years to our only source of wealth by way of portable surplus will be wool, wheat, meat, and butter, and any difficul Mr. ties we have can only be removed by havgation experts in the world. ing a greater increase in the exportable surplus of our primary productions. Since 1904 our imports and exports have been gradually coming together, until all last year the exports only exceeded the imports by 1.2 per cent.",21
116,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,"The value of the excess  is greater the better off we shall be. According to the 1912 Tear Book issued by the Department of Agriculture in the United States of America, every million dollars spent upon the Department is rei n the shape of ten million dollars' of wealth produced through the increased production of the land due to fol) lowing the advice given by the experts of that Department. To be a little more definite as to the work done in I shall read from the historical sketch of the Department of Agri culture in the United States for the year In 1879 there were 35 bushels of corn raised for every person in the country, and in 1889 only 34 bushels; but the production per acre increased from 28.1 bushels in 1879 9-5 ' «88o. to 2 n And in relation to corn, the largest product of the United States, this was 23 bushels in 1839 and 44 bushels in 1899. I am pleased to notice that, under the provisions of the Bill before us, there are certain matters which the Commonwealth can investigate for the benefit of coming generations. First of all, the proposed bureau will deal with the acquisition and diffusion of information connected with agriculture and so forth . To do this we must have eminently qualified professors or experts who know what they are talking about, and and we shall have to pay these meD very subsalaries in order to obtain their services. The States havemade several mistakes through haggling over dollars in the matter of giving increases to their exwe perts. SoiLe years age New South Wales had the services of Dr Cobb, one of the bacteriologists in the world, but the work United States very soon found out his reputation, and got hold of him, because South Wales was not prepared than to go to the expense of the dolcome lars America was prepared to pay. exAnother illustration is to be found in Victoria. The State has the services of Elwood Mead, one of the finest i r r i He has made wonderful alterations in the irrigation schemes in existence in Victoria, but his position is now in jeopardy, owing to advanced offers being made to him from another country. I have not heard whether he has decided to remain here, or whether Victoria is to lose his eminent services. If we are to succeed in the direction we hope to attain, that of attracting the people looking for land in a - new country, we shall have to pay well to get the services of these experts. As to our relationship with the States, I can see no evidence of any antagonism between the States' Departments and our proposed bureau. Mr . Valder, Under-Secretary for Agriculture m New South Wales, has told me that he can see no reason why there should be any friction between an agricultural bureau, under the Federal auspices, and the Agricultural Departments of the States. He considers that the two could work hand in hand, that the experience of the State Departments will probably be of benefit to the Federal bureau, and that ultimately Australia will be able to take its place in the councils of the world in this regard.",21
117,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,That is the attitude the Victorian Director of Agriculture.,22
118,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Where does your Socialism come in 1  a proposal so broad as the one before us, I hope we are not going to intrude party considerations. If the honourable memket? ber would think for a moment, he would discover the difference between a public tion's business. utility and a Socialistic project. They are as wide apart as the Poles. Howable ever, I do not wish to be drawn to one side on a matter of this kind.",22
119,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"This proposal is on same footing as universities and schools, which we all support.  number of matters that the Commonbald wealth can investigate by appointing the eminent laboratory and other experts, such matters as animal pathology, field research, the introduction of new crops, new plants, and new methods.",22

121,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Is not the State of Victoria already doing that work?  tagonistic to what the State is doing, I hope to be able to show that there is large portion of Australia for which no State has endeavoured to make better provision.",22
122,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Will not this Bill mean, the creation of more Government officials ?  bureau will be a costly Department, but as the result of the money spent therewill be the production of much morewealth than we have at the present time. In the United States, for every million, a similar Department has cost in the way of agricultural instruction, the result has been ten million dollars' worth of wealth produced. This is one Department ini which we can see a direct return ahead of us for the money we shall spend. W f r could follow the lines of the United States Agricultura l Bureau, and divide: the work into several divisions, each, under control of a noted expert. In the. first place, we should have a good laboratory in which eminent men can make in-: vestigations into such things as infectiousand contagious diseases of all sorts, pleuro pneumonia in cattle, tetanus,. of Texas fever, tuberculosis, and other i m portant diseases that ought to be invesantitigated by the very highest authorities, if we wish to be as successful in our prowith duction as we hope to be.",22
123,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"As an anti-Socialist, whydo you not do that out of your own poc",22
124,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"That is the na member for Capricornia does not. realise that we are now dealing with a. national matter, and not with one that the should be approached from an individual point of view. To invite the individual to deal with the national aspect of affairs would land us into such troublea that the honourable member would goi n a week. In the initia l stages of work of this proposed Bureau of A g r i culture, I see no reason why we should be at all antagonistic to the States. I hope we shall never be antagonistic towards them, and I trust that we shall utilize their work as part and parcel of a great scheme. The State Departmentsare doing a lot of work that might well be published in the Federal reports for the benefit of the whole of Australia. Thei n New South Wales, V i c but toria, and Western Australia are doinga good, work, each for its own State, but the results ought to be made available to the whole Commonwealth. A few months ago Western Australia took from New South Wales the finest wheat experimentalist we had. He was the senior pupil of the late Mr Farrar, and New South Wales could ill afford to lose him, but Western Australia offered him more than he was getting in New South Wales, and, naturally, he went where his services were better recognised. As the controlling genius of the laboratory, I would suggest the pointment of a gentleman possessing a veterinary science degree, or of one holding a double degree, that is, a medical degree, and a degree in veterinary science. In most European countries the men at the head of affairs-possess double degrees. Sir John MCFadyean, a doubledjegree man, is an eminent authority, particularly on bacteriology and pathology, in Great Britain , and Sir Stewart Stock is Chief Veterinary Officer and head of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries there. In South A f r i c a , Dr Thale is the bacteriologist. In America, Dr Mohler is the Chief Pathologist of the Bureau of Animal Industry, and in India Professor Holmes is the Imperial Bacteriologist. In Australia we have an eminent bacteriologist in Dr Gilruth, the Administrator of the Northern Territory, and another in Dr Dodds of the Sydney University. A name of wide-world reputation in bacteriology is Professor Bang of Denmark, who is the discoverer of the cause of epizootic abortion in cattle, which is at the present moment a matter of considerable importance to us. It is necessary that there - should be a gentleman possessing a veterinary degree at the head of affairs, because the British Medical Association objects to an individual who has not had special training in medical prudence entering the field of bacteriological investigation. A doctor of veterinary science must diagnose wholly from - symptoms, and thus acquires a more in t imate knowledge of the causes of many of the troubles which affect the lower creation than the ordinary medical man obtains of the causes of human disease. I - say that with the greatest respect for the medicai profession, and in justice to the eminent veterinary surgeons who bave so wide a knowledge of the bacteria and micro-organisms affecting animal life. - Coming to m 'other matter, I have before me a map prepared by the Commonwealth Meteorologist, which shows that one-third of the area of Australia has a rainfal l of less than 10 inches. It does not follow that that country cannot be settled, and should be abandoned as if it were a Sahara. It should be a function of the Agricultural Bureau to experiment with a view to ascertaining the methods to be employed to make good use of these dry areas. The Department should endeavour to find out also what constituents are ap- lacked by the soil, and how they can be best supplied, and should generally ascertain the possibilities of the country for agricultural and pastoral occupation. Magnificent crops may be obtained with a rainfal l of only 10 inches a year, provided that the rain falls in the growing season between May and October. In deed, I would sooner have a rainfal l of 10 inches between those months than one of 40 inches between October and March. In the Northern Territory, we have a Government farm on which £19,000 has been spent to date. The rainfall in the locality is 40 to 50 inches per annum, but according to the Government Meteorologist, no rain is to be expected in May, June, July, August, and September. Consequently, agriculture in the ordinary sense of the word is not possible there. What are needed are experiments to ascertain the possibilities of intense culture, or of crops, possibly even of wheat, which may be sown at times of the year differing from the times of sowing in the more favoured and cooler parts of the continent. The dry area to which I referred, if proved by careful experiments to be capable of settlement, would give room for a huge population that would help us to hold for ourselves what is probably the best country under the sun. The chemist has within the last juris- few years revolutionized our knowledge of agriculture, and I look forward hopefully to a considerable alteration of our methods. There are in the soil two kinds of micro-organisms, which are hostile to each other. There are bacteria, which are beneficial, and protozoa, which are harmful, and the discovery of methods which will keep the protozoa in check and cause the bacteria to thrive will greatly increase the yields of the soil. Experiments have been made which go to show that, land which has been gradually getting weaker and weaker, or "" sick,"" to use the word of the farmer, can be brought back to almost pristine vigour. It has been found that by subjecting soil to a heat of from 56 to 100 degrees centigrade the protozoa in it is killed, but that the bacteria can withstand a heat of 150 degrees centigrade, even though it may be forced back into the spore state. Honourable members interjecting  with this question from a broad point of view; and if my remarks are having no educational effect upon honourable members opposite, who are always telling us that they are the friends of the farmer, I am sorry for them. My object is to show some of the difficulties that have to be faced in connection with the greatest industry in Australia. The men on the land are responsible for the only exports of surplus production that we have; and honourable members opposite, who pose as the friends of the agriculturists, should be anxious to help them in every way. If we could have agricultural experts of eminent reputation engaged in connection with the bureau to carry out experiments such as are being conducted in other parts of the world, the whole country would be benefited. If the new agricultural theories developed by agricultural chemists can be effectively brought to bear in many of the older settled districts, where we have to resort to what is known as the rotation of crops and fallow-, ing, then our older ground will retur n a yield twofold greater than it is returning today, and the result must be a great increase wealth of Australia. Anything in that direction would be costly, no doubt, but the money would be well spent. I feel quite satisfied that the results which have been obtained in this direction in the United States of America would also be obtained in this great Commonwealth. ""We might have experts engaged also in connection with the important subject of the afforestation of many parts of Australia. At present a wicked, wanton waste is going on. Some of the finest timbers in the world are being ruthlessly destroyed. This waste is largely due to the ignorance of the individuals concerned, and perhaps, also, to the fact that although these timbers are of commercial value, there are no facilities at hand to encourage agriculturists to prove this great source of wealth, with tlieresult that they are simply burnt off.",22
125,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Hav e we any power to deal with that matter?  it by suggestion; and, by working hand in hand with the State Departments, we could ascertain whether those Departments could not bring influence to bear on the State Governments in this direction., Then, again, we have a number of noxious weeds which require to be in vestigated. Prickly pear is one of these* As far as I have been able to ascertain, it is of very little commercial value. I conducted some experiments, at one time, to ascertain whether it could not be used, after being boiled, or as ensilage, for feeding dairy cattle, but the results were not satisfactory. There are also a number of stock-poisoning plants in different parts of Australia that need to be dealt with. We could have the opinions of the authorities promulgated in those useful publications known as bulletins, and now issued in connection with the United States of America Bureau of Agriculture. In such bulletins we could give the latest information concerning the efforts of scientific men to solve all these problems. These bulletins must result in better work. In conclusion, I want to point out that a bureau similar to that which we propose to establish in the Commonwealth is in existence in Canada, and isdoing good work. I have before me a report by the Live Stock Commissioners of the Dominion ; and looking through it I find that ' they act upon the suggesi n the tion I have made in regard to the employment of veterinarians at the head of the different Departments. In nearly every case where bacteriological investigation has to be made, we find that a gentleman holding veterinary degrees is in charge. The result has been a grand success, and the reports of these Commissioners have been most encouraging. I hold that it will not be necessary, in connection with our bureau, to commence experiments de novo. If we are wise we should go on with our experiments where others have left off. Let us take advantage of their experience, cheerfully acknowledging the sources which we have drawn upon, and I feel satisfied that as a result of the establishment of this bureau our wealth will be largely in creased; that we shall be able to discover methods of dealing with portions of Australia that at present look somewhat hopeless, and of dealing with them in such a way as to attract to them the surplus populations of other parts of the world.",24
126,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Capricornia) [12.8] - I am sorry that the Prime Minister did not allow this measure to stand over until next session, because it has certainly been brought forward without due consideration. It is quite incomplete, and should not have been introduced until the Prime Minister had consulted the Premiers of the States, and had a conference with the directors of the State Agricultural Departments with a view of ascertaining how far the Commonwealth might take over work that is now being done by the individual States. I cannot refrain from expressing my continued surprise at the action of the great anti-Socialist party opposite, which is every day abandoning its professions, and adopting socialistic and even communistic experiments.",25
127,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Does the honourable member think it would be logical to abolish our universities and public schools ? It is all a question of education.,25
128,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Ha d my honourable friend been acquainted with the Labour movement for the last twenty years he would know that we have claimed all along that all expenditure of public money in the interests of education is of a socialistic, and in some cases, of a communistic character. Where a community is taxed to find funds for free education, that, in my opinion, is a b it of Communism. The honourable member for Hume thinks that there is a difference between a socialistic experiment and a public utility carried on by a Government or a municipality. What we try to impress on the Liberals and anti-Socialists is that the expenditure of Government or municipal funds to carry on services they do not carry on for themselves is of a socialistic character. I regard posal to establish a Bureau of Agriculture as being very much in the nature of to Communism-- a step, of course, greatly beyond Socialism, under which people have to pay for services rendered. Our honorto able friends opposite who declaim against us, and declare from every public platasked form that we are Socialists, while they anti-Socialists, are going to dip their hands into the public purse to take thousands, and, perhaps, some hundreds of thousands, to assist one or two sections of the community, and principally the farmers and pastoralists.",25
129,Mr GROOM,Unknown,But the proposal is a good one.,25
130,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Rightl y carried out it is, but my honourable friends opposite in sist upon abusing the Labour party throughout the Commonwealth because we ask for a little Socialism or Communism for the man who is on the lowest rung of the ladder. When we asked for pensions for the aged poor we were called Socialists. g",25
131,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"It was said that we were ""sapping their independence.""",25
132,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Ye s j * some honourable members opposite were always in favour of old-age pensions, but others have always opposed the system, and tolerate it only because they dare not say from a .public platform that they would vote to abolish it . I do not think we can sufficiently impress upon the Liberals and the public generally what Socialism and Communism really are; how far they enter into the lives of the people at the present time, and how we ought to extend Communism and Socialism in the interests of civilization. I am agreeable to this proposal provided the Prime Minister will consult the States. Honourable members opposite say that we have been extravagant as a party, but what about their financial methods? What have the honourable member for Robertson and the honourable member for Riverina, who take an interest in financial matters, to say of this proposal on the part of the Government? The Prime Minister says, "" We propose to establish a Bureau of A g r i culture.""",25
133,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"Will it not "" sap the which independence ' ' of the farmers ?",25
134,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I shall come to that. this proThe Prime Minister saidWe want a Bureau of Agriculture. It seems me that we have great opportunities to effect a lot of fine work. I think we ought to have a small body of competent investigators. When I put a question to him as what the cost would be, I think he said that my question was frivolous. I ' him whether he had prepared any are estimate of the cost that would be involved in the establishment of the proout posed Bureau of Agriculture. The reply of the Prime Minister was, "" That is the last of those frivolous questions that I shall answer."" I asked that that statement should be withdrawn as objectionable, and the Prime Minister withdrew it , though he added that the question I had asked was objectionable to him. And no doubt the question was objectionab.' :, seeing that the Prime Minister knew nothing whatever as to what the cost would be. To his great surprise, from which he has not yet recovered, the honourable gentleman became Prime Minister. , He never had any constructive policy when he was in Opposition abusing the Labour Government in the language of the pot-house.",25
135,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order !,26
136,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I have never been in the pot-house, and I wonder how the Prime Minister obtained his knowledge as to the kind of language used there.",26
137,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order !,26
138,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"However , the honourable gentleman got into office; and I suppose, prompted by the Minister of Trade and Customs, who, as a private member, had made a speech in favour of an Agricultural Bureau, he hurriedly introduced this measure. Some weeks ago the Prime Minister, in answer to a question by myself, said he would lay on the table the sketch which had been prepared of the duties to be carried out by the experts, but it has not yet appeared, and I suppose that really it is not ready. Probably the Minister of Trade and Customs, when he speaks, will give us his view of the scope and character of the proposed bureau. Before I leave the subject of the great Liberal anti-Socialist party, I think I ought to indicate an amendment, of which I had intended to give notice but for the fact that I thought the Bill had been dropped. That amendment proposed to make the preamble of the Bill read thusWhereas the so-called Liberal or Fusion party have abandoned their alleged policy of anti-Socialism, and have wisely determined to spend a portion of the people's money, known as the Consolidated Revenue, in assisting farmers, dairymen, horticulturists, viticulturists, owners and others in an unmistakable Socialistic . and Communistic manner, be it therefore enacted. I have here an enormous quantity of literature which I have collected, thanks to the kindness of various State Ministers of Agriculture and their officersliterature showing what the States are already doing in assisting those engaged in laud pursuits. The Prime Minister, when he assumed office, said . that it would be his aim to bring about harmony between the States, 1 and we know his method and the results. He began by abusing Mr Holman, the Premier of New South Wales, in very violent language regarding the small-pox business.",26
139,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I cannot connect these remarks with the Bill .,26
140,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I shall try to connect them by showing that the Prime M in ister, in introducing the Bill in the way that he did, was not in any way endeavouring to bring about harmony, between the States. Two or three years ago the farmers themselves, in conference at Sydney or Brisbane, carried a resolution against the establishment of a Federal Bureau.",26
141,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The honourable member is confusing the farmers with the f r u it growers.,26
142,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I am not, and I resent that remark. Really there is some cause for some of the language quoted in the Senate, for Parliament seems to be the place where people indulge in fibs to an inordinate extent.",26
143,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member must not make 'reflections of that nature on Parliament.,26
144,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I withdraw the words, but honourable members will admit that we f l i r t too frequently with the truth . The Prime Minister had been with his back to the wall for so many years that he never thought that he would be in office again; and, therefore, he had no policy, and had to rush in with this Bill before it was ready. When introducing the measure he had no idea of what was to be the scope of the Federal Bureau. He said It has always appeared to me that what we most need in Australia is a small select body of the best original investigators we can get. I am afraid' that we have never gone to the top of the tree in engaging the kind of ability that we stock- want in these matters. This was immediately after referring to the fact that one Commonwealth officer was receiving £1,000 a yearAltogether, a great realm of exploration lies open to us, and we have to persevere until we find a solution for many of our difficulties. The honourable gentleman went on to refer to the diseases of apples, and to the prickly pear, and said If we got a man to deal with one of these troubles and solve it for us, he would be ^50,000 a year to this country. For years in Queensland there was a standing reward of £10,000 for any method by which land could be the prickly pear at a cost of £ 1 per acre, and no one was ever able to claim it . Prime Minister had in his mind a small body of experts who were to go into laboratory and conduct certain experigentleman, ments; and he seems to have been quite unaware of what had been done by the States. In Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales there are agricultural bureaux at the present carrying out all' the experiments which it is supposed are to be carried out under this Bill .",26
145,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Not at all.,27
146,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,What have those State bureaux done?,27
147,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Riverina is a pastoralist, and, perhaps, has not given the attention he might to the agricultural industry. As I say, have an enormous mass of literature here which I cannot hope to deal with in the limited time at the disposal of honourable members. We ought to be dealing with would the Estimates instead of this Bill , which is being rushed through without proper consideration. I have a long and very interestpenditure ing letter, of many typewritten the work.' pages, from the secretary of the Victorian Agricultural Department, in which he informs me that Victoria has experinumbers mental farms, a chemists' branch, a science branch, a field branch, and a horI ticultural branch, with farmers' classes and lectures. The object of the agriculmiles tural division under the State is briefly to assist in raising the standard of culCollege, tivation and production in every part of the State where agriculture is carried by the means of demonstration plots and experimental farms, regular courses of lectures, and by the distribution of pamfarms phlets, bulletins, and so for t h, bearing directly on the work of the farmer. Plant diseases, and soil, and manurial problems are also a marked feature of the work.",27
148,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"Does the letter say anything about the Wyuna experimental farm on which was lost £10,000 or the £15,000 ?",27
149,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Liste n to the honourable member for Riverina, who is a supporter of the Bill before us! He points out that the State of Victoria, in assisting the worth farmer by means of this farm, has sunk from £10,000 to £15,000.",27
150,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Because the Liberal Government put a man there who knew cleared of nothing about farming..,27
151,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I am not, as I have exThe plained before, a Unificationist, and I draw special attention to the remark of a the honourable member for Riverina. That by supporting this Bill , proposes to supersede the State in such efforts; but if the State of Victoria, which has a comparatively small area, has lost £10,00 0 or £15,000, how much is the Commonwealth likely to lose in experiments, with the heads of the bureau, probably, in Melbourne, and farms and other experimental stations in the other States, say, for example, in the Northern Territory. I emphasize this to show the necessity for postponing the carrying of this Bill until such time as the Prime I Minister or his representatives have consulted with the State Premiers and the representatives of the State Agricultural Departments, to see to what extent it be better to leave certain duties in the hands of the States, and to what extent the Federal Government ought to take over the work. Otherwise, there is going to be foolish and extravagant exof public money in duplicating I can show honourable members of bulletins issued in the various States on all kinds of subjects. n Victoria, they have a central Research F a r m at Werribee, situated about 19 from Melbourne; the Rutherglen Experimental F a r m and Viticultura l in the North-eastern D is t r i c t; the Wyuna Irrigation F a r m in the Goulon, burn Valley ; and an Experimental Farm at Bamawm, in the Goulburn Valley. It is stated that "" the general object of these is to carry out exhaustive experiments and demonstrations to show the varieties of the different crops best suited to each of the several districts, the manurial requirements of the various soils; the cultural and tillage methods most likely to give best results, and the methods of crop rotation which will give best financial results ""-jus t what one honourable member was asking the Federal Government to do. "" Hundreds of permanent experimental plots have been laid out at these experimental farms, and the intelligent settler who visits these plots may read from the results of the plots those practices which are likeiy to give him the best financial results. Expert officers, skilled in the various branches of production, are attached to these various farms, and give personal advice on all agricultural matters free. The results of the researches and experiments are published as they accrue in the monthly journal of the Department, and so are made available to all farmers in the State."" What is the Prime Minister going to do about that? Is he going to spend public money in duplicating that work without consulting the State Premiers and the State Ministers of Agriculture as to how far Federal interference is called for?",27
152,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"When the Bill is passed, arrangements can be made.",28
153,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Coul d we not come to an understanding before we pass the Bill?,28
154,Mr GROOM,Unknown,It is agreed now that there is a fairly large field of scientific research work that can be undertaken by the Commonwealth. There is no trouble about that.,28
155,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"This Bill only shows the slip-shod method of legislation of which we have the right to complain - Honourable members who went throughout the Commonwealth talking about the extravagance of the Labour Government, ought surely to come down to this House with a proper scheme of finance, instead of a Bill which may cost, we do not know how much.",28
156,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,Have ' the State Departments ever .cured any one disease to which our stock were liable?,28
157,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"We know that in Queensland they have discovered certain cures. One man discovered a formula for treating ticks- a matter affecting the pastoralists particularly. The Government of Queensland spent public money in assisting the stock-owners to get rid of the ticks, or to keep them down. The State Governments of Australia have assisted pastoralists to an enormous degree, and if a balance-sheet were published showing the amount of Government money that had been spent in that way the public would be astounded. Almost millions of money have been spent by the Governments of the States in giving the stock-owners wire netting and rabbitproof fences, at very great cost, to fence their runs when, in some cases, there were no rabbits within hundreds of miles.",28
158,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,They paid it all back.,28
159,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"They have not paid it all back in Queensland, by any means. The State Governments of Australia, and of Queensland in particular, have given the pastoralists long leases of huge areas at 5s. per square mile-the leases running in some cases to forty-two years. They .let the pastoralists in Queensland have land at | d . an acre, where they charged the farmer 3d. per acre for similar quality land, so that pastoralists like the honourable member for Riverina should never say anything about the parsimony of the States.  be got?",28
160,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"If the honourable member will write to the Bureau of Intelligence in Brisbane, and ask for the latest Crown Lands Directory, he will find that he will be able to get land in Queensland from small agricultural farms of 150 acres up to farms of 1,280 acres, or get up to 2,500 acres of prickly-pear country, and up to hundreds of square miles of country further back from the railway line.",28
161,Mr GROOM,Unknown,A Bill like this was included in your Government's programme.,28
162,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,It might have been. We are always willing to assist the farmers.,28
163,Mr GROOM,Unknown,And now the practical test comes.,28
164,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"We shall assist the farmers by protecting them and the general public from the duplication of the expenditure on many of these services. Why should the Federal Government issue, through its Bureau, pamphlets on cotton-growing for the Queensland Government? There are pamphlets already' printed on cotton-growing. I have here a large number of pamphlets that have been issued, and these are only about a quarter of the total number. Here is Western Australia issuing a bulletin on ""mil k and cream: its care from the cow to the consumer,"" by the chief of the dairy division. Are the Federal Government going to issue a similar pamphlet to the farmers? Here is another on the examination of Western* Australian poison plants. The honourable member for Riverina asked what the States had done to protect stock. That pamphlet supplies the answer. Here is another pamphlet from Western Australia from the horticultural and viticultural division in relation to lemon-curing. There is another on "" hints to stockbreeders, together with diseases common in stock, for the use of breeders of all kind of far m animals,"" issued by the Department of Western Australian Agriculture. There is another on ' ' orchard rigation and drainage."" Now we come to Queensland, which issues a very large list of pamphlets, beautifully printed, and containing 'a great deal of information. Here is a pamphlet on ""poultry-farming,"" issued by the Department of Agriculture and Stock. There is another on citrus culture. There is no place in Australia where .citrus f r u it s can be produced so well as in that country. To show what we are doing to assist the farmer, here is a book on elementary lessons on the chemistry of the farm , dairy, and household, to be obtained free. My antiSocialist friends on the other side can get these pamphlets free on application to the Queensland Department. There is a pamphlet on lamb-raising, which is described as an undeveloped industry in Queensland, and no doubt, considering the territory that we have, it is. Here is a lecture on the drug cure of tick fever. Here is a pamphlet concerning the very matter the honourable member for Hume spoke about-in reference to diseases in sheep, and another with reference to contagious abortion in cows. Here is another to assist the exporters of our products. I am not too keen about that matter, because, unhappily, the more we assist the exporters to send away our produce, the higher becomes the price for the consumers here. We assist them to send their butter and meat to London, and the combine charge the people here a higher price than they ought to charge.",28
165,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"There would be none of us here if we did not export. Mr HIGGS.^-Let me tell the honourable member that in the ten years we exported about £60,000,000 worth of agricultural produce, but we consumed Locally about £273,000,000 worth, so that if there were no other countries in the. world we could still get along here. Here is a pamphlet on cotton-growing in Queensland, so that we have done a great deal in our State to assist all kinds of producers.",29
166,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Clause 46 of this Bill enables an arrangement to be made with the Government of any State for the supply and distribution of information, so that there will be no duplication.",29
167,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The , Government might first have inquired of the States whether ir- they were prepared to join with them. Yet they pose before the public as being people who object to Unification. I would point out that the resolution objecting to the proposal to establish a Federal Bureau of Agriculture, passed by the Conference of Farmers, was the direct outcome of the agitation of the so-called Liberal or State Rights party and their opposition to many of the functions now carried on by the Commonwealth. Queensland has also published a pamphlet on cotton plantations, and on dips and sprays for cattle and horses. It is remarkable how much we spend in assisting the pastoralist and farmer, and how little the pastoralists and farmers, as a body, realise it I quite agree that we ought to assist both pastoralists and farmers, but, in my opinion, it is about time we also commenced to assist the poor people in the community. What are we doing for sailors, wharf labourers, miners, and those poor fellows who work in the trenches in the streets, about whom cultured men, like the honourable member for Parkes, and others, complain, and say "" They are all idlers,"" if they should happen to straighten their backs during their work? What are we doing for these men ?",29
168,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The more production is increased the better it is for them.,29
169,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"That may be so in a properly organised community, but not in one where combines or trusts can increase the cost of living. I admit that if we make two blades of grass or two potatoes grow where one grew before, it is better for the community, providing we can get the goods to the consumers, and I hope that later on we shall assist the farmers to dispose of their produce by municipal, or possibly State, agents. Another pamphlet issued by the Queensland Government gives instructions to dairymen. The State Government have also gone into the matter of assisting the pastoralist by information and expert advice to enable him to secure the* best horses for stock-breeding purposes. They also publish a pamphlet on broom millet, and they supply the Dairy Produce Acts free of charge. They publish a pamphlet on the cultivation of potatoes in Queensland, and a pamphlet concerning sisal fibre growing. In fact, they do a great deal in Queensland to assist farmers by a series of beautiful pamphlets; such a one as "" a n abridged text-book on plant life and botany for Queensland students."" Where are the pamphlets to assist boot operatives? Is anything done to assist boot operatives?",29

' There is very important and generous work done by the State of New South Wales to assist farmers and producers, and i honourable members would like details about this assistance they can obtain them from a pamphlet issued by direction of the late Honourable Donald MCDonald, Minister of Agriculture in New South Wales, showing the State assistance dered to agricultural settlement in State. A balance-sheet is given in that pamphlet showing the very large amount of money which has been spent in assistingthe farmers. Those anti-Socialists who* object to the Government using money for any industrial purpose, because they say it destroys a man's independence, and think that every individual should do things class of for himself, only . apply this doctrine to such men as boot operatives, miners, or"" sailors. If boot operatives should ask for Government money to assist them, these honourable members would say, "" No . If you get this assistance you lose your in dependence, and your moral fibre is destroyed. We breed up a race of men who* will need to lean up against a wall or a post all their lives.'' We should distribute our favours withi something like an even hand. I shall not use that vulgarism about greasing a certain f at animal, because I do not wish to imitate the there is the Prime Minister, but when we are spending money to assist the millionaire pastoralists in Australia, surely we should not baulk when we are asked for Government aid for the unemployed. The Prime Minister the other day made - use of thecommunistic sentiment, "" Each for all and all for each."" I want him not to baulk if we should ask that assistance be given to the unemployed.",30
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What is your at t i use tude towards the Bill ?,30
178,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has It he will create dissension among the States. T,he honourable gentleman is abandoning his State rights opinion. However, what I was anxious to ask when he pubinterrupted me was-If we pass the Bill what are we going to do for the unemployed ? The Government propose to expend anything up to £100,000 on a Bureau of Agriculture to assist pastoralists who, generally speaking, are fair l y well to do, and to assist farmers, many of whom, unfortunately, are not too well",30
179,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The Bill is intended to f help them to a better financial position.,30
180,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Yes ; but see the blundering method that Ministers have adopted. A sensible business-like body of men would have called a conference of State Premiers, and would have asked these renPremiers to bring with them the heads that of their Departments «of Agriculture. They would have asked what suggestions could be put forward whereby duplication could be avoided. If we appoint an expert to deal with diseases in stock, is he to spend Federal money in issuing pamphlets dealing with this matter when nearly all the States are already issuing pamphlets upon the same subject? Minister defend that kind of folly ? My complaint is not against the idea of having a Federal Bureau of Agriculture, but it is against the clumsy methods of the Government who claimed that if they got into office they would curtail expenditure, and that there would be a return to responsible Government and sound finance. This is their sound finance: The States issue hundreds of pamphlets on hundreds of different subjects concerning farmers and pastoralists, and a Federal Bureau of Agriculture is to be superimposed upon the States and to spend thousands of pounds upon the same work. Surely that is an uubusiness-like proposition. Honourable members would not run their private business in that way. At any rate, I do not think the honourable member for Riverina would.",30
181,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 1.0 to 2.15 p.m.,31
182,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The New South Wales Agricultural Department, according to a pamphlet issued with authority, giving its history, was established in 1890, when the Hon. Sydney Smith was appointed by Executive minute Minister for Mines and Agriculture. A Director was appointed to organize the new Department, and it was administered by the first Minister for three years, as a separate entity. A comprehensive scheme of agricultural education was approved by the Government, the Hawkesbury Agricultural College was started, and four experimental farms were established, and sites for - others were chosen in districts whose climatic conditions differed. A scientific staff was got together. It consisted of a chemist, a plant pathologist, a botanist, an entomologist, a viticulturist, and a f r u it expert; and an officer was appointed to give instruction in dairying, with the aid of a travelling dairy. The Agricultural Gazette was instituted, and was distributed free each month to about 500 persons connected with rural pursuits. - Several experts, such as those I have mentioned, will be required by the Commonwealth Department, if the institution is likely to be of benefit to Australia. In 1893, the year of the great bank smashes, it became necessary for the Government to retrench, and the Department was coupled with the Mines Department. But it was soon found that it did not Can any make the same progress under those conditions as when dealt with by a Minister holding a separate portfolio, and after representations had frequently been made by the classes interested-anti-Socialists , no doubt-the office of Minister for Agriculture was created by a special Act of Parliament, and the Department was, in January, 1908, placed on an independent footing. In the Department now there is a chemist's branch, in which various chemical investigations relating to agriculture are carried on, as well as analyses of soil, fodders, wheat and flour, butter and milk, &c. There is a dairying branch, in which there is a dairy expert, and instructors in dairying, with a staff of inspectors and graders in connection with the Commerce Act. There is a fruit expert, who, with the aid of assistants and inspectors, administers the Fruit Pests Act, and superintends operations at various orchards. There is a sheep and a wool expert, a wheat experimentalist, and a Government entomologist. The duty of the entomologist and his assistants is to investigate the life history of the various insects and pests which affect fruit growing, and to discover methods of keeping noxious insects and organisms in check. There is a viticultural expert, a stock branch, a bureau of micro-biology, a seeds department-the seeds being sometimes sold and sometimes given awayand a Government botanist, together with a number of other experts. I have not time to refer to the various experimental farms, but I draw attention to the following balance-sheet. My anti-Socialist friends who object to the unemployed man getting assistance from the State, on the score that his moral fibre may thereby be destroyed, do not object to the expenditure of large sums of money for other socialistic work. The expenditure and revenue of the Department for the financial year ended 30th June, 1910, was as follows:EXPENDITURE. Departmental ... ... Subsidies and grants ... Other miscellaneous ... ... Hawkesbury Agricultural College ... ... ... Experiment and Demonstration Farms ... ... ... Less refunds ... ... Forestry ... ... ... Pastures protection ... ... Stock and brands ... ... Botanic Gardens and Sub-departments ... ... Exports and cold storage ... Commercial agents ... ... Stores Supply Committee's vote Votes of other departments ... Of this total, £196,384 5s. 8d., the sum of £5,455 is. gd., representing expenditure in Federal services, & c , has been debited to the Commonwealth and other Governments, leaving the net expenditure by the State as ... 190,929 3 n REVENUE ... ... 103,710 4 n Debit Balance ... ... That debit balance, a sum of £87,218 of Government money, was spent in New South Wales in 1909-10 to assist the pastoralists and farmers of that State. In conclusion, there may be some difficulty in obtaining experts to fill positions in the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau, and I would like to know whether it is intended that Australians shall be chosen.",31
183,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,We should get the best brains from wherever they can be obtained.,32
184,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Yes ; and we should pay the best salaries, because, if we do not, those whom we should employ will feel that they can do better by entering into business for themselves. I have it on good authority that the lands of Australia differ from those of other countries, and that men who may be well qualified to say what should be done with land in the United States of America or the Argentine, or some other place, may not understand Australian conditions. The State experts have been .conducting experiments here for years, and due consideration must be given to that fact, and £ s. d. to their claims for appointment in the 33>55i 0 8 Federal Bureau, should it be established. 19,611 5 8 'i333 0 4 Mr SPEAKER - The honourable member's time has expired. 20,313 o 7 Debate (on motion by Mr FALKINER) 42,131 16 7 adjourned. 116,940 3 10 3,180 7 5 ESTIMATES.

A friend of mine of whom I inquired, "" How are you getting on as a member of the New South Wales Parliament,"" replied, "" I am not a member of Parliament, I am simply a correspondence hack."" We ought to be something more than that. It cannot be denied 87,218 19 o that members have to deal with a very large volume of correspondence, and that it is largely added to whenever a new department is taken over. For instance, when we took over the old-age pensions system our correspondence was enormously increased.",32
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What does the honourable member suggest?,32
186,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"That the Government should place at the disposal of honourable members-and especially of members of this House, because it is to the district representatives that most of the electors go-the assistance of typists and shorthand writers to enable them to deal with their correspondence, which has been steadily increasing. Since we are so influenced by precedent and example, I refer the Prime Minister to the amount which is spent in this direction by the Canadian Parliament. A commencement might be made with the employment of two or three typists and shorthand writers, and if their services were found to be insufficient more could be obtained. People who occasionally visit our galleries and see us here think that we have nothing to do. That idea is entirely erroneous. The records of Parliament show that a great many members have come and gone, and many of them have l e ft us because of the onerous character of the work of a member of this Parliamentwork that is more difficult than' is that of a member of a State House. We have not only to travel long distances-and travelling is extremely disastrous to the health of members-bu t our work is of a most exacting nature. I am sure that if the Government would assist honourable members in the way I have suggested to attend to their correspondence and to discharge this part of their duty as it ought to be done, the public would offer no objection.",32

189,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The fact that we failed to do so does not justif y the with holding of this assistance fro m members. I suggest that two typists should be employed in the Ministerial room and two in the Opposition room. member should not have to spend most of his time in doing mere clerical work. Mr JOSE PH COOK (P a r a m at t a Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [2.36] - I ask honourable members to allow this matter to go for the present. I promise them that it shall be looked into with a view to seeing whether something cannot be done. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The trouble could be obviated by raising our allowance to £ 7 5 0 a year.,33
190,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Brisbane) [2.37] I have already suggested in this House that an arrangement should be made to ing. enable members of the Federal Parliament to travel free by the tramways all our capital cities, just as we now have record "" ? the use of the railways of the States.",33
191,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"Why should we? Mr ""FINLAYSON - For a very reason. Representatives of the other States can speak with feeling as to time occupied in visiting the various monwealth offices on business. Those visit Sydney appreciate the advantage of the free use of the State tramway system, and I do not think it is unreasonable to ask that this concession should be extended in respect of the tramway system of the other capital cities. It would not involve any heavy expenditure, because we already enjoy the privilege in Sydney, and in the case of three other State capitals-Brisbane , Adelaide, and Hobart - fe w honourable members have occasion to go there. This convenience would be greatly appreciated, since it would enable us to go about our business more freely. I also think that an unfair deduction is made from the allowances of honourable members from the date of dissolution of a Parliament u n t il the date of election.",33
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is a matter of law. Raise it when an Electoral Bill is before us. I Mr FINLAYSON - I shall leave it for the present. Another suggestion which I have to make is that we should have in the Federal Librar y a record of members of this Parliament on the lines of a parliamentary Who's Who. This record should give the place and date of b i r t h , and the parliamentary career of every member.",33

The record I suggest could be compiled at small whole cost.",33

208,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Kennedy) [2.45] I should like to make a suggestion to the Prime Minister for consideration in view of the next session. The recent sad events i u this Parliament House must have suggested to those who have had any long parliamentary experience sitting days a week are too much. know that it is very difficult for a Government, no matter what shade of politics, to get measures through; but if members are expected to sit four days a week, I am afraid that, instead of intelligent consideration of the measures brought before us, we shall have ill-informed discussion without finality. In my opinion, three days a week are ample, more particularly in the case of the Federal Parliament. Honourable members who live in New South Wales, South Australia, or even in the country districts of Victoria are all anxious to return to their home at the week-end, and \ it is desirable that they should have time to do so, in view of the fact that many, in attending here, are drawn away from their own private business.",34
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I promise the honourable member that I shall consider tlm suggestion very seriously. Personally, i. look on it favourably.",34
210,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I do not thinkthere is one State Parliament in Australia which sits more than three days ». week, except, perhaps, towards the end of in the session; and I trust that something will be done in the direction I have suggested.",34
211,Mr BOY D,Unknown,"Henty) [2.47] - I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy in reference to our sitting three days instead of four days a week. If we look at the records of Library the various State Parliaments we see that, with their three days a week, they do just as much work as does this Parliament. The State Parliament in Vicparliamentary toria claims to have put through, last session, eighty-three Bills, and the previous Federal Parliament laid claim to having passed a similar number during the life of the Parliament. Members of Parliament have other duties and business to perform and look after, as well as legislating. Outside bodies generally what hold their meetings on days that Parliament does not sit; but members from New South Wales, Tasmania, and South Australia do not reach their homes u n t i l the Saturday night, and have to leave again for Melbourne on the Monday, so that they have no opportunity of attending to local affairs in their constituency, not to mention their own private business. If we go on as we are doing, it seems to me that there will be a pension suggested that four for members of Parliament. I",34
212,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,The r e ought to be one now.,34
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member means a funeral allowance!,34
214,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"The public records show that men who have given their whole life to the public have been left in necessitous circumstances at the end of their political career. A man who was Premier and Speaker in Victoria ""died in debt, not because he was extravagant, but because, in the position he held, he was not able to pay his way. Another exSpeaker of the same State was paid a pension because, after his years of public duty, he was left stranded. It is not to be supposed that men must abandon the whole of their private business when they become members of Parliament. A certain programme is put before the country by each successive Government, and Parliament makes up its mind to get through the business of the session, whether the sitting days be three or four a week. I am quite satisfied, in my own mind, that, in view of the atmosphere of this chamber, we sit too long for the health of honourable members. No doubt a proposal to sit only three days would be met with the objection that on the Thursday Inter-State members would depart for thenhomes'; but that was the objection raised in regard to the country members of the State Parliament. members do clear out, the Government have a grand opportunity to bring in their Estimates, and get on with the business.",34
215,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Herbert) [2.53] - I suffer that pecuniary endorse what has been said by the orable member for Henty in regard to old-age pensions for members of Parliament. It is not to the credit the country that men who have served employment. faithfull y should, when retired either compulsorily or voluntarily, be placed i a necessitous position. There is one member of the House, whom I shall not name- a good party man, a good fighter and debater, and most attentive to his duties here-wh o now occupies a position in the Public Service which is creditable made. to neither the Paaliaiiient nor the country. There are others, too, who might be mentioned in an even worse position. It is nob reasonable that a man should have to take the position of a clerk in a very subordinate class, after having occupied seat in Parliament for a considerable time. Unless a member happens to live i Melbourne or the immediate vicinity, his business, should he have one, must suffer, for he cannot attend to both it and parliamentary duties. If he medical man or a lawyer, he loses touch wealth. with his clients, and, after a few years, finds it most difficult to establish a practice. The present position is al very well for those honourable members who are of independent means, but"" it very different for those in less fortunate circumstances, who, on retiring from it . Parliament, may find themselves compelled to go around with a basket of peanuts, or something of that kind. Here are 111 men, representing nearly 5,000,000 people; and I am sure that the latter would willingly pay pensions on a reasonable scale to those who have served them well, and who, in their old age, find themselves poorly off. I , for in stance, am in the "" sear and yellow leaf,"" and I know that, although I was earning as good a living relatively before I entered Parliament as I am now, I could not go back to my own business; and I am afraid that my age would disqualify me for any public employment. My suggestion is that there should be a graduated scale of pensions according to the number of Parliaments in which a If man has served, with a maximum of , say, five Parliaments,. and then a pension granted sufficient to enable him to live decently and comfortably for the resb of his life. I know that the Prime Minister is not now likely to embarrassment honcommon to most of us, bu t were he in a similar position to ourselves, and had he been defeated at the 1910 of election, he would have had to seek some Knowing the honourable gentleman's spending capacity, I do not n think he will be able to save very much exduring his parliamentary life, and very few of us can, especially those who are rearing and educating a family. I hope that the Government will give serious attention to the suggestion which has been Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin)' [2.57] --In my opinion, Parliament u n fits a man for any other kind of business. I was brought up a banker, but I would not like to run a bank now. When a man has been from eight to a twelve years or so in parliament, he has lost the energy, cunning, snap, and n subtlety so necessary in private business.",35

The heads of Departments mentioned by the honourable member for Barrier have all had very large increases since the Clerk had any at all, and the question of their increase, in any case, seems to have little or no relation to the increase in the Clerk's salary.

Ever since I have been in the House, I have had a suspicion that a considerable quantity of the paper which we, who are supposed to encourage local industry, use here, is imported paper. Without making a charge against any particular official, I can say that there are officials who seem to have a considerable liking for the imported article in preference to the local article, and some members of the House have had to make very strenuous efforts to thwart their desires.

Mr JOSE PH COOK (ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home A f fairs) [3.9] - The expense arises in connection with Commissions travelling on public business, while a large part of the extra amount is also due to the travelling expenses of an additional member of the staff who was brought from Western Australia.

227,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"Gippsland) [3.10] I should have no objection to the expenditure of this money on the Parliamentary Reporting Staff if I thought that the circulation of Hansard reached to the extent that I desire it to reach. Will the Prime Minister take into consideration some method of altering the parliamentary system of reporting, so as to adopt a similar practice to that followed in South Australia, where the parliamentary debates are published by arrangement with the daily press? This would greatly enhance the value of the reports, and lead to a wider knowledge of political affairs in the Commonwealth, with corresponding benefits to the people and to members. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [3.11] - The suggestion of the honourable member for Gippsland would be all righ t if we had a reporting staff in each State, but, unfortunately, the Melbourne papers would have the whole contract, and they do not circulate all over Australia.",37

Division 11 (Prime Minister), £42,003.",38
238,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Barrier) [3.21] - A few days ago the honourable member for Grey asked the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether a caretaker in his Department had had his salary lowered by 7d. a day; and, though the Minister at first said that this was not the case, on a subsequent day he admitted having unr intentionally made a mistake, and said that he found the reduction had been made because the Public Service Corninissioner claimed that under the Public Service Act no temporary hand could receive more in salary than a permanent officer doing the same work. I am not anxious to raise the question of the reduction of this individual salary. I wish to raise a matter of principle. We are entitled to know the intentions of the Government in regard to the payment of temporary hands. The late Government framed a regulation that temporary or casual hands employed by Government Departments must receive the union rate of wages, or wages fixed by an arbitration award, and I am sure that the Prime Minister, unless he has very considerably altered his views, will be prepared to adone mit that any one employed by a Department casually should receive the wages fixed by an arbitration award, or the union rate of wages. However, the Public Service Commissioner pointed out that there was a provision in the Public Service Act providing that a temporaryhand must not receive more than a permanent hand doing the same work. We claimed that the concessions granted to the permanent hands should also he taken into consideration, just as a Judge in an Arbitration Court, when dealing with wages, always takes into consideration the fact whether a man is likely to get permanent work or merely casual work. For instance, when wharf labourers appear before an Arbitration Court they make a strong point of the fact that they should receive a higher rate per hour because they cannot secure continuous employment. If a wharf labourer were paid the same wage per hour as an ordinary labourer gets, he would have very little at the end of a week; in fact, although wharf labourers are paid per hour considerably more than a number of labourers in other industries are paid per hour, the weekly average earned by wharf labourers is not more than £2 per week. In the same way we pointed out to the Public Service Commissioner that it was a fair and legitimate thing that, in fixing the wages for casual and temporary hands, the concessions granted to permanent hands should be taken into consideration, and we laid it down that if any person employed by the Government enjoyed all the concessions, in the shape of leave granted to the permanent hands, he had no right to ask anything more for similar work than the permanent hand received, but that if he did not get these concessions it was not a fair thing that he should get exactly the same pay. I am anxious to learn what is the policy of the present Government in the matter.",38
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Our policy is merely to carry out the Act at present, seeing that we cannot alter it.",39
240,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"If the Ministry take that stand, they will not be able to employ trade unionists. It will practically mean, not only that they are going to say that they will not give preference to unionists, but also that they are going to givfl absolute preference to non-unionists.",39
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We do not desire tr. do that.,39
242,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Le t me explain the position. In connection with Government work a number of carpenters are employed temporarily. There are also permanent carpenters employed in some of the Departments, who are not necessarily paid the union rate of wage. Having entered the service a number of years ago they will remain in Government employ until they are sixty-five years of age. Each year they will enjoy three weeks* holiday, and they will be allowed six months' holiday after twenty years' service. The Public Service Commissioner takes these things into consideration in fixing their salaries. The carpenters outside the Public Service appeal to the Arbitration Court, and get their salaries fixed, not on the basis of permanent work, and not with consideration to the three weeks' annual holiday or the six months' long-service leave. In these circumstances, it is more than probable that their wages will be 6d., 9d., or Is. per day more than those received by carpenters permanently employed in the Department. That is why I say that if it is the intention of the Government to carry out the idea of the Public Service Commissioner, they will not be able to employ trade union carpenters, unless they pay them union or current rates of wages, or the wages fixed under an arbitratio» award.",39
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We must carry out the law.,39
244,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"For three years the Fisher Administration did what I think this Government should do, notwithstanding the Public Service Act.",39
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The reply given to the question referred to related to a particular case. Are there any more in the same category?,39
246,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The question related to a particular individual, the reply being that, under the Public Service Act, a temporary employee could not receive more than a permanent employee.",39
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is this man still in the Service?,39
248,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Probably .,39
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If he has been there long, why is he a temporary employee ?",39
250,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Temporar y and casual employees are on a different footing from permanent employees. However long they may have been in the Service, they may be dismissed at a moment's notice, while permanent men can only be suspended, and may appeal to a Board. I do not wish to raise the case of a particular indidivisions^-professional vidual; it is the principle with which am concerned. A carpenter who is not being paid the union rate of wage cannot remain a member of his union. The last Government got over the difficulty, with in the general division. the consent of the Public Service Commisthis sioner, by not giving to casual and porary men the holidays and other conhave cessions enjoyed by the permanent men, and allowing them extra pay, which made up the Wages Board award. If this Gohim vernment cannot do that, they are carryto ing non-preference to unionists to logical conclusion-that is, preference non-unionists. They may reduce the wages of office cleaners by 7d. a day, they cannot act in the same way towards carpenters, because the latter belong to strong unioD.",39

Coming to the point raised by the honourable mema ber for Barrier, I wish to say that I gave these cleaners 9s. per day because I claim having regard to the cost of living, no one can live on less than such a wage. I gave them that wage, not because they were in a union- I do not think that there in is a cleaners' union-bu t because I regarded the rate as a standard one. These poor cleaners have since had their wages What meanness !

294,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I shall call them statements that were deliberately correct.  order, is the honourable member allowed, under cover of a personal explanation, to make an attack in such unparliamenit. tary language on another honourable memtisement ber ?",43
295,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable memfuture, ber, in speaking on the motion for the adjournment of the House, is enthey titled to go further than he could i he were making a personal explanation in the ordinary course of business. At the same time, I must ask the honourable member to refrain from using language personally offensive to other honourable members.",43
296,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member for New England was not at all caref u l about any remarks he made, or any innuendoes he tried to put forward, i u his supposedly clever way. He does not know the difference between making a personal explanation and speaking on the adjournment of the House, which again shows that the cleverness on which he prides himself does not exist. He was making statements during the State election that were not correct, and, in order to remove any effect that they might have, I took occasion to refer to him in a good deal milder language than he was using. If he gets on a platform and alleges that a State Government have been wasting £4,000,000 on Socialistic experiments, when the real facts show that the amount spent was £290,000, we must come to the conclusion that he is uterly irresponsible, and has little or no regard for facts. I felt it necessary, not only to contradict his assertions by putting the facts before the people, but also to show them the irresponsible authority from whom the assertions emanated. I certainly had a right to do so in fighting for my party and their interests in the manner I thought best. Of course, the honourable member squeals when he receives a little b it of a punch, but he does in not mind getting on a platform in the up country and attacking men who are not there to defend themselves, regardless of the obligations imposed upon him by the h f u l responsible position he holds. I do not want to be bad friends with the honourable member, but I must say that I believe he gets a newspaper, which is alto be considerably subsidized by to publish every word he speaks here, and that he religiously sends along to it every little question that he asks. inI suppose he has been looking for another paragraph by making a personal explanation this morning, and that this will appear, word for word, in the Guardian-whoeve r takes any notice of He is quite welcome to any adverhe gets out of it . The honourable member will be very careful in I think, in making electioneering speeches, not to treat the public as if were a lot of gulls who will believe f any statement that he might make, irrespective of its correctness or otherwise.  [4.8] - The honourable member for Gwydir has adopted rather an offensive tone",43
297,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,What did the honourable member do this morning?  galah cannot keep quiet.,44
298,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"As a matter of taste, that remark is very offensive, but we will put it down to the honourable member's ignorance.  desire on my part, this matter has taken rather a personal turn. I quoted from a newspaper, and could have quoted a number of newspapers, word for word, and have also taken the trouble to find out whether the statements could be verified, but the honourable member has not been able to show in one particular where that newspaper report is incorrect. being so, I must assume that the statement. I read here is absolutely correct, and that the honourable member used the words attributed to him. - Mr Webster - I do not deny words. Unfortunately, they are true.  will shorten the remarks I have to make. It strikes me, as a new member, that there is a certain code of honour which should apply in politics as well as out of them; and people, in making statements publicly, are in duty bound to get as near to the truth as they possibly can. The question is whether the honourable member was justified in making the statement he did; whether I , as a new member, have taken no interest in the proceedings of the House, and have really not represented the electors of New England since I was returned. can safely say that since I have been here I have not taken up much of the time of the Hansard reporters. But I have heard such a flood of eloquence from honourable members on the other side of the chamber, including the honourable member for Gwydir, that little opportunity was presented to me to make myself heard. I have endeavoured to attend to my duties here; I have shown that the statements made by the honourable member for Gwydir in my electorate were absolutely without foundation, and were really spoken for political purposes, and to further political ends, and now that the honourable member admits that he was correctly reported in the press, I think I have satisfied my electorate that during the last six months I have endeavoured to do my duty by them in this House.",44
299,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan-Trea surer) [4.12] - I wish to place on the table of the Library papers in connection with the Ordnance Stores. The report I have is from the Auditor-General, and it shows that the deficiency is not so serious as it would appear. With re^ference to the question submitted by the honourable member for Melbourne, as to the municipal ratings in the Australian capitals and ratings for similar services in London, Dublin, and Edinburgh, I think it is advisable to place before honourable members a copy of a further communication from the Government Statistician, explanatory of the replies which have already been furnished. Mr. Knibbs writesI t was explained in the covering memorandum, That sent with the statement forwarded to the Treasury on the 27th November for reply to questions asked by Dr Maloney, that comparisons drawn from the figures were subject to the limitation that they did not refer to the same matters, inasmuch as in some of the cities services which the were carried on by the municipalities themselves were in others intrusted to various boards, such as Water and Sewerage Boards, &c. The ratings as given were those specified in the local government portion of the various State Statistical Registers, and referred to city corporations. The most serious thing in giving the return to Parliament was the omission of the following remarks, viz. :- "" The details given refer to city corporations alone. Any comparisons made of them are, of course, subject to the disability that they do not all relate to the same items, i.e., services which in some cases - are performed by the municipalities are in others looked after by special boards, e.g., water and sewerage, & c . ' Whoever handed you the matter for reply should have incorporated those qualifying remarks, and to leave them out was, in my judgment, a mistake. One of the principal difficulties in the way of I preparing a strictly comparable return of this nature lies in the fact that differently constituted bodies control the rating for various purposes and different States and countries, and, in addition, the rates are levied on different bases. Thus, for example, in the case of Melbourne, the City Council imposes a rate of is. in the £ 1 for the construction and maintenance of roads, streets, bridges, culverts, & c , and a rate of 3d. in the £ 1 for public lighting, while the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, a federation of metropolitan municipalities, imposes a rate of is. 8d. in the £ 1 in respect of water supply and sewerage, in addition to meter rentals aud excess water charges. In Perth, on the other'hand, the City Council levies a general rate of is. 66. and a loan rate of gd., whilst the rates in respect of water supply, sewerage, and storm water are levied by«a Government Department-the Water Supply, Sewerage, and Drainage Department-and are consequently not municipal rates at all . A further complication arises from the fact that in gome cases the rates are levied on an assessed annual value, and in others on an unimproved capital value, the Sydney City Council employing the two systems in conjunction. A further point may be mentioned, viz., that the general rate varies considerably, even in contiguous municipalities. Thus, whilst in the city of Melbourne the general and lighting rates aggregate only is. 3d. in the £ 1 , in some ^of the neighbouring municipalities the corresponding rates are quite as great.",44
300,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Yarra) [4.13] - Is it not extraordinary for a Minister to place on the table of this House documents which are intended to be laid on the table of the Library? Once they are here they are the property of the House.,45
301,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The papers connection with the Ordnance Stores are to be laid on the table of the Library.,45
302,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I am not particular where they are laid. I was merely pointing out the extraordinary procedure of placing papers on the table of the House when they are really not intended to remain here. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.14 p.m. in,45
