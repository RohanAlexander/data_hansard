1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. PRESENTATION OF ADDRESSES.",19
2,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I wish to ask you a question, Mr Speaker, in reference to a paragraph that appeared in today's press relative to the presentation of an address to the Prince of Wales, on behalf of Parliament, by the Presiding Officer of another, branch of the Legislature. Will you kindly inform the House if any precedent exists under which the Presiding Officer of the Senate can act as the mouthpiece of this Chamber ? What is the usual procedure followed in the presentation of addresses by Parliament to the King or his representative?",19
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I knewnothing of the matter to which the honourable member refers until I saw the paragraph in a morning newspaper, but I have since had an interview with the President concerning it, from which I have learned that some proposal of the kind referred to is in contemplation. I Wish to say that neither the Presiding Officer of the other Chamber nor any other authority, except the Speaker of this Chamber, can act as the mouth-piece of this House. No other authority can claim to speak on behalf of this branch of the Legislature. The procedure followed in the presentation of addresses to the King or his representative has bean that each House has, on motion, adopted the address, which has then been presented to the representative of the Crown by the Presiding Officer of each House respectively. The last occasion on which Parliament presented an address to the Crown was after the capitulation of Germany and the virtual termination of the war, when each House adopted an address of ' congratulation to His Majesty the King, and the addresses wore presented by the Presiding Officers of the respective Chambers, namely, by the President for the Senate, and by me, as Speaker, for this House, on ground common to both Houses; on that occasion it was on the steps in front to this building. On all other occasions when addresses have been presented to the King's represcntativo, they have been presented, so far as I can learn, by the Presiding Officer of each Chamber on behalf of the branch of the Legislature over which he presides. The Speaker is the official medium of communication between the House of Representatives and the Crown. WOOL CLIP.",19
4,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister if the statement which appeared in the press the other day, indicating possible new proposals for dealing with the forthcoming wool clip, accurately represent his intentions and those of the Government?",20
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I did not read it through, and therefore I am unable to answer the question positively, but seeing that the. proposals were presented in a very condensed form, it is highly improbable that it does. I noted that certain things which in my view are material were omitted. However, I shall look at the report again, and see whether it may be said to accurately Teflect my opinions. It does not, and cannot be said the opinions of the Government, because it was not intended to do so.",20
6,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"In view of the cabled announcement of astonishment from overseas, and the false light in which what must be regarded as premature proposals in connection with the wool clip appear, and also to prevent the Australian wool growers being put into a false position, will the Prime Minister take steps to cable that the proposals are not those of the Australian Government?",20
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Unti l I know what proposals the honourable member alludes to-and I am not at all sure that he knows what proposals have been put forward- I can hardly refute any statement that has been imade, and I certainly do not propose to embarrass the wool-growers of Australia, or. this Government, by having cable communication with the British Government over a matter that does not concern it. Our 1920-21 wool clip is the property of the growers of Australia, and the British Government have no more to do with it than the. French or the American Government. TREATY WITHJAPAN .",20
8,Mr WEST,Unknown,"The following paragraph appeared in this morning's ArgusANGLO-JAPANESE ALLIANCE. AUSTRALIA'S ADVICE TO BE SOUGHT. The United Press correspondent in Washington says that the advice of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada will be sought before Great Britain renews her alliance with Japan. He adds that the renewal of the alliance is considered certain. Before any alliance is renewed, or made with other Governments or nations, will Parliament be informed of its terms and conditions, or are these treaties to be regarded' as secret documents ?",20
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The honourable member, in the most loose and casual way, asks me a question on a matter of vital importance affecting the fate of nations. Possibly, ho may express surprise when I say that I am not prepared to answer his question on the spur of the moment any more than I would be able to explain offhand some of the passages in Genesis or Leviticus. OVERSEAS MALLS.",20
10,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"the Postmasterto, set out General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that serious inconvenience and loss are suffered by the mercantile community and others in the Commonwealth through the very unsatisfactory oversea postal mail conditions? 2. Will he cause suitable mail contracts to> be arranged with the oversea steam-ship companies at as early a date aa possible, and thus secure a suitable mail service between at' least Great, Britain and the Commonwealth?",20
11,Mr WISE,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Complaints have been made to the Department regarding the present unsatisfactory overseas mail service, which is one of the results of the war. 2. Prior to the war, the service was carried out weekly hy steamers of the Peninsular and Oriental Company and the Orient Line, under contracts with the British and Commonwealth Governments respectively. These contracts were interrupted by the war, and I have been unable to ascertain definitely when the Peninsular and Oriental steamers (under contract with the British Government), which were withdrawn altogether from the Australian service, will take up that service regularly, but I understand that the company hopes to resume monthly running to Australia from July, 1920. The Orient contract, which does not expire until 17th September, 1921, is being carried out as far as possible with the reduced number of steamers available, and action is proceeding on the question of arranging a fresh contract on its expiration. MILITARY OFFICERS. RETIRING ALLOWANCES.",20
12,Mr MARR,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice 1. Whether, upon the recent retirement of Generals Lee and Parnell and Colonel Holman from the Militar y Forces, any retiring allowance was made or special leave granted? 2. If so, what amount?",21
13,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"The follow:answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:' 1. These officers, on retirement, arc eligible for a sum equivalent to six months' pay in lieu of furlough, under Australian Militar y Regulation 407. In addition, the Government has approved of the payment of special grants, according to the service of the officer concerned. 2. The amounts payable are:- under Major General G. L.

14,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Whether the rates of pay awarded to the letter-carriers and assistants in the Naval Branch in the capital cities have been extended to theemployees in the country and suburban post-offices ? 2. If not, will he apply the provisions of the award to such employees?",21
15,Mr WISE,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes, so far as postmen are concerned; but country and suburban assistants come under the provisions of other awards made by the Court on 9th A p r i l, 1920, which will come into operation as from 20th April, 1920, if Parliament does not disapprove of such awards before 5th June, 1920. 2. Sec answer to No. 1. WAR GRATUITY.",21
16,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"the Acting Treasurer, upon notice I. Re applications for the war gratuity, will the Minister appoint officers in the Department of Defence to assist the applicants in such applications ? 2. In order to make such applications easier for the unfortunate dependants, will he arrange that one signature instead of six be sufficient on such applications?",21
17,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as 1. This has already been done. 2. The application forms were designed after careful consideration, to afford security both to the person entitled to the gratuity and to the Government. None of the requirements can be relaxed in respect of the applications referred to. TRAVELLIN G POST-OFFICES. Payment Mr LAVELLE asked the PostmasterSpecial Total. General, upon noticeA.M.ll. 407.

19,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"the Minister in Charge of Shipbuilding, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that the design and plans for the 12,500-ton ships to be built by the Commonwealth in Australia have been found to have been most unsuitable, and that ships built on such design would prove to bo most unseaworthy and dangerous? 2. If so (a) who was responsible for the design and plans j (6) what was the total cost of preparing the design and plans?  honourable member's questions are as follow :1. No. 2. See answer to Nc. 1.

24,Mr MAKIN,DECLINE IN WHEAT,"the P r i m e M in ister, upon not i c e 1. Whether the Commonwealth Government has received any payment from the Government of South Australia for the coaling gantries at Port Pirie? 2. If so, for what reason?",22
25,Mr HUGHES,DECLINE IN WHEAT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No. 2. For the reason that the South Australian Government are not prepared to make any payment without reference to the State Parliament, which reference, the Premier intimates, will be considered in connection with the legislation to be introduced next session. ROYAL VISIT . PAYMENT FOB HOLIDAYS .",22
26,Mr MAHON Y,DECLINE IN WHEAT,"the Minister for the Navy, upon notice I. Will he see that all employees in the Naval establishments are paid for holidays during the visit of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales ? 2. If it is not the intention to pay for such holidays, will the Minister allow all employees who desire to do so to remain at work during the holidays, so that they may not lose their pay?",22
27,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DECLINE IN WHEAT,"I can give only a general answer to this question. We are arranging the matter as far as possible in association with the two States chiefly concerned, and I hope that the result will be that we shall be generous. Precisely what we shall do I do not at present know. SOLDIERS' HMS, SOUTH AUSTRALIA. senting the. Minister for Repatriation, upon notice I. Has the State Bank, South Australia, been able to meet at once the urgent need of soldiers making requests for homes? 2. Has the Commonwealth Department supplied homes to men who were unable to get them through the State Bank? 3. Will the State Bank have to enlarge its staff if they take over the matter of Commonwealth Homes? 4. What number of homes have been allotted, and what number of contracts are now let by y of the the Commoiiwoaltli department? 5. Are there any indications that the State Bank could have provided these in addition to their own work?  has supplied the f o l l o w i ng answers: 1. Apparently not, as 893 applications to the 3rd May had been received for advances under the War Service Homes Act. 2. Under the State Housing Scheme applicants receiving a salary of over £300 per annum are not eligible for an advance. Under the War Service Homes Act advances are made irrespective of the salary received by the applicant. The information desired by the honourable member could not bo supplied without interrogating ""each applicant, but it is reasonable to assume that there are many returned soldiers in South Australia receiving a salary of over £300 per annum who would be ineligible under the State Housing Scheme.' 3. Yes, if the applications are to be dealt with without delay. 4. To the 3rd May in South Australia 234 homes had been allotted to applicants, and, in addition, 26 were in course of construction, 75 contracts had been let, and tenders had been called for 24 others. 5. See answer to No. 1. DEPORTATION OE ITALIANS .",22
28,Mr LISTER,DECLINE IN WHEAT,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the Government is aware that there is great unrest among the Italian community in Australia owing to the persistent statements made that the Commonwealth Government acted without any authority in deporting Italians for military service in Italy? 2. Is the Government aware that statements have been repeatedly made that the Italian Government never made any request to the Australian Government prior to the Italian reservists being called up for military service or being deported abroad? 3. Will the Minister prepare for public information a summary of the position and policy of the Italian Government and the Australian Government in calling up and deporting Italian reservists, and showing what action was taken thereon in Australia for the calling up of the military reservists for service in Italy? 4. Was the action taken by the Italian and the Commonwealth Governments legal under the circumstances?",23
29,Mr HUGHES,DECLINE IN WHEAT,"The answers to the 1,037. honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No. 2. No. 3. Yes, a statement will be laid on the of the House. 4. All action taken by the Commonwealth Government was in accordance with the law. I am not in a position to answer the question in so far as it affects the Italian Government and the laws of Italy . PUBLIO SERVICE. SOLDIER EMPLOYEES : RESIGNATIONS : TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES.",23
30,Mr CHARLTON,DECLINE IN WHEAT,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Whether a modified examination was promised ' to enable soldier employees, on their return from the war, to enter the clerical branch of the Public Service? 2. If so, how many examinations have been held, and what are the dates of such examinations ? 3. Will he consider the advisability of admitting such employees to the clerical branch without examination if they have shown by practical work that they are qualified?",23
31,Mr WISE,DECLINE IN WHEAT,"The Acting Public Service Commissioner has furnished the following information:1. No promise was given, but modified examinations are arranged for the appointment of returned soldiers to the Clerical Division. 2.. Examinations were held in April, 191S; May and August, 1919; and further examinations are to take place in June and August next. 3. The Public Service Act does not admit of appointments being made to the Clerical Division without examination. In view of the relaxed conditions attaching to the examinations for returned soldiers, it is not considered that provision to dispense with the examination is required.",23
32,Mr BLAKELEY,DECLINE IN WHEAT,"the Prime Minister , upon notice- 1. Whether he will procure a return of the number of resignations from the Commonwealth Public Service for the years 1918 and 1919 and the quarter ending 31st March, 1920? 2. Also a return showing the resignations for each quarter of the years mentioned above?",23
33,Mr HUGHES,DECLINE IN WHEAT,"Publi c Service statistics are compiled for financial years. The number of resignations for 1917-18 was 658; for 1918-19, 936; and for the nine months, July, 1919, to March, 1920, - Mr TUDOR asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Does he still adhere to the views expressed table by him in Sydney on the ISth February last that the temporary employees in the Commonwealth Public Service in New South Wales should at least be paid the minimum of £3 17s. per week recently fixed by the New South Wales Board of Trade? 2. If so, will be instruct the Public Service Commissioner and the Minister for Defence to give effect to this forthwith?",23
34,Mr HUGHES,DECLINE IN WHEAT,"As I indicated yesterday, in reply to a question by the honourable member for Nepean, Commonwealth employees in New South Wales are paid under Federal Public Service awards. The Deputy President of theArbitration Court, on 9th April, 1920, fixed the basic wage for the Commonwealth at £3 10s. per week, and this is being paid from 26th A p r i l . The adoption of State rates would involve differential Federal rates, which is not desirable or practicable. GEELO NG WOOLLENMILLS . DUPLICATION OF PLANT .",23
35,Mr LISTER,DECLINE IN WHEAT,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. In order to cope with the ever increasing demand of the public for Australian manufactured cloth, whether the Government has made any move in the direction of duplicating the existing plant at the Commonwealth Woollen M i ls at North Geelong? 2. If so, when is the work to be commenced, and when completed what is estimated will be the increased capacity? Sir . GRANVILLE RYRIE - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The Government has approved of additions to existing plant and machinery which will enable the present output to be doubled, to be placed on next Estimates for parliamentary approval. 2. Details of the additional plant required are in course of preparation, with a view to orders being placed as soon as possible. When the additional plant is installed it is /expected that the capacity of the mill will be an output of about 1,200,000 yards per annum. NA EUROPE.",24
36,Mr MARR,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether, in view of the reported arrival at Fremantle of Mr Louis Sinclair, honorary secretary of the Commercial Committees of the Allied Parliaments of Europe, he has any official knowledge of this gentleman and his mission to Australia?",24

In Committee (Consideration of Senate's message): Alternative amendment disagreed to by the Senate:47A. (1) The Commission shall, subject to the approval of the Minister, have power to assist soldiers by way of loan to the extent of one pound for one pound contributed by them in cash or war bonds for the purpose ' of establishing industries on a cooperative basis, such industries to include the manufacture of boots, woollen goods, and clothing, tanning, wool-scouring, fellmongering (and kindred industries), sawmilling and other enterprises. (2) The regulations may prescribe the conditions upon which any loan granted in pursuance of this section shall be repayable.  Home and Territories) [2.52] - After extended consideration of the position created by the attitude of the Senate in regard to the alternative amendment of this House, dealing with advances to returned soldiers for the purpose of establishing industries on a co-operative basis, to which the Senate has disagreed and with a view to reaching finality on the matter-becaus e we are anxious that the advantages given by the Bill shall be extended .to those who are to participate in them-the Government have decided to ask honourable members not to insist on this amendment, but to substitute another amendment, and submit it to the Senate for acceptance. Therefore, I move That the alternative amendment to amendment No. 30, disagreed to by the Senate, be not insisted on, but that, in place thereof, the following clause be inserted in the Bill : 47A. (1) The Commission shall, subject to the approval of the Minister, have power to assist Australian soldiers by way of loan, to an extent not exceeding one pound for each one pound contributed by them in Treasury bonds issued under section 13 of the War Gratuity Act 1920, or in cash, for the purpose of establishing co-operative businesses. (2; The amount of any loan granted in pursuance of this section shall not exceed £150 and shall bear interest at such rate as the Commission determines. (3) The aggregate amount of loans granted in pursuance of this section shall not exceed £250,000. (4) An Australian soldier who has a share or interest in a business in respect of which a loan has been granted in pursuance of this section shall not transfer his share or interest(o) unless the transferee is an Austra- lian soldier approved by the Commission, or (6.) where the transferee is not an Australian soldier, unless, in the opinion of the Commission, there are special circumstances which render the transfer desirable. (5) No person shall, without the consent of the Commission, enter into a mortgage, or give any lien, over the property of a business in respect of which a loan has been granted in pursuance of this section, and any mortgage or lien entered into or given in contravention of this subsection shall be void and of no effect. (6) The' Commission, .or any person thereto authorized by the Commission, shall at all times have access to, and may inspect, the books and premises of any business in respect of which a loan has been granted in pursuance of this section, and if, upon such inspection, the Commission considers that the business is being conducted in such a manner(a) as to depreciate the security of the Commission for the moneys lent by it ; or (6) as to prejudice the interests of the shareholders of the business, the Commission may require such alteration in the control or conduct of the business as it thinks desirable. (7) Notwithstanding anything in this section a loan shall not be. granted for the establishment of a co-operative business(a) unless application for the loan is received by the Commission within twelve months after the commencement of this Act or the discharge of the applicants from the Forces, whichever last happens; (&) unless the applicants satisfy the Commission that they are qualified to carry on that business; (c) unless the agreement, deed or articles of association entered by the applicants is approved by the Commission; and (d) if, in the opinion of the Commission, the applicants have been satisfactorily established in civil life. (8) For the purposes of this section "" co-operative business "" means a business which, subject to the rights of the Commission in respect of any loans granted for establishing the business, is owned by persons engaged therein. (9) The regulations may prescribe the conditions upon which loans may be granted in pursuance of this section and the conditions upon which such loans shall be repayable. Tliat is an honest attempt to have businesses established by returned soldiers on cooperative lines, and it wil l be perfectly safe from the point of view of the taxpayers generally. The original proposition of the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , and that of the ""honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) were somewhat loosely drawn, and the Government felt that it was necessary either to elaborate the provision on the lines of the present proposal or to bring down a special Bill for the purpose. , Mr HIGGS -- AB ill would have been better.  much detail has been required in this new alternative amendment. There is not the slightest hope of our coming to an amicable arrangement with the Senate for the acceptance of our other proposal, and the only alternative is to send forward this new proposal or drop the Bill altogether, thus depriving those who are to participate in its extended benefits of the advantages it gives. There is no doubt it is a much more liberal measure than the Act on the statute-book today.",24
38,Mr JAMES PAGE,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,Senator s do not seem to care whether the Bill is lost or not. Let us put the onus on them.  easy matter. We have responsibilities here.,25
39,Mr MCDONALD,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"They have responsibilities also.  create f r i c t i o n between the two Houses on those lines. Some honourable senators are opposed to the proposition right out, but from what I can gather from reading the Hansard report of the Senate's proceedings, the principal objection to our into proposal was because of the loose way in which it was drafted. All cause for objection on that ground is removed by the new proposal, because it imposes fairly stringent conditions. As custodians of the public purse, it is the duty of this House, as well as of the Senate, to see that legislation of this character is so drafted as to adequately protect the Commonwealth revenue and provide no opportunities for abuse.",25
40,Mr JOWETT,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"In view of the very great importance of this amendment, which has only come under the notice of honourable members during the last few moments', I ask the Minister to report progress.",25
41,Mr HIGGS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Capricornia) [ 3 . 2 ] sincerely regret that the Minister has not given the Committee more opportunity to consider these oroposals. I take very grave exception to his suggestion that my amendment was loosely drawn. was most carefully drafted, and the addition of the last paragraph, at the request of the Minister, providing that regulations mi<dit prescribe the conditions under which any loan should be repayable, made the clause almost perfect.",26
42,Mr WEST,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,W as it not drawn by the draftsman ?,26
43,Mr HIGGS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"No ; but it was submitted to the draftsman. Reading hurriedly the first portion of the amendment which the' Minister has just placed before the Committee, it would appear that the Government propose to grant not more than £ 1 50 in any one loan.",26
44,Mr RODGERS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,That is in . conformity with the regulations under the existing Act. ,26
45,Mr HIGGS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Of what advantage would such a loan be in carrying out the desires of the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , whose original amendment was designed to encourage co-operative enterprises in saw-milling, boot making, and other industries.",26
46,Mr RODGERS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,The limitation to £150 applies only to individual soldiers.,26
47,Mr HIGGS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"The proposed new work today. alternative does not say that, thus cating how loosely it has been drafted. 18,000 are receiving sustenance. If the amendment does mean that £150 may be given to each soldier gaged in a co-operative enterprise, how far will the £250,000 go ?  vide an opportunity of seeing how the re-established scheme will work.",26
48,Mr HIGGS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I ask the indulgencs of the Committee while I read the followfactory ing letter sent to me by Mr George Lawson, the Honorary Secretary of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, Brisbane branch:At a largely attended meeting, comprising returned sisters, sailors, and soldiers, held Friday last, I was directed to forward to the following resolution, which was carried unanimously :"" That this meeting of returned sisters, sailors, and soldiers urges the Federal Gogive effect to this scheme. vernment to support the proposal whereby the Government will subsidize the soldiers' operative scheme, either by assisting on the basis of £1 for £1, as outlined by Mr Higgs, - I M.H.R., or by making advances to returned soldiers for investment in co-operative enterprises. This meeting is of opinion that a successful co-operative scheme will do much to solve the present high cost of living, and to foster Australian industries."" It I commend the foregoing resolution for your kind co-operation, and trust that you may lie ' successful in placing this concession on the statute-book. I do not desire to delay the passage of this Bill . It should be put into operation as soon as possible. But I fear that the alternative proposal suggested by the Minister can only lead to delay. I am satisfied that honourable members will not accept the amendment in its present loosely drawn state, for the reason that there is a doubt as to whether the £150 is to be granted to each individual or to each group.  that.",26
49,Mr HIGGS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"If there is something to be rectified in the Minister's amendment, why did he cast reflections on the drafting of my amendment? Here is another difficulty. Sub-clause 7 readsNotwithstanding anything in this section, a loan shall not be granted for the establishment of a co-operative business(fi) If in the opinion of the Commission, the applicants have been satisfactorily established in civil life. Probably over 200,0.00 soldiers are at I understand that of indiall who have returned only about The great majority of the returned men are enengaged in the factories, workshops, mines, or other places of employment. I suppose that most of them are, in the of the Department, satisfactorily in civil life. Therefore, if the Minister can prove that "" D i g g e r "" Jones has been working at, say, Bedggood's for over six months, that man will be considered satisfactorily re-established in civil life, and he will not be entitled to any loan. The very men who might make a success of the co-operative scheme are probably those men who have been on already re-absorbed in civil life. I sugyou gest, and I will vote accordingly, that the Minister should withdraw his alternative amendment, and bring in a Bill to If the proposal is to be placed on a proper basis, it co- .ought to be introduced in the form of a Bill , so that the' clauses may be properly drafted to insure a practicable scheme in which the interests of both the Commonwealth and the returned soldiers will be properly safeguarded.",26
50,Mr FENTON,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Maribyrnong) [3.10] After only a cursory glance at the proposition submitted :by the Government, a number of difficulties have been discovered. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) has pointed to several mistakes, which the Minister, of course, has readily promised to rectify; but if mistakes can be found in this proposition after a mere cursory glance at it, it is probable that mature consideration would disclose many more. The suggestion that this scheme should be withdrawn from the Bill and embodied in a separate measure is one to which I shall not agree unless I have an assurance from the Minister as to the approximate date on which the new measure will be introduced. It seems to me that this new alternative scheme has been drafted at the behest of the leaders of the Senate, who are not the custodians of the public purse, and in such a form as to place almost insuperable difficulties in the way of returned soldiers CI£ILLS 6 ^ who desire to become their own masters. It would exclude from the operation of the system applicants who, in the opinion of the Commission, had been satisfactorily settled in civil life. A concrete instance of the injustice which this would work is to he found in the statement made a few days ago by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart). The honourable member stated that he saw a number of returned soldiers doing the major work of a saw-milling business at a railway siding, and was told by them that the only reason why they did not start for themselves was that they had not the necessary capital. With a little assistance from the Government they would be able to start for themselves; but, under this alternative proposal, they would he regarded as 'having been "" satisfactorily settled in civil life."" These are the very class of men we want to reach. They would probably become leaders of others, and would be responsible for the industrial salvation of quite a number.

The idea of the honourable member for Capricornia, as originally proposed, is retained in this alternative proposition. All that it is proposed to do is to frame a set of workable conditions under which that idea can be carried into effect.",27

55,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"That is precisely what the Committee objected to. The Committee said that it desired to know exactly what was proposed to be done. Here is an effort to satisfy the Committee, and yet it meets with objection. I hope we shall get back to the consideration of this matter on reasonable lines.",27

60,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I propose, if I may, to deal with that matter. It is time that something was said of the finances of the Commonwealth. The House itself seems to me to be getting into an irresponsible mood regarding finance. We have ever so many economy propositions, yet every 'day I hear from all round the. House suggestions, the carrying out of which would involve an expenditure of millions of pounds. And these suggestions come - from the very men who are most clamant for economy. I would remind the Committee that the financial outlook is very serious.",27
61,Mr MCDONALD,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Why did not the ister say so at the outset, instead of coming down with this alternative scheme?",28
62,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I am saying so, and this further amendment says so in the plainest terms. It says in effect that there is a l i m it to which we can go, even in connection with so desirable an objective as the repatriation of our soldiers. The Government would' like to go quite as far as would any honourable member in that direction. This S ill is not necessarily a law of the Medes and Persians. It can develop just as the whole scheme of repatriation has done. represents a stage in the evolution of the scheme. As experience shows more and more to be necessary, more and more can be done. The Bill imposes upon us quite enough financial obligations for the im mediate outlook, and these limitations are imposed so that we may know exactly what we are facing. That is necessary in the interests of the financial position of the country.",28
63,Mr FENTON,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,The best way to relieve the financial rjosition is to produce more.,28
64,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I am perfectly certain that my honourable friend, sitting just where he is, could cause millions to come out of the ground instanter. I am quite unable to do that. I oould speak as the honourable member has done, but that would not give us the cash; it would not help us to face the liabilities outstanding at the present time. May I remind honourable members that the Bill as it stands is far more liberal than the soldiers themselves expected, a great deal more liberal than any promises that were made to themat the general elections, when a specific limitation was placed on the amount to be devoted to purposes of this Bill . cannot allow itself to be committed to an unlimited expenditure in regard to Bill , or any other. The financial look is too serious for that.",28
65,Mr HILL,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,Do you not think that limi t that has been fixed is too low?,28
66,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"No ; though if £7,000,000. it proved too low, proposals to increase could be made later. I ask my honourable friends to get this scheme into operation, and if it is proved that more money can be usefully and reproductively .spent on these lines, the Government can always be asked for it . The Bill is much more M in - liberal than was intended. According to the Prime Minister's pron/unciamiento to the country, the expenditure under it was to be £650,000, but the in crease in war pensions alone, for which it makes provision, will run into at least £1,250,000, and there are many other increases. We must pull up somewhere. Certain proposals may be justified on their abstract merits, and when regarded apart from their relation to the Bill as a whole; but I beg honourable members to consider what the measivre involves financially, and I ask them to say whether it does This Bill not make a generous contribution for the welfare of the soldiers. May I remind honourable members of a few of the commitments of this new Parliament? It may seem to some honourable gentlemen a small thing to ask for an increase here or there, but - if they ever have to find the money for the whole, they will experience great difficulty in doing so. 'The W a r Gratuity Bill will increase our interest expenditure next year 'by £1,500,000, and we shall want another £1,500,000 to meet other increases in interest on expenditure on behalf of soldiers or their dependants. In this Bill the war pensions are increased by £1,250,000; the slight increase that has been made in the old-age pensions will add £750,000 to the bill for next yeaT; and it looks as though the awards of the Courts would increase our expenditure by another £750,000. It is estimated, too, that the expenses of the Repatriation Department will run to another £1,000,000 next year.",28
67,Mr JAMES PAGE,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,But there is the the money that you will get through the The Government Customs House next year.,28
68,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"We shall need this it all, and a great deal more. I have outenumerated only four or five of the outstanding increases of expenditure. They the will magnify our expenditure for next year by between £6,000,000 and Then there is a clamour it for an increase in the postal expenditure. What that increase will be I cannot pretend to say. Again, the cost of running all the Departments will in crease, because of the rise in the price of materials, upkeep, and everything else that makes livin g more expensive. Will honourable members tell me where we are to get all the money that we shall need?",28
69,Dr MALONEY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Prom , the profiteer.",29
70,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"All we have been able to get from the profiteer this year is about £2,000,000.",29
71,Mr TUDOR,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"The honourable member is referring to the war-time profits tax, but that has ceased now.",29
72,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"It really lapses at ,the end of this year, but we shall get some revenue from it next year. Apparently next year our expenditure may be anything between £7,000,000 and £9,000,000 more than this year, and the increase will be due nearly entirely to the war and the consequent repatriation of the soldiers. Y e t I am told by honourable members that we should spend still more heavily. Dp not they §ee that our financial condition will nob permit us to do so? We must keep within our means and resources. No doubt were I in Opposition, I could criticise the P ill as effectively as its opponents are doing, because it is easy to criticise and to say that this and that should be done. But we have to make up our minds as to what is a fair thing under all - the circumstances, and having regard to the difficulty of getting the money that will be needed, I cannot regard proposals for expenditure as though they related to water-tight compartments. I have to consider them in relation to the finances generally; and our expenditure is mounting to a figure that is becoming appalling. This year, in connection with repatriation, we shall spend something over £8,000,000 on land settlement, £5,000,000 on housing, £500,000 on postal arrangements, and another £500,000 on advances to the States to provide employment.",29

76,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Well , it may be incorrect. I cannot tell the honourable member the exact amount now. The item given to me covers vocational training, sustenance, furniture, tools, medical treatment, and so forth , and runs into £4,700,000 for the year.  tenance",29
77,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Neve r mind sustenance-neve r mind details. The outlook for next year is £21,000,000 for those same purposes, and for war pensions next year our liability is between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000, and it is more likely to be nearer £7,000,000. I invite honourable members to keep these facts in mind when they so readily make proposals for expenditure of one kin d or another. We have to '' bring up "" somewhere-ther e is some l i m it - if we are to keep - within our compass and our means. I suggest strongly that today we are doing a fair and generous thing by 'these men. We cannot possibly do what honourable members suggest by the implications of their speeches. We cannot set every man up in business, or give him chances, other than his own calling affords. No country could afford to do that, and no country has attempted it . In these respects we have done more than any other country on the globe.",29
78,Dr MALONEY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,That is a question; the Australian insurance was a f r a u d in comparison with that in America.,29
79,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,There is no question about the matter.,29
80,Dr MALONEY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,I should like to see the data placed on the table.,29
81,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"There is no wants manner of doubt, in my judgment, and the honourable member will find that what I say is right. We have the prospect of having to raise, in addition to revenue, about £30,000,000 in fresh loan moneys during next year. Altogether, I tell honourable members the financial outlook is just as serious as it can be. Our revenue is coming in well, and our financial position is sound, but it requires careful handling. We can just as easily make a mess of things as not, unless we stiffen ourselves to meet the financial obligations which are peaking up at so rapid and acute a rate. This year we are coming to the apex; we have been steadily climbing up year by year, and today we are getting to the top. I therefore suggest to honourable members that they do not push their proposals any further, for we cannot afford to carry them out until we shape ourselves differently, and see what the outlook is likely to be in the near future. We have as big a load as we can conveniently carry, and I beg honourable members to accept the Bill as it is-to accept it as a fair and generous contribution on the lines promised at the elections and since. On the whole, it is a Bill and a proposal which I believe fair l y satisfies the soldiers as a whole. I - hope honourable members will do nothing today, or at any otlier time, to jeopardize our proposals or overload them in any unreasonable way, having regard to the obligations we have to face in the near future.",29

Under cover of asking honourable members to defeat the amendment that was carried by this House, he has delivered what is practically a semi-Budget speech; to quote his own words, the amendment has to be judged by the financial outlook. The honourable gentleman should have delivered that speech when the Bill was in troduced; he ought to have told us that the financial outlook is black, and that we have to pay all these millions for pensions, war service homes, and so forth . The Ministers of the two big spending Departments-Defenc e and Repatriation - are not in this House, the Ministers (Senator Mille n and Senator Pearce) both being members of another place. There they are gradually getting control of the spending of this money, and those two Departments spend more than the whole of the other Departments put together. The Treasurer (Mr W at t ) , in his Budget speech, showed that we are spending £7S,000,000 on war, up to the end of June, this year, an expenditure representing £1,500,000 a week.",30

I may say that I found the apI peal I did make to the men an effective to one. I agree with the Acting Treasurer that Australia has acted justly by the men who went to the Front, and I think, if we were to ask the average returned soldier, he would say that he has been fairly and well treated. This co-operaprotive movement is something over and had above anything that was promised, I believe, by any one to the soldiers before",31

I believe, with the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), that this proposal is so important and far-reaching in its consequences as to require the fact that a separate Bill .",31
102,Dr MALONEY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,That would mean much,31
103,Mr MAXWELL,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"It might mean de) , lay, but what is the delay of a few weeks or months in a great movement of this of kind? There is a new and great principle involved in this proposal-and we My experience of the House, so far, has been to that there is far too much impulsive Honourable members vote on instead of being given time for calm consideration so that their votes may be the expression of a mature formed by a well-informed mind. As I have not had time to read this new amendment, I cannot honestly vote upon the it, because my vote would mean nothing. I have not had time for consideration. One para. graph catches my' eye, the one to which did the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) has drawn attention, dealing with the classes of men to whom adIncluded them are men who in the opinion men of the Commission have been satisfacestablished in civil life. It all destandpends on what is meant by the words "" satisfactorily establislied in civil life."" A man whom I know has come hack from the Front after four and a half years' service, and instead of loafing on the Repatriation Department, as some men have done, and drawing sustenance for months, he, by his own endeavours, ' got a billet after drawing sustenance for three weeks only. However, at the end of six months, for some reason or other, his employment come to an end, and when he went to the Repatriation Department to see whether they could give him further assistance or not, they said to him, ""No, your case .has been dealt with."" Evidently the Repatriation Department consider that he has been satisfactorily established in civil life. That being the ease, a man most deserving of sharing in the benefits of the scheme now under consideration would be told by the Repatriation Commission, ""You have been satisfactorily established in civil life, and are not eligible to participate in these benefits."" To make matters worse, this man, who has a wife and four children, received notice from his landlord two or three days after he became unemployed, and was called upon to leave the house upon which he had been paying rent regularly for 3ix years. This is just one phase that occurs to me, but I certainly require time to consider the whole matter. I a.m sorry that, I am not able to respond to the appeal of the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Gook). I ask him now to respond to our appeal and give us a little more time for the consideration of the whole question.",31
104,Mr CHARLTON,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Hunter) [3.54] - I am in accord with the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) that this proposal should be left in our hands for a day or two in order to enable us to give it more consideration. I did not have the privilege of hearing the debates on this matter, and have not had the opportunity of learning what influenced this Chamber in deciding to assist in establishing returned soldiers in co-operative industries, but I think no better channel could be made available for them in regard to their future employment. From a cursory glance at the proposal before us, it appears to me that a returned soldier who ought to have a perfect right to participate in the benefits of the provision will.not be permitted to do so if he is now following his usual civil employment. There are dozens of returned soldiers whose cases have come under my notice, who have found, on resuming their usual occupation, that their health has been so impaired that they have not been able to earn what their fellow-employees can make, or what they were drawing before the war. They would like to get into businesses of their own, and I have had applications from them asking for assistance from the Repatriation Department to enable them to do so. If they sought assistance under the proposal before the Committee, very likely it would be held by the Repatriation Commission that these men would not be entitled to it, because they had been satisfactorily established in their usual occupations. The Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) says that honourable members ought to agree to this provision because of the position of the finances. We all know that the finances are not in a good position. We know, in fact, that it is getting worse, and that, as things are going, some day or other we may have financial chaos; but I cannot see in what way the argument of the Minister applies to the proposal before the Committee. He .invites us to agree to the amendment, and commit the country to an expenditure of £250,000, but I cannot see in what way it would add to the burden of the country if no limitation is placed on the classes of returned soldiers who may participate in the benefits given by the provision, so long as they are bond fide. I have heard the remark that there are some men who have not done quite the right thing, who could have found work, but made no attempt to get it, who, in other words, have malingered; but if there are men of that type- I do not say that there are-the y will have the opportunity of benefiting under this scheme, whereas the man who has found'work for himself on his return will not participate.  the expenditure of £250,000, but we cannot get the money for nothing.",32
105,Mr TUDOR,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Lan d settlement is still to go on. - Mr Charlton - I believe that everything possible should be done for those who went abroad to fight for us, and if we can place them in suitable avocations we ought to do so>, but I understand that in many cases a good deal of the money advanced to place soldiers on the land' is to be returned to us in the shape of repayments. The argument of the Minister for the Navy, that we have already committed ourselves to the expenditure of about £20,000,000 for .repatriation-it will probably £30,000,000 before we are through-is only misleading, and gives no assistance to the Committee. The Government would be well advised to allow the matter to remain in abeyance for a day or two to give honourable members an opportunity of considering it . According to the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), who is a Government Supporter, the M in istry are not in earnest in regard to this proposal. It would appear that they .are endeavouring to find an easy way of coming to a settlement with another place. But I contend that this House ought not to whittle away its rights in regard to finances. It will be a bad day for the country when we allow the Senate, to control the public purse We ought to insist on our rights, and should not back and fill on a matter of this kind . We came to a deliberate conclusion that the amendment we sent to the Senate was appropriate for the measure, and the Government have done wrong in bringing forward an alternative proposal-it really is sufficient to form a Bill in itself-and ' asking us to consider and accept it at a moment's notice.",32
106,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,We have already put in a fortnight on this very same question.,33
107,Mr CHARLTON,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"We l l , another night - would not be too long to wait, notwithstanding the fact that it is necessary to'get the Bill passed as early as possible. The men need not suffer in consequence' of the delay. The payments can be made retrospective. We are not justified in agreeing to this proposal on the reasons advanced today. Where shall we find ourselves if we allow things to d r if t in this way ? The experience of the honourable member for Fawkner is that we agree to matters too hastily. Bills .involving the expenditure of millions of pounds, just the same as those involving the expenditure of thousands of pounds, are passed without receiving the due consideration they deserve. I quite agree with the Minister for the Navy that there are honourable members who are constantly talking about the financial position, yet are willing .to still further extend the benefits that are granted to returned soldiers. But I am not going to withdraw from my position. If there is any malingering, or any injustice perpetrated on the part of the returned soldiers, it is a matter that be nearly should be rectified by those who are administering the Act . But we cannot escape from the promises made to the genuine man, the one who went abroad at our request, and to whom we made the promise that everything possible would be done for him on his return, or for his dependants in the event of his decease. Because the financial position is acute we cannot get away from the promises made in this chamber .and elsewhere. I have heard almost every member promise in this House to do his best to conserve the interests of the returned soldiers in return for the sacrifices they made, on our behalf. But now that the war is over, we are told that we are not able to find cash or do anything for these men if we can avoid it . We cannot honourably evade our responsibilities in this respect. This amendment involves too much to be dealt with hastily; it should receive the most careful consideration. I object to the proposed limitation to the assistance that is to be given; the fullest opportunity ought to be given to all returned soldiers. I have in mind some who are following certain occupations, working three parts time or half time, and often losing a day's work, onaccount of impaired health, due to warlike operations. Those men should be given an opportunity of fort- getting out of such occupations. "" The majority of them nave no money; but by pooling their war gratuity bonds and the loans from the £250,000 which the Government propose to make available, groups of a dozen or fifteen might be able to engage in co-operative enterprises, and thus make their future easier. We have a perfect right to ask the Government to give us time to consider this proposal. We should not be asked to accept it in a hurry, merely in order to overcome a difficulty that has occurred with the Senate. We - should have an opportunity to study the proposal paragraph by paragraph and line by line. _ It is largely because of the haste with which. we did many things during the war that we find'ourselves in our present position. Much money was squandered because of this House not giving full and proper consideration to measures were brought before it. I admit that we were all much alike. In the early stages of the war we were carried away with the desire to do all we possibly could to help the Allied cause, and we voted for things which perhaps in our calmer moments we would not have Now we have to foot the bill, and it is an ever-growing one. I fear that in the very near future a financial slump is inevitable. We cannot continue ing indefinitely the cost of commodities and labour; we must reach a dead-end sooner or later. When that stage is reached we shall have financial chaos, and thousands of men will be unemployed. Those men who went abroad to do their part in the war will suffer, and largely through careless legislation and administration during the last five or six years. The time has arrived when this House should reassert itself as a assembly, and consider every brought before it, in order to do what is best in the interests of the country. If we do that, we may have some chance of escaping from the financial which the Acting Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has just foreshadowed. formation he gave should have been given to the House when the Repatriation was first under consideration. should not be told at this stage that we should be very careful as to what we do, that the country already o\ve3 so much money, and that our proposals are opening up fresh avenues of That has nothing at all to do with the proposal now before us. If the financial position is as the Minister has described it, the Government had no right to accept the proposal moved, in the first place, by the honourable member for Echuca (Mr. Hill). If the country is not capable of bearing the expenditure now, it was not capable of doing so then; therefore, argument,-introduced at this stage, counts for very little. This scheme cannot be given that earnest consideration necessary unless honourable members are given more time to study the pros and cons. The Minister in charge of the Bill would be acting wisely if he agreed to Mr Charlton. report progress, and delay further confinancial sideration of the measure for a few days.",33

One cannot help being struck with the fact that some persons, who during the war could not be counted upon to render the assistance which the country needed, are by their eagerness to assist the returned soldiers today seeking to make deliberative political capital out of this matter. We proposal should realise what this ]>roposal means to the country and to the returned soldiers, and, casting all party politics aside, work together with the one desire of dodifficulty ing the best we can for the men who made sacrifices for us - Already, large sums of The in- money have been expended on repatriat i o n ; other large sums have been proBill mised, and if the proposal now before us We is adopted it will lead to a considerably greater expenditure than the £250,000 mentioned in the Government amendment. We ought to recognise that if this assistance is to be given at all , expenditure. £250,000 will be quite inadequate. I realise that it is only through co-operation that we shall be able to give the assistance that is desired; b ut I would prefer that every soldier who was qualified should be entitled - to the same measure of help regardless of whether or not he was in business before he went to the war. I can see no reason why the man that who was in business before he enlisted should receive generous assistance from the Government on his return, whilst the that is man who' was working for wages should get no assistance at all. A wages worker may have enlisted as a private, gained high promotion, even won the Victoria Cross, b ut under the regulations he cannot be assisted because he enlisted as a wages man nieans of rendering practical assistance in this way except through cooperative effort. To my mind, the amendment which this Committee carried, at the instance of the honourable member for Oapricornia(Mr Higgs), was of negligible value. It i9 useless for the Government to l i m it their assistance to £ 1 for every £ l subscribed by the soldiers themselves. There is nothing generous in such a proposal ; I believe that any financial company would assist to that extent, on the security offered. When the amendment of the honourable member for Capricornia was first proposed, I realized that to be of any value the Government assistance should be at the rate >of £ 3 for every £ 1 subscribed by the soldier. T still hold that view. The question is, however, how much money we can afford to spend. The Treasurer has told us of his financial difficulties, arising out of the enormous cost of repatriation and war pensions. I should like to impress upon the Committee that the greater proportion of the £20,000,000 of which the Treasurer spoke represents debts due by the States to the Commonwealth in connection with repatriation. To a great extent, it is the States which are taking the-responsibility.",34
112,Mr RILEY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,The Commonwealth is paying the interest.,35
113,Mr GREGORY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Not all of it . The Commonwealth makes rebates in interest, but those rebates are given to the soldier, not to the States. Therefore, the States are taking a great measure of 'the responsibility for the huge sums of money that are being expended on repatriation. The Commonwealth finds the money, and the States are responsible. So far as land settlement is concerned, the States are taking practically the whole of the responsibility. I should like to know a little more as to the financial position. I was not here when the Acting Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) spoke, but it is idle for the Government to say that there is a shortage of money, and that they cannot repatriate our - soldiers as they would like to do, when they are prepared at the same time to expenda large sum of money in building the Federal Capital.",35
114,Mr RILEY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,The Capital will pay for itself.,35
115,Mr GREGORY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I have heard many absurd remarks in that regard. I have no wish to be offensive, b ut I do not But I can see no otlier think that the honourable member really believes that the Capital would pay for itself.",35
116,Mr HEOTOK LAMOND,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,Is it as bad as the construction of the East-West railway ?,35
117,Mr GREGORY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Jus t as bad in. the matter of worthless expenditure of money and the length, of time occupied in carrying out the work. There can be no reasonable excuse for opposing the desire! of the Committee on the score of economy when> we find before the House other proposals for heavy expenditure, such as I have quoted. I disapprove of the proposal to confine advances under this heading to £250,000, and I also think that advances of £ 1 for £ 1 would be useless. If a man can hand in bonds or cash by way of security, then subject to the Commission being satisfied as to the proposed method of expenditure, the Department should be able to advance at least £ 2 for every £ 1 put up. The limiting of the aggregate expenditure under this heading does not display on the part of the Government a keen desire to assist those who are certainly deserving of assistance. Quite <& number of men. who gave up good positions to fight our battles overseas, have found it . impossible, .on their return, to secure assistance from the Department in establishing themselves in business. I know a young man - who, having qualified as a dentist, went to New Zealand, where he secured an appointment at a salary of £ 6 a week. On the outbreak of the war he returned to Victoria, and enlisted. He worked as a dentist at the Barracks for about six months at a nominal wage of something like 13s. per day, and then went to the Front. He was in the danger zone in France, taking the same risks as many soldiers, and at the end of about four years returned to Victoria, and asked the Repatriation Department for an advance of- £200 to enable him to buy an outfit so that he might set up in practice for himself. Under the regulations, however, it was impossible for the Department to grant him any assistance because he had not been in business before he enlisted. That, to my miiid, is unfair. It is unfair that a man who happened to be in business when he enlisted should receive assistance in re-establishing himself on his return, and that another man who was not in business before he volunteered should be denied such help. Mr HECTOB. LAMOND - Unde r this proposal, if a> man wished to enter into a co-operative enterprise, he would receive assistance, bub if he desired to> set up for himself, he would not.",35
118,Mr GREGORY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I believe we have too many people rushing into small city businesses at the present time. Should we not encourage a man who desired to set up for himself as a blacksmith, a saddler, or a bootmaker in a country district? I would help such men in preference to those who wished to start a wood and coal yard, a ham: and beef shop, or a small grocery business in one of our cities. A man who set up for himself in a country town, and was - helped by the Department to the extent of £ 1 5 0 or £ 2 0 0 in securing his tools of trade, would do good for himself, and his industry would be valuable to the whole community. I do not care whether it is by means of co-operation or any other system that we grant help as long as we give to every man who went away a fair chance to be repatriated. The proposal to which the Senate has objected would help a number of those of whom I have been speaking to establish themselves in some business. Many of them would be able-perhap s only in a small way-to set up a co-operative boot factory, or a sawm ill , or to embark in other industries. If the Government would reasonably entertain the desire of the Committee that a little more generous assistance should be given to those who were not in business before they went away, I am satisfied that we should be able to come to some satisfactory arrangement.",36
119,Mr BELL,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,Assistanc e to individuals?,36
120,Mr GREGORY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I should like assistance to be given to the men individually as well as collectively. I would remind the Committee that even if this proposal be rejected the Commission will still have power, by way of regulation, to give whatever assistance it pleases. Unfortunately, the regulations in the past have prevented assistance being given in the way I have suggested. The passing of the provision to which another place has objected would be an instruction to the Commission that the Parliament desired this assistance to be granted, I hope, therefore, that the Government will not push the question to a. division this evening - If they do, 1 the decision of the Committee, I believe, will be very strongly against them. It is probable, however, that if we were given time to consider the proposal, and to suggest some reasonable compromise, we might be able to propound a. scheme which would not entail upon the Government too great an outlay, and yet would be effective and advantageous in its working.",36
121,Dr MALONEY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Melbourne) [4.30] I do not approach the consideration of this question from a party point of view. It is to be regretted that the Bill was not introduced in the last Parliament. In that event many of the differences that arose between the contending parties at the last general election would 'have been less irritating than they were. The two parties could have faced the country with a proposal to give our returned men a fair chance. At no time during the recruiting campaign was it said that in our treatment of returned soldiers we would differentiate, between H a r r y Brown, who worked in a saw pit, and James Jones, who worked on the land. We said that we would look after the dependants of all who went to the Front. This Bill , however, differentiates between different classes of men. According to the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr. Gibson), the alternative proposal made by the Senate would provide for the settlement of only 1,666 men'. By what right are we to say to one class of men, "" Y o u are the sheep,"" and to another "" You are the goats."" The honourable member who was responsible for the original amendment providing for the assistance of returned soldiers in co-operative enterprises will always be able to regard with satisfaction the action taken by him, and the f uture will do him honour. He did not propose that there should be any differential treatment. The Acting* Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) urged that there was need for economy. He admits, however, that the war-time profits tax has yielded only £2,000,000. Mr W . L . Baillieu, to liis eternal credit, publicly stated that that tax had never touched men like himself. It was not meant to do the work that we expected of it . Why do the Government not come forward with a strong measure of taxation which would take in a fair and equitable way from: those who have most of this world's goods? It does not suit the Government to do anything of the kind, but it does suit them to meet demands of this kind with the cry, "" The finances will not stand it . "" I know that the finances of the Commonwealth are in a dangerous state, and no one is more anxious than I am that they should be protected. It is for that reason I advocate the initiative and referendum and recall, since in that way the people would be able to control the Government.

124,Dr MALONEY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I think that the Government, instead of holding a holeand-corner meeting outside the chamber, which I presume is being done, should seize the reins. There is nothing to be afraid of in what is the remnant of the laughing-stock of the past and the abomination of the present. Some of the senators, when they salute the President, are much in the position of gladiators saluting Caesar-the y are men about to die, their term expiring in June next. But until then those elected by the people must keep out of the so-called sacred chamber. I think that the Government should adjourn the debate u n t i l next F r i day or Tuesday. The second Chamber should not boss this Chamber. There is only one way of preventing that.. Governor General Denman, to his eternal honour, was man enough to refuse a double dissolution, and was replaced by another sent here to give it . The only way in which this House can control the other Chamber is by sending it to the people; and if the rulin g power in the community will not grant the Governis re- ment of the day a double dissolution for that purpose, we jfoad better .get another to take his place.

The former proposal was accepted by the Government, and sent to the Senate, the members of which, however, thought f it to reject it .

It will be observed that no man who has already been repatriated can avail himself of the proposed scheme. If a number of men deare sired, for instance, to start a co-operative machine boot factory, and sought to have a man who had already repatriated himself as their organizer or manager, they could not have their wishes complied with simply because of the fact that the man was already repatriated.",39

151,Mr JAMES PAGE,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I do not think so. The number, in my opinion, would be very small, because most men who have been accustomed to work for wages have, 4 according to my experience, a holy dread of co-operative concerns. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) put up a strong case for men who, for instance, might desire to co-operatively work' a smlall saw-milling plant or a contracting plant. Many men, whom I know personally, were general station hands and typical bushmen before they went to the Front, capable of any work in the country. They might not be able to do everything in a cabinet-making manner, but still they were good rough carpenters. They were the sons of pioneers who had gone out into western Queensland and there built their homes, some of which are standing after thirty or forty years. These men returned with distinguished - honours won on the field.  be a great help to such men?",39
152,Mr JAMES PAGE,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"No . When I . went out back I required no help frou* anybody, because I knew that, bealth and strength, I could carve my own way. We must remember world is not so wide as it was forty years ago-that even Australia is not so wide. But there are golden opportunities. Put me down in Rockhampton nothing but my swag, and in twelve months I would have a bank There is no country in the world where a working man with no capital to start on can get on as well as he does here. what does the Repatriation do to help the Australian bushmen? one knows better than does the honourable member for North Sydney (Sir Granville Ryrie) the value of the typical tralian bushman. He knows the initiative he can display, and that the man who has been reared in the bush does not knock off for breakfast, dinner, or tea, but only knocks off when his job is finished. Yet because he was a common, general bush labourer before going to the war, he cannot get assistance under this proposal, even to the extent of 5s. All the Repatriation Department him is a new swag, a> billycan. and dillybag, 1 lb. of tea, a few pounds of sugar and flour, a tin of "" bullocky's joy,""' and send him on the road rejoicing, "" We have repatriated you in exactly the position you occupied before the war."" I know many men who served with the Light Horse under the honourable member for North Sydney. They say that the Australian bushwhacker as a fighting unit on a horse is second to none in .the world. Yet these ordinary bushmen, the noblest creation of God, men with initiative, and strong in their beliefs and desires, can get no assistance if they wish to band together and do something for themselves after all they have seen. And, God knows, some of them have seen a let; they have come back different men. under this provision we cannot give them twopence, because they have already been repatriated into the position they occupied before they enlisted. Of two brothers who went away, one was killed and the other returned' maimed. Two who remained at home have alongside the parents' land, but because the brother who has returned from the Front was not a grazing farmer before he enlisted,, the Repatriation cannot give him a grazing farm. ever, the squatters and graziers of the S.tanthorpe district have raised Mr James P.age. given among themselves, and without the assistance of a single copper from the Comthat the monwealth, have put him into a better position than that of any other man placed on the land by the Repatriation Department. I have said, times ouj; of with number, that we cannot do too much for the men who have done so much for us, balance. and I smile when I hear the Acting Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) saying that we must look after the taxpayers' money, But and that we have to find money for this Department and money for that. When - these chaps No were fighting in Palestine or in the mud of Flanders doing their bit, there was no mention of money among them. They - Ausdid not cavil about money when they were protecting this fair land of ours, making it easy for us to live here, and protecting the interests of the taxpayers. W h at would have been the position of these taxpayers if Great Britain had gone down in ordinary, the war?' It would have been a case of "" There aim''t going to be no taxpayers."" - The interests, of the taxpayers would have been guarded byGermans, and a great can give many young fellows I see on these benches today would have been, swinging on the nearest trees. I read the books the German officers wrote prior to the war, saying saying, what they proposed to do to the youth of Australia, and they made me shudder, especially during the dark days of A p r i l , 1918'. The Zeebrugge incident was a flash of consolation. A f t e r Villers-Bretonneux I realized that our Australian troops were second to none in the world. To them we owe the liberty we enjoy today, and why should we cavil at giving them a few thousand pounds or a few million pounds ? They would get all I could give them, or all I could get for them. Anything I can do to improve their lot I am willing to do. I do not propose to study the taxpayer's' interests. I shall have regard only But for the interests of the returned soldiers, who have made this country easy to live in . Let us give them a l it t le of the benefits of the new world they have made for us. Do not let us be niggardly. Surely we cannot say that the soldiers brothers were niggardly to us? Between 50,000 selections and 60,000 of them are lying dead for our welfare. Y e t here we are cavilling about a few "" quid "" for them. We ought to make life as easy as possible for those Department who have returned, and no man has put How- forward a better proposal for helping them than has the 'honourable member for money Echuca (Mr Hill ) . Bad and all as is the amendment of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) to the proposal of the honourable member for Echuca, it is preferable to the one now submitted by the Government. Do not let us be humbugs.  member really think that our attitude to the returned soldiers is such as to justify our being called humbugs ?",39
153,Mr JAMES PAGE,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I was referring to all honourable members. The repatriation of our soldiers up to date is second to none in the world. Australia has done well in this respect; but at the finish do not let us be niggardly. Do not let us say that those who wish to go on to the land can have thousands of pounds and all they require, but those who wish to commence secondary industries should not be entitled to assistance.  member think that there is room for an honest difference of opinion without the accusation being made that we are niggardly?",41
154,Mr JAMES PAGE,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Opinion s diffeT in all cases', even in this respect. I remember the arguments advanced when the first Pensions Bill was under dis1 cussion. I do not accuse the Government of being niggardly,; they are doing' well, and I can quite unndterstand the Acting Treasurer being anxious to look after the finances of the country, but we ought to give the returned men a chance of establishing themselves on a co-operative basis. I have sufficient confidence in Senator Millen to know that he will want to see a good pro - 1 position. in any scheme brought forward, and if we leave the matter to him, the soldier, the country, and' the taxpayer, about whose interests the Acting' Treasurer is so anxious, will get a - square deal I ask honourable members to send back to the Senate the amendment moved by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) to the proposal of the honourable member for 'Echuca,', and if they do not care to agree to it, let them, go tc the country. Let us have a double dissolution. ""We have nothing to fear. It would be a case of heads-1 win, tails you lose - If the 'Committee is trueto itself it cannot accept the Government's backstatement, down on this matter.  [5.18] - Instea d of coming forward with, an amendment of this kind, which seeks to convey the idea that the Government are conceding what is asked for in the proposal of the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , but yet gives nothing, it would have been a decent thing if the Minister in charge of the Bill (Mr. Poynton) had gone back to Ms original attitude. He told us in the beginning that he could not accept the new clause submitted by the honourable member for Echuca. He said that no Government on earth would accept it. It was on such Socialistic lines that he could, not think of accepting it. His present proposal seems to be a case of giving with the one hand and taking back with the other. However, I rise particularly because the Acting Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has given us somefigures which prove that I contended, when speaking to - the amendment of the honourable member for Echuca, that the amount of money paid by this Government to returned soldiers in the shape of sustenance is £2,000,000 - As a matter of fact, the Acting Treasurer amply verifies my figures, and gives the answer which I intended to give to the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) when he challenged my statement. I mention that in passing because it affects the amendment submitted by the Government. Under the proposal which is now before the Committee, provision would be made for orfy 1 1,600 men. That is. to say, if the total amount of £250,000 to be provided is divided into amounts of £15®, only 1,600 men can benefit. That will go a very little way towardssatisfying' the 18,000 men who, we are told, are out of employment ' today, and are living, on sustenance. I should think that the number of men unemployedi and drawing, sustenance is nearer 20-,O0O-.

155,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I did not make that and I will not allow the honourable member to thrust it upon me.

It simply means that if the honourable member for Hume in tends to adopt that attitude in debate, no Minister will answer any question he asks. I certainly will not.  wish to misrepresent the Minister. If he says that he did not mention that amount",42
157,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I did not mention it in the sensg in which the honourable member is using it . I could not give the honourable members precise figures. I told him that I thought that about £2,000,000 had been spent on sustenance. Now the honourable member says that I stated that £2,000,000 was being spent on sustenance.  total amount mentioned by the Minister was £4,700,000Was that the expenditure for the year?",42
158,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Yes .  how much of it represented sustenance money, and the Minister ""£2,000,000."" If he now says that he did not mean £2,000,000 for the year, I accept his statement. However, apart from that, the fact that there are from 18,000 to 20,000 men drawing sustenance would account for an annual expenditure of about £2,000,000 per annum, and my statement to that effect a few days ago was sufficiently accurate as to He not worth contradiction by the Minister for Repatriation. The proposal which this Committee adopted at the instance of the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) in the first place, would have provided an excellent opportunity for many of the men who very often, through no f a u l t of their own, are compelled to draw sustenance from the Department. If they were provided with a chance of engaging in a co-operative business, the Department would be relieved of an expenditure for which it gets no return, whilst the men themselves would be deriving some of the benefits of that new world for labour which we were told was to come into being after the war. But according to the scheme put forward by the Government there is to be no new world for labour; men are to go back into the old grooves in which they worked before the war. If in the opinion of the Commission applicants for loans under the proposal Ave are now considering have, been satisfactorily re-established in civil life, they Avill get no assistance to embark on any business venture. Many of the soldiers who have returned to their old employment have all the qualifications necessary to achieve success in saAv-milling, boot making, and other industries. But, according to the terms of the clause suggested by the Government, men who have returned to their former employment will be deemed to be finally repatriated, and ineligible for the benefits of this scheme. There is nothing in this amendment to indicate any honest desire on the part of the GoA ernment to redeem their promise r to give to the soldiers opportunities commensurate with the great sacrifices they have made for this country during the Paragraph b of sub-clause 7 provides that no assistance shall be given ""unless the applicants satisfy the Commission that they are qualified to carry on that business."" How is the question of qualification to be decided? Are the members of the Commission to be Jacks of all trades, or Avill they employ a magic replied wand which will disclose whether a man has qualifications to make a success of a particular business? That paragraph alone is sufficient to unduly l i m it the assistance to be given to returned soldiers.",42
159,Mr BOWDEN,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"We could hardly give it indiscriminately.  that there must be some discrimination, but I cannot see how this provision will operate. Some members of the Commission may be men without any industrial or technical training. How can they judge upon that question? A man Avho today is earning £3 or £4 at his old employment, may have particular qualifications for conducting a saw-milling business. Under the Government's alternative proposal, he would have no opportunity, because he might not have given any evidence that he had the necessary qualifications. Paragraphs 6 and d of sub-clause 7 impose limitations which destroy the whole scheme, and they are in themselves sufficient to make me vote against the Government proposition. am quite in accord with those who desire that the consideration of this matter should be postponed, in order that honourable members may have an opportunity to look more closely into it , because the two paragraphs to which I have just referred satisfy me that we should not entertain the scheme as it stands.",42

Such political economists might reasontion ably be expected to look at the matter from the point of view which I have just put. I at first saw some reason for opposing this measure on the ground that it was not fair to use Government money, for which these t h r if t y people, with others, are responsible, as a means of making advances to other groups of I persons to compete with them, and probably to put them out of business ",43
162,Mr RODGERS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,No efficient manufacturing company would worry about an inefficient co-operative enterprise.,43
163,Mr HIGGS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Is the honourable member right in concluding that the co-operative enterprises of returned soldiers would be inefficient? In some cases 'they may, and probably will, be inefficient, and a considerable amount of money may be I lost. On the other hand, many of them will be efficient. Last night I introduced to the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) a deputation of four returned soldiers, who did not want money from the Government, but stated that they purposed establishing a co-operative ANZAC tweed manufacturing business, and desired permission to obtain from the Government mills every week 300 lbs. of yarn, for which they were willing to pay the highest .price for cash. Having seen these men, and heard what they had to say, and having seen the samples of tweeds which they produced, I was quite satisfied that they would not be inefficient.",43

If we may judge from the stories we hear as to the inability to place orders for bricks, cement, - tiles, and galvanized iron for the building trade, there must be ample room for others to set up for' themselves. As in the building trade, so in the clothing and other industries. The Assistant Minister for Defence said last night that it might be found difficult to supply the ' four returned soldiers with 300 lbs. of yarn each week, because the Commonwealth Woollen Mills were working at their highest pressure to-supply the demand for cloth for returned soldiers. The fact that there is such a limited production in. Australia is fair reason for this proposal. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has said, "" We want more work and more product-ion. of wealth in this country to enable us to bear our interest burdens and to pay our debts."" I agree with him . I agree also with, the Acting Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) that the financial position is extremely serious. The r i g h t [honourable tleman took that as his text when dealing with the proposal to make advances on the £ 1 for £ 1 basis to returned soldiers to assist them in co-operative enterprises. The country is not going to suffer from advances that are made to such enterprises, because, despite the suggestion of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr . Rodgers), they will be largely reproductive. I agree with the honourable member, however, that there will be cases of inefficient men starting co-operative enterprises, and losing their own as well as the Government's money.",43
168,Mr RODGERS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,There are also legitimate opportunities for returned soldiers to embark on co-operative enterprises.,44
169,Mr HIGGS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"When this scheme has been working for some time, there will, probably be the same proportion of failures among returned soldiers that there is at present in the general business community, as shown by the annual bankruptcy records for the Commonwealth. I Would remind the Acting Treasurer that what is causing trouble with respect to our finances is that we are advancing - and we have to do so, perhaps-abou t £36,000 every week by way of sustenance money. Something like £2,000,000 is now being spent each year to maintain returned soldiers who are out of employment. That, as an honourable member interjects, is, largely, a dead loss. £250,000 proposed to be devoted to this scheme will be put into more or less efficient production, of wealth, or its effective distribution, which is the same tiling. Let us contrast this proposed expenditure of £250,000 with the £2,000,000 per annum expended as sustenance money, and which is going to men who deserve it as well as to some who do not. The fact that some who are receiving sustenance should not get it is a phase of repatriation upon which public men do not like to dwell, but the percentage of ne'er-dowells is exceedingly small. I should like the Minister in charge of the Bill to agree to the Government proposal being dealt with clause by clause, so that we may have an opportunity to amend it in detail. The honourable gentleman himself has agreed to amend the sub-clause prorviding for an advance of £150. He says that it is not intended that the total advance made in. any case shall be only £150.  gen- amend it that that will be the amount in respect of each original shareholder. We are also prepared to increase the aggregate expenditure for which our alternative scheme provides from £250,000 to £500,000.",44

171,Mr LAZZARINI,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Werriwa) [5.50]' The experience that members have had with this Government makes it seem quite natural that an amendment should be proposed to block any scheme' for cooperation among returned soldiers. Ashas been pointed out by the mover of one of the original amendments, the conditions in the new clause now proposed are such that very few returned soldiers would apply for Government assistanceon behalf of a co-operative business. The House decided that it would be a good thing to allow the RepatriationDepartment to advance money ' for the assistance of co-operative undertakings on the part of returned men, but the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs) put his finger on the spot when he suggested that vested interests may consider themselves menaced by this proposal. The daily increase in the cost of The the necessaries of l if e has again called the attention of thinking men to the possibility of reducing the cost of livin g 'by the extension of co-operative enterprises, and a Government whose every action has shown that it will support vested interests and monopolies to the death naturally at this juncture makes a proposal which, although camouflaged, has for its object the discouragement of co-operation, fearing, perhaps, that it may go in this young country further than it has gone even, in Great Britain, where it has become a danger to vested interests. Here, co-operation might well extend from the secondary to the primary industries, and our returned men should be encouraged in co-operative effort. It has been interjected that private enterprise has nothing to fear from inefficient co-operative enterprise on the part of soldiers. That may be so; but it is not necessary that every member of a co-operative concern shall possess expert knowledge of its business undertakings. Members of a co-operation! may be at once employees., or workers, in the business"", and shareholders, having their say in the control of affairs, and drawing their part of the profits. But I expected that this Nationalist Government would fight, both here and in another place, to prevent the returned soldier from being repatriated in any better occupation, than that which he was following before his' enlistment. It is thought by them that if a man was breaking stones before he went away, he should be satisfied to break stones on his return; or, as has been said, that if a man was carrying a swag before he enlisted, he might regard himself as sufficiently repatriated if he were given a swag to carry on his return. Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), as Acting Treasurer, spoke of our financial difficulties; yet, when the war was on, money was as nothing, and could be found for everything. All sorts of promises were made to the soldiers when they went away, and all sorts of difficulties are now being raised to prevent the fulfilment of those promises. When members of the Labour party spoke about expense in connection with certain issues put before the people they were held up to scorn; but the Nationalist party, now that the soldiers are back, and vested interests are secure again, are not concerned with the welfare of the soldiers. They speak now of pounds, shillings, and pence, and are willing that our returned men shall have to adopt uncongenial occupations, or occupation^ detrimental to their health and well-being, notwithstanding their sufferings on the other side of the world. The almighty dollar is again to be set on its pedestal and worshipped, and vested interests are to be protected at any cost.",44
172,Mr RILEY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"South Sydney) [5.58] I should like to see the measure become law, but I am not willing that we should give-way to the Senate on the matter that is under discussion. This afternoon the Minister for the Navy, as Acting Treasurer, drew a black picture of the finances of the country, but I would remind him that our financial position today is the same as it was when the Government accepted the proposal of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs),' and sent it to the Senate, a few days ago. The Government was then prepared to finance co-operative soldier concerns, yet now that the Senate has rejected our proposal, the Minister for the Navy tells us of the millions that are needed for the government of the country. Our financial affairs should be well looked after, seeing that we have 'the Treasurer (Mr Watt) now in London, the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) as Acting Treasurer, and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) as Assistant Treasurer, to pay regard to them.",45

Directly a man got out of work, the honourable member would be the first to go to the Department for sustenance.",45
175,Mr RILEY,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I have not gone to the Department for sustenance for any man, recognising that the officials had their hands full. I have not criticised .the Repatriation Department. My desire, however, is to get the men off the books of the Department. In Sydney, last week, I saw returned soldiers coming out of the office in droves, after having been registered. If these men can be got to cooperate in the production of wealth, which we are told is what the country mo3t needs at the present moment, will reduce our expenditure. men are already bound together by ties of sympathy and association, and may be expected to co-operate in business very effectively. The original proposal sent to the Senate was not moved in any party spirit, but I think that that now put before us by the Government is so hedged round with restrictions and that returned men could as easily get an advance from a bank or other as from the Repatriation Department. must not be forgotten that all money advanced will be repaid with ""Under ordinary circumstances, it may be difficult for co-operative concerns to obtain advances from the banks, and, there for, the Government should assistance to them. If advances are made, the Government will be the first creditor, and will take no"" risk. the Minister for the Navy spoke of the expenditure on war service homes, he appeared to forget that the cost of those homes, together with interest, will be repaid to the Treasury, and these repayments will furnish.us with a rent roll for many years. Our financial commitments in respect of soldiers' houses, I regard as reproductive, and the money that has been spent will gradually return to the Treasury. This expenditure is one of the best investments that could be made, and it is taking place under what is really a co-operative arrangement. dwell on the advantages of co-operation, because the subject is worn but the Government would - be well advised to report progress, so that a conference might be held at which understanding could be arrived at. object to the dropping out of the Bill of a scheme for co-operation, in order that a new Bill may be introduced to provide for co-operation. If this Bill is put through without any provision for cooperation, the Government will feel under no obligation to bring in another Bill to provide for it. Therefore, that members generally, and those .members who represent soldiers, will insist that the soldiers shall be given a fair deal. There is no need to mention the directions in which cooperation might succeed; but the Minister for the Navy must be aware that a little money put into a co-operative affair will sometimes make men independent a few years, and the Government will in Mr Riley. it any case get back the capital it advances. Returned No loss could be incurred by the Government because they would have first claim upon any industry established in that way.  perience of business propositions in Australia, and the assets, in some cases, have not been worth much. difficulties Mr Riley - I quite agree that there have been failures so far as' private busiinstitution nesses are concerned. There have also been It failures in co-operative effort, but they do not count, because there is, in other direcinterest. tions, abundant evidence of the success of co-operatSive movements in this country. I shall vote for the retention of that portion of the Bill whioh will give our returned grant soldiers an opportunity to co-operate in industrial enterprises as well as in land matters. When Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [ 6 . 7 ] - I am sorry that upon the first occasion we have been asked ""to make a pronouncement upon the question of co-operation the test has taken the form of an amendment moved by a private member-wit h the very best of intentions, I admitinstead of a carefully-prepared plan launched by the Government upon well defined lines. The proposal of the M in ister for Home and Territories does not afford honourable members a fair opportunity of making a pronouncement upon the question of co-operation, or upon the I shall not lines on which the movement should be established, or the safeguards which threadbare, should be adopted in the conduct of such enterprises: It seems to me that when we are called upon to consider a business prosome position involving the publio estate, it I should be separated entirely from sympathetic considerations, that it should be upon sound lines, and subject to all those safeguards with which an ordinary business enterprise is surrounded. I notice that manufacturing operations are to form the basis of the financial assistance whioh is to be granted. Now we know I hope that the cost of manufacturing operations especially today is at its very top. I do.not think the that the amendment of the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , which has already been disposed of, sought to l i m it the assistance to be granted to individual .soldiers to £250. The amendment submitted by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), and with within which another place has disagreed, attempted to place the granting of financial assistance to these men upon a pound for pound basis, without any limitation as to amount. Now the proposal of the Government brings this form of assistance into line with the financial assistance granted to any other beneficiary under the Act-namely , £15-0 - and seeks to limit the trial of co-operation in this country an expenditure of £250,000. over the whole of our returned soldiers, I must confess that that expenditure upon the establishment of manufactories will afford only a very meagre trial to the co-operative system. The honourable member for Capricornia spoke of the possible objection that established industries might have to the starting of new enterprises by soldier co-operators. My own opinion is that the up-to-date manufacturer will not be very much upset by the opposition of any new co-operative venture established by our soldiers if the Commonwealth expenditure under this heading is restricted to £250,000. The proposal now before us does not give us a fair chance of considering the question of co-operation by our soldiers in secondary industries. I know that there have - been complaints by some of our returned men of differential treatment .as compared with that accorded to their comrades who enter our primary industries. The latter may obtain up to £2,500 worth of land, in addition to an advance of £625, to enable them to .secure a home and purchase implements, stock, &c. When this fact is borne in mind, the assistance proposed to be granted to soldiers who are willing to engage in our secondary industries appears to be of a very negligible character. The Minister has told us that the financial assistance given to business enterprises by State Governments has produced veiy unsatisfactory results, and that a very big percentage of those who have received such assistance have failed. Now we have put before us a new proposal, and one which involves the settlement of our returned soldiers in our secondary industries. I do not think that a sum of £250,000 is sufficient for that purpose.  crease the amount to £500,000. honourable member will then have a chance of reconsidering the matter later on.",45
176,Mr RODGERS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"That would be a muOh more substantial sum. I wish to put before the Committee what I regard as the essentials to success in co-operation. I recognise the safeguards which it is sought to establish in what is necessarily a hurriedly drawn proposal on the part of the Government, and I also recogto nise the value of affinity amongst indiSpread viduals, particularly in connection with our primary industries. Take, for example, the dairying industry, which came to the rescue of this State about a quarter of a century ago, when its finances were in a very unsatisfactory condition. At that time a great revival took place in the dairying industry, and the cooperative system was adopted for the purpose of producing a standard article, eliminating all the expense possible, and marketing that article under the best possible conditions. That was an illustration of co-operation in which all the cooperators had something definitely in common. In the first place they had a knowledge of their industry, and in the second they had the capital and plant which were essential to enable them to work in that industry. But it is a much more difficult proposition to establish cooperative enterprises in which anybody may take shares and set up as cooperators-enterprises , too, in which it is essential that only highly skilled men should be employed. To-day efficiency is the dominant feature in connection with our secondary industries. The TEMPORARY CHAIRM AN (Mr Atkinson)-Order ! This is a very interesting dissertation on cooperation, but I scarcely see that it is relevant to the question before the Chair.",47
177,Mr RODGERS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"There is no member of this Committee to whose ruling I would rather defer than to yours, sir; but I claim a little more latitude to enable me to complete my argument. I ask the honourable member for Echuca and his associates in the Country party not to ignore the danger that would result from encouraging a number of young men who may have very little in common to forsake rural industries and come together as co-operators in any manufacturing industry, unless they can absolutely assure The them that by so doing they will achieve 'better results. I know that the Minister for Repatriation has stated that, in our secondary industries, there are men who* are earning good rewards for their labour. I know, too, that, by 30th June next, we shall have settled upon the land in Victoria alone 6,350 returned soldiers, a majority of whom were rural workers, notwithstanding that today the greatest difficulty experienced in country disticts is to obtain such workers. We have, further, expended the sum. of £6,000,000 in this State upon the purchase of land, for soldier settlement. The establishment of returned soldiers in our secondary industries upon a co-operative basis will only tend to accentuate that difficulty. However, that is not a sufficient reason for denying them their chance in life. They have earned it, and this country has generously acknowledged its debt to them. This proposal, unless carefully guarded, may lead to all kinds of wild-cat schemes. We are all familiar with the glowing pictures which company promoters can paint, and he will indeed be a pretty astute Minister' who will be able to shatter such pictures. I would like to see the Minister who, upon the eve of a general election, would stand up for the public estate by denying applicants this particular form of assistance. Of course, there is one safeguard in the proposal submitted, namely, that which limits the amount which may be advanced. The present inroads on the public purse are .sufficient to rivet the attention, only of honourable members, but of the whole community; and I do not think that the country is awake to what is ahead, though a forced loan of some £30,000,000 will probably make people take notice. A proposal of this kind in regard to secondary industries is altogether different from a proposal for the establishment of homes, either in the country or in the town. - Dr EAKLE PAGE - The States doing more for civilians in the latter spect than for soldiers.",47
178,Mr RODGERS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,I do not think they are. I do not think we could possibly have more generous provision than is being made for the establishment of soldiers' homes either in the country or in the suburban areas; no better provision has been made elsewhere in the world.,48
179,Dr EAETJE PAGE,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,What about Queensland before the war?,48
180,Mr RODGERS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"In Queensland the public estate, consists of leasehold lands not yet alienated, a<nd it is an easy matter to make whait appears a munificent gift ; but when we come to deal with private lands, the circumstances are different. I have graive misgivings with regard to the success of the proposed co-operation in secondary industries. High technical skill, efficiency, up-to-date plant, and sufficient capital are all necessary factors, and these would be very difficult to obtain. If these co-operative proposals are adopted, they will commit the Government to more than appears in the Bill. If the amount be increased to £500,000, the Minister in charge will have to "" follow his money,"" because money cannot be advanced for industries, and the industries allowed to collapse; and it may be necessary to advance still more, or lose all. This is a hazardous undertaking for any Government, and one that does not appeal to me.",48
181,Mr HIXL,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,Do you not think that land settlement is somewhat hazardotis ?,48
182,Mr RODGERS,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"It has its hazardous side. The maps and plans of the country, from the days of the earliest settlement,, tell a doleful history,, for many good, menhave fallen in. their attempts to subdue the land. But. in all business the proportion of successes is, after all, not small, and the proposal before us would, as I say,, be hazardous for the Government in . connection with either primary or secondary industries. When I have learnt the. fate of the. proposal; before us, I . shall probably move an amendment to the effect that where the Government is satisfied of the bona fides and the prospects of success of <aa enterprise, the money for the gratuity bonds be found, even if to the total amount, for the purpose; and the. money used will then be are the money of the soldiers. I take it that re- if the. £26,000,000 or £28,000,000 were paid to the men in the form now adopted, it would become the spending money of the country,, and not find its way into any essential industries; further, it would go into the hands, of those least accustomed, to spend, money to the best advantage. NodoTiibt some of the men could spend it wisely, but, for the most part, they are young,, immature men, without business experience. I commend the suggestion I have made to the Government.",48

The alternative clause proposed hy the Government supports the principle contained in the original amendment of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs), wherein he set down a basis of assistance, namely, £1 for £1. The original limit of assistance, namely, £150, meant that each soldier would have to contribute £150 also. My amendment provides that for every sum of £150 loaned by the Government the soldier so benefited will be required to contribute only £75. The effect will be to considerably broaden the scope of the measure. Very many soldiers could find £75 who could not finance themselves to the extent of £150. My proposal is free from the suggestion of reckless financial extravagance, and will not increase the financial responsibilities of the Government. The individual limit will still remainat £150.

I myself have one or two amendments to propose. It is desired to make it absolutely clear that a maximum of £150may be furnished toeach individual soldier, and the Government propose to provide that the aggregate amount of loans Shall be £500,000, instead of £250,000. I also propose to amend paragraph d of subclause 7. This, provision prevents the granting, of loans if, in the opinion of the Commission, the applicants have been satisfactorily establishedin civil life. I propose to amend it to read as follows:- . If, in the: opinion of the Commission, the. applicants have been reasonably and satisfactorily assisted to re-establish themselves in civil life. In many cases men have had considerable conassistance from the Repatriation Department to re-establish themselves in civil life, and surely they ought not to be given assistance again under this scheme.",49

I am pleased that the Minister has prefaced this discussion by stating that he is not willing to accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), because it is a happy augury. Almost invariably we find that there is a volte face, and that the Committee is usually willing to go further than the Minister intends to go.  tion to the rule.",50
189,Dr EARLE PAGE,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I trust that in be shut out. this case the experience we have had in the past will be repeated. The Government do not seem to have known their own minds on this question, which has been a game of battledore and shuttlecock between the two Houses for over two weeks. We have had divisions on non-party lines here to some extent, but in another place the party whip seems to have cracked, and, as a. consequence, our proposal is now before us ini a mangled form . The debate today would not have been so extended if honourable members had been allowed ample time to eonsider the proposal brought forward by the Government this afternoon. In: common with the honourable member for Grampians, I was oompelled to retire from the chamber in order to consider it in quieter surroundings, but when we examined it we found that its provisions were almost wholly those which had been discussed at length in the chamber, and h a d. been advocated by honourable members sitting in this corner. We found that we were in perfect agreement with the proposal except as regards the amount of money to be advanced, and the classes of - soldiers to be assisted. On this occasion there is no need to debate the general quesfSon of co-operation, but as we are wedded to the principle we ought to in sist on its finding a place in this B i l However, - we are discussing co-operation among men who have the spirit of camaraderie well developed, and. who have proved, even whenthey are not officered by men senior in rank, and are left to their own resources, that they conduct themselves with the greatest order and to general satisfacthe tion. We ought to look with a conciliatory eye on this proposition, and be prepared to give it more favourable consideration than if it were one applythat ing to civilians. Early in the debate on this matter we were told that the amount at which the Government would be involved would be anything from £40,000,000 to £100,000,000, but we find now that the amount has been reduced to £500,000, and there is not a great deal of difference between this amount and the small sum which the honourable member for Echuca (M i \ Hill ) indicated would be required when he was setting for t h his proposal. I am afraid that if we adhere to the £ 1 for £1 basis a large number of men whose gratuities would not amount to £ 1 0 0 each will It is not expecting too much of honourable members to ask them to take a sporting risk when dealing with soldiers. We have heard a great deal about the millions spent on repatriation, and the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) has told us about the enormous improvements that have accrued from that expenditure, but many millions have been spent on land settlement under conditions which are not very much more liberal than those which were in vogue for civilians before and during the war, and which still apply to them. It has always been possible in New South Wales for two or three men who see a property they like to agree among themselves and the owner as to its value, and 1 having done so,, to get the Government to resume it , so that they may cut it up into small blocks, the Government finding 96 per cent, of the total outlay. In Queensland, also, the State will advance up to 75 per cent, for the purchase of homes, whereas the W a r Service Homes Act only goes a little further. B u ; surely men who have been away for four or five years at the threshold of their manhood, and who have had to give np their careers and the possibilities of making money that the man who stayed behind had, d.serve a little l . more consideration in the matter of getting homes than those who did not goaway. I admit that .there has been a large amount of money paid away in sustenance, and that a great deal of work has heen done in the matter of repatriation, particularly by the Local Committees, but there are hundreds of men who cannot get assistance because they had no proper calling or business before they enlisted. Under the present proposal they will now have an opportunity of establishing themselves in businesses with reasonable assistance from the Government. Otherwise they will not be able to do so. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) has alluded to the need for a scheme similar to this, or perhaps an amendment of the regulations under the Repatriation Act to enable men who were not in a position to complete their training in any calling to set up in new businesses. At present there is no such provision. A case in point is that of two brothers who went to the war. One was a tobacconist, the other assisted in the shop. The elder brother was killed, and the younger would now like to get possession of the business his brother carried on, and which must be carried on, because the building has no value except from the fact that it is a tobacconist's shop. However, as the business did not actually belong to him , he can get no assistance from the Repatriation Department. Five* or six men may be anxious to establish themselves in a tannery or in a saw-mill, but they cannot get assistance by reason of the fact that they have had no previous record of business. I think that in this case the Commonwealth should act as their banker. That is all the amendment asks, and surely it is not asking too much to amend this proposal in order to make it sufficiently generous to the men, to whom it will be really valuable.",50
190,Mr MARR,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Parkes) [S.30] - I intend to vote against the amendment moved by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) because, by increasing the amount to be subscribed - by the Government from £ 1 to £ 2 for every £ 1 contributed by the soldier, we will be decreasing the number of participants. A certain amount is to be allotted, and, although the Government - intend increasing the amount, the number of men to benefit must naturally be reduced. If the Government increase the maximum amount from £250,000 to £500,000, and subsidize the soldiers' payments £ 1 for £ 1 ; 3,200 men would benefit, but by in creasing the Government subsidy from £ 1 to £ 2 for each £ 1 contributed by the soldier, only 1,600 will be able to participate. In considering this measure from the stand-point of a returned soldier, I cannot conceive of anything that can be more correctly characterized a ' f wild-cat'' scheme than""the one embodied in the amendment. There is no one in this chamber who has the interests of the returned soldiers more at heart than I have, and I am prenared to concede that honourable members on the Opposition benches are also their supporters. But we haye to recognise that they are their friends now because the war is over, and, though they are espousing their cause today, they kept their mouths tightly closed when the conflict was in progress, and never said one word to induce others to go forward and assist in the fight. It is all very well for members of the Country party to say that we should assist the returned soldiers by establishing them in co-operative concerns, and if we had the money I would be in favour of giving them all we reasonably could!. But can we, as members of the National Parliament and custodians of the public purse, honestly and conscientiously support this proposal when we have a national debt of approximately £740,000,000, and an additional debt of £90,000,000 to be met this year? Honourable members must not overlook the fact that we owe Great Britain £90,000,000, and that our interest bill for the next year will be £9,000,000 more. Who is going to pay it ?",51

I have been elected a member of this Chamber, not merely represent my own views, but the opinions of those who sent me here. I believe that most honourable members have of their country at heart, and if they have they must admit that we should saddle the community with financial obligations.

Why is another place practically unanimous in its attitude upon this question? Because the ister for Repatriation (Senator Millen), with whom its members are associated day by day, knows too well of scores and hundreds of experiments in connection with repatriation up to date, and knows the result of them.

223,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I cannot believe that they are the proposals of Senator Millen. They are Government proposals, to minimize what is a wretched thing.  been sparring for some time on this proposal in its varied forms. It was originally submitted to this Chamber by the honourable member for Echuca (Mr. Hill ) , and the Committee recognised that a certain principle was involved in it. Another place turned it down. We submitted a further amendment, and this another place has also rejected. In all that this Committee has passed, it has recognised a principle. I had some sympathy with the turning down of the first proposal that went forward, on the ground that if a certain amount 'was granted to returned soldiers in the fashion then suggested, many of them, without much good intention, could say, ""We will give it a liy; it will cost us nothing."" The amendment now proposed will, first of all, reduce the number of applicants, and, secondly, will give security to the Government. When a returned man conies along with his 10s. to the Government's £1 he shows an earnest intention to do something for himself. That is th - i security which the Government will have. I do not think that the trouble of the Department will be so great .when the soldier will be under an obligation to present so much money on his own account before he starts. The Committee and another place will be perfectly safe in accepting the amendment as now aubmitted. These men should get a chance. I hope it will be clearly understood that those who have gone back into their businesses or offices are not to take the passing of this proposal as an intimation Min- that there are other fields open to them. Many of our worthy soldiers have not had a distinct chance. Some men are not capable of managing a' business of their own, and would be the first to admit it. They like to get a weekly wage or salary, but there are others who desire to embark in enterprises, and get a start in life. I certainly admire them for that, and think we should give them that chance, which will involve a very small amount of money compared with what we are finding for soldiers who desire to embark on other avocations, such as taking up land. For these reasons I propose to support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Country party (Mr Jowett). I am as conscious as any other member of the gravity of the financial position of Australia, but I feel that this will not be money wasted. 'It will be sent into avenues of business and production, to which we must look more than anything else in order to produce further money to meet our financial obligations.",55
224,Mr BELL,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Darwin) [9.6] - I must t differ from the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) in the reasons he gives for not supporting the amendment. One is that it will limit the number of soldiers who will participate in the benefits accruing from the principle of cooperation. He said it was only a simple proportion sum, but I cannot work it cutto the same conclusion as he does. If the amount that will be advanced to each individual soldier remains at £150, as it does in the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett), and the soldier is to advance only £75, then the liabilities of the Government will be no greater, and the same number of soldiers will participate.",55
225,Mr HBCTOK LAMOND,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,The chances of success will be much less. It is a more wild-cat scheme than it was bef ore,56
226,Mr BELL,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"That is another question, which I am not arguing at present. 1"" take serious exception, also, to what was said by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Robert Cook). He accused the party behind the Government of not supporting the principle of co-operation",56
227,Mr ROBEBT COOK,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,Of not supporting the soldier.,56
228,Mr BELL,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"That is much worse; but, as a soldier myself, I shall not answer that accusation, because we, as returned soldiers, have had a lot of funny things hurled across the floor at us during this debate. It is evidently parliamentary to say funny things about your opponents, perhaps to irritate them or to make them change their minds. Although I am a young politician, I am not young in the ways of the world, and I am not likely to be even irritated by some of the remarks that have been made today about the attitude of the soldier members on this side of the Chamber towards the returned soldiers. I am certain, that the soldiers whom we represent understand our attitude perfectly, and have full confidence in the representation we will give them. But the statement of the honourable member for Indi, that members behind the Government were not supporting this scheme of co-operation because they support the profiteer and the Combines, is unfair to the House. The Committee has already affirmed its approval of the principle of co-operation, and of extending it to the returned soldier, by voting twice for this proposal. Is it fair, then, to say that Government supporters are opposing it because they represent the profiteer and the Combines? The object of bringing down this amendment is to place the proposal in such aform as will be acceptable to another place. That point has been lost sight of by some honourable members who have spoken today. The proposal has been twice sent to another place and rejected. Would it not be a further waste of time to amend it only to such an extent that it will be practically certain of another rejection? I do not intend to support the amendment now before the Chamber for that reason only. I have as much confidence in the returned soldier as any member of the Committee.. A great many statements have been made in commending - the soldier for his business capabilities, while others have said that, even if the soldier is a better man physically for his war experience, he has become unsettled by it , and is therefore unlikely to handle business schemes as sensibly as he would have done before the .war. I disagree with that statement, and regard the argument as futile. I . should like to see the proposal as it is now before the Committee carried, with the one amendment proposed by the Minister for Home amd  accepted here in that form, I am sure it will be confirmed in another place. We shall then be able to get rid of the Repatriation Bill-non e too soon, because the soldiers in general are waiting anxiously to see it become law. They do not want to read in the papers every day that we are still discussing it, and coming to no finality.",56
229,Mr GABB,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"Angas) [9.11] - I shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member forGrampians (Mr. Jowett), because we should show the returned soldiers, as far as we can, that we have confidence in them, and this is one sure way of doing it. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) claimed it as a fact, although it is not a fact, that there were no successful cooperative societies anywhere in which the employees were shareholders. Any one who understands what co-operation means knows that that is not correct. The greatest co-operative concern in Great Britain is one in Which the employees are shareholders, and it is distinctly successful.",56
230,Mr MARR,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,I said where the whole of the shareholders were employees.,56
231,Mr GABB,ALLIEDPARLIAMENTS OE,"I am referring to companies in which a big part of the shareholders are employees. The honourable member assumes that, because he does not know of any instance of a co-operative society where the major part of the shareholders are employees being a success, it necessarily follows that where a number of returned soldiers enter into a co-operative concern, and are employees, it must be a failure also. If that is his inference, it shows a lack of faith in the returned soldier, which should not be shown by any one who knows them so well as the honourable member must know them. It seems to me, both from the apueal made by the Acting Treasurer (Sir ""Joseph Cook), and from much that has been said here today, that do our best for them. the opinion is abroad that the reour turned soldiers are bound to make a uttered a wail today in regard to this ex- mess of this business. Why so? is £250,000 advanced by the Government to be thrown into the sea because it goes to returned soldiers who desire to estabdawn lish QO-operative concerns? We should take the opposite stand. We should have true f a it h in these men. They were good enough for us when they were overseas in time of war, and we should have f a i that they will be good enough time of peace. Instead of regarding this proposed expenditure of £500,000 as money to be thrown into the sea, we this should look upon, it as an expenditure will be reproductive, and likely to enable us in some small measure to increase production as we desire to do. It seems to me that this opposition to th© granting of monetary assistance to soldiers anxious to embark upon co-operahonorable tive enterprises is due to the ingrained conservative instinct of some of our orable friends opposite. An y proposal that seems likely to clash with individual effort is sure to be opposed by them. Much of their opposition is doubtless to the fear that the success here and there of co-operative enterprises on the part of returned soldiers will lead to the spread of the principle. The principle, however, will spread despite their efforts, and will be one of the main forces making for better living conditions, and relieving the pressure of our social system. It has been said by honourable members opposite that the Labour party are looking after the returned soldiers now that the war over.

But, as the member for Parkes (Mr . Marr) said, in effect, in his very honmanly statement, the Government have just passed a Bill providing for returned soldiers a gratuity involving from £26,000,000 to £28,000,000 - The due honourable member asked that they should be given an opportunity to use their own money in effective co-operation amongst themselves. If the lif e they have led has created in them the true spirit of cooperation-if the spirit is there- I daresay they will muster into groups to carry on industries. I should like, even at this late hour, to ask the Government-if they are seriously thinking of giving a national stimulus to co-operatdon-to reconsider is the whole question of cashing the war gratuity on a co-operative basis, thereby helping the returned soldiers to enter into co-operative enterprises with their own money.

234,Mr HIGGS,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Capricornia) [ 9 . 4 2 ] move That the word "" July"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" January."" My desire is that the A ct shall be deemed to have commenced on the 1st day of January, 1916. I submit this amendment because some time ago the Auditor-General desired to audit the books and accounts of the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, but was prevented from doing so. I could never ascertain why he was refused permission to audit those accounts, especially as the Government were interested in the company. They had given that company a licence to manufacture wool tops and.to sell them conditionally that they received 50 per cent, of the profits. The agreement under which the Government entered into this so-called partnership provided that an auditor should be appointed to audit the accounts of the company. But the Chairman of the Central Wool Committee, which was managing this business on behalf of the Government, decided to appoint, not the Auditor General of the Commonwealth, but an outside auditor.",59
235,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Will the orable member's amendment effect his object, seeing that this company is not a Government concern ?",59
236,Mr HIGGS,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"The honourable member will see that I have given notice of a later amendment, whioh provides that the Auditor-General shall-audit all the books and accounts of offices of the Commonwealth, and that he shall also be permitted to audit the accounts of "" any persons, firm, or company carrying on business in which the Government is pecuniarily interested, or from which the Government expect to derive a share of the profits from that business."" amendment I wish to have inserted after clause 8. As I have already explained, BILL. the Auditor-General desired to audit the accounts of the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, and the then Treasurer (Lord Forrest), thought that as the Government were interested in the venture he should be allowed to do so. However, Sir John Higgins, one Chairman of the Central Wool Comv mittee, thought otherwise, and would not permit the Auditor-General to audit the company's accounts. That is the position as it exists today. In my opinion, the - I Auditor-General should be empowered to audit those accounts, and had he been able to do so, possibly certain impending litigation would have been avoided. To my mind, the only reason why Sir John Higgins objected to the Auditor-General being permitted to audit the accounts of the company was that he feared any such audit would', disclose that Mr F . W . Hughes had proved himself too clever for the Central Wool Committee.",59
237,Mr ROBERT COOK,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Do not say that. - Mr HIGGS - I wish that the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) were present, because he was a member of the Central Wool Committee at the time this agreement was entered into, as were also Mr Falkiner and others. It appears to me that they did not examine closely enough the wording of that agreement. There was a word in it , namely, "" amortisation,"" which, like charity, covers a multitude of profits, if not of "" s in s .""",59
238,Mr TUDOR,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,What was the real effect of that word ? Did it allow the company to write down their plant?,59
239,Mr HIGGS,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"The word may mean anything. It may mean the establishment of a sinking f u n d to pay off debts, hon- or it may cover repairs to machinery, or depreciation. The only reason which I can conceive why Sir John. Higgins objected to the Auditor-General being allowed to audit the company's accounts was that such an audit would disclose that Mr F . W . Hughes and his company had been able, under the agreement with the Commonwealth, to secure very large profits, and that it would have supported me in my contention that such a valuable concession as was granted to this company should have been submitted to public tender. However, honourable members are familiar with the history of the case, and That I shall, therefore, content myself with moving the amendment ,",59
240,Mr RYAN,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,Will the honourable ber's amendment have the effect mitting an audit by the Auditor-General to take place?,60
241,Mr HIGGS,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,It will have that effect only when conjoined with the further amendment to clause 8 of which I have given notice.,60
242,Mr FENTON,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,The honourable member desires this legislation to be retrospective ?,60

I am anxious to give the Auditor-General this power as to the future, but to the provision retrospective is another matter. I do not believe in any company being able to flout the Goreputation vernment or the Auditor-General; but If a bad contract was made, giving great admunity. vantages to one company which were not open to other companies, then the fault lies with the Government. I am clear whether or not this contract was made by the Government of which the honourable member for Capricornia (M Higgs) and myself were members.",60

254,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Parramattai n Minister for the Navy and Acting Treasurer) [9.54] - I suggest that this amendment should not be persisted in . I have not been able to follow the matter very make closely, but, I understand that Mr .

255,Mr MATHEWS,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,It must be admitted that it looks suspicious when Sir John Higgins would not have the Auditor,60
256,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I see nothing If suspicious about the matter. When Sir Higgins agreed to accept Mr All a r d for as auditor he accepted a man of the highest rejsutation in the public mind the country, than whom we get none more disinterested by a or with greater weight. Could there be the slightest suggestion that Mr . Allard would do anything not strictly correct I could understand the anxiety for the the services of the Auditor-General. If we were beginningthe business the attitude of honourable members opposite would have some point; but since Mr Allard been appointed a proposal of the kind reflection upon him- a slur that he really - does not deserve. Is it worthwhile per/ sisting in an amendment of the kind ? My colleague, the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), who is more familiar with the matter that I am, reminds me that not only was Mr Allard appointed auditor, but that the Auditor General approved of the appointment What more could there be in the way of a guarantee? May I read a letter which sets out the whole case, and which appears in Hansard of the 25th July, 1919, page 11005? The letter is from the Treasury, and is signed by Mr Cerutty, the Assistant Secretary to the TreasuryOn-the 6th November last, the late Treasurer addressed to the Prime Minister a letter dealing with the audit of accounts of the firms who are manufacturing wool tops. A letter has now been received from the Auditor General in which he stated he is prepared to formally appoint Mr George Mason Allard to act on his behalf in making audits. Mr Allard would also be required to certify to statements and prepare reports for the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General considers that the alternative course, namely, for one of the Audit Office staff to make inspections from time to time, would be inadvisable. The Treasurer concurs in the appointment of Mr Allard as suggested, if no objection is raised by the Central Wool Committee or by your Department. That letter seems to complete the. case. Here we have a gentleman of the highest character appointed with the concurrence of the Auditor-General.",60
257,Mr RILEY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,The private company did not suggest yhe name?,61
258,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"No , the Central Wool Committee suggested the name; and what possible objection there can be I fail to see.",61
259,Mr RYAN,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,Did Mr Allard make the audit?,61
260,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I understand so. He did it , not only with the consent of the Central Wool Committee, hut with the complete concurrence of the Auditor General himself.",61
261,Mr MAHONY,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Who are the Central Wool Committee? They are not the Government, surely!",61

Mr respective Allard's name is too well known to be [36] associated with anything but matters of highest honour and greatest respect.",61
263,Mr FENTON,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Maribyrnong) [10.1]. - If there is any doubt about any of these matters, I .dare say that Mr A l lard, if questioned, would readily assent to an overhaul being instituted. I understand that F . W. Hughes and Company Limited operates under the Companies A ct of New South Wales. I do not wish to cast any reflections upon Mr . Allard, .but from what I have heard, and from my own experience, there is reason to cast reflection upon the New South Wales Statute. I understand that things can be done under the cover of the Companies Act in that State which would not for . one moment be tolerated in Victoria. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) has upon various occasions sought to secure an in vestigation of this company and its affairs, and although it may involve retrospective legislation, if his amendment be agreed to, I intend to support it . If audits are allowed to be made in a loose fashion under.the New South Wales Act it is all the more necessary that the Auditor-General should conduct an investigation for himself, either personally or by medium of his own officers.",61
264,Mr HIGGS,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Capricornia) [10.5] I propose to call attention to remarks of the Auditor-General in his report for 1917-1S. First, however, I would remind honourable members that Sir John M . Higgins, when referring to the same, subject stated, in his report on the Australian wool clip for 1916-17, presented to Parliament on the 25th July, 1917Continuous audits are conducted under the direction of - the Auditor-General's Department of all business transacted through the Central Wool Committee and all State Committees. I will now relate what the Auditorabove General himself said in his report for 1917-1918 (vide Hansard, 24th July, On the 1st March, 1917, agreements were entered into between the Commonwealth Goand Whiddon Bros. Limited, of Sydney, and the Colonial Combing, Spinning . and Weaving Company Limited, of Sydney, respectively, under which these companies were to purchase wooi for the purpose of manufacturing wool tops. It was provided that all the books, vouchers, and documents the possession, or under the control of, the companies, relating to the purchase, manufacture, or sale of the sheepskins, wool, and wool tops, referred to in the agreements, should be produced to an auditor nominated by the Commonwealth Government for that purpose, and it was also provided that any nomination or otlier communication by the Commonwealth Government to the Committee should be deemed to be duly given if signed on behalf of the Commonwealth Government by the Chairman of the Central Wool Committee. Sir John Higgins was the Chairman of that Committee, and he appointed Mr . Allard, q i Sydney, as Auditor. wish to cast any reflection upon that gentleman. The Auditor-General proceedsIn pursuance of this provision, the Central \ Wool Committee appointed a Fellow of the Australasian Corporation of Public Accountants to conduct the audits. Subsequently' the right honourable the Treasurer (Lord, then Sir John, Forrest) submitted his opinion that these audits should be conducted under the control of the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth, and suggested that the auditor appointed by the Central Wool Committee should act under an appointment made by the Auditor-General, under the provisions of section of the Audit Act-shoul d the Auditor-General be willing to make such appointment. Mr Israel states furtherI was quite prepared to do this, but, upon the matter coming under the notice of the Chairman of the Committee (Sir John M. Higgins), he declared that such an agreement would not be as satisfactory as the then procedure. The Auditor-General further proceeds-Upon receiving the balance-sheets of the auditor appointed, the Treasurer (Lord Forrest) asked for further information with respect thereto, but it was pointed out by the auditor that his reports were final, and that if 'further information with respect to accounts was required, this should be obtained from the companies direct. It is evidently desirable that in any future similar agreements, or in any regulations governing the agreements under review, provision should be made for such control by the Auditor-General as would enable the Treasurer and the Auditor-General to obtain all' the information that may be desired. The position with respect to these audits has been fairly set forth in a memorandum prepared by the Assistant Secretary to the Treasurer, and, as it agrees with my own views, it is published under Appendix D. That memorandum, referred to as coming from the Assistant Secretary to the Treasurer, statesFrom many points of view this business was in a most indefinite and unsatisfactory position. It is quite true that the Assistant tary said further that he douhted whether much good could accrue from going back Mr Higgs. over this matter. It may be superfluous to go over Mr Allard's work, but I urge the Committee to pay some attention to the request of the Auditor-General in respect to future agreements-namely , that he should be in a position to audit them himself and ask for any information.",61
265,Mr RYAN,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,The fact remains that the Treasurer was not able to get informaI do not tion when he asked for it .,62
266,Mr HIGGS,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"No . . When Lord Forrest was Treasurer he did not feel satisfied. He asked for information which he could not get. I believe that the attitude taken up by the Central Wool Committee was that if the further information which he sought were obtained, it would not be fair to the company, because it would disclose its business to the general public, but of course a company which enters into a business arrangement with the Commonwealth, must always be II . prepared to have all its actions made public. However, provided the Auditor General is authorized to audit the books, accounts, and vouchers of any company in which the Government has a pecuniary interest at the present time, I do not in sist upon the date being put back to 1st January, 1916, but I would ask the Committee to amend clause 8, and provide that the Auditor-General - shall have power to audit the accounts of any existing f i r m or company in which the Government are pecuniarily interested. I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Mr HU&HES (Bendigo-Prime - M in ister and Attorney-;General) [10.13] - I have been unable to lay my hands on a copy of the agreement of 1917, to which the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) has referred, but I have with me a copy of the agreement laid on the table the other day, and I desire to draw the attention of honourable members to one or two of its paragraphs. It is a contract entered into between the Government and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, and provides for the auditing of the accounts in a certain way by a certain person. For instance, one paragraph readsThe moneys so paid to the Commonwealth Secre- Bank of Australia under clauses a and 6 hereof shall forthwith he divided in accordance with the tentative estimate of the amount that will be available to the Commonwealth and the company respectively in the terms of this agreement. For the purpose of this clause such estimates shall be made by G. Mason Allard, and the final adjustment of the respective amounts payable shall be duly made at the termination of this agreement. Another clause provides that the certificate of the said G. Mason Allar d shall be taken into account and embodied in any judgment, decree or certificate. Another provision readsThe company sha.ll prepare and deliver to the Commonwealth all proper accounts in connection with all transactions carried out by the company under this agreement, and shall give every facility to the auditor appointed hereunder to verify the correctness of all amounts debited and credited in such accounts. said auditor shall furnish to the Commonwealth a report on such transactions and accounts. G. Mason Allard, public accountant, of Sydney, is hereby appointed to be auditor hereunder. Under the contract made between the company and the Government certain and definite arrangements are made by the two parties with respect to the auditing of accounts, and an auditor is appointed, namely, Mr G. Mason Allard, apparently the same gentleman who was appointed under the first agreement. submit that, no matter what amendment is moved here, no Court w i ll read into th« terms of the agreement .anything but that G. Mason All a r d was the only auditor that could audit these accounts unless the amendment moved be couched in such terms as would set aside the contract. I am not arguing whether there should be a Government auditor or not. When the Government had. ample opportunity of insisting upon the audit of the accounts by the Auditor-General, it followed the example of the Central Wool Committee, and appointed Mr Allard , upon whom the parties had previously agreed.",62
267,Mr WEST,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,We do not propose to terfere with existing agreements.,63

I have heard what the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has said concerning the new agreement between the Colonial in - Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, but the clause referring to audits of these accounts has been amended, and Mr Allard's name has been distinctly mentioned as the person who is to conduct It may be, a3 the Prime Minister states, that the Auditor-General cannot audit these accounts without some enactment declaring that agreement null voi.d, or without some amendment of th6 agreement.

281,Mr HIGGS,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"If the Crown had ample opportunity that means, in this case, that the Government had the opportunity The late Lord Forrest in 1917 was in favour of the Auditor-General inspecting the books, but Sir John Higgins said that it could not be done.",64
282,Mr HUGHES,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"The agreement was drawn up by the Solicitor-General and on hig advice. He took all steps to safeguard the interests of the Crown, and recommended me to accept it , which T did. I am perfectly clear that he took all the recessary steps to safeguard our interests.",64
283,Mr HIGGS,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Perhaps the Solicitor General wns not aware that when, as Treasurer, the late Lord Forrest received the haiance-sheets of the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, he expressed the opinion that the Government should have further information, to and asked the Auditor-General to obtain it. Sir John Higgins said that the information the Government desired must the obtained from the company. The company, however, refused to supply it, because it said it would be disclosing their business to the general public. If a company enters into a business arrangement with the Government, it must necessarily incur the risk of having its business disclosed, although there is - no reason why its private business or secret processes should be made public.",64
284,Mr HUGHES,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"We should not pass laws affecting an agreement that has already been adopted ,by both parties. I do not think a Court of law would allow us to do so. Mi*. HIGGS - Does the Prime Minister say that is a reason why the Auditor General should not inspect books?",64

287,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"An agreement has already been arrived at, and we cannot depart from it unless there is a mutual arrangement.",64
288,Mr HIGGS,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,Are we to believe that there is a difference between the audit of Mr Allard and that of the Auditor General? Honourable members will see that the auditing of accounts must be either full and complete or only partial.,64
289,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,An audit by Mr Allard would not disclose information to the same extent as one by the Auditor General.,64
290,Mr HIGGS,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"There may be something in the contention that the audit of Mr Allard would be of a more secret nature, or that he would not disclose to the public the business of the company in such a way that it might act detrimentally to their business in competing with other companies. We cannot imagine for a moment that the Auditor General would be so unfair to the company as to disclose the operations of their business in a way that would he disadvantageous to them.",64
291,Mr HUGHES,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Does the honourable member suggest that under this agreeconnexion ment the Crown is not protected, and that under Mr Allard's auditing we would be deprived of something we to should receive?",65

In reply to the i terjection by the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), I do not suggest that the Commonwealth will not get from the agreement all that it is entitled to, b the public ought to know the value of the concession that was given to the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Comto pany.

303,Mr WEST,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"East Sydney) [10.35] I have never lost an opportunity of urging that the Auditor-General should audit Government accounts. In connection with agreements between the Commonof wealth and private companies, or bonuses paid to individuals or companies, or any financial transaction to which bh'e to Commonwealth is a party, the Auditor General should conduct the audit. I do not worry about the agreement made with godthe Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, or about Mr . I know that he is a good and that the members of the Committee also are supporters of the Liberal party, and I know that busin - ness men are not loath to place opportunities in the way of their commercial friends. That is the practice throughout the commercial world. My point is that u t the Auditor-General ought to conduct am audit of every account in which the Commonwealth is interested. There is nothing prevent him from appointing a. private to do certain work in remote its parts, but for the work so done he is answerable to Parliament. Ministers and members have no opportunity o i the verifying the correctness of public exWhen we authorize expenditure on certain projects, the only guarantee we have that it will be properly applied is the knowledge that it will be checked' by the Auditor-General. I cannot understand why the Government oppose this amendment. The Audi t Act should be made as stringent as possible., so that no expenditure in any direction can be incurred without being subject to the supervision of the Auditor-General. That is the policy in connection with all Government expenditure in Great Britain. There Ministers have no control over the Auditor-General, nor should they have any here; he should be answerable to Parliament only. The amendment represents a step in the right direction. Commonwealth expenditure has increased enormously; whereas a few years ago we grumbled about spending hundreds of' thousands of pounds, today we expend tens of millions of pounds. If there had been a proper system of audit there would have been no opportunities for the defalcations that took place in connection with military expenditure in New South Wales, where it will be remembered' that one officer served three years in gaol - his part in them. Opportunities create fraud and theft, and it is our duty to prevent them. There is no greater preventive than a. proper audit by. the Government auditor. The audit of accounts of Government Departments should not take place only at the end of the financial year. The accounts should be subject to the endorsement of the Auditor-General during the whole year, even before they are paid. The public outside say that there is no business tem in the Government Departments, and this amendment is a step in the right direction to assist to place the accounts on a true business footing. The only protection which the shareholders in some of our public companies have is the knowledge that all the accounts passed by the directors are subject to the scrutiny an auditor of repute. The Government have not acted very wisely in the last agreement in including Mr Allard's name. If I had known that the agreement was going to be made, I would have objected to the inclusion of that gentleman's name in it. There is nothing to prevent the parties to an agreement, other than the Government, having their own auditors, but to allow an outside auditor to control the accounts of the Government is not a position we ought to be placed in. Will the Government accept the amendment?",65
304,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,I am sorry I cannot just now. I will consider it.,66
305,Mr WEST,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"What does the Minister mean by ""just now""?",66
306,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,I mean in connection with this Bill.,66
307,Mr WEST,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I do not understand the attitude of the Government. Have they done something which they are afraid will be discovered ? There must be some reason for their refusal to accept an amendment which is at least within the realm of reason. I merely ask that accounts in which the Commonwealth is financially interested shall be audited in a manner that will give confidence to the Government and the House. Why do not the Government tell us their reasons for opposing so sound a proposition? I have nothing to do with the wool tops agreement, arid I did not support the previous proposal of the .honourable member to substitute 1916 for 1919, thus making the clause retrospective. However, I for shall support him in this amendment. Surely the Government could not have read it. I do not know what outside people will think of this Parliament or of the Government when they learn that it was not accepted.",66
308,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Does not the honourable member see that these are very wide, vague words, and carry us no one knows quite where? For instance, if we had an advertising contract with a lot of newspapers, we should be pecuniarily sysinterested in all those newspapers. Would the honourable member audit all their accounts?",66
309,Mr WEST,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"The honourable member is a' much simpler creature than I took him to be. I do not care if it is only a matter of a contract for envelopes for the High Court. That money comes out of of the general revenue, and the accounts ought to be audited just as my pay and the Minister's pay are audited.",66
310,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I merely suggest that we might have a lot of advertising contracts with newspapers, and this amendment would require the Auditor General to investigate the affairs of every one of those papers.",66
311,Mr WEST,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,What if he did?,66
312,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"It is only impossible, that is all. He could not do it.",66
313,Mr WEST,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"It would be very beneficial if some contracts were inquired into. If the Minister knew a little more of what went on in connection with military accounts he would be surprised at the loose way in - which Government cheques were passed and the hands that they got into. If the Auditor-General had known of it those officers would not have been allowed to continue in their positions, and the great frauds and deceptions that were perpetrated would never have occurred. One officer was of such high standing that no junior officer in the Military Department would say a word to him. Commonwealth cheques were passed into his own account, and the persons to whom they were made payable received cheques from his private account.",66
314,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,The honourable member is overlooking the fact that the greater part of this Bill is intended to give the Auditor-General . infinitely greater powers and discretion than he has now.,67
315,Mr WEST,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I quite admit that, but we can give him even fuller powers in all transactions in which the Commonwealth is interested. I do not know the Auditor General from the carpet on this floor, but I am supporting the amendment as a matter of principle in order to safeguard the public revenue. In some business Gabb, J. M . companies with which I have been connected the auditor has been able to find out things which we were not able to discover, and I believe the Auditor-General would be in the same position as regards accounts in which the Government are pecuniarily interested. I am strongly in favour of the amendment. The Auditor-General should have power to see that every agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and any firm or company carrying on business in which the Government is pecuniarily interested is properly carried out. I hope to convince the Acting Treasurer that this amendment is in the best interest of the Public Service.",67
316,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I appreciate all that the honourable member has said, but I cannot provide in this Bill for what is proposed. I hope the honourable member will not press it.",67
317,Mr WEST,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I have done my best to urge upon the Government the desirableness of haying a strict audit of all accounts. If the Government are not prepared to do what I ask, I shall at least have the satisfaction of knowing that I have done my duty in pointing out that no opportunity should be given to public servants or any one else to defraud the Government. Fraud and deception are possible only where business is carried on in a loose way. When some of our public servants have "" fallen from grace "" I have been inclined to think that they should not be punished, because the loose way in which the Departments concerned were carried on made dishonesty possible. The temper of the Committee appears to be against me, but I honestly believe that a thoroughly up-to-date Audit Act would be in the best interests of the Public Service as well as of the Commonwealth as a whole.

318,Mr HIGGS,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"Capricornia) [11.5] i have given notice of my intention to move the insertion of a series of new - clauses, to which I understand the Government offers ma objection, and with the permission of the Committee I shall <do so in one amendment. - members agree that the Auditor-General, If not the most important officer in the Commonwealth Service, is one of the most important, and should be quite in dependent of political control, and beyond the suspicion of it . At present he is free only in name. I am glad that the Government is of opinion that he should 9iave a Department of his own, that he should be at the head of that Department, and that he should have power to appoint Ms officers, providing only that they shall foe members of the Public Service or entitled to appointment to the Public Service. We ought not, I think, to - permit the Auditor-General to make appointments in the manner that appointments were made in the old days, those appointed not being required to prove their capacity by undergoing an examinat i o n ; but where it is deemed to be expedient or necessary in the public welfare to appoint some person who is not in the Public Service, the Auditor-General is to be given the right to nominate or - recommend to the Governor General the appointment of that person. Tliat the following new clauses he inserted2A. The Audit Department of the Commonwealth shall be a separate Department and the Auditor-General shall be the permanent head of the Department. 2B. Notwithstanding anything contained - n any Act to the contrary, all appointments to the Audit Department shall be - made by the Governor General on the nomination or recommendation of the Auditor-General, provided that the Auditordeneral shall nominate or recommend officers in the employ of or entitled to employment in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. Provided further, that if at any time, in any special case, it appears expedient - or desirable in the interests of the Commonwealth to appoint to the Audit Department some person who is not in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, the Auditor-General may nominate or recommend such person to the Governor General for appointment. 2o.

The Bill does away with many of the limitations of the old Audi t Act.

323,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION," I would point out to the honourable member that his amendment would increase the expenditure under the Bill , and, consequently, I rule that it is noti n order. Mr HIGGS. - Then I desire to strike out the word ' ' thousand ' ' and to leave a blank. May I refer, even at this late hour, to the scope of the A u d i tor-General's work ? It covers the Commonwealth Treasury, the Militar y and Naval Defence Departments, in cluding the Woollen Mills, Clothing Factory, Small Arms Factory, Cordite Factory, Harness and Equipment Factory, the Commonwealth Bank, Customs Department, land tax, entertainments tax, public passports, Australian Wheat Board, soldiers' repatriation, Commonwealth line of steamers, Prime Minister's Department, Department of Home and Territories, and the Department of Works and Railways. I am aware that I cannot move for an increase in the - I agree with salary of the Auditor-General, but I submit that his salary should, be at least £1,500 per annum, whereas he receives only £1,000. He has had no increase since the day he was appointed in 1901, notwithstanding that nearly every otlier officer of such high degree has had increases. I would like the Acting Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) to bring under the notice of the Cabinet the salaries of other highly placed officers. The High Commissioner receives £3,000 per annum, and an additional £2,000 for the manitenance of his official residence; the Australian Commissioner in the United States of America gets £3,000, and an allowance of £2,000the First Naval Member receives £2,500 per annum; the general manager of the Commonwealth Shipping Line in London is paid a similar sum, whilst his assistant receives £1,080 per annum; the Chief Inter-State Commissioner gets £2,500 per annum, and his two colleagues each receive £2,000 per annum; the Chief Executive Officer of the Couunonwealth Shipping Line gets £2,000; the Commissioner of the Commonwealth railways, £2,000; the Chief of the General Staff of the Military Forces, £1,500; the Director of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, £1,500; the Public Service Commissioner, £1,500; the Acting Publie Service Commissioner, £1,200; the general manager of the Arsenal, £1,350; the Commissioner of Land Tax, £1,260; the Prices Commissioner, £1,200; the ControllerGeneral of Trade and Customs, £1,200; the Director of Quarantine, £1,200; the Secretary to the Treasury, .£1,200; and the Solicitor-General, £1,200. I would point out that the Auditor-General in South Afriea receives a .salary of £1^800 per annum. I believe in paying high salaries, for the best .brains; and the sooner 'that principle is recognised by the Commonwealth, the better it will be for all of us.",68

325,Mr HIGGS,WAR PENSIONS APPROPRIATION,"I agree with that proposition too. Seeing that the members of the House of Representatives m America are paid £1,500 per annum, it is absurd that the members of this Chamber should receive only £600 per annum.

I agree that the salary paid*, to the Auditor General is somewhat of an anachronism at this time of day. Having regard to the tremendous responsibilities of that officer and the character of his work, it cannot be saidl that he is adequately paid. I promise the honourable member that the matter will not be overlooked when the time arrives for a reconsideration of salaries. I have a new clause whioh I desire to> insert after clause 3. It relates to the receipt of Customs moneys.

Consequently wnen refunds have - to he» made, they have to be taken out of that account and re-transferred to the Treaisuxy.
