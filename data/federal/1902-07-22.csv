4,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,"Some time before we adjourned last month I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs if he would consent - to the payment by the States Gop.m., vernments of - bonuses which hod been voted prior to the date mentioned in the Constitution, which is, I think, the 30th June, 1898. Acting upon the advice of the he told me that that would be done; but I am now informed by the VicMinister of Agriculture that, although he is anxious to make certain payments, he failed to .get the necessary consent from Federal Government. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs if there is any reason for withholding this consent any longer.",14
5,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"The Victorian Minister for Agriculture ""hasmade an extraordinary mistake. The proper course to be taken in regard to these bonuses is to send an application to the Federal Government for the approval of their payment in a particular which case, and we then either approve or disapprove of it . I had heard it suggested that these applications were being delayed, disand on the 29th Apri l I made inquiry as to whether it was a fact. In reply to an inquiry which I caused to be made at the office of the Victorian Minister for Agriculture, I received from him a letter which says, amongst other thingsIn replytoyour letter of the loth, asking for information relative to the payment of bonuses by this department, I have the honour to inform you that at present there* are no claims awaiting Federal approval. Since then, one application for approval has been received in my office-o n the 1st Julyand the approval was given on the 5th. CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATION.",14

SOLOMON - Has the Minister seen a report of the case, in which the presiding magistrate is made to state that he regretted that the court had no power do other than inflict a £5 fine, and that, view of the absurdity of it, he would grant operation ? no costs ? Does not the Minister think it advisable that more discretion as to a mum fine should be given to the courts, that the Act should be amended to allow I that to be done 1",15
10,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"- I do not think so. The provision in the Customs Act which prohibits the importation of convict-made goods was copied from English legislation. That provision must either be a dead letter or it must be enforced. We propose force it, without in the slightest degree gesting any moral blame against the gentleficials man concerned in the case to which referment ence has been made.",15
11,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Does the Minister intend to prosecute, even when he knows beforehand that there is no moral blame attaching 1",15

20,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"An elaborate return is in course of preparation, because I think it is wise, on this occasion certainly, and perhaps next year, to give very full tails for the information of honourable bers. This return will show the receipts from each item in the Tariff for each month, comparing State with State. Unfortunately I am not able to complete the return because I have not obtained all the necesreduced sary figures from Western Australia. These I hope to receive very shortly, and then shall be able to lay the particulars before honourable members. DEFENC E RETRENCHMENT . Sir LANGDON BONYTHON - I dehave sire to know whether the Minister representQueenstown ing the Minister for Defence can answer question I asked him some weeks ago as to how it is proposed to distribute the Defence retrenchment, amounting to £130,000, which was decided upon by this House 1 Can he state the proportions to be borne by the Naval and Military departments respectively ?",16
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I cannot give the honourable member any details, even roughly, at present, but I can tell him that approximately the naval expenditure will in his be reduced by £30,000, and the military South expenditure by £100,000. ADJOURNMENT. TELEPHOXE RECULATIONS.",16
22,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I desire the to move the adjournment of the House to of discuss a definite matter of urgent importance, namely, ""The effect of the new regulations recently issued by the Government "" affecting the postal, telegraph, and of the receipts telephone system. Rive honourable members liaving risen in Question proposed.",16
23,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Some time ago the the Government issued a regulation which provides that upon trunk telephone lines an extra charge shall be made for sending telephone messages. I now desiie to ask what constitutes a trunk line. There is a teleTreaphone line between Queenstown and Gora manston on the west coast of Tasmania, the between the two places being 2^ to 3 miles. That line is classed as a trunk line for telephone purposes. The residents of Queenstown pay £ 6 per annum for the use of their telephones, and £ 1 extra for the privilege of sending telephone messages to Gormanston. Under the new regulation dei t is claimed that the line from Queenstown memto - Gormanston is a trunk line, and the Government have consequently issued orders to the Deputy Postmaster-General of Tasmania that the price charged for telephones yet, at Queenstown and Gormanston should be to £ 6 per annum, and that every time a resident of one town wants to comI municate with a resident of the other he must go to the telegraph office and pay 6d. for the privilege of using the telephone for a few minutes. The result is that nearly all the people of Queenstown ordered their telephones to be removed. is a very compact settlement, the and people can easily communicate with each other without the telephone, but the privilege of telephoning to Gormanston was highly valued. I communicated with the Postmaster-General, and after waiting several days I received a reply to the effect that no change could be made. The people of Queenstown then gave orders that their telephones should be taken down. This will involve the department in a loss of .£700 per annum, which will not be recouped by means of the Telegraph department, because the business between the two towns will not warrant the expense of sending telegrams. I find that subscribers to the telephone system in Melbourne can communicate with the outlying suburbs, such as St. Kilda and AVindsor, without any extra charge.",16
24,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The subscribers can teleStates, phone from Melbourne to Mordialloc, a distance of 16 miles.",17
25,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I protest against the revenue-destroying proclivities of the Government. I do not know how many telephones have actually been taken down in Queenstown, but the order went out that all should be removed, and twenty were taken away in one afternoon. Regulations suitable to a large city like Melbourne are not adapted to the circumstances of a mining town, because in the latter case the residents can communicate with each other without much difficulty, and can very well dispense with the telephone. I desire to enter my protest against such a foolish and bungling regulation. I have another cause of complaint. As a member of this Parliament I desired to communicate with the Postmaster-General upon a matter of public business, and instead of being allowed to send a telegram free of cost I had to put my hand in my pocket and pay for it .  able member ?",17
26,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Why should I ? The regulations provide that members of the Commonwealth Parliament shall enjoy the same privileges as are accorded to memcentres bers of the State Legislatures. Members the State Legislatures can communicate with their Ministers upon public business without paying.,17
27,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Not in all cases.,17
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"In Tasmania they can, but it is not so in all the States.",17
29,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Canno t a member of I the Victorian Parliament communicate a member of the Victorian Ministry on public business without payment ?,17
30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,I never heard of it.,17
31,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I am afraid there are a good many things that the Minister has not heard of. A member of the Eederal Parliament should not be called upon to pay for telegramS despatched fo the Postmaster General or other Ministers upon public business. On the occasion referred to I was endeavouring to save the Commonwealth £700 per annum, and I should not have been compelled to put my hand in my own pocket. I am in a worse position as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament than is a member of the Tasmanian Legislature. In Canada, and in the United and other parts of the world, members of Parliament have the privilege of communicating free of cost with Ministers upon matters of public business. This applies even to cases in which the telegraph lines are held by private companies. The whole system of federation was based upon the idea of uniting the people and improving their means of communication, but the administration is working in an opposite direction. Unless the causes of complaint to which I have directed attention are removed, I shall strongly advocate the abolition of all franking and other privileges. One of the results'of the present condition of affairs is that federal members are being ignored, and the electors are relying on the members of the local Legislatures to look after their interests. The Commonwealth member is merely a figurehead, and apparently possesses no privileges or rights whatever.",17
32,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," T have not had the experience of the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, in conwith the use of what are known as "" main trunk linesf neither am I concerned with the privileges enjoyed by members of this - or of State Parliaments. But I wish to mention a very valid grievance of small in respect of the regulations to which of the honourable member has directed attention. In New South Wales-and especially in the electorate which I have the honour 1 to represent-there are a number of sparsely populated settlements. Some of these are mining settlements, and others have been created by making the land available for occupation. Of recent years telephonic comwith | munication has been one of the means adopted for bringing these settlements closer touch with civilization. ties have been promoted in the districts to which I refer to such an extent that a large - number of private persons have incurred the expense of connecting their residences by telephone with the nearest telegraph office. Indeed, some of the out-stations, which are situated. 15, 20, and even 30 miles from the head station, are regularly worked by this means. 1 think that the policy which formerly operated in New South Wales, and. for which the honourable member for Parramatta is largely responsible, seeing that he introduced these up-todate methods of communicating, isolated settlements, is one which commends itself to the people, and certainly it is worthy of the consideration of the Eederal postal authorities. Prior to the transfer of the Post and Telegraph department to the Commonwealth, I had placed before the head of that department in New South Wales applications for telephonic extension to several settlements. Some of these were approved, and others were under consideration when the transfer took place. The reply which I received to these applications was that the Postmaster-General was considering - question of uniform treatment in connection with this matter. Within the past week I have obtained the result of that uniform policy, and I wish to show that it practically prohibits the adoption of up-to-date - methods of communication. I have in my' hand one of the replies wmich I have received, and it will put before honourable members the present position more concisely than I can. It reads as follows :-'Adverting to your communication of the 18th October last, and my reply thereto of 24th idem, respecting an application made through you by Mr T. Nosh, Long Plain, Navromine, secretary to the I'avvendale and Wollan Billan farmers' and Settlers' Association, for the establishment. of telephonic communication with Wallan Billan, I have the honor to inform you that under the new regulations of this department, such communication can only be provided when funds are sivailable (which is not the case at present) on the cash guarantee system, under which persons - desiring the erection of a telegraph or telephone .line are required to deposit with the Postmaster General a sum equal to two-thirds of the cost of constructing the line and supplying the instruments, plus the cost of operating same for a period ot five years, and subject to the following .conditions, namely1. The amount so deposited to be placed to the credit of the Postmaster-General, in a Government savings bank, and Mr Brown. into the Postmaster-General to have power These facili- to withdraw at the end of each complete year a sum equal to the difference between (a) the telegraph (or telephone) revenue derived from such line during that year, and (b) one-fifth of two-thirds of the cost of constructing the line, plus the total cost .of operating for such year. 2. At the expiration of the term offiveyears the amount of the deposit, with inter-. est allowed thereon by the Government savings bank authorities, less any sum or sums deducted as above, to be returned to the guarantors. The cash deposit required for a line between Wallan BalUiu and Narromine, via Farrendule, would be about £688 (is. 8d., namely £623 6s. 8d. - two-third s of the estimated cost of the neceswith sary line and instruments, and £65-the cost of operating, if fixed at £13 per annum. If, however,. .Farrendale and Wallan Billan were connected with Dandaloo instead of Nai-romine, a cash deposit of about £631 13s. 4d. would be required, namely-£56 6 13s. 4d - two-third s of the estimated cost of the necessary line and instruments, and £65-the cost of operating for five years. The amount of revenue likely to be derived from the proposed telephone line is estimated at £32 per annum. I. have the honor to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, J. DALGABXO, Deputy Postmaster-General.",17
33,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,What is the distance 1 the,18
34,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"It is something like 30 miles. I want to show how these regulations operate. To the west of Dandaloo is another settlement known, as Lansdale, and whilst the honourable member for Parramatta was Postmaster-General of New South Wales I applied to him on behalf of the settlers there for telephonic communication with Dandaloo. An estimate was made, and only a simple guarantee was asked for. No arbitrary condition, such as the enforced payment of a sum of money into the bank .to the credit of the Postmaster-General, was imposed. In connection with that work, which involved the construction of 30 miles of line, all that was asked for was a guarantee of between £ 6 0 and £ 7 0 . The settlers, however, were rather afraid to face such an obligation. I ascertained that the postal revenue derived from the settlement exceeded the cost of the mail service, and upon representations beingmade to him the Postmaster-General decided to place the surplus as a set-off against any loss incurred in connection with the establishment of the telegraphic or telephonic service. The result of the adoption of this enlightened policy was that the settlers were required to give a guarantee of only -£30, instead of £ 6 0 , as originally suggested. This guarantee was readily forthcoming; the line was constructed, and has proved to be revenue producing from, its inception. Indeed, the income from this source exceeded the anticipations of those who were interested in the carrying out of the work, so that the guarantors have never been - called upon to pay anything. For the past five or six years that settlement has enjoyed the advantages of this up-to-date means of communication. There is another little settlement in the same class of .country which has to contend with similar obstacles. - Under the new regulations, its residents will be required to place a sum of £631 in the Savings Bank to the credit of the Postmaster-General as a guarantee that the department will not suffer loss by providing these facilities. This money will continue to lie in the bank for five years, even if line prove a payable one. From my experience of these back-country settlements, I claim that it should be the aim of the Federal Government to afford them means of communication which will assist settlement and render the advantages of civilization accessible. It is lamentable to think that, should an accident occur in an isolated settlement where there are women and children, the only way of communicating with the nearest medical man, who is perhaps 30 or 40 miles distant, is by messenger on horseback. I unhesitatingly affirm that the policy adopted by New South Wales in this connection was an enlightened one, whilst that of the Federal Government is a retrogressive one. The demands which are now being made upon the small settlement to which I have referred will absolutely prevent the settlers from securing the advantages which they have hitherto enjoyed. If this sort of thing does, not make federation stink in the nostrils of the country people nothing will do so. I think that the Government will be acting wisely if they review the regulations and - see whether it is not possible to frame them on the enlightened lines adopted by the postal authorities in New South Wales prior to the transfer of that department to the Commonwealth. I have other communications of a similar character. I asked for a short extension from the telegraph station of Ungarie to a small settlement at Bena. That would have been carried, out under the old system of a guarantee of something like £30, the distance, being not nearly so large as in the case I have mentioned - Communications which I hold in my hand are similar to the one I have read, with the difference that in this case £2.51 13s. 4d, is required to be placed to the credit of the Postmaster-General. In the interests of the settlements I have mentioned I hope the Government will see their way to alter the regulations.",18
35,Mr GB EDWARDS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," It was inevitable that some such discussion as this must take place sooner or later. There is a great deal of dissatisfaction with the administration of the Postiil department, the regulations not. being what we were led to expect when a re-organization was entered upon. Much difficulty has been caused in my own constituency ; and I think that we suffer through not having in this House the the Minister who supervises this important department. The only opportunity hitherto afforded in discussing these matters has been on the Estimates, and, under the circumstances, there has not been that criticism for which the administration calls. I am inclined to think that it would have been better had the motion taken a wider form, and had the whole question been fully ventilated. Under the regulations any 25 persons can, on application, obtain a telephone exchange; but in Redfern, which is the most important centre in my district, there is no exchange, and when application was made, the answer given was that there was already a connection with another exchange two or three miles away. The whole conduct of some of the exchanges shows an unwarrantable lack of administrative ability. Redfern is tacked on to a less important station at a distance, though the former is a business centre larger than Richmond in Victoria.",19
36,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,There is no exchange at Richmond.,19
37,Mr GB EDWARDS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The absence of an exchange in Redfern is not the only difficulty. There is no exchange in the whole of my electorate, which is one-fourth the size of the city of Sydney, the only communication being with other stations which are already congested with business. If the department had any business ability, they would consider the question of re-organizing ""the exchanges and distributing the work. Another important point is that sufficient regard is not had to the object of making the department pay. I am perfectly certain that the want of communication will prevent the business paying as it would pay if iii the hands of business men. In. Redfern, Botany, Alexandra, Waterloo, all flourishing manufacturing districts in my electorate, people would make much more use of the telephone if an exchange were established in their midst. At present if a subscriber wishes to communicate with a man living, perhaps, only two blocks away, he has to ring up an' exchange four or five miles distant. The department seems to require re-organization from top to bottom. first place, this House does not seem to have enough power of criticism in the absence of the Minister; secondly, there is no uniformity of system throughout the Commonwealth ; and thirdly, there is required some power of decentralization under which the local .Deputy Postmasters-General will be able to deal with trumpery details, the settlement of which is at present postponed from time to time in order that they may be referred to head-quarters, where business appears to be congested. Only the other day I pointed out to the Deputy Postmaster General of Sydney the disgracefully dirty condition of a certain post-oifice in Redfern. That office was so dirty that, had it been in the hands of private people, it would have been condemned by the local authorities : and I believe complaints on this score are also made in regard to the post-offices in Sydney and Melbourne. All such matters as these in connection with local offices have to be referred to the Postmaster-General in Melbourne, even though only £50 may be required for repairs. seems to be blunder after blunder. my district the department shut up two offices which had heen in existence for a number of years, and were paying, and it was only after strong representations permission was given to continue the business at these offices pending an ultimate decision. All these matters should be dealt with in a business-like spirit. The more facilities, in reason, which are given, the more business there will be, and the more revenue will result. A deputation waited on the Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney the other day, when this matter was referred to, and that gentleman was reported as having passed some reflections on the difficulties which were in the way. The Deputy master - General, however, was misreported ; what he said was that Mr G. IJ. Edward*. was always a great deal of difficulty in referring matters to head - quarters. In any big private business details would be left to the local representative. The honourable member for Tasmania, Mr. O'Malle}', is perfectly justified in bringing this matter before the House in order that the Government may know that throughout the length and breadth of the States there is a feeling of dissatisfaction, and a desire that the department should be reorganized on business-like lines. I understand that the Postmaster-General has been In the asked to make a business-like statement of the results of the administration under the Commonwealth: and, if he did so, the information given would prove a useful guide to this House, because we should, in all probability, be shown where revenue is lost through want of better management.",19
38,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," Actua l experience has disclosed a number of serious anomalies and absurdities in connection with the regulations of the 5th June, 1902. We must, of course, give credit to the Postal authorities for the best of intentions in promulgating these new regulations. No doubt the variety of conditions which had to be dealt with account for some of the complaints which have been made. The honourable member for Tasmania, Mr . O'Malley, has drawn attention to an anomaly which requires some explanation. In the regulations there does not appear to be a definition of what is to constitute a trunk line or long-distance telephone. The distance may be a mile or two, or 25 miles - ther e is no limit. Some effort should There certainly be made to attain uniformity, and In a definition given of what is to constitute a trunk line, on which these special charges are - made. It does seem absurd that the line between Queenstown and Gorthat manston, which are only two and a half miles apart, should be treated as a trunk line, w'hile the lines in other States between many towns which are five or six miles apart, come within anothercategory. I have no doubt that now attention has been drawn to the matter, steps will be taken to rectify the anomaly. I take the opportunity of reviving a question which was brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General a fortnight ago by a large deputation, representing the people Post- of Bendigo, Ballarat, and Geelong, in regard so the time limit on trunk lines. there Hitherto in A ictoria the time limit has 7 been five minutes, and the charge between, say,' Melbourne and Bendigo, Is. 6d. That five minutes has now been cut down to three minutes, and the view of the deputation was that the latter is utterly inadequate when it is desired to conduct important business transactions. The brokers of Bendigo and Ballarat, and the merchants of Geelong, pointedout that in many cases it was utterly impossible to complete a conversation and make it effective within that time.",20
39,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The time limit on the trunk line between Newcastle and Sydney is three minutes, and there is a big business done.",21
40,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The limit is three minutes everywhere, except in Victoria.",21
41,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"In Victoria the people have been trained, and are accustomed, to five minutes. I believe that in many cases it is difficult for a subscriber, say, in Melbourne, to get in communication with a subscriber in Ballarat. It may happen that the business man at Ballarat is in the exchange, and by the time he has been found and ' brought to the telephone, one or two of the minutes .have elapsed, with the result that the conversation is rendered abortive by its being cut off in the middle. I am aware that the Postmaster General said that in other countries the limit is three minutes; but, as a compromise, the deputation suggested a regulation to the effect that a subscriber might have the option of extending the conversation for five minutes, on paying an extra proportionate charge. The Postmaster-General took a note of the suggestion, which he promised to consider.",21
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Does the honourable and learned member say that a subscriber is arbitrarily cut off at the end of three minutes, whether or not the conversation is finished ?",21
43,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Yes . There is ho desire on the part of subscribers to monopolise the wire, and hence the suggestion to the Postmaster-General. In all probability three minutes will - be sufficiently long in many cases; but it is desired to have the option of extending the time to five minutes on the condition I have indicated. hope the Attorney-General will support the view which I am now presenting, or, at any rate, bring it under the notice of the Postmaster-General. As a result of the reduced time limit, business on the long distance 4.1 u telephones has fallen off considerably. If the public demand increased time for the discharge of business and are prepared to pay for that time, their demand ought to be met, and if one line is not sufficient, another ought to be erected. There are many points in the regulations which require revision, and the Postmaster-General ought to welcome these observations and criticisms, which are intended to meet the requirements and the convenience of the public ",21
44,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," It is becoming more apparent every .day that it would be an advantage to honourable members here,, who more particularly represent localities, to have the Postmaster-General's departmentrepresented in this branch of the Legislature. I suppose, however, that the absence of"" that Minister cannot be remedied untilanother Government is in - office; so that we may dismiss the matter, at any rate foia time. I think that the Postal department is taking the proper course in insisting upon a cash deposit of some kind from those who ask for these lines, because I know that, while in New South Wales a written guarantee to make good any probable deficiency was required, deficiencies occurred times without number, and in no case were the guarantors; asked to pay the money for the payment of which they had rendered themselves-.. responsible.",21
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,The honourable'member is wrongly informed. When I was Postmaster-General the department collected money from guarantors in some cases.,21
46,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The Deputy Postmaster General assured me the other day that he did not remember an instance in which money so'guaranteed had been collected, and I know of many instances in which it has not been collected. It is folly to pretend to place the administration of the department upon a business footing, and not takeordinary business precautions. But I have a letter here, which I have received from, the department in regard to a suggested telephone line, which seems to me to go to the other extreme. The department ask,, in connection with an application for a telephone line in my district, not only to be guaranteed the payment of two-thirds of the I cost of construction, but also for the placing in the bank of a sum of moucy to"" cover the estimated cost of five years' working of the line, although they admit in the letter itself that the estimated revenue - should more than cover expenses. That is going to a vidiculous extreme. They have officers skilled in estimating the probable revenue from mining, pastoral, and agricultural districts, and their estimates are generally very conservative. Therefore, whenever it is considered that the revenue from a line is likely to more than cover its annual working expenses, the department ought not to ask for a guarantee in respect to the working expenses. have a still more important matter to mention. Some weeks ago the Secretary to the Post Office informed me that a regulation, which would permit of the licensing for use in - connection with the Commonwealth services of lines erected in the cheapest manner possible by the people whom they were to serve, was under consideration. If that system is adopted,' I am convinced that small populations 'can be connected with the Commonwealth lines practically without cost to the Government, and without the need for the ordinary guarantees. In my and, I dare say, it is the same in other districts-the local squatters fences to carry telephone wires being taken over gateways and roads upon poles. I have spoken over such lines with the greatest satisfaction, and on two occasions to places 40 miles distant. eagle is a township in my electorate ten miles distant from Young, but onlythree or four miles from the nearest telegraph line, which runs along the railway. If the fences were used to carry, the wire the township could be connected with Young, irrespective of the cost of instruments, for, perhaps, £10 or £15 ; whereas the department ask for a guarantee of £173, which is' not likely to be raised by so small a community. therefore, that the Minister will see the desirability of promptly proclaiming regulations which will permit of telephone extensions of the kind to which I refer. I am satisfied that in nearly every case that will .get over the difficulty of guarantees, aud that the lines will be found quite sufficient for - ordinary business for the present, at all events. When the traffic increases to a certain point, it will be possible for the department to put up a permanent line, and to take over the whole work. In nearly every instance in which telephonic, connection is asked for, the working expenses would be more than covered by the revenue received, and if the department is not asked to undertake the construction of an expensive line, I do not see that any guarantee need be 3fr. Wattoit. demanded. I trust that something will be done to amend, and to add .to, the regulations governing these matters, because they are in a most unsatisfactory state now.",21
47,Mr CLARKE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I desire to urge upon the Government, in the most friendly manner, the desirability of revising the regulations under which telephones may be extended into, country districts. Under But I the New South Wales State system those living in country districts could obtain telephone connexions by simply guaranteeing the payment of interest upon the cost of construction-, and general maintenance, but now they are being called upon to deposit in cash two-thirds of the actual cost of constructing the line and supplying the instruments, plus the cost of operating the same for a period of five years, before the work will be undertaken at all.",22
48,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"That is prohibitive. district- Mr CLARKE - Yes . The people in the smaller districts are not able, to find the use their large amount of money which is generally lines, the necessary, although they would be willing to enter into a legal guarantee to become responsible for the interest on the cost of construction, and working expenses. I Mont- have here a letter from the department, dated 16th July, which deals with an application for an extension which is two or three years old. Before the department was taken over by the Commonwealth, I had prevailed upon the New South Wales authorities to practically agree to the erection of the line. If it had been erected then, the guarantors would have been called upon to find, speaking from memory, I trust, something like £ 2 S a year, but they are now being asked by the department to pay £ 4 0 3 into the Savings Bank to the credit of the Postmaster-General. Such a request is absurd and outrageous. As the honourable member for Bland has suggested, if the Government cannot see their way to alter this regulation, they should allow people residing in distant parts of the country, to whom the telephone is the only adjunct of civilization which they enjoy, to undertake the construction of lines for themselves, to ultimately become the property of the Government. It is astonishing how telephone lines pay after they have been in existence for a few years: the facilities for sending messages always creates a desire to send messages. I trust 11 that the Postal department will not pursue a policy which will render federation obnoxious to the people of the country. I have put other cases before the Postmaster-General, but without avail. There appears to be some cast-iron rule in the department from which it is impossible to get away, and advice, no matter how tendered, is practicall}' ignored. Whenever I have given advice to the department I have done so in a spirit of friendliness. I have not asked them to do anything unreasonable in view of the necessities of revenue, but have tried to prevail on them to do what will benefit the people of the country. But whatever I have put before the Postmaster General has been quietly ignored, until I am pretty well tired of it, and much resent it . I am ashamed to send this letter on to the people interested in the matter to which it refers, and I have in my pocket Another letter of the same tenor. I am sorry the Postmaster-General is not a member of this House, so that we could put these matters directly before him. The ' present state of affairs is giving serious dissatisfaction in New South Wales, and this dissatisfaction will increase if some alteration is not made. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. (Parramatta) - I , Itkeotherhonorable.memberSjhavesomepostal grievances, and I think that it is time they were seriously looked into by the Postmaster General, so that they may be remedied, because it is no pleasure to us to have to anthem so constantly. The new regulations which have been published are altogether of a retrograde character. Honourable members have been asking for uniformity, but the uniformity which has been obtained is all in the direction of retrogression. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo complains that the time limit on the line between Melbourne and Bendigo has been reduced from five to three minutes, upon the ground that three minutes is the limit elsewhere. I remember that when the first long-distance telephone was opened in New South Wales, the time limit was fixed at three minutes, because the officers of the department told me that that, was the recognised limit elsewhere. The honourable and learned member was similarly informed that the time allowance was to be cut down to three minutes, because that was the rule elsewhere. Would it not be wise to err on the side of conferring additional advantages upon the public, rather than to limit the facilities afforded to them ? This is a purely business question, 41 E i and the greater facilities that can be extended to the public, the more we shall popularize the service, and the more profitable it will become. Too great a tendency is being shown to square accounts, but that is not the way in which the department can be made to pay. The balance may be squared very quickly, if that is the only object ; but if reasonable facilities are denied to the public, the balance will very soon be on the wrong side. When I proposed to reduce the telephone fees in Sydney, I was told by the officers of the department that we should incur a heavy loss, but during the twelve months immediately following the reduction in the charges, the business of the department was trebled, and it paid handsomely. The more business-like the administration, the greater the chance of success for the department. I do not agree with the honourable member for Bland that a,cash guarantee should be given. There .ought to be no cash guarantee in connection with these lines.",22
49,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"If that system is not adopted, a number of places will have to go without telephone lines.",23
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,All that should be required by the department is an assurance that a reasonable amount of business will be done.,23
51,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,They say in some cases that the business is not sufficient.,23
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Then the line ought not to be constructed.,23
53,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"If guarantees are required in connection with' telephone lines, why should not the same principle be extended to the building of post-offices?",23
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Precisely ; one is just as much a public convenience as the other. The cash guarantees are being insisted upon, because under the old system of administration there was a little leakage. A few of the guarantees were not met.",23
55,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Hardl y any of them were met.,23
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The amount involved by the guarantees would amount to a tiifle compared with the advantages conferred upon the public as a whole by the facilities afforded. We can, however, have nothing perfect in this world, and our telephone system will not be extended or perfected under a system of cash guarantee-that will not give the public the business facilities necessary to insure success of the system. What man would pay £600 into the Treasury, to lie there for years, in order to. secure the the telephone 1 The idea is absurd. It has been shown that in some cases a guarantee has been given amounting to only £ 3 0 if one community can secure a telephone system for that amount, is it likely that others will risk £600 ? The only effect any such system will be to render it absoPost-office lutely impossible to carry on telephone ness in the back country. It is this part our territory that we should specially consider in connection with the telephone service, and I am sorry to see that one of the faciliconvenience ties which was granted under my administration. tion of the Post and Telegraph department of New South Wales has been taken away. I allowed station owners to construct their own telephones, subject to our control at the connecting ' point. For that we charged them £ 1 per annum, because we had to assume the responsibility where lines crossed public roads. This proved very great advantage, because i the people of the towns into direct communication with those on the outlying stations, and I regret exceedingly that steps are being 'taken to deprive stationregulations owners of the facilities hitherto enjoyed. Wo endeavoured to recover some of the guarantees, but in nearly all cases a very good reason was shown for their non-payalthough ment. Perhaps only one or two out of four or five guarantors could be called upon, because the others had left the district. This was the explanation in eight cases out of ten, and there is no justification for imposing such conditions as those now provided for. case cited by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, is one in which the regulation regarding trunk lines is being pushed to an absurd extreme, and which the rule is being administered withstances out the slightest regard for common sense. These rules have to be made, but they should be administered with a full regard for the interests of the public. It is anomaly that a charge should be made telephone messages upon a line 2h miles in length, whilst no fee is exacted on lines 13 or 14 miles long. The case should only need to be stated in order to have the remedy applied by the Postmasterbe General. Mr Joseph Cook.",23
57,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I wired to the Postthe master-General and asked him to suspend the regulation, but he would not do it .",24
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Has the honoruse of able member seen the Minister since ?,24
59,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,NO .,24
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The honourable , and member ought to have seen the Minister, because I can scarcely believe that the Minister would justify the action taken. of I admit, however, that the trend of the administration generally is to busitake from the people the facilities which of they have hitherto enjoyed, and that the one idea of the authorities seems to be to bring out a good balance-sheet. The public is apparently the last consideraThat is not the way in which the Post and Telegraph department in a young community should be administered. Business administration should be introduced into the control of the services, which should not be choked for the purpose of bringing out a favourable balance - sheet. It is only by the making the public convenience the first of object that the ultimate success of the t brought department can be assured. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON (South Australia) - The position of Adelaide in any regard to the new postal and telegraph is, to say the least of it , peculiar. Much irritation exists there at the present moment, and this would have taken a more acute form but for the curious fact that, the regulations came into force on the first of the present month, they have not yet been published in South Australia.",24
61,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Darling Downs) I can sympathize with honourable members who wish to see telephonic communication extended in the country districts, but we The must recognise the difficulties with which the Postmaster-General has to contend. 1I have presented to him several requests for the extension of telephone service, particuin larly to remote centres, and in some inI. felt that there was justice in his demand for proof that the service would yield a certain amount of revenue. We may disapprove of the stringency of the conditions, an but it seems necessary that some stipulation for should be made to guard the department against heavy loss. I think that a cash deother posit should be made, but the Postmaster General has erred on the side of stringency in requiring such a large guarantee. It must remembered that the telephone is not established for the short period covered by the guarantee, but practically for all time, and - less the community to which telephone facilities are given is a progressive one, the departdeclined ment must ultimately become a heavy loser. The point to which I desire specially to refer is that mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, namely, the three minutes' limit. Complaints have been made in Queensland, especially where long distance telephones are in use. In the case of Warwick, which is about 169 miles from .Brisbane, a fee of 2s. 6d. has to be paid for the privilege of conversing by telephone for three minutes. As a rule the telephone is used by merchants to settle the prices of goods which have been ordered by their customers. .During these conversations, invoices have to be consulted perhaps,' and before any conclusion can be arrived at, the persons conversing are rung off. Then a delay occurs, and they have to be reconnected in order that the business may be concluded, the charge made for the extended time bringing the total fee up to 5s. The people in Warwick think that it would be fair and reasonable if a reduced charge were made for the extension of the time beyond the first three minutes.",24
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"That is done in New South Wales. Mr L . E, GROOM - It is not so in Queensland. It has been represented to me by the Chamber of Commerce and by the municipal authorities in Warwick either that the charge should be reduced, or that a reduced charge of, say, Is. 3d. should be made for the extra minutes required to carry on long conversations. An increase of the facilities in this way would undoubtedly lead to an enlarged business and an improvement in the revenue. Mr ' WATKINS (Newcastle) - I desire to complain of the new regulations. There is no more reason for demanding a cash guarantee in connection with the construction of a telephone line than in the case of the erection of post-offices, or the carrying out of any other works for the public convenience. Officers are employed by the Post and Telegraph department tb ascertain whether certain lines will pay, and I do not know of any cases in which a telephone - service has been extended without a fair assurance of Sufficient revenue. In several cases where the reports showed that the lines would yield a substantial return over and above the working expenses, the department have absolutely refused to provide a service. un- In connection with certain long-distance telephones the authorities have absolutely to establish a double service, even though the returns show that the construction of a second line would pay handsomely. Another hardship to which I would direct attention consists in compelling a private subscriber, who desires to speak from his place of business to another centre over a trunk line, to pay threepence for connecting him with such line. That practice has never previously been adopted. Mr. JOSEPH COOK:-The authorities wish to make the lines pay.",25
63,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"If that be their desire, they are pursuing a wrong course. If they intend to harass people instead of assisting them the result must be disastrous to the department. Moreover, business people very frequently find it impossible to finish a conversation upon an important subject within the three minutes prescribed by the regulations, and in such circumstances it is only reasonable that they should be allowed an additional two minutes at a reduced rate.",25
64,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I regret the absence of my honourable colleague, Sir Philip Eysh, who is better informed upon this subject than I am, although upon a debate of this character the intention of honourable members is rather to make suggestions than to engage in any final discussion upon the merits or demerits of specific practices. In its essence the question is the old one, as to the extent to which the State is justified in providing telephonic facilities with a view to increasing not only the public convenience but the public revenue. It is difficult to determine the exact point at which we should declare- "" Beyond this the advantages confer led upon the public will not be commensurate with the loss imposed upon the taxpayer."" Exactly where that line should be drawn will always be a matter of contention. The views of honourable members will be influenced by the practice ' which formerly existed in their respective States, and by the density of population in the districts from which they come. Liberal as the honourable member for Parramatta may have been, when he was Postmaster-General of New South Wales, he established precedents which would apply only in that great State. He would have needed an additional measure of caution if the precedents which he established were to be applied to portions of Australia as different as are Western Australia and Tasmania from New South Wales and Queensland. My honourable colleague, the Postmaster-General and his advisers, were thus placed in a delicate position. ' Different practices existed in the six different States, and we had to adopt that one, or some amendment of it, which seemed likely to apply fairly in an average way throughout the Commonwealth. I have listened in vain today for either ' some protest or approbation from representatives of those States which are receiving enhanced benefits as compared with those which they formerly enjoyed. There arc many such benefits. The rates which are now charged are lower than they were previously in these States, and the time during which the public can engage in telephonic conversation has been extended. Of course we hear nothing of these advantages. But from those States in which reduced facilities are now given we naturally hear a cry of alarm. It has to be discounted by the fact that it is inevitable in the initial stages of establishing a uniform system throughout Australia. The honourable member who moved the adjournment comes from a State in which the people have been treated most liberally in telephonic matters. Consequently there need be no surprise at the tentative discontent which is engendered in bringing that State up to the Australian standard. The particular matter which aroused the honourable member's wrath has met with its due reward. Instructions have been given which will enable the two great centres of the West Coast to communicate with each other directly without the necessity for sending their messages over a main trunk line.",25
65,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,-Why is this special privilege given in one case ?,26
66,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"If honourable members will turn to the regulation referred to by honourable and learned member for Bendigo they will find that no minimum distance was fixed below which a line would cease to be a trunk line. The words used are "" 25 miles in length or under."" Therefore, a line a foot long might be termed a trunk line. It was the endeavor of the Postmaster-General to decentralize that led to the curious anomaly in Tasmania. The Deputy Postmasters-General were allowed to determine what, according to the practice of their respective States, were trunk lines. The complaint which the honourable member has made is due to the fact that the Tasmanian authorities denominated this particular line on the west coast of that State a trunk line. In structions have now been given that where two small settlements are concerned no line under five miles in length is to be regarded as a trunk line, whilst in the case of cities the minimum has been extended to ten miles. The honourable member for Parramatta was in error when he declared that the three minutes limit was not of universal application. So far as the postal authorities are aware there is not a line outside of Victoria where three minutes is not the ordinaiy limit.",26
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,But in nearly every country people are allowed to use the telephone for more than three minutes.,26
68,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The three minutes limit is universal because 70 or 80 per cent, of the conversations in which business people engage consist merely of a question and a reply. That period is also fixed with a view to preventing a monopoly of the line. Otherwise it would be sometimes possible for a few men to get possession of a telephone line ,to the exclusion of their rivals. The Postmaster-General has been impressed with the good case made out by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo and others in favour of an extension of the three minutes limit to five minutes, at a reduced charge for' the last two minutes. That appears to be a reasonable suggestion, and I have every reason for believing that he will shortly make a concession in that direction. The other series of complaints by honourable members had reference to the deposits required in connection with the construction of certain telephone lines. Apparently honourable members have assumed that this new condition is to apply to the construction of all such lines. But it is not the so. It is to be applied only in cases where the estimated revenue is not considered sufficient to justify the erection of a line. Mr JosEPn COOK - It is not the guarantee of which we complain, but the cash deposit.",26
69,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"It is very desirable in the public interest that we should obtain a cash deposit in cases where the revenue is doubtful, if we can do so without unduly hampering those concerned. The point at which we should say- "" We require something more than our expectations' in this case to induce us to construct the line"" is very difficult to determine. But, unless some such restriction is imposed, many deserving localities will be denied proper facilities for communication. There must necessarily be discrimination, in justice to the various communities interested ; and the communities which offer the best results have the first claim to be heard, and must be first considered by the Postmaster-General. The honourable member for Bland appears to have received some very proper encouragement in submitting his proposal.",26
70,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,It is not my proposal; I think it came from some one in the department.,27
71,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The proposal to which the honourable member has referred appears to meet with approval in the department and to offer a satisfactory means of escape for those in the back-country, with whose conditions it is most difficult to deal. There, in many cases, those concerned will be satisfied with simpler appliances, which the Government simply dare not erect as their own, and expedients may be devised to work well for some time. The people will take advantage of natural conditions and circumstances to obtain short cuts so as to reduce expenditure, and thus, with the assent and assistance of the departs ment, obtain the privileges which they desire to enjoy without imposing any burden on the public purse. This plan seems to offer great opportunities for development, and I trust that amongst the amendments made in the regulations will be included some for promoting and encouraging self-help in this connection throughout Australia. But I do not say, even apart from this matter, that it ought to be necessary to insist on so large a deposit in the great bulk of the instances which come before the Post-office authorities. The proposed guarantee, however, was a very good basis on which to start-o n which to lay down in a business-like cash fashion a principle which would have the effect of bringing home to the public what their responsibilities were. I have not the least doubt that the representations made by the honourable member for Cowper and other honourable members will have due effect, and will not be passed over, as that honourable member appears to think they have been. We have as a basis these regulations framed with the best knowledge and judgment the department possesses, but not proposed as representing the completed regulations which must ultimately be evolved. Honourable members, Australian born as many are, and all Australian residents, have yet but a very imperfect conception of the enormous area of this great continent, of the immense diversity of its conditions, or the absolute contradistinctions which obtain. There is but superficial appreciation of the difficulty of moving the people of the different States out of the grooves into which they have grown in regard to expenditures of public money.",27
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,If the Attorney General sits down we shall all apologize for speaking.,27
73,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The only excuse I have for speaking is that honourable members have given me such good material. I shall' have great pleasure in submitting the several representations which have been made. As to some of these representations, I know that they will be accepted, and as to the others I am sure they will be considered. W it h the assistance of the House I hope we shall obtain, if not entirely satisfactory regulations-that is beyond the dream of the most ambitious politician-jus t and workable provisions, fair to the people of Australia as a whole. The - task of framing regulations so minute as these must necessarily be, capable of meeting the needs of 4,000,000 of people spread over the whole of this enormous continent, is one in the performance of which difficulties must be discovered. Defects may readily be forgiven by members of this House, who are to some extent, at all events, acquainted with the innumerable and almost insuperable difficulties to be encountered in Federal administration and legislation.",27
74,Mr HARTNOLL,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH, I think we have good reason to believe that this discussion has come rather as a surprise to the Attorney-General.,27
75,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Hear , hear.",27
76,Mr HARTNOLL,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"W it h other honourable members. I am hopeful that what has been said today will have due effect in inducing the Postmaster-General to remedy the defects which have been described, and to apply up-to-date regulations, more in accordance with a progressive policy. The Attorney General referred to Tasmania as the State in which there were the most liberal telephone regulations. In the smallest State of the group- a State sparsely populated, and with less advantages than those possessed by many other parts of the Commonwealththere were the most liberal conditions connected with the telephone service: and yet the postal and telegraphic service, when handed over, was producing a surplus revenue amounting to £16,000 a year. That ought to prove to the Attorney General, that if, instead of a retrogressive policy, there had been adopted the policy of Tasmania, the revenue from the telephonic service throughout the Commonwealth would be beyond the present expectations of the Government. There is an intense feeling of disappointment in Tasmania in regard to these regulations, and I hope they will be speedily altered. In the House arid in the press it is constantly said that the desire is to encourage our primary industries. On the banks of the Huon the only industry is that of growing fruit, which I am sure every honourable member desires to encourage. Yet in isolated parts of that district, perhaps 30 miles from Hobart, the telephone facilities previously enjoyed have been seriously curtailed. Formerly the producers could communicate with their agents in Hobart and get their produce shipped at considerable advantage, but under the new regulations these fruit growers have to meet an expenditure of £20, and storekeepers an expenditure of £50, in order to comply with the demands of the department. Altogether a backward - and mean policy has been adopted. In Tasmania for years farmers, squatters, and - others had, at the expense of £ 1 a year, the privilege of fixing letter-boxes on their front gates, which are, perhaps, 2 or 3 miles from the homestead. Under the regulations the charge for that privilege has been raised to £ 2 a year in order that the great Commonwealth of Australia may get more revenue. No doubt some of the squatters and others are extreme]}' wealthy, but a great number of those concerned in this convenience are poor, and it is the poorest who should be considered in such a connection. The Commonwealth could surely do without this small accession of revenue. Now that the subject has been so fully debated, J. think we may rely for some good results on the practical adaptability of the Attorney-General.",27
77,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Tasmania), vn reply - I feel grateful to honourable members for the interest they have shown in this debate. Tasmania is not the only State which is suffering from _great wrongs under these regulations. I am glad to hear that the central Government was not responsible for the miserable bungle on the West Coast. The people of Queenstown met, and sent to the Deputy Postmaster-General a telegram placing the case before him, and he sent a reply stating that there would be no alteration-that the regulations were final. Yet the whole of the odium was placed on the Postmaster-General, and the people of the West Coast denounced the Commonwealth. It would seem, after the observations of the Attorney-General, that some officials are better fitted for the New Norfolk lunatic asylum than for running a post office. It is time that the responsibility was put on the right shoulders ; and I am glad the Government have withdrawn from all these infamies, because they are nothing less. Wherever a Government refuses to grant redress for wrong done, that Government, is on the brink of a political volcano, ten times more dangerous than Mont Pelee. Question resolved in the negative.

78,Mr BAMFO RD,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I understand that the Attorney-General impliedly, consented to reconsider clause 99 before proceeding with the other clauses.",28
79,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"That cannot be done: we must go through the Bill, and return to clause 99.",28
80,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," If clause 99 is amended by the omission of any reference to a money deposit, it will be proper to consider whether the nomination of six persons should be accepted as sufficient. I suggest that it would be wise to postpone clause 101, or, in the event of clause 99 being altered, to consent to the recommittal - of the clause now before the committee.",28

86,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," Has the Minister made any provision for validating a nomination to which consent may have been obtained prior to the issue of the writ ? In New South Wales it has happened once or twice that a candidate has been temporarily away from the State at the date of the nomination, and could give his consent only before the issue of the writ. I think that technically such consent was invalid, but in no case were the opponents of men so elected ungenerous enough to test 'the question. It seems to me, however, that we should make provision to deal with such a case.",29
87,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,I think that the case to which the honourable member refers has been provided for. I agree with him that we should prevent the possibility of a nomination being declared invalid because the consent to it was given by a candidate prior to the date of the issue of the writ.,29
88,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," Has the Attorney-General come to any decision as to whether this Parliament has power to fix the time and place for the election of senators, which the Constitution provides shall be determined by the laws of the States ? The provision in the Constitution was designedly inserted, because it was considered that the elections for the Senate were, to a large extent, incidental to the State rather than to the Commonwealth functions.",29
89,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I have already looked into the matter, but I intend to consider it further.",29
90,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Darling Downs) It seems to me that in the case of a State like Queensland a candidate for the Senate should not be compelled to send his nomination to the electoral officer lor the State. In Queensland, that officer would reside.in Brisbane, and it might be veryinconvenient for a candidate residing in the northern part of the State to have to send his nomination as far as Brisbane. When the last general elections were held, any returning officer in the State had power to receive - nominations.",29
91,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," Thepoin t raised by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, is worthy of careful consideration. It would be very unfortunate if we - inserted in this Bill a provision out of harmony with the design of the Constitution. The Constitution contemplates that the writs for the election of senators shall be issued by the States Governors, who must necessarily issue them to States officers. The question then arises, has the Commonwealth Parliament authority to appoint returning officers for the Senate ? It would appear to me to be open to very strong argument that the returning officers for the Senate must be States officers.",29
92,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,How could States officers use our rolls and other inachinerv?,29
93,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"That would have to be arranged for as a matter of administration. The times and places for the election of senators must also be fixed by the States. It would therefore seem that from the time of the issue to the time of the return, of the writs, the procedure in regard to the. election of senators is a matter for the States, because the senators represent the States as political entities.

Clause 104 -(Forma l defects). ' Mr Glynn (South Australia) - It seems to me that too great power is given to the returning officer under this clause, and under clause 100, in the matter of determining what nominations shall be received. Clause 100 allows him to receive a nomination the validity"" of which may not be made complete until after the date of the nomination. Such a thing may be most inconvenient. Clause agreed to. Clauses 105 to 107 agreed to. Clause 108 -(Proceeding s on nomination day).",29
95,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"South Australia) This clause provides that if more candidates are nominated than are required to be elected, the proceedings shall stand adjourned to the polling day, and that if no greater number are nominated the returning officer shall declare those nominated to be duly elected. But no provision is made to meet the case where a smaller number are nominated than ai:e required to be elected. Such an occurrence is extremely unlikely, but a similar case occurred in Victoria many years ago, for which no provision had been made by the electoral law, and the matter had to be referred to Parliament. Another case of the kind also occurred in reference to the nominations to the University Senate recently.",30
96,Mr BAMFO RD,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," In the event of one of the candidates dying between the date of nomination and that of election, must there be an election, or would the surviving candidates be elected ?",30
97,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," It is no doubt extremely unlikely that fewer candidates will ever be nominated than are required to be elected ; but it may happen that three out of eight nominations will be invalid, in which case there will be fewer valid - nominations than persons to be elected. If that occurred, the clause is mandatory that "" the proceedings shall stand adjourned to polling day."" To my mind, it is best to provide for even the most unlikely contingencies.",30
98,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"No provision has been made in the - States Acts to .meet this case, because it is such an unlikely one, but as the question has been raised, I shall have the matter investigated. I think it is best to meet all cases of the kind, where possible.",30

Clause 109 Any elector(a) who resides .more than five miles from the polling place at which he is entitled to vote; or (6) who has reason to believe that he will on polling day be more than five miles from the polline place at which he is entitled to vote; or (c) who being a woman believes that she will ou account of ill-health be unable on polling day to attend the polling place to vote ; or (ci) who will be prevented by serious illness or infirmity from attending the polling place ou polling da}'; may after the issue of the writ and before polling day make application in the form K in the schedule to the returning officer for the division in which he resides for a postal vote certificate.,30
100,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I m o v e That the word "" Any,"" line 1, be omitted. I do this with a view to test the question whether voting by post is acceptable to the committee. I have a very strong objection to voting by post. It is desirable that the fullest possible facilities should be given to voters, but this should always be consistent with a minimum of influence being exercised upon the voter. Under the old system of open voting, we know that veryT few votes were recorded without undue influence. Voting by ballot, which was designed to overcome this difficulty, first saw the light in South Australia, and it has proved very effective, because it leaves the decision of the voter absolutely secret. Notwithstanding its obvious advantages in some instances, voting by post makes an attack, although not with an evil intention, upon the system of voting by ballot, because the elector has to record his vote m the presence of certain people.",30
101,Mr HUME COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,We can liberalize that.,30
102,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,I do not know that that would affect the objection I have to any great extent.,30
103,Mr SALMON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,There is no disclosure made.,30
104,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The honourable member evidently has in mind the system in force in Victoria, but that does not apply everywhere. I am given to understand that in some places the system of voting by post has not been a great success, because a considerable number of persons have been induced to disclose the name of the candidate for whom they were voting, because of the knowledge on the part of the employer that a certificate entitling them to vote by 1 post had been obtained. ! Mr ISAACS - Has the honourable member ' evidence of that 1",30
105,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Not such evidence, his perhaps, as would be accepted in a court law. I am informed that what I describe has taken place in South Australia.",31
106,Mr HUMECOOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,I do not think it has occurred in Victoria.,31
107,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The opportunity did not occur in Victoria, because the franchise was not extented to women in that State. I am told that a great amount of influence was exercised on young women, particularly domestic servants, who were induced to obtain these postal certificates, and to in the presence, and practically under the control of the individual employing them, or of a parent, or some other person.",31
108,Mr ISAACS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"But that is forbidden the Bill. Mr V . L : SOLOMON - That is not possible » under the South Australian law. Mr ' WATSON - I am informed that has been extensively practised in South tralia, and it may occur under this Bill. provided that any elector who has received a postal ballot-paper shall "" in the presence of a postmaster, officer, police stipendiary magistrate, or head-master of a State school,"" record his vote. Now, I know of several instances in New South Wales where the postmaster is a squatter.",31
109,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,That is . a bogey.,31
110,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The honourable member may say that it is a bogey, but I know some squatters who use their influence that way. In one case, in my own elecof torate, a squatter, who was acting as presiding officer, when he was obtaining a majority of votes, kicked the ballot-box to pieces. returned, and that squatter discharged every man employed on his station the very next day. It is unfair to subject .any man to the temptation to which he would be exposed if he had an opportunity of witnessing the votes of the persons ployed by him, aud over whom he might exercise a great deal of influence. The only way to effectively p'rotect the secrecy of ballot is by insuring that the electors shall exercise their votes only in the polling under the supervision of the officials pointed for the purpose, and free from influence as faivas outsiders are concerned. I have suggested a provision in - lieuof voting by post, under which an elector would be enabled to vote at any amendment, polling booth, whether in or out of cratic electorate. If an elector were 100 miles of away from his electorate on polling day, he would be able to go to the nearest pollingbooth and record his vote. The only objection to that plan is that it would involve in some cases a delay of a few days, perhaps in the declaration of the poll. Therefore, we have to weigh the desirability of relieving a number of candidates from a state of uncertainty against the advantage of offering additional facilities to the voters and, at the same time, preserving the secrecy of the vote ballot. In Tasmania, the voter who finds himself outside of the district in which he is registered can go to the nearest pollingbooth and make a declaration stating under that he is on the roll, and that he has not previously voted. This declaration is made subject to penalties. This plan is similar to that proposed by it the Minister for Home Affairs for meetAusing the case of a man who finds himI t is self unable to vote at the particular booth at which he is registered. I ask that this principle should be extended. In Tasmania the voter presents himself and signs the declaration, and his voting paper is placed in an envelope, and-forwarded to the returning officer for the division in which he has a vote. Later on the returning officer ascertains whether the voter is entitled to have his vote recorded, and if he is satisfied he includes the vote in his return. The delay of of a day or two thus involved is of very in small moment compared with the necessity keeping the ballot free from any suspicion of undue influence on the part of infound that I terested individuals.",31
111,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"How would that affect Still, I was paragraph (c) ?",31
112,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"There will always be a certain percentage of voters who cannot go to the poll on account of ill-health, but I do not see why we should imperil an election emon that account. It is desirable to place beyond all considerations the free exercise of the voter's will at the ballot-box, and it the is because I fear that voting by post will be used improperly to influence elections that booth I regard its disadvantages as outweighing apthe importance of extending voting faciliany ties to the small percentage of persons who are unable to attend the polling booth.",31
113,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I am sorry that the honourable member has moved his because if there is one demor prineiple in the Bill it is that which is embodied in the provisions for the extension of voting facilities. . Mr A MCLEAN - The principle of voting by post has worked well wherever it has been tried. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - So far as I can gather it has worked well, and I inserted the provision in the Bill with a view to affording all electors an opportunity' of voting, whether they were able to attend the ' polling booth or not. It is all very well for the honourable member for Bland to refer to Tasmania, as an example, but it must be remembered that that State is not so large as some of the electorates in other parts of the Commonwealth, and that therefore provisions which would be workable in Tasmania would be utterly unsuitable for other States. The honourable member's proposal is to enable an elector to vote at any booth in the Commonwealth, aud I would ask how it would be possible to check attempts at fraud, or impersonation ?",31
114,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"There is no more'difficulty in regard to that than in connection with the provisions under which the Minister proposes to enable electors to vote at any polling booth in the electorate to which they belong. Sir AVILL [ AMLYNE - Yes, there is : because in the case of an electorate which is sub-divided there are facilities for communicating from one point to another. But in the outlying parts of Queensland, the north of South Australia, the north-west of AVestern Australia, and the back portions of New South Wales, it would be impossible to ascertain within a reasonable time what electors had recorded their votes at different polling places. The amendment of the honourable member is absolutely impracticable. He declares, that the provision in the Bill is liable to abuse. That argument, however, could be applied with equal force to any other provision. Under his proposal, ""persons who reside a hundred miles from polling places would be denied an opportunity of recording their votes. I am sure that in South Australia, Western Australia, and Queensland, there are post-offices which are separated from each other by a hundred miles. I have in my hand a voter's postal certificate, which will show honourable members how it is proposed to carry out the provisions of the Bill. If they will look at it they will see that it practically insures the secrecy of the ballot. Of course if an elector chooses to tell another person how he intends to vote, no one can prevent him from so doing. As the honourable member for Gippsland has pointed out, wherever this system has been tried, no serious injury has arisen - The honourable member for Bland declares that under its operation undue influence will be brought to bear upon certain voters. But I would point out that in clause 112 special provision has been made to meet such cases as he has described.",32
115,Mr ISAACS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Where does the elector who has to vote by post get the information that all the provisions of clause 112 must be complied with 1,32
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"It is printed upon his certificate. The objection taken by the honourable member for Bland is that in some parts of the States the postmaster , may be a squatter, selector, or storekeeper, and we all know that these individuals exercise considerable influence. That was pointed out to me, and thereupon I had the provision which appears in clause 112 inserted, with a view to giving the Government power to appoint some one outside of the individuals mentioned to receive the votes. The honourable member declares that this portion ol the Bil l constit tutes an attack upon the system of voting by ballot. I cannot agree with him. What I propose is to confer upon those who are situated in remote country districts an opportunity of voting, which will otherwise be denied them. If we allow a man or woman to record his or her vote at any polling plaoe, we shall have confusion worse confounded, and be unable to prevent impersonation and abuses against which we have fought for many years. I trust the committee will assist me in making this Bill the most liberal measure of the kind.  am afraid that if the proposal of the honourable member for Bland be carried he will injure the very men whom he desires to serve. The mere fact of giving an elector the right to vote at any polling booth does not by any means insure to every elector an opportunity of voting. The system of voting by post, however, will - if property administered-confe r that opportunity upon every elector. Many years ago I advocated the adoption of that system in connection with the shearers in the back-blocks. Even if they had the right to vote at any polling booth ' in the State, many would be unable to do so because they might be scores of miles distant upon polling day. Under the system of voting by post there may be abuses, but. I venture to say that for every one that occurs facilities will be given to twenty electors to exercise the franchise. In the district which I represented in the South Australian Parliament there were no less than 38 polling places, and yet there are scores of men there who have never had an opportunity of voting. Unless some more valid reason be given for expunging the clause I shall certainly vote for its retention. I have heard that abuses occur in South Australia, but I certainly have heard no proof of those abuses.",32
117,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Me n have voted a dozen times at an election in New South Wales, but the offence could never be proved.  whom the honourable member for Bland wishes to vote will not be able to do so, unless this clause be included in the Bill, and they are a class who have to put up with considerable hardship as compared with dwellers in centres of civilization. I regard this clause as an advance in electoral reform ; and any reference to alleged abuse in South Australia does not justify us in absindoning the principle of voting by post.",33
118,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"In South Australia the law was altered to prevent abuses.  be retained if only in the interests of the large body of women who have now been given the franchise, and who should have an opportunity of voting without going to the polling booth.",33
119,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"It is no worse for woman than for a man to go to the polling booth.  female suffrage, which has been the law in South Australia from 1.896, is that when health the great bulk of the women go to the poll; but a greater percentage of than of menare frequently prevented by ness from leaving their'homes. I am wedded to' the particular wording of the move from place to place. clause, and would support any amendment to give it a wider scope. I do not see there could be any evasion of the secrecy of the ballot.",33
120,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,If a postmaster to be an employer of labour he might insist on one of the employees showing him his vote.  few cases there may be of that kind are any justification for our rejecting this clause.,33
121,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Darling Downs) I am sorry the honourable member for Bland feels it incumbent upon him to oppose the clause, because I regard this part of the Bill , as exceedingly liberal. What we all desire to get is the expressed will of the people, and it is only by such a provision as that now before the committee that we can really get the expressed will of the whole of the electors. When I stood at the by-election for this House, many of the electors of Darling Downs experienced serious difficulty, and I have several letters in my possession from shearers expressing regret that on the polling day they. would be working at too great a distance to record their votes. Had these men been ordinary loafers about the city they could have voted, but because they were doing work which society requires shall be done, they were absolutely disfranchised, and they asked me to do what I could in the Eederal Parliament to remove the injustice. It is utterly impossible to predict at what particular place in an electorate these vast bodies of shearers may be. The polling place may be fixed at one station, and at the very next election the men who had been working there are pursuing their avocation miles away. The seamen on the vessels along the coast are many of them absolutely out of their electorate on the polling day, and surely they ought to receive some consideration. It is a matter of history that in Brisbane men engaged in shipping were on election day ordered down the river to do a lighterage work and thus pi-evented from voting, it being known by those, who-had control over them how their votes were of likely to be recorded.",33
122,Mr BAMFORD,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,An elector must be more in than 5 miles away from a polling place.,33
123,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"These men of women Brisbane were more than 5 miles away. sickEvery facility for voting should be given to not persons whose business requires them to Then we have to consider the female voters. I recently how visited my electorate, and I can see that if we have not some such clause as this, nearly half the women there will not be able to rehappened cord their votes.",33
124,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Nonsense !,33
125,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Of course, I may be wrong; but the selectors in my constituency are scattered over the Downs, a large number more than 5 miles from any polling place, and it would be utterly impossible for both husband and wife to leave home at the same time. The honourable member for Bland and myself are at one in the desire that every person who has the franchise shall vote, but we differ as to how to bring about that result. The honourable member for Bland objects that undue influence is likely to be exerted, and the same charge was made in Queensland in regard to small polling places. It was said that by reason of the small number of ballot-papers being opened after the voting, secrecy could be, and had been, violated ; but all that is prevented by the Bill. Practically, the charge made by the honourable member for Bland is that a squatter may require men in his employ to hand their ballot-papers to him so that he may see how they vote, but that would be a very audacious act on the part of any man, and I am glad to see that in the Bill there is a stern provision to punish any person guilty of such an act, so that danger in that connection, I think, is rather exaggerated. I understand that the honourable member'for Bland is speaking with a certain amount of knowledge, and I do not want to minimize his opinion. I hope the Minister may see his way to adopt a suggestion to allow the vote to be attested in the pre-. sence of two electors or extend the provision in some way. Another charge made is that this clause is practically a violation of the ballot system. The object of the ballot is simply to place the ballot-paper in a box so that no one can see how the vote is given; and this clause is certainly no violation of the system per se, though the secrecy rather than the system may be in vaded if a person insists on opening a ballot paper. I do not think, however, that there is any very serious danger; in any case, the danger is small as compared with the vast extension of utility given to the voting power in the Commonwealth. We had voting by post at the last election in 'Queensland, and I believe it worked well, *md it is in operation elsewhere with beneficial results. We have extended the franchise to the fullest limit, and the voting system should be practically as wide as the voting power.",33
126,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," The community honourable and learned member for Darling Downs says that what we desire to obtain is the exercise of the will of the people. . That is exactly what the honourable member for Bland desires: but it should be the will of the people and not the will of a person or a few persons. I myself am a martyr to the system of voting by post in South Australia. The danger lies in circumstances where a clever employer, with perhaps 40 or 50 or 200 workmen, asks the latter whether they have voted, and asks them' to send their votes from his place. We all know that employers do exercise more or less power over the men who, directly or indirectly, are dependent on them for a living, and it is wrong for us to put such a temptation in the way of any justice of the peace, or similar official. The objections of the honourable member for Bland are thoroughly reasonable. Nothing could be simpler for a man than to walk into a polling booth, and break the law in the way suggested. My experience in South Australia leads me to feel that the adoption of the system provided for in the Bill will give the death blow to democracy. We talk about giving every man a chance, and providing equality of opportunity. The way to do that is to adopt the system now in vogue in Tasmania. There a man can go into any polling booth and say- "" My name is on the roll for suchand-such a division."" He signs a declaration to that effect, and records his vote, which is then despatched to his own district. No man will run the risk of being imprisoned for perjury by wrongfully signing such a declaration. I look upon the system provided for in the Bill as vicious, pernicious, and damnable in its effects.",34
127,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"South Australia) I support the proposal of the honourable member for Bland. We have had considerable experience of the absent voter system in South Australia. I think it was adopted in that State before it was adopted in any of the other States. Our first Absent Voters' Act was passed in 1891 or 1892; another in 1893; and another in 1896, when, owing to the abuses which had occurred, the privileges given by the system were considerably curtailed. The South Australian system is not so wide as that provided for in the Bill. While it is our desire and our duty to extend the opportunities for voting, so that every person in the may avail himself of them, it is still more important that we should give all who vote an opportunity to record their votes without fear of influence. It is more important, indeed, that the votes recorded should be recorded without undue influence than that here and there some elector should be unable to vote. In South Australia the provisions of the Absent Voters' A ct have not been taken advantage of by employees to anything like the same extent as by employers, because of the suspicion which has been aroused that the system allows influence, to be brought to bear on employees who avail themselves of it . In a case which occurred since 1896, a postmaster allowed himself to be taken round the country by members of a political organization.",34
128,Mr MCCOLL,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Was he not punished ?,35
129,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"No ; because there was nothing in the Act preventing him doing what he did, and there is nothing in well. this Bill to prevent an officer acting in the same way. That is a serious blot upon measure. The question is, how can we hedge round this privilege with sufficient safeguards? There are so many officials empowered to witness signatures that i be quite impossible to define the places which the witnessing may be done, and therefore difficulties will occur. The master of a State school may be present at a friend's house, and the domestic servants may be called up, and told- "" Mr Smith here to-night. It will save you a lot of trouble if you record your vote now.""",35

132,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"No , but a justice city of the peace can witness the declarations of applicants for certificates. Under South Australian system, application for a certificate must be made direct to the returning officer, and it must be witnessed by a justice of the peace. Is there thing in the Bill which prevents the roundheard ing-up of employees in the presence of postmaster, the head-master of a State .school, or some other officer, under such circumstances as would really amount to an attempt to coerce them ? The possibility of such coercion has been very quickly recognised by a very large number of the employees of South Australia, and if honourable members think that the system will be largely availed of by those whose avocations make it difficult for them to record their votes at proclaimed polling places, they will find that they are making a mistake.",35
133,Mr SALMON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,That has not been the case in Victoria.,35
134,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,--In Tasmania they have passed an Act adopting this system.,35
135,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I do not doubt that; but, taking it all round, I am convinced that the system cannot be hedged about with sufficient safeguards to prevent the suspicion of coercion in the minds of electors to such an extent as to make it practically inoperative;",35
136,Mr VL SOLOMON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,In South Ausfrom tralia both sides worked the system very,35
137,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The only cases of the abuse suggested there were all on the one side. AVe never heard of an employer being coerced, or being afraid to exercise his vote. I admit that there are some advantages in t will the system, but in my opinion they are at not sufficient to justify a practice which meets with so much disfavour from those head whom it is intended to convenience.",35
138,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I think that none of us wish to give facilities for is the abuse of the electoral system. To my mind, it seems that the Bill contains sufficient safeguards to prevent abuse ; but, if voting there are not enough, I am prepared to assist in adding to them. I hope, however, there will be no serious opposition to the system of voting by post; because, under proper safeguards, it can be niade as secret as the ordinary system cf recording votes in the polling booths, and it is of enormous convenience to people in country districts. Those who live in the are likely to overlook the disabilities of country electors, who are very glad to have the the opportunity of voting by post. The system has s/ived me the trouble of riding a distance of more than 130 miles to record my vote, and I have known many others to anybe similarly circumstanced. I have not of any case of abuse in Victoria. A a ; Government of which I was Premier intro! duced the system in Victoria, in the interests | of the scattered electors of the country disi tricts, and, although a large number of city representatives opposed it, it was only be' cause they were not familiar with the hard; ships under which country electors labour. I venture to say that they would not be prepared to oppose it any longer. I should be very glad to help the honourable member for Bland to give the additional facilities he proposes, but I am afraid it is not practicable. If electors were allowed to vote at any polling booth in the State there would still be large numbers who would be so far removed from polling booths that they would be unable to exercise the franchise. It is these people to whom we should give some thought. All electors are not so favourably situated as are those who reside in the cities. I am surprised that the amendment should come from the professed representatives of labour. The whole of the labour is not centred in the cities, and the best men we have are those who are able to do without luxuries, and who devote their energies to developing the resources of the country districts. I am prepared to go as far as any one in preventing abuses and in providing safeguards, but what has been possible in Victoria may very well be extended to the other States. I have always voted for the extension of the franchise to every man and woman in the Commonwealth, and I am very glad that we have given the franchise to women. I now wish to afford every possible facility for electors to record their votes, and I should like to even go so far as to impose a penalty on those who neglect to exercise their privilege. I hope honourable members will consider those electors who are many miles away from the nearest polling booth. The honourable member for Bland said that it was preferable that a few persons should be prevented from voting rather than that opportunities should be presented for the exercise of undue influence upon a large scale. The cases of improper influence, however, will be very few and far between, whereas of the 50 per cent of the voters in the country districts who refrain from recording - their votes, many are absolutely unable to reach the polling booth. Every facility should be afforded to electors to record their votes so that our legislation may be a true reflex, of the opinion of the whole of the people, instead of that of a section residing in the centres of population.",35
139,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I do not State. think that the provision for voting by post has been abused in South Australia. I was rather inclined to think at first that, perhaps, the person who could afford to employ the greatest number of canvassers, and who could thus secure the largest number of votes by post would be placed at an advantage, but I am somewhat doubtful upon that point. I looked up the election returns with a view to satisfying my mind, but I was unable to conclude reexamination. The fact that a candidate procures a voter's certificate for an elector does not, but is apt to be considered by some to place him or her under a moral obligation to vote for such candidate. If any influence of that kind is exerted the same objection would apply to all classes of canvassers, because there is not one person in five who is not approached in some way or other regarding his vote. The only coercion exercised under the system of voting by post is upon those who are foolish enough to think that because they are being helped to obtain a voter's certificate they are under an obligation to vote for the person who obtains it. We know that the expediency of voting by post maybe pointed out to certain voters by the friends of some particular candidate, .and that the voter may think that he is under some obligation, but I do not see that any other coercion could be brought to bear to influence the judgment of an elector. I have never heard of any case in which there has been any breach of the secrecy of the ballot.",36
140,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I cannot speak as to that, but I know of cases in which influence has been exerted. Mr Glynn . - All that has to be feared is the activity of particular candidates. On the whole, a very small proportion of electors take advantage of the facilities offered for voting through the post. The system of voting by post was strongly advocated in South Australia in the interests of sailors, and any abuses to which the system may have been subject at the outset have now been provided against by amendments of the law. The alternative suggested by the honourable member for Bland is open to many objections, the principal being that it would involve great delay in the declaration of the poll. An elector entitled to a vote in Sydney might be in Western Australia upon the day of election, and might record his vote in that",36
141,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Why should he be prevented from doing so ?,36
142,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Because far greater inconvenience would be involved in permitting him to do so than' in preventing him. In the case of a South Australian elector who was absent in the Northern Territory, and who chose, to-record his vote there, the declaration of the poll for a South Australian constituency mighthc delayed for perhaps six weeks or two months. I do not see anything in the proposal to justify a delay of that kind. Voting by post affords a simple method .of achieving the object aimed at, and it would involve no such delay as would be incurred .under the alternative suggested by the honourable member for Bland.",36
143,Mr SOLMON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, has pointed out the only objection that could he urged against the provision in the Bill, namely, that the candidate who secured the greater number of applications for voters' certificates would reap an undue advantage. ' I can, however, assure the honourable and .learned member that the danger is not so great as might be supposed. We have had some experience of the system in Victoria, and during the election of representatives to this House a number of applications were made for voters' certificates. In one case a candidate applied, through his canvassers, for 80 certificates, but as the candidate did not receive more than 50 votes, and the balance went to his .opponents, it is clear-that it does not follow that those who. provide the certificates necessarily secure the votes. I would urge the honor' able member for Bland to withdraw his amendment, because the clause as itstands ""will afford facilities to a large number of people who have recently been admitted to the franchise, and who will probably not register their votes if (-hey are required to attend the polling booth.

I can assure the committee that during the period in which the system of voting by post has operated in Victoria, the results obtained have exceeded the anticipations of its most sanguine advocates, and I have never heard a single complaint as to the secrecy of the' ballot being in any way violated.",37
146,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I am in sympathy with those who wish to extend the facilities for ' exercising the franchise; but, at the same time, I wish to guard against possible abuses. Our experience in New South Wales shows the necessity for care in this direction. The honourable member for Bland cited an instance which occurred in his electorate in which the presiding officer wen^ to the extreme of kicking the ballot-box to pieces, because the votes were not recorded in the direction which he desired. I have had a somewhat similar experience. At one station in my electorate, the manager ascertained the direction in which the men intended to vote, and when polling day arrived, he sent out-.to the back of the run those who would have voted in opposition to his desire, so that they could not exercise the franchise, whilst the others were brought in to the home station. These illustrations serve to show the extent to which feeling is sometimes carried. In other instances, a number of men have been discharged from their work after ah election. Their employers have said to them - "" You voted for So-and-so ; go to him for a job."" Like the honourable member for Bland, I fear that if ' the Government proposal -.he carried, it will lead to the exercise of a great deal of undue influence. I recognise, however, that additional facilities for the exercise of the franchise must be given - In every centro of any importance in New South Wales pollingplaces exist.. In many districts, indeed, it is much easier to go to the polling booth than to find a justice of the peace to witness one's signature. I should like to see the polling are booths thrown open to every elector. Sir W ILLIAM LTNE - It is impossible to",37
147,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I do not think so. When we we elected our representatives to the memFederal Convention, we required each a elector to possess an elector's right, and he be was thus enabled to vote at whatever polling he chose. A similar provision could be inserted iir' this Bill.

I : see, however, that the committee are not favourable to my proposal, but are anxious-to give at r i a l to voting by post, - and, as I indicated two or three months ago on the second reading that I was prepared. to accept this Bill in order to have a measure applying to all Australia, I shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment. These postal certificates can be obtained only between the issue of the writ and the day of polling, and the minimum period of fourteen days is very short in country districts, where the mails are infrequent.",38
150,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"""When I was elected I found that some of the postal votes came too late.",39
151,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"If this minimum period be availed of in every instance, it will, in many cases, be impossible to get votes through in time. In my own district there are places with a mail only once a week or once a fortnight. I regret the committee are not in sympathy with the amendment, but I reserve to myself the right later to agitate for an alteration if my views are borne out by experience. In any case, there is necessity for a considerable number of alterations with a view to safeguard, not so much the application for a certificate, as the exercise of a vote. The conditions under which the vote is exercised are such as to make it necessary to provide that no undue influence shall be brought to bear, and that the receiving of the votes shall be restricted to some official person. The place should be confined to the office of - the official, though I am not certain whether the class of postmaster before whom the vote must be exercised is clearly provided. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. ' Mr HIGGINS (Northern Melbourne) I am glad the amendment is withdrawn. In the Victorian Parliament I opposed a ' measure providing for voting by post, which was introduced by the MCLean Government, and I and those associated with me were so successful, that we compelled the Government to change the Bill into a measure such as this is becoming, namely, a Voting Before Officials Bill. Voting by post means that the elector sends his vote by post from himself to the returning officer. Subject to small modifications, which are on the lines of those suggested by the honourable member for Bland, I think the committee may safely adopt the proposed system of voting before officials. We opposed the Bill introduced by the MCLean Government for the very reasons mentioned by the honourable member for Bland. As that measure was brought down, any person could vote of his own free will, anywhere, in the presence of anybody. 41 F 2 But we knew how an employer might collect the votes of his workmen, and we also knew the constraint which is felt when the person who wants the vote is present and the elector is not sure whether the candidate may not see the vote in some way before it reaches the returning officer. That would be like a return to the old system of open voting, of which I had some experience in the old country. I have seen a farmer have to mount a table, and in the presence of his landlord and agent say for whom he voted : and the country never got a proper representation until that sort of thing had terminated. The system proposed in the Bill will achieve an object we all desire, namely, that every person shall have an opportunity to vote. During' the last election, I was called to see a man suffering from rheumatic fever who could not attend the polling booth, and whoasked me how he could exercise his vote. By the Bill such a man is given a vote, but I do not see any provision as to how he is to exercise it . Clause .109 confers the vote,, and clause l l 2 says that such a man may make his mark in the presence of the official! named, and that he is to hand the vote to the postmaster or post it at the post-office. But how is such a man to find a postmaster or to go to a post-office ? Then there should be some provision, as in the Victorian Act, that the vote shall be handed only to the officer in whose presence it has been signed,, and that he shall then become responsible to. the State for dealing with it . The idea is that an official, with a State office, will beanxious to do his duty, in order not to fall under the censure of his superiors. If that officer is to be trusted with having thevote exercised in his presence, he may also be trusted with the duty of forwarding it to the returning officer.",39
152,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Is the honourable and learned member referring to what is to be done with the ballot-paper 1,39
153,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I was asking just now how a sick person who cannot leave his house is to hand a ballot paper to the postmaster, or post it at a post-office, and - suggesting that some amendment was necessary. A postmaster cannot go round collecting votes.",39
154,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,That is what is said to have been done in South Australia.,39
155,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"South Australia) I think it would be well to strike out paragraph (a), because there is no necessity forit. The information that is wanted before an absent voter's certificate am be issued is not whether the applicant resides 5 or 50 miles from a polling place, but whether he has reason to believe that he will on pollingday be absent from the polling place Paragraph (6) is quite sumcient. Mi'. THOMSON (North Sydney) - To my mind, a man living more than 5 miles from a polling place should be entitled by that very fact to an absent voter's certificate. I think it is unnecessary to require such a man to declare that he anticipates being more than 5 miles from the polling .place on the day of the poll. Paragraph i(l>) is necessary to meet the case of the - elector who resides .within 5 miles of a \polling place, but believes that on the day - of the poll he will be away.",39
156,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"South Australia) The only reason for allowing voting by post is to convenience men who cannot attend a polling place on the day of the poll; a man's place of residence has nothing to do with the question. Paragraph (a) does not convenience anybody who is not provided for by paragraph (b), and it is therefore unnecessary. But it offers encouragement to all - who live 5 miles from a polling place to vote by post, a practice which it is .'better to discourage, because it adds so greatly to the difficulties of conducting - elections. Where men cannot attend at the polling places to vote, let us give them - the opportunity to vote by post; but do not let us give them the right to vote by post simply because they live 5 miles, or .any other distance, from a polling place. Apart from the population in the townships, nearly all the electors of South Australia reside 5 miles from the polling places.",40
157,Mr VL SOLOMON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"South Australia). - There is a good deal in the contention of vthe honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor. The South Australian Absent Voters Act provides only for the - case of electors who have reason to believe that upon polling days they will be at a' certain distance from a polling place. But paragraph (ce) offers an inducement to all who live 5 miles from a polling place to vote by post. The system of postal voting may be a good one for the convenience of people who are ill , or are otherwise unable to attend at the polling booths, but it would be a very bad one if it were to be generally availed of. The South Australian Act provides that any elector who has reason to believe that he will be more than 15 miles from the polling place at which he is registered to vote may vote by post, and that provision has worked - well. No complaint has been made about the distance, though it might perhaps be well to reduce it to 10 miles. The system provided for in paragraph (b) was first introduced into South Australia by the member representing Port Adelaide, in order to enable the numerous residents of that district who are engaged in the intercolonial, Gulf, and coastal shipping trade, and are therefore frequently away from home, - to exercise the franchise. The principle was subsequently extended, so that persons living in sparsely-populated districts, who found it difficult to reach a polling place, might take ' advantage of it, and the cost of too many polling places might be saved. I agree with my honourable colleague that if paragraph (a) is struck out, any elector to whom it applies may avail himself of the provisions of paragraph (6).",40
158,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I do not thinkthere is much reason for retaining paragraph (a). I find that in Victoria one arbitrary limit has been fixed, and in South Australia another. I am not quite sure that 5 miles is not too short a distance. Of course it is not intended to induce people to keep away - from the polling booth, but the object is to afford voting facilities to those who cannot reasonably get there. There cannot be any harm in striking out paragraph (a). Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) agreed toThat the following words be omitted :- "" («.) who resides move than 5 miles from the nolli'iif pluce at which he is entitled to vote'; or."" Amendment (by Mr BATCH KLOR) proposed - That the word ""five,"" linefi, be omitted, with a view to insert in fieu thereof the word ""ten.""",40
159,Mr WINTER COOKE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The 5-mile limit was recently adopted by the Victorian Legislature, and, as it has worked very well, I do not see why we should extend it to 10 miles as suggested. In mamfamilies it will be impossible for both husband and wife to get away to vote, and a 10-mile limit would, therefore, be unnecessarily long. Amendment negatived. Clause further verbally amended, and agreed to. Clauses 110 and 111 agreed to. Clause 112Any elector who has received a postal ballot paper shall in the presence of a postmaster officer police stipendiary special magistrate or head master of a State school and of no other person record his vote as follows :(i.) By exhibiting the ballot-paper unmarked and in the condition in which it was issued : (n.) By marking his vote on the ballot-paper, but so that the postmaster officer magistrate or head master shall not see the vote: (m.) By signing his name on the counterfoil: (iv.) By presenting the ballot-paper, folded up, to be witnessed : (v.) By enclosing the ballot-piper with the counterfoil attached as witnessed, together with the postal-vote certificate in the envelope, addressed to the returning officer, and having closed the envelope, by handing it to a postmaster for posting, or posting it at a post-office.",40
160,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," Eithe r the word "" postmaster"" ought to be omitted or some qualification should be inserted. In many country districts large employers of labour act also as non-ofticial postmasters. They receive a salary, but are not civil servants, and they are therefore subject to all those throes of partisanship which would influence ordinary electors. We could easily conceive of undue influence being exerted by such persons in recording postal votes. I have no objection to postmasters who are civil servants acting in the capacity provided for in the clause, and I move That the words ""being a classified public officer,"" be inserted after the word ""postmaster,"" line MO.",41
161,Mr SKENE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," The amendment would considerably limit the usefulness of the provision. A number of post offices in the country districts are conducted under what is known as the contract system, and the postmasters or postmistresses in such cases would not come within the scope of the honourable member's amendment. These persons are not employers of labour, and the) are not open to the same ob7 jection as are storekeepers who also act as postmasters. I know of a number of ladies who carry on post-offices in country districts, and perform their duties exceedingly well, and who would not be open to any objection so far as the purposes of this Bill are concerned. The contract system under which these ladies and others carry qn their work is largely resorted to in Victoria, and as it is favoured by the department, the probability is that it will be availed of to a much larger extent in the future. I cannot see any. objection to allowing postmasters or postmistresses, who follow no other occupation, from acting as provided for in connection with postal - ballot-papers. Mr OMALLEY. (Tasmania) - I suggest that* police officers should be included among those who are empowered to deal with postal ballot-papers under this clause. At the same time, I am opposed to ladies who act as postmistresses being allowed to discharge any such functions. At my second election in South Australia, one of the postmistresses in my electorate was taken round in a buggy day after day with a view to securing votes for my opponent, with the result that I was ousted, and obliged to go away to Tasmania. I am not quite sure that even civil servants would be proof against the allurements of a drive round the electorate under the care of an electioneering agent. I do not regard civil servants as being entirely above suspicion, because my experience shows that they are not always entirely free from prejudice.",41
162,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," There is some force in the contention of the honourable member for Grampians The object of this clause is to extend certain privileges to electoi's residing in remote districts ; but if only postmasters who are classified public servants can deal 'with postal ballot-papers in the manner provided for, its operation will be limited to the more populous districts. I admit that there is a grave objection to squatters, who are also postmasters, being allowed to act; but in the State of New South Wales there are a number of non-official postmasters, who perforin 'the duties of deputy registrars with very satisfactory results. If these officers are to be debarred from dealing with postal ballot papers, the electors in the outlying districts will be placed at a disadvantage. I prefer that the persons charged with the performance of this duty should be appointed by the Electoral department. I am not prepared to go to the extent of limiting its performance to official postmasters to the exclusion of all other suitable persons. The Government proposal will do a grave injustice to a large number of electors.",41
163,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"South Australia) I really do not see what objection there can be to limiting the discharge of this duty to officials. In ray judgment it would be a great mistake to extend this provision to country postmasters who are not servants of the Commonwealth. If there is no official postmaster at some remote settlement, the State still has the head-master of the public school, the special magistrate,-or the police or stipendiary magistrate to fall back upon. Surely amongst all these individuals we can secure some official before whom the absent voter may exercise his franchise? I ask the honourable member for Bland to temporarily withdraw his amendment to enable me to move a prior one. To my mind it would be a mistake to multiply the places at which absent votes may be recorded. Let us limit the duty of receiving such votes to officials, and let the work be done at their usual office. I admit that under my proposal the sick would be disfranchised, but if we attempt to legislate for every possible case, we shall immediately open the door to all sorts of abuses. I am extremely anxious to avoid even the suspicion that undue influence may be brought to bear upon absent voters by the person charged with the duty of receiving their votes. One of the chief reasons which led to the extreme disfavour with which the Electoral Act was viewed in South Australia was that at one election a certain postmaster was carted round by members of a political organization for the purpose of securing votes for its candidates. There is nothing in this Bill to prevent a repetition of such iin occurrence. I do not think that it is worth our while to risk spoiling the whole measure by attempting to attain the ideal. It is far better for us to confine our attention to providing reasonable facilities for the exercise of the franchise.",41
164,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," Before the amendment is withdrawn, I submit that the honourable member who moved it has scarcely kept in view one class of case which must arise, and in which it would be absolute cruelty to ask electors to go to an office. These are the cases referred to in sub-clause (c), and there ire other cases of sickness infirmity, in which to enforce the amendment would mean practical disfranchisement.",42
165,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Is the officer to go to the residence of the sick person ?,42
166,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Why not? If we arrange that persons who are away from the electocandidates. rate, perhaps for slight cause, shall have this cumbrous machinery created to enable Act was altered. them to vote, why should we not also provide for persons, who, on account of illness, cannot leave their homes ? There would not be much harm in asking an officer to go to the house, since we are committing ourselves to this somewhat dangerous principle in the Bill. A' man's house is surely as safe a place as anywhere else for the exercise of a vote under these conditions.",42
167,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"My amendment would prevent great abuses, as such occurred in South Australia.",42
168,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,But such abuses have only to occur once to be quickly put down.,42
169,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,The law in South Australia has not been altered.,42
170,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The whole question is a most difficult one. For instance, I see that the Federal Franchise Act gives the franchise to any elector whose name is on the roll, whereas this Bill seems to contemplate that unless a person lives in the division for which he is enrolled, he shall not be entitled to vote. That is in contradiction to the Federal Franchise Act in which there' is no such qualification.",42
171,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,The assumption is that the electors were living there before they got on the roll.,42
172,Mr RETD,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,But the Act does not say so.,42
173,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,The provision was deliberately struck out of the Franchise Bill in order to be put into this Bill.,42
174,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"That was a most inconsistent thing to do. A man looks at the Franchise Act to see the terms upon which he is entitled to vote, and now it appears that that Act does not express what the franchise is, and that there is another condition in another Bill.",42
175,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,It was the committee who were inconsistent.,42
176,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,It is contrary to the principles of legislation that there should be such a contradiction.,42
177,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH, I feel very much impressed with the complaints and made by members who have had experience of the working of the South Australian Act. It appears that under that Act some of the officials authorized to witness the marking of the ballot-paper have been hawked about the country in the interests of certain,42

Bat while personally opposed to the suggeswho tion of the honourable and learned member, I am prepared to accept it, because I that the majority of the committee are posed to my amendment.

185,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," It seems to of me that - these amendments are rather the farcical. Tho original idea of the clause was to leave everything to the good sense of - the officials, and, although it is sought by the amendments to hedge round its provisions with safeguards, we must ultimately TUIV upon the good sense of those arc called upon to administer it. If officers are so biased that they cannot be see trusted to administer the clause as it opstands, they cannot be trusted to say whether a certain person who has sent for them is, or is not, suffering from severe illness or infirmity. I am not at all in favour of the proposal as it stands, but I memdo not see that the amendment will im",43
186,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Northern Melbourne). of - I support the view of the honourable system, member for Canobolas. The broad line which we must follow in this case is to' select officials whom we can trust. If there are abuses of power, the Public Service and Commissioner orthe Government must deal with them. By providing for the recordsons ing of votes before officials, we are ally increasing the number of polling places. Instead of having a polling place only this town and the next, we are creating polling places wherever we can get officials - whom we can trust. I originally opposed the measure providing for voting by post, which was introduced by the MCLean vernment, but I was very glad to support it when I found that the voting was to done befo/e trusted officials. I do not see why policemen should not be included among those before whom votes polled under this clause may be recorded. Owing to the diminution of crime, the policeman is being turned into a general agent of the Governtion, ment for all purposes, which I think is very useful, way of employing him. If add the police to the list of officers menought tioned in the clause, we shall meet the jection of the honourable member for Canoofficials bolas, who has pointed out that in many of country districts neither postmasters, Statecorrectly school teachers, nor police magistrates' easily procurable. Thepoliceman would know that his position depended upon, the right performance of his duties. Permanent officials feel that they must do what expected of them by law, and it is upon this feeling of responsibility that we must rely. As a general rule the police in tralia do thoir duty well. I suggest that the amendment be withdrawn.",43
187,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," The honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, seems to think that candidates would secure an advantage by taking policemen round .with them, but I would point before an elector can vote by post, he must have taken the original step of applying a certificate, which would be done quite without pressure on the part of the candiobject date or any one else. I am sorry that honourable member for Bland has met some storekeeper or postmaster who has not acted fairly, and that the honourable memberforTasmost mania, Mr O'Malley, knows some postmaster or postmistress who has travelled round nent. the country with a candidate. cases make had laws,"" and we ought to frame our legislation on the supposition that every - official, is likely to act properly simply because of the.experiences' of two honourable members. ; But if we allow votes to be recorded only before postmasters State school teachers, there are districts in which it will be impossible to find perto act.

192,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"We shall simply ask the States to allow us to use their officials, and we assume that they will consent. Then the officials must do their duty as the Bill provides. Any official neglecting or refusing to do his duty will render himself liable, under clause 178, to a penalty of £200, or imprisonment.",45
193,Mr BATCHELOR,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Would it be the of an official to go to any place to which he might be called to attest a vote 1,45
194,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"If it is not his duty to do so the Bill will prove futile. If any officer exhibits partiality, or in any way violates these provisions, he will be liable to the penalty provided for in clause 178.",45
195,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The term ""officer"" used in clause 17S refers to the electoral officers, and not to those mentioned in this clause.",45
196,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Yes, I admit that ; but the scope of the provision will have to be enlarged to apply to all the officials referred to in this clause. Mr HrcGiNS - But we could not punish a Victorian stipendiary magistrate for not carrying out these provisions.",45
197,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"That flaw extends right through the Bill. We are assuming that it is all right, but at the same time we know that it is all wrong. The present condition of affairs is not like that which prevailed before the Ballot Act was first brought into force. Labour is no longer in terror of capital, and tenants are no longer afraid of their landlords, but we have reached such a stage of development that a man need not feel ashamed or afraid to declare the side upon which he stands.

This amendment has been suggested by the provision in the Victorian Act. Under that provision the police officers were appointed. That is how Victoria dealt with these postal voting certificates.",45
199,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Why take the trouble to include all these officers if someone else, who is not mentioned in the Bill, is to do the work t",45
200,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"It may be unwise to invariably appoint police officers. The amendment suggested itself to ine, because of the objection urged by several honourable members against persons in outlying parts of the country who possess influence, and who might exercise it in connection with these voting papers. If any danger of that sort were apprehended, it would be very easy for the Governor General to .appoint somebody"" who did not possess such influence. The com- Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The Ministry might appoint a partisan.",45
201,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The power to c 9 which I refer exists in the Victorian Act, and it was exercised with advantage at the 24 last general election. If the Government possess an elastic power to make appoint15 ments, I think that the whole trouble will be overcome. AYES. Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) - I claim that all reasonable facilities for voting will be provided, if, in addition to L. the names which already appear in the clause, we include ""police officers."" Thar, would give us ample scope for the selection' of the necessary officers to carry out the provisions of this measure. I take it that any of these officers might be selected, no matter how many there might be in a particular locality. I . protest against the Minister having power on the eve of an election to appoint any person he chooses to undertake this necessary work. Where we have ample officers at the disposal of the Government, I do not see the necessity for going further. I shall, therefore, vote against the amendment.",45
202,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"It seems to me that we are getting into a curious muddle in connection with this clause. The policy of the Government as defined in it is that it is wise, in connection with voting by post, to specify the classes of persons who shall receive the 'ballot slips. We have had a long discussion in favour of enlarging those classes, the result of which has been to leave the clause as it stood, but to give an additional power to the Minister to appoint any person he chooses, irrespective of his class or occupation. That is a very circuitous way of legislating. Either it is a good thing-as was at first suggested-that we should specify the classes of persons who shall undertake this work, or it is-bad. If it be good, why should we. insert a provision which robs the clause of all virtue ? Why not leave the matter entirely in the hands of' the Government of the day 1 If we specify the persons to whom this work shall be intrusted, and the Government subsequently appoint someone else, they practically reflect upon the postmaster, or head of the State school, by saying-""Althoug h you are the person Named in the Act, we cannot trust you, and intend to appoint another individual."" It is a most invidiousthing, to say by legislation that a certain man has to do a certain thing and afterwards to leave it in the power of the Government to ignore him and appoint someone else.",46
203,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"That provision was inserted in the Victorian Act to meet the case of outlying districts, where none of these officials were stationed.",46
204,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The result of the operation of. the Victorian. Act was to show the Government that members of the police force could cover the whole ground. Why, then, should we specify'two classes, who will not cover the ground ? I would much rather leave the whole matter in the hands of the Executive than specify classes which may afterwards be ignored in the administration of the Act.",46
205,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I scarcely think that the. right honourable and learned member is correct in his interpretation of this .clause. The Government"" merely propose that they shall have an additional powerin cases where the services of the officials mentioned in this - provision are not available. The necessity for this is really to be found in the interpretation of the word ""officer."" That Word was inserted in the Senate. I saw my colleague there, and asked him to insert a word which would give to the Governor General power to do what I am striving for now. But when I come to look at this, clause, and to read it in the light of the definition of the term ""officer"" contained in clause 3, I find that it does not effect my purpose. That word was intended to comprehend everything which is> comprehended in the amendment now submitted.",46
206,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," In this clause the word ""officer"" is used and under clause 3 that term is interpreted to cover the chief electoral officer, as well as the presiding officer and poll clerks. These presiding officers and poll clerks are generally appointed only a day or two before the election takes place. Does the Minister contemplate that their positions shall be permanent ?",46
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"They are not permanent, and there is an Ac t in existence which givesthe Government power to remove them in the same way that they , are appointed'.",46
208,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,I take it that the Minister does not wish to include poll clerks as officers before whom these votes can be registered ?,46
209,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,No .,46
210,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"But according to the interpretation clause, poll clerks and presiding officers are included, and unless these officers are to be permanently appointed, I do not see how the clause can work. This provision is intended to apply to thinly populated districts, and it very often happens that the returning officer from whom the elector would have to get his authority, resides 200 or 300 miles away. The Minister might consider the suggestion of the right honourable member for East Sydney, that the persons charged with this function should be specially appointed ; otherwise the persons named in the clause would by virtue of their position have the right to perform the duties. If there should happen to be a repetition of what took place in South Australia, the Minister would, if the appointments were specially made, have power to deal' with officers so offending. At the same time, if the Minister decides on retaining the clause in its present form, I see no objection to the proposed addition. In outlying districts where there is small settlement, there is sometimes no police officer, postmaster, or schoolmaster.",46
211,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I do not see much objection to the latter part of the amendment, in view of the fact that the appointment of special registrars is in addition to the other officers mentioned in the clause. There is, however, something in the suggestion of the honourable member for Canoblas that it would be unwise to include as officers, poll-olenks and others, who are only temporarily appointed, and were not, I think, contemplated by the Minister when the clause was drawn ",47
212,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I think the remarks I made showed that the word "" officer "" was inserted with a different intention from that of making poll-clerks and others perform the duty of dealing with voters'"" certificates. I move That the words ""postmaster, officer. . . . head-master of a State school,"" linos 3 and 4, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words- "" or a police or stipendiary or special magistrate, or a head-master of a State school, or such other person in the public service of the Commonwealth or any State as may be appointed for the purposes of this section by the Governorintention General.""",47
213,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"What is a "" special magistrate""?",47
214,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"-In South Australia, if not in other States, there are what are known as ""special magistrates,"" who have the power of two ordinary magistrates. The clause is drawn to meet the circumstances of the whole Commonwealth.",47
215,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"""Under this clause, will justices of the peace of New South Wales be excluded from performing the duties 1",47
216,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Yes. .,47
217,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I do not think that the police are covered by the words "" public servant,"" except in special Acts passed for the purpose of retrenchment.",47
218,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The object of the clause will be construed with reference to this Bill, and not with reference to other Acts, and surely a police officer is a person in the public service.",47
219,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I thought so, too, until the question came to be considered in a legal and technical sense, and I take it - that public servant means a public servant by Act of Parliament.",47
220,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The clause does not say "" public servant,"" but ""person in the public service.""",47
221,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"^I cannot speak with authority as a lawyer, but it seems to me that the words "" public service"" in a Commonwealth measure will be restricted to the Commonwealth public service.",47
222,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,There will be no trouble on that point. Amendment agreed to.,47
223,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Is - there any necessity for the words ""and of no other person V The effect of the clause is that no other person can so act. Mr Y . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). It would not be desirable to strike out those words, which bear a different meaning from that attached to them, by the leader of the Opposition. This clause is taken from the South Australian Act, and the intention is that nobody but the officer shall be present when the vote is registered.",47
224,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," It is very important, in dealing with this particular kind of voting, that the envelopes-containing the votes and ready to be despatched, should"" not pass into the possession of any third person before going into the post. It is the that when the voter has enclosed his vote he shall either hand it to the postmaster or post it himself; and that is a very proper provision. I see the difficulty, of course, in the case of persons who are ill ; but to leave any opportunity for the envelope getting into the possession of a third person might lead to serious danger. For instance, an elector might be under the influence of some one for whom he had promised to vote ; and the personto whom .the promise had been made might insist on seeing the voting-paper before it was despatched. There are various methods which persons with strong reasons, and small principle, may use for the purpose of surreptitiously opening envelopes ; and we know that a few votes may alter an election, and have a great effect on the politics of the Commonwealth. If voters are put into the position of being compelled to hand their ballot-papers to persons who have great influence over them, the secrecy of the ballot w i ll be gone, because the envelope provided for can easily be opened and closed again. It is quite conceivable that hundreds of votes might be polled in that way, so that persons interested might be able to say whether the voters really voted as they had promised, under some improper influence, to do. The clause aims at the voter posting the ballot paper himself. It says that he shall record his voteBy handing' it to a postmaster for posting, posting it at a post-office. Mr L . E. G ROOM - That provision would allow persons who were ill to vote only before a postmaster.",47
225,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"No harm could be done if the provision were evaded in such cases. But the intention is that the ballot-papers shall be either handed to a postmaster for posting or be posted by the voters themselves. I see the difficulty of preventing the abuse to which I have referred, but some remedy should be provided. What makes the matter more serious, in my eyes, is that under the Franchise A ct the qualification of an elector is that his name is on the .electors' roll, and it is not provided in the Bill that a man who has left an electorate shall thereby be disqualified from voting in it. A man may have left an electorate for two years, but unless some person files an objection before a revision court, and pays a deposit of 5s., his name will not be removed from the roll. It is astonishing how many men remove from a populous electorate in the course of twelve months. In Sydney we have found that in that time 700 or 800 men leave a district in which there are 2,500 on the roll.",48
226,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Do they get their names on another roll ?,48
227,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"They need not do so. That fact constitutes another grave political danger. '.Unless special machinery is brought into play, their names remain upon the roll for the division from which they have removed. But at election time their weight can be thrown either into the electorate from which they have removed, or into the electorate in which they reside. In New South Wales a voter may be asked, "" Do you still possess the qualification in respect to which this elector's right was issued to you?"" and he would be liable to a penalty for perjury if he stated falsely that he did. But under the Bill an elector may be asked only whether he is the person whose name appears on the roll, to which he can truthfully say, ""Yes;"" and whether he has already voted at the election or is disqualified from voting, to both of which he may be able truthfully to say, "" No . "" The names of hundreds of persons who have removed from a district may remain on the rolls for a year or two after they have left, because no one will take the trouble to have them removed. or What is everybody's business is nobody's business, and no elector is likely to deposit 5s. in order lhat the name of John Smith, who has removed from the district, may be struck off the roll.",48
228,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,The only way is to allow the electoral officer to strike off such names.,48
229,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"An electoral officer would not scour his district to ascertain whether John Smith had removed from, say, 150 Yurong-street, East Sydney, and gone to Bourke. Therefore, when an election took place there might be hundreds of men living out of an electorate in which they were actually residing. Of course, where men apply for a transfer no harm can, happen.",48
230,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"If an election took place at Bourke before an elector was qualified for that division, he could not vote by post for his own electorate.",48
231,Mr REID,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Yes , he could. Unfortunately he would have a choice. He could either get a transfer, and vote for .Bourke, or he could vote by post for his old electorate. I simply mention the matter so that it may be considered. The difficulty might be got over if it were made a disqualification for an elector to have ceased to reside in a division, and the question might be asked, "" Do you still possess the qualification in respect to which you were enrolled?"" Then a scrutineer, seeing an absentee, could direct the presiding officer's attention to him, and he would probably abstain from voting.",48
232,Mr GB EDWARDS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"South Sydney) The leader of the Opposition has pointed out a very serious flaw in the clause under consideration, which I noticed myself, and intended to 'deal with. The whole of the clauses providing for voting by post will be nullified if the last sub-clause is not altered in some way, though it appears to be rather difficult to frame a safe provision. As the clause stands, an elector, having secured a certificate entitling him to vote, appears before one of certain authorized officers, to whom he submits his ballot paper unmarked, to have the counterfoil signed. He then retires in secrecy to mark the danger. paper, and the officer before whom the vote is recorded is not allowed to see how it marked, or whether it is marked at all. The envelope must be closed down by the voter, but it may or may not be gummed, he has then to post it himself. I know from experience that this system will give opporThe tunities for wide-spread frauds. 'Voters who could be influenced would be directed to is apply for certificates entitling them to by post, and they would be instructed that after they had had their papers marked before the proper officers they must show them to the electioneering agent, who would see that they had been "" proago, perly "" marked, and would post them. This provision is a very dangerous one needs to be safeguarded. The envelope must containing the vote should either be sealed by the voter aud posted by the officer, sealed by the officer and posted by the voter. The seal should be such that i could not very well be tampered with, and the returning officer should be empowered to reject any vote contained in an envelope which had been tampered with. Unless we at a nake some such provision, postal voting will be very dangerous. Perhaps it would be as well to withdraw the clause for the present until the two or three which have been raised can be fully, considered. It has been said that the ballot itself can be tampered with, and one way of doing so is that which has been referred to in the House of Commons as "" the Tasmanian dodge."" Under this plan post it. I movea man goes into the polling booth and obtains a voting paper. He then deposits or a blank paper in the ballot box, and takes once the voting paper out with him to an agent, master, who marks it as he desires. Another man takes in this marked voting paper, and, after obtaining another voting paper, deposits the marked paper in the box, bringing the blank voting paper to the agent. So the process may be repeated, and a large number of votes may thus be manipulated. We are now introducing a new principle, which will leave the door open for much more extensive fraud than even that, because a large number postal ballot - papers may be secured an agent and manipulated in the interests of the candidate he represents. I am desirous that this jjrovision which I recognise as a step forward in the march of. electoral reform should not be attended by any such",48
233,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Northern Melbourne) is We must all recognise the importance of the point raised by the leader of the Opposition, and the necessity of preventing any person and from interposing between the voter and the official before whom he records his vote. voting paper must not be handled by any one other than the voter after the vote recorded, until it is placed in some official' vote hands. I indicated at an earlier stage of this discussion that I should propose an amendment at the end of sub-clause 5. At the time 7. framed my amendment I had not looked at the ""Victorian Act of two years but I find that my draft follows the same lines as were adopted in that Act. and It is provided there that the voter hand his paper to the official for posting. Thus no risk is incurred of the vote or falling into the hands of an electioneering agent. I suggest that we should adopt at similar system. Section 9 of the Voting by Post A ct of Victoria, No. 701, providesand the elector shall then enclose the postal ballot-paper in an envelope, and hand the same . once to the postmaster or officer for posting.",49
234,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,What objection is there to permitting the elector to post his doubtful points vote himself 1,49
235,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"In such a case there would be no guarantee that the vote would not pass into strange hands. We are trusting the officer to take the vote properly, and we should be prepared to trust him to That the words, "" to a postmaster for posting posting it at a post-office,"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" at to such postmaster, magistrate, or heador other person as aforesaid for posting.""",49

243,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," Seeing that the Minister has accepted the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Melbourne, it will be necessary for him to follow it up by inserting additional provistead'of sions, which are contained in the Victorian Act.

262,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I desire to draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence to a matter which has been brought under my notice by the various rifle clubs of the State. During the last few days I 'have been perfectly inundated with communications' from the rifle clubs, pointing out that it is proposed to retire Colonel Templeton, the officer who is in charge of these associations in Victoria. If such be the case it appears a most extraordinary act at a time of retrenchment. Colonel Templeton is an honorary officer, and has rendered magnificent services, for which he has charged nothing. He was selected on I account of his special fitness to control rifle clubs, and they haA'e made marvellous progress under his direction. He is eminently qualified for the work, being an excellent and enthusiastic rifle shot, and a good disciplinarian and drill, instructor.",51
263,Mr OKOUCH,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,He was commander of the militia battalion for years.,51
264,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Colone l Templeton is strong, healthy, and active, aud capable of giving many years of useful service : and why such a gentleman should be retired "" I cannot imagine. If it be for the purpose, as I presume, of placing a highly paid official in his place, it seems a somewhat extraoidinary move. The retirement is evidently inteuded for the purpose of bringing the volunteers under the direct control of military officers, which is just what the rifle clubs throughout Victoria want to retired ? avoid. The object of the rifle clubs is to qualify persons at the least pense, to shoot, and thus f it themselves for the defence of the country.",51
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,What Colonel Templeton been retired from t,52
266,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Colone l Templeton was placed in a special position outside of the military forces. He is purely a reason. volunteer officer, his official title being the officer commanding the volunteer clubs. My object in drawing attention to the matter is that the Minister may inquire fully into it before taking any further tion.",52
267,Mr MCCOLL,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," The members of the rifle clubs in my district, of which there are a number, are greatly excited over this proposed change. Colonel Templeton has been associated with the rifle club movement from its inception. He was specially appointed because of his qualifications, and I believe that the work has been j i labour of love with him, and that he has the entire confidence of this arm of the force. I strongly urge the Minister, not to be guided too much by the' milithe tary authorities in this matter, but to act according to his own judgment. There are 20,000 riflemen in Victoria alone, and many others in the other States. They are all first-class shots, and must of great importance in regard to our defence. I should be sorry to see their ardour cooled by the proposed change. ' Mr Mauger (Melbourne Ports) - I too, have been inundated by petitions i regard to this matter.",52
268,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,So have I .,52
269,Mr MAUGER,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Then , perhaps, the honourable gentleman understands the merits and demerits of the case. There is a strong feeling on the part of those enrolled in our rifle clubs that the wrong step being taken, and I am sure that the honorput able gentlemen will give the matter the earnest consideration which it demands.",52
270,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I join is with other honourable members in asking the Minister to give this matter serious sideration. It would be a great pity and great blow to the service if a man Templeton's ripe experience and sound discretion were lost to the country. He is man in the prime of life, and has won golden opinions.",52
271,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Why has he been,52
272,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Because he has possible expassed the age limit.,52
273,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"There was no reason for retiring him on that account, because position has he receives no salary.",52
274,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,A large number of other officers who are receiving practically no salary have been retired for the same,52
275,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Colone l Templeton has been performing his work as a labour of love. He has the confidence of the rifle acclubs of the State, and it would cause great dissatisfaction if he were retired, especially as there seeme to be no good reasons why he should be. I fear that the Minister has been misinformed or misled in some way by officers occupying permanent positions, and I hope that before getting rid of Colonel Templeton he will take into consideration the views which have been put before him, not only in this House, but privately. Mr G. B. EDWAR DS (South Sydney) This is not a question which should be left entirely to Victorian members. I acknowledge services which Colonel Templeton has rendered to the rifle club movement in Victoria, but before we can properly discuss this matter, we must know what scheme it is proposed to adopt for the future military be defence of the Commonwealth. Without that scheme before us we cannot judge whether the Government have done right in retiring Colonel Templeton. My opinion has always , been that the rifle clubs should form an n integral part of the defences of the Commonwealth,, and if it is necessary in order that they may . do so to retire Colonel Templeton, I am willing to agree to his retirement, brilliant and helpful as his services have been. I hoped that an announcement as to the policy of the Governis ment in regard to defence would have been before us much earlier in the session, but the matter has been hung up, and I believe that the Minister for Home Affairs still grappling with it . We cannot discuss the subject of Colonel Templeton's retireconment without knowing what are the proa posals of the Government in regard to the of Colonel whole question of defence.",52
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I a do not think that the Minister can make fish of one and flesh of another, and I am acquainted with a number of hard cases which liave been brought about by the application of the age limit.",52
277,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"This is not a hard case so far as the individual is concerned, because Colonel Templeton has been getting no salarv.",53
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"The officers to whom I . refer get practically nothing. They receive £ 5 0 or £ 0 0 a year, but that does not keep them in horse-feed, or provide them with uniforms.",53
279,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,They get less than that.,53
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"In New South Wales Colonel Holborow, a man practically worshipped by, his regiment, has been retired because he has reached the age limit. I do not think we can make invidious distinctions between any of these officers. Colonel Holborow has been in the service of his State for the last 30 years.",53
281,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,There is no case upon all fours with that of Colonel Templeton. He is outside the military altogether.,53
282,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,That is part of trouble.,53
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I do not know thab the fact mentioned by the honourable member for Gippsland is a reason why Colonel Templeton should not have been retired. Tho whole scheme for defence must be placed before the House before these individual cases can be dealt with. I feel that some of the retirements in New South Wales are very hard indeed, and almost harsh, but in justice to the Minister, who has had a most unpleasant duty thrust upon him, we should hear what he has to say before judging his action.",53
284,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I wish to know from the Minister if it is not correct that Major Boam, who is really doing a large part of the work of the rifle club movement in 'Victoria, was retired from the New South Wales forces because he is over age.",53
285,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Ye s : but he is acting now as a clerk, not as a military officer.",53
286,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I understand that he has been appointed at a salary of £300 to do the work which Colonel Templeton was doing. Colonel Templeton was, four or five years ago, a brigadier of the infantry militia of Victoria. He had won respect for his ability and his command of men, and he was offered £250 a year to take charge of the rifle club movement: but, feeling that he could occupy himself with honour -.11 c without the salary, he accepted the position for the kudos he might gain, and for the pleasure he would receive in seeing the movement grow under his hand. He has largely helped .to create the rifle club movement, which is of such importance to our defences : and I think the Minister should explain why another officer, who has also passed the age limit, has been given his work. I do not agree with the honourable members for South Sydney and Parramatta that we should wait until the Minister gives us some explanation before criticizing what is being done. Action has been taken which, in some instances, is irrevocable. At Swan Island, in my constituency,eight men, some of them between 20 and 25 years of age, have been dismissed, although they are necessary for the efficiency of the engineering corps there. I think it was intended that the scheme of retrenchment which has been sanctioned should not affect the men at all, but simply the allowances of the officers. Our defence forces are being the smashed up, and the work of years is being destroyed ;. and yet we are told that we should wait for the statement of the Minister at some future time before having anything to say on the subject.",53
287,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,The dismissals should be held over pending discussion.,53
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,They have already taken place.,53
289,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I should like the Minister to let us know definitely when he is prepared to make an explanation, or. to promise that nothing will be. done until the whole matter has been discussed.",53
290,Mr CHANT ER,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I join with other honourable members in testifying to the high character and ability of Colonel Templeton. I have known him for many years, and I think it was a mistake to retire him. There' is another matter which I wish to bring under the consideration of the Minister? Some time ago, an ardent desire was manifested by our young men in all the States to form themselves into rifle clubs. From my own electorate, and from other parts of the Commonwealth, requests have been sent in for permission to form these clubs, but the applicantsliave been put off from time to time-in one case for twelve months-and have been unable to obtain any satisfaction from the military authorities. This delay .is doing great harm, because it is killing the spirit which we should cultivate among our young people in order that we may have ample reserves of good rifle shots to draw upon for the purposes of defence. The policy of the Government should be, and so far as I ' know is, to give every encouragement to young men to form rifle clubs, and bring themselves to a state of efficiency as rifle shots, .so that they might readily become competent members of any military organization necessary in the case of invasion. I trust that the Minister will make a careful inquiry, and that the ardour of our riflemen will not be damped by continued delays in the organization of clubs.",53
291,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," Fro m the revelations made to-night, it would appear that, if the Government continue dismissing the privates, they will have no force left but a lot of officers, for whom there will be no occupation. From what I witnessed at the swearing-in of the Acting Governor General, I should judge that there were any number of officers, because they seemed to come in from all quarters. At the time that the defence retrenchment was decided upon I felt that there was a danger that the poor men would be sacrificedthat the democrats would have to go in order to make room for the plutocrats.",54
292,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH," I think that the honourable and learned member for Corio was scarcely fair when he referred to the dismissal of certain young men belonging to the Victorian Permanent Artillery. The House has deliberately decided that the defence estimates must be reduced by £131,000.",54
293,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"But were not the fence estimates increased by over £200,000 at the time of transfer ?",54
294,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Yes , by the States.",54
295,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I am not going into that matter now, because it would take too long to dea* with all the details. The honourable member, however, is absolutely mistaken in supposing that we had a margin f about £200,000 to work upon. 0 I would ask honourable, members how the decision of the House is to be carried out unless we make some reductions in the forces.",54
296,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,The Government are increasing the number of officers.,54
297,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"That is absolutely incorrect. The proportion of officers retired is larger than that represented by the men dismissed. I have been through the whole of the staffs, and a very unpleasant task it has' been. In New South Wales the headquarters sbaff alone has been reduced by fourbeen othcers, and some of the men musb also go. A proposal has been made bo me bo reduce the pay of the men, bub I have refused bo do so. The case referred bo by the honourable and learned member for Corio probably arose in this way :- A list was brought to me one evening by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, showing that certain married men in the permanent arbilleiy force in Vicboria had been .recommended for rebiremenb, and I was requested to give the married men preference over the single men. This seemed to he reasonable, and the result has been that some of the younger men have been retired; while the married men remain in the service.",54
298,Mr CEOUCH,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,The eight men to whom I have referred include four married men.,54
299,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"I do not know about that particular case, but certain dismissals musb bake place, because the cosb of our defences has to be reduced. In reference to the remarks made by the honourable menaber for Parramatta, no doubt there are a number of cases, including the oue to which he refers, in which officers have been retired under circumstances involving great hardship. Colonel Holborrow was paid only a few pounds per annum, and as there is no doubt that he has practically given up his life to military work, it is hard upon him, and also upon others in New South Wales, that they should be called upon to retire at this time. There are also de- several very hard cases in Queensland. I do not think there are any in South Australia, because the Sbabe Governmenb had retrenched so far that it was not possible to go muchfurbher in that direction. I realise that something must be done with regard to the rifle clubs, and I am expecting a report upon the subject from the military authorities. I have always taken a very great interest in those clubs, as I have been a member of one or two of them for several years, and have tried my best to become an efficient rifle shot. A recommendation was made bo me to strike off nearly all the grants to the rifle clubs, or to reduce them to a merely nominal sum ; but I refused to carry out that suggestion, and the grants are being placed on the Estimates in the same way as before. My action in this matter does not show any desire to injure the rifle clubs. The difficulty in Victoria is caused by the fact that the rifle clubs have grown to an enormous extent. They now have 20,000 members, and whereas a year or so ago they used 1,300,000 rounds of ammunition, they expended last year 4,000,000 rounds, and between 4,000,000 and - 5,000,000 rounds will be required for the current year. involves serious expense. I do not know how the expenditure of ammunition can bo curtailed, but some provision must be made so that the cost shall not be so largo as in the past. It strikes me. that there is a great leakage somewhere; as it would be almost impossible to fire away that quantity of ammunition in a legitimate manner. I am against any undue military interference with the rifle clubs, but still there must be a governing power, and I do not think that 20,000 armed men in Victoria, or 30,000 or 40,000 in the whole Commonwealth, should be absolutely beyond the control of the military authorities. Mr G. B. KnwABDS - They will be of no use for defence purposes unless they are under control. / ",54
300,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"No ; but at the same time) as I say, I am entirely opposed to any undue military interference with the rifle clubs. Now, with regard to the case of Colonel Templeton, that officer has been retired as being over the age l i m it ; and I would ask honourable members where we are to stop if we make exceptions to that rule.",55
301,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,Surely there is a difference between officers who are working for nothing and those who are drawing high salaries 1,55
302,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"But a number of other officers who have occupied positions similar to that held by Colonel Templeton, so far as salary is concerned, have also been retired. Colonel Templeton mode a stipulation with the State Government that his age should not operate as a cause for his retirement; but, now that the whole matter has come under the control of the Commonwealth, one general age' limit has been fixed, and I am trying as far - as I possibly can to avoid being placed in the invidious position of allowing one officer to remain in his position whilst retiring another.. ' I am not making any exceptions. I have my own'opiuion as to the age - limit, which was fixed before I took over the control of the Defence department. I know 41 u z many good men who have a lot of work left in them, who have been retired; but that is a military matter. A number of petitions have been presented to me during today and yesterday, and I suppose that I shall receive others from all the rifle clubs with reference to Colonel Templeton's retirement. Theserepresentations will receive duo consideration. I know Colonel Templeton, and. This that is all, and I have no feeling whatever against him. I feel that I shall have manyinfluences brought to bear upon me to in- duce me to reinstate this person or that, person; but I must sit tight if I am to carry out' retrenchment such as the House has.. demanded. Mr A . MCLKAN - If Colonel Templeton.. is retired, a salaried officer willhave to do-. his work.",55
303,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"So far as-. Major Boam is concerned, I believe the salary paid now is less than it was. I am not quite sure. Two or three clerks have been removed to the Treasury, and their salaries have been saved, and Major Boam is doing the work for the same salary that it was previously costing: He is a very able man, and he is now acting as. a clerk. The applications from rifle clnbs,. which were referred to by. the honourable, member for Riverina, almost stagger one,, and unless the House js prepared to vote a. larger sum of money for defence purposes,, wo cannot accede to all the requests. Then,, again, the members of rifle clubs are applying for '303 magazine rifles - We have in stock a large number of '303-rifles without., the magazines, and I cannot understand why the members of rifle clubs cannot becontent with these weapons for a time, in stead of putting the Commonwealth to theexpense, of obtaining magazine rifles. Wealso have a large number of Martini-Henry rifles, and a large quantity of ammunition for them. The members of the rifled uba can learn . to shoot just as well with Martini rifles as with Lee-Metford magazine rifles, and it. would be better to wear out these weapons, and when we get fresh rifles secure the best obtainable.",55
304,Mr BROWS,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"A number of clubs cannot-' get rifles of any kind. Sir AVILLIA M LYNE - When I was in Sydney I was applied to on behalf of some of the rifle clubs for magazine rifles, but I considered that it would be highly improper to grant any such request, because it would involve a very heavy outlay to-supply magazine rifles all round. We must use up our present supplies before WB buy new rifles and ammunition. That is one of the reasons why the requests from some of these rifle clubs cannot be acceded to as readily as we could wish. I am a great believer in rifle clubs, and I should: like to encourage their formation in every possible way, because I believe that the men who, as members of these clubs, are taught to shoot will bave to be depended upon to come to our assistance in case of invasion.",55
305,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,When will the defence retrenchment scheme be submitted to the House?,56
306,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"It is impossible to say at present. The task has been a very arduous one, and it is very nearly completed, but I cannot make any statement to honourable members before the Estimates . are framed and put in proper order. The principle upon which I have acted has been ""to dispense with a number of officers as well as men, and not to unreasonably reduce the pay of the men.",56
307,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,The pay of the permanent - engineers has been reduced.,56
308,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLIC WORKS IN SOUTH,"Generally the pay has not been reduced, except in the - case of the Victorian Naval Brigade. The pay of the, men in that instance was reduced from £ 9 10s. to £ 8 10s. per annum. We must have harmony throughout the : States in connection with a matter of this sort. I . wish to retire' a good propor- tion of officers as well as of men. The largest reduction has been made in Queensland, because that State possessed more men than it should have had relatively to its population. The forces there have been reduced by 800 or 900. In New South Wales the naval brigade has been reduced - from 650 to 440, and I have entirely dis- pensed with the naval artillery volunteers ; - so that honourable members will recognise ithat Victoria is not the only State in which retrenchment has taken place. It has had .a biting effect in the other States. I will give every consideration to the matter brought forward by the honourable member for Gippsland, but I cannot promise to accord one officer different treatment from that meted out to another. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.2 p.m.",56
