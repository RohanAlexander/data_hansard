What could be fairer than the subscribed to by the former government, that anything else, if it comes to that-should be of this particular policy. It extends to nursing introduced in respect of hostels. It means that contribution will be asked to do so. Mr Deputy Speaker, the unfairness of the opposition's 'We will jump in and attempt to frighten as somehow there will no longer be a nursing home money or sell the family home.' But neither point over and over again, although opposition will not be required to sell the family home cannot afford to pay will simply not have to principle that the former government always accepted.

The principle of that is sound, and it is a small windows of opportunity for criticism in on it in an attempt not to make a small opening and make people think that there is actually happy to stand up here, as I have stood up in my group-and say to those people that our policy also address the other fundamental problem that was a chronic shortage of nursing home beds. cannot get into nursing homes. There are people at a very critical stage of their life, who cannot government did nothing to address that system, especially the funding complexities.

(2) Did he undertake to (a) unleash ADI and (b) ensure that ADI's local capability would not be sacrificed to the expedience of overseas purchases; if so, how. (3) Will he ensure that ADI Lithgow retains its staffing at existing levels and pursues contracts other than defence business; if so, by what steps. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In February 1996 I stated and I quote ""Since ADI was corporatised by Labor in 1988 Lithgow ADI has gone from a state-of-the-art facility with about 1100 employees to a business struggling to support 200 workers"". It is pointed out that during this period ADI across-the-board downsized by 65% as part of restructuring. (2)(a) 'Yes'.
