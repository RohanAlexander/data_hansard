In this particular year the Queensland government schools by six per cent; the cent. The Commonwealth has increased funding ing the parents who pay for the choice they tra amount this year.

This is an area of education in Queensland have grown by almost seven per power, and this year we are looking at an increase the Queensland government is not even keeping ing.

My concern comes down in a very local sense Ten years ago the Labor Party were hell-bent providing general services. I was part of the shame Labor into the business of supporting that Borbidge-Sheldon government that there was the health minister during those years, in fact Labor are up to their old tricks: they are doing Some of it is in subtle ways, and one of them stroy the efforts of the QEII hospital auxiliary.
