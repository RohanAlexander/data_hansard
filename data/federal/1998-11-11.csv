Thankfully, there are very to use the standing orders to that extent. taken over this responsibility in education with with the government and to work in a way that the parliament. We will not seek to unnecessarily believe that important pieces of legislation are in this parliament. We do not believe legislation which we are debating this afternoon. was dealt with by the previous parliament but that is why it is back here. It is also true only into the House of Representatives and that debated. Even if we allow for the fact that the into the last parliament, it has made changes into a new bill, and that should allow the to consider the changes that the government NA Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE has made in this new piece of legislation. It new, consolidated piece. The opposition was only given a draft copy had a party meeting on Tuesday. We were given afternoon after our parliamentary party had for me and my staff to give proper consideration recommendation to the shadow ministry, let Labor Party and the caucus committee an opportunity party meeting. I would like to use this opportunity to say that on education is conditional upon the minister does not have full control over all of these legislation to the shadow ministry, our parliamentary party's caucus meetings. If the time to allow our members to consider this legislation, that we will use the standing orders of the parliament legislation in a proper manner. The reason we are a number of institutions that will need this legislation to pass, even though there has legislation today. I repeat once again to the minister, that this is the last occasion on legislation on education through this parliament opportunity for the party that got 51 per cent Howard government's intentions. Having mentioned that we had less than 24 also point out that late last night we were makes the sins of omission even worse--added way, we will not be allowing the government future on education. In many ways, this is a very bad start for only hope that the government gets its act together two such vitally important education bills If the government had had the courage to legislate announced in 1996 in tertiary education, or not be faced with the ridiculous situation now without debate six weeks before university The minister should have had plenty of portfolio responsibilities have been halved, but believe that this is an issue that Before the 1996 election the member for Bennelong, the following: A Howard government will maintain levels of funding The main provision of this bill is to belatedly million to Australia's universities.
