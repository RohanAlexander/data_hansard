2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Peuuon of the undersigned dtizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: Child endowment received by families has declined relative to average earnings cent of its value in 1949. The Interim Report of the Australian Government's Commission Into Poverty recommended a substantial increase in Child Endowment as a way of alleviating poverty. This report pointed out that increased Child Endowment deserved priority and would be advantageous to the community in the long run. It specifically recommended increasing child endowment from SO cents to $ 1.50 for the first child; from $ 1.00 to $2.00 for the second child; from $2.00 to $4.00 for the third child; from $2.25 to $7.00 for the fourth child; and to $8.00 for subsequent children. Your petitioners humbly request that the Government increase Child Endowment in the September Budget. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mrs Child, Mr Fulton, Mr Scholes, Mr Staley and Mr Street Petitions received. To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate and the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the inflation which now besets so many countries today and in Australia is now at the rate of 14.4 per annum is most seriously affecting and making life intolerable for those least able to take corrective action to maintain their posiuon, namely, pensioners and those now retired living on fixed incomes. Whilst the Australian Government is giving effect to its election policy of making $1.50 per week pension increases each Autumn and Spring such actions have been completely nullified This fact of life impels your petitioners to call on the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to: Make a cash loading of $5 per week to those pensioners who have little means other than the present inadequate pension eroded by inflation. That each Autumn and Spring the increase in social security pension payments be not less than $3 per week to ensure that within a reasonable period the Government's policy pledge to affix all pensions at 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings be achieved. In order that money may go to areas of greater need the Tapered Means Test ceilings of income and assets be frozen. To allay the concern of social security recipients as to their future when in 1975 the means test has been PETITIONS abolished and replaced by a National Superannuation Act that there be an assurance by the Australian Government that the said Act will provide a guaranteed minimum income to social security recipients based on the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' Federation and that of the Australian Child Endowment Council of Trade Unions, namely, the payment of 30 per cent of average weekly earnings adjusted from time to time in accordance with figures issued by the Commonwealth Statistician and published quarterly. And your petitioners in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hewson and Mr Mulder. so that today it is about 20 per Petitions received. Universal Health Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed Universal Health Scheme is essential to the well being of all Australians, in so far as it will(i) Provide that all Australians irrespective of their means will have access to a high standard of health care. (ii) Every Australian will be automatically covered for doctors' and hospital bills thus ensuring that citizens will no longer be burdened with additional psychological strains because of inability to meet the high cost of medical treatment. (Ui) It is committed, in principle towards the ideal that an individual's contribution to the cost of health services should be based on his or her capacity to pay-that people who derive the most financial benefit from our society should give the most for its support. (iv) It guarantees freedom of choice so that every Australian will be able to attend the doctor or hospital Social Security ofhis or her own choice. (v) In the long term it will take the politics out of medical care and will thereby allow dedicated members of the medical profession to return to the occupadon of their choice . . . The care of the ill and the prevention of disease. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will hasten to introduce this much needed scheme so that health care services in Australia can begin to function efficiently and economically.

Baltic States To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizen of Australia respectfully showeth: Regarding the 'recognition' of the control by the Soviet Union of the three Baltic countries Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia by the Australian Government, be rescinded. Your Petiuoners therefore humbly pray that in the name of all that is dignified and decent in humanity that the 'recognition ' above be rescinded. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Oldmeadow. Peuuon received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Whereas the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were independent republics and members of the League of Nations until occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union following a secret agreement between Hitler and Stalin, such annexation has not been recognised by the Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada and many European countries. As announced recently in Moscow, the Australian Government has now recognised them as part of the Soviet Union and according to the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs such decision has been made the Prime Minister without consulting the Government or Parliament. We the undersigned petitioners humbly beg Parliament to express its disapproval of such action. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Wallis. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. The Peuuon of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. Your petitioners believe in the principle that every Australian child, irrespective of the school he attends, is entitled to economic support for his basic educational needs from the funds placed at the disposal of the Australian Government through taxauon. Further, they believe that this the form of per pupU grants which to the cost of educating an Australian child in a government school. 2. Your pedtioners believe that in addiuon to this basic per pupil grant additional vided in cases of educational disadvantage, but believe that the appropriate instrumentsforreducing economic inequalities are taxation and social welfare systems which deal with not with schools. Your pedtioners therefore humbly pray that, as an interim measure, the Government will immediately increase the current grants being made to children in non-government schools to at least 50 per cent of the cost of educating children in government schools, thus enabling the nongovernment schools to conunue to exist and fulfill their function of educating Australian children. And your peuuoners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Chipp and Mr Scholes. Petitions received. Uranium To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas uranium found in vast quantities in Australia is the raw material for the nuclear fission reaction, And whereas presently assured reserves of uranium in Australia represent a potential production of over 540,000 kilograms of Plutonium 239 if utilized in Light Water Reactors overseas, Baltic States And whereas the Maximum Permissible Inhalation of Plutonium 239 is 0.00000025 gram, And whereas Plutonium 239 is one of the most dangerous substances human society has ever created, causing mutations and cancers, And whereas there are no methods of safely and absolutely confining Plutonium from the biosphere for the requisite quarter of a mUUon years, And whereas Plutonium coming in contact with the air forms an aerosol cloud of micron-sized panicles, its most dangerous form, And whereas the export of uranium may return to us an import of Plutonium particles dispersed in the global environment via the circulation of the atmosphere, by And whereas there are no sure safeguards against the military use of nuclear fission, and the nuclear proliferation represents a prime environmental threat to all forms of life on the only earth available to us, And that it is therefore an act of self-preservation to demand a halt to all exports of uranium except for biomedical uses, Your peddoners humbly pray that the members, in the House assembled, will take the most urgent steps to ensure: Education 1. That funher mining and expon of uranium from Australia except for bio-medical purposes be banned, 2. That the Australian Atomic Energy Commission be transformed by the rewriting of its chaner into an Australian Energy Commission to funher the understanding of energy flows through our society and to promote national economic independence and selfsufficiency. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, economic support should be in are directly related by DrJ. F. Cairns. Petition received. Australian Textile Industry assistance should be prothey To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of residents of the State of Victoria respectfully individuals and famiUes and showeth: That we have cause to be greatly concerned with the state of the textile industry in Australia, and the effect upon this industry caused by the Ufting of tariffs on low-cost garments entering this country from Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Korea, etc. For a period of over twelve months Australia has been flooded with low-cost garments of inferior quality imponed from Asian countries. This has caused a widespread slump in the garment industry and as a result many of our large and hitheno successful manufacturers have been forced to lay off large numbers of trained and qualified staff. Many of these people arefindingalternative employment difncult or impossible to obtain, thus suffering hardship and we, stiU in the industry feel that our jobs and our security are at grave risk. Our employers too, are facing great economic difficulues and many have already closed their businesses as a direct result of the unfair competition arising from Asian produced textiles. We, your petitioners, therefore humbly pray that the government examine closely the depressed state of the Australian textile industry and take the necessary steps to bring about a state of full employment and economic growth by imposing restraint on the importation of lowlabour-cost textiles, your peuuoners as in duty bound will ever pray. byDr J.F. Cairns. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens showeth: 1. That the whole principle of the Family Law Bill 1974 is aimed at destroying the entire concept of marriage as traditionally recognised in Australia, with its special obUgations between husband and wife and between parents and children. 2. That the bill fails to recognise or provide for the equal rights and responsibilities of both parties to a marriage, such as are provided for in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including therightsof parents to choose the type of education they desire for their children. 3. That this bill appears to express the desires of only a minority of Australians. Your pedtioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should not admit into the law of this land the principle that marriage is only temporary and the family no longer the fundamental unit of society. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Kevin Cairns. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned, being citizens of Australia, respectfully showeth: That we strongly oppose the Family Law Bill, 1974, which is being introduced into our Federal Parliament by Honourable The Attorney-General, Murphy, because of the absence of protection for the human family in its natural and traditional constituuon as the basic unit, the ostensibly permanent unit of human society. We oppose the Bill because of the omission of a dearly defined dause like that which is incorporated in Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and which dares that both men and women in marriage and that Parents shall have the right to choose their children's education. We oppose the Bill which is Murphy, because either the Bill becomes law, will have no defence, i.e., no legal objection, to a divorce which might be desired and instituted by the other party. In this conception of law, there is no justice, no humanity, and no recognition of the traditionally accepted standard of marriage and the family, but there is a tremendously noticeable backward step in the civilisation of Austrahan people. Whilst we oppose the Bill for above mentioned reasons, we see it as expressing the views of an individual, or the views of a minority of citizens or their Representatives, instead of the views of the majority of Australians. Therefore, we beg the rejection, and not the passing of this Bill. And your petitioners, as in duty bound ever pray. particularly of Asian origin, and by Mr Kevin Cairns. Peuuon received. Family Law Bill Marriage To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned sitizens of Australia respectfully showeth: of Australia respectfully (1) We are strongly opposed to any reduction in the present 24 month separation period requirement now to be fulfilled prior to the date of commencement of the hearing of an application for the dissolution of a marriage. (2) We believe that evidence should be produced that genuine attempts have been made at reconcUiation. (3) We believe both panies are entitled to equitable distribution of family property and assets. (4) We urge the inclusion, in this Bill or in other legislation, of positive steps to provide funds for Family Life Education in schools and in post school years, for Preparation for Marriage programmes and for the decentralising of approved Guidance Facilities and for education in Marriage Courses for young marrieds. Your pedtioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will amend the proposed FamUy Law Bill in accordance with the points contained herein. And your pedtioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, by Mr Hodges. Family Law Bill Petition received. Jervis Bay: Heavy Industry To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives. The petition of citizens of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory respectfully The showeth that we seek to protect the natural environment of Senator Lionel Jervis Bay. We consider the construction of steel works or any other heavy industry requiring Wide Water Location to be the most immediate and serious threat to the natural values of Jervis Bay. The Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourdeable House will reject the Armco proposals or any other as shall have equal rightsstated above. And your pedtioners as in duty bound will ever pray, accredited to Senator by Mr Kerin. of the parties to a marriage, if Petition received. National Health Scheme To the Honourable, The Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Peddon of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed 'free' national health scheme is not free at all and will cost four out of five the present scheme. That the proposed scheme is discriminatory and a further erosion of the civil liberties of Australian ticularly working wives and single persons. That the proposed scheme is in fact a plan for nationalised medicine which will lead to gross waste and inefficiencies in medical services and will ultimately remove an individual's right to choose his/her own doctor. Your pedtioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measures to interfere with the basic principles of the existing health scheme which functions efficiently and economically. And your peuuoners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr MCLeay. Petition received. To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That a Pension Scheme for males, bringing up porting their children, similar ation for females in a immediately to alleviate males and their children and whereas in the case of a parent (male or female) working fulltimeand employing a housekeeper, the be totally tax deductable. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government take steps immediately to rectify this situation. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Oldmeadow. Petition received.

3,Mr SNEDDEN,DEVALUATION OF AUSTRALIAN,"Will the Prime Minister condemn last night's scandalous episode in which information about the decision to devalue the Australian dollar was widely available throughout Parliament House up to 7 or 8 hours before the official announcement which was made at 6 a.m. today. Is the Prime Minister aware that at the time of this disgraceful leakage of information it was about midday London time, allowing a full afternoon of trading to speculators in the northern hemisphere? Will he now order an urgent inquiry to establish how the premature disclosure occurred last night; which Minister has ministerial responsibility for the preservation of the secrecy of the decision; and the extent and effect of speculation in the Australian dollar on foreign money markets resulting from this leakage? Will the Prime Minister table the report of that inquiry in the House? Will he preserve the integrity of Australia's international reputation by requiring the responsible Minister to resign as would be required by the Westminster system of Australians more than parliamentary government?",20
4,Mr WHITLAM,DEVALUATION OF AUSTRALIAN,"The right honourable citizens, pargentleman makes assertions. He produces no facts at aU. The Ministers concerned with this decision were the Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister and I . I would stake my life on my 2 colleagues whom I have mentioned. I have worked with the Treasurer in this Parliament for nearly 22 years and I have worked with the Deputy Prime Minister in this Parliament for nearly 18 years. From my close acquaintance with them. I know them to be people of complete honour and trustworthiness. The right honourable gentleman is in no position to talk about speculation concerning the Australian dollar. Supporting Fathers When he was Treasurer he initiated Cabinet discussions concerning the value of the dollar. They House went on for 3 days. Everybody knew who would win a contest between him and the Leader of the Australian Country Party. It was a field day for and supspeculators at home and abroad- 3fielddays, into that which is in operfact. similar position, be implemented the suffering of the supporting NA",20
5,Mr OLDMEADOW,EXPENDITURE ON SCHOOLS,Is the Minister for Eduhousekeeper's total wage should cation aware of the growing disquiet among parents and teachers over the spending of the Australian Schools Commission money by State governments? Would the Minister inform the House of the degree of accountability State governments have to the Australian Government in the spending of Schools Commission money? To what extent is it possible for members of the Australian Parliament to know in what State CURRENC Y schools Australian Government money is being and has been spent?,20
6,Mr BEAZLEY,EXPENDITURE ON SCHOOLS,"A considerable volume of correspondence is being sent to me by people who are expressing disquiet that State governments are not spending as additional sums of money the so-called Karmel grants, or the grants under the States Grants (Schools) Act 1973 to the States. I draw the honourable gentleman's attention-answerin g his third question first-to the fact that section 59 of the States Grants (Schools) Act, which goes on for 2Vi pages, specifies every section of the Act. It requires me to lay before both Houses of this Parliament the details of every form of State government expenditure on State schools after the academic year. That would mean that the information should be available as early as possible next year. So whether the money was spent on laboratories, programs for disadvantaged persons or any of the Karmel programs whatsoever, I am required to present those details to the Parhament. If a State government declines to give that information it would not be flouting me; it would be flouting this Parliament which has enacted that requirement. On the subject of the grants to the States, remind the honourable gentleman that the Prime Minister had an arrangement with the Premiers whereby the capital expenditure of the States should be the average of that of the 3 financial years before the Prime Minister made his arthat rangements with the State Premiers in 1973. Prime Minister also made an arrangement the Premiers that the percentage of their housing and other expenditure of a capital nature for which they accepted responsibility should not lower than it had been before the commencemy ment of the arrangement. As far as recurring grants are concerned, State appropriations not be below the appropriation for the financial year 1971-72; it must be the same percentage of their recurring budgets. I think it will be possible for all of those things to be required. The traUan Schools Commission is obtaining inforTreasury. mation of an interim character. The details of every specific school are required of a State at end of an academic year and they must by law then be made available to this Parliament. The honourable member in his question expressed the desire to know about these things. If any honourable gendemen are interested in expendiby ture in their own locaUties we would certainly the State government concerned for the informaofficials. tion. But in fairness to the States, I think that information could be given only at the end of a complete academic year if one were to make any inferences or generalisations about their programs. NA NA",20
7,Mr SNEDDEN,CURRENC Y,"Does the Prime Minister deny that it was common knowledge in this Uament last night-rather I should say 'around the House' because no statement was made to the Parliament-that there was to be a devalualeave tion of the currency which would take place this morning? If he does deny it, how does he cile his denial with the fact that members of Press wrote their stories giving the exact figure honourable last night for pubUcation in this morning's newspapers? For instance, does he deny the accuracy of the statement in the' Courier Mail' today that 'The devaluation is expected to be by 12 per cent against the US dollar', and that 'A Government omciai said last night there would be an announcement today'? Does he deny that the Melbourne 'Sun' published the exact figure? Against this background, will he please put aside the bluster of the guilty and engage in an inquiry to ascertain how this serious information could become available to those people wishing to make profit from it? Does he reaUse that this is a I worse example than anything that has been put in the Rae report? In the examples in the Rae report private information was used by private individuals from a private source, but this emanates from the Government. It was put last night a Government official would make a stateThe ment today. Will the Prime Minister therefore with have the inquiry which I requested?",21
8,Mr WHITLAM,CURRENC Y,"I do deny that this was combe mon knowledge round the Parliament. It gave colleagues the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister exquisite pleasure to see how the must right honourable gentleman was floundering throughout the evening's proceedings. He had no inkling of what was going on in this matter. It has irked him for weeks, of course, that he has Ausbeen deprived of making decisions in the He had no idea what was going on. If he asserts that this was common knowledge, it is the amazing that he showed no awareness of it himself whatever. The fact that a newspaper says 'Government officials say' does not prove that the Government and officials have said anything of the sort. It is commonplace to dress up stories saying that they came from sources close to ask such and such a department or Government. It is a stock-in-trade. If the right honourthis able gentleman has anything specific at all it is his duty to give it to me and I will certainly pursue it. But I will not take up the time of the departments, my colleagues or the judiciary in investigating sheer allegations such as he has now twice made without substance. He cannot support them. He cannot adduce any evidence whatever. He knows that. If he does have any evidence he should give it and I shall pursue it. Par Mr Snedden- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is a most serious matter. I have been asked to produce what I know. Mr Speaker, I ask to table this morning's' Courier-Mail'. recon Mr SPEAKER-Order! That is not a point of the order; that is a request. I suggest the right gentleman seek the indulgence of the Chair to make a request. Mr Snedden-Then I shall take your advice, of Mr Speaker. I ask your indulgence to make a request that this morning's newspaper the 'Courier-Mail' and such other newspapers as refer to this matter should be tabled and that Prime Minister should in pursuance of his undertaking, ascertain from the writers of the relevant articles in those newspapers the source of their knowledge. Unless that is pursued the inquiry cannot be successful.",21
9,Mr SPEAKER,CURRENC Y,"Order ! The right honourable gentleman is not entided to make a speech or debate the quesuon. The quesuon is in regard to tabling. The right honourable gentleman seek leave and the answer has to be either yes or no. Let me explain the posiuon. When any honourable member asks for leave to table a exists paper, leave either is granted or not granted. debate can take place on that request. The If Leader of the Opposition has asked for leave table certain newspapers. What is the answer? Government supporters-No .",22
10,Mr SPEAKER,CURRENC Y,Leave is not granted. NA,22
11,Mr LAMB,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Is the Minister for Overseas these Trade aware that 2 textile manufacturers, Fibremakers Ltd at Bayswater and Courtaulds Hilton Ltd at Healesville, both in Victoria, retrenched workers from their factories? Is aware that reports of the number of those retrenched at Fibremakers vary from 106 to and at Healesville from 30 to 40 women? What indications or assurances can he give these workers of continued employment, preferably in their former occupations, and manufacturers expect an improvement in their situation?",22
12,Dr JF CAIRNS,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I am aware of the reports of retrenchments at the 2 factories mentioned the honourable member. I point out that when an economy has reached a very high point of mand, of inflation, such as ours has, there invariably sooner or later a downturn in demand and a downturn in employment. No matter what a government does or does not do, that is a very likely result. It has happened on many occasions before and it will happen again. No government can guarantee that every person in employment in those circumstances will remain in employnow ment, especially in the place where he has been employed before. We have now a fairly equate record of what has been happening as result of changes in industry, classified as structural changes resulting from such things as increased imports-and that applies strictly to the 2 cases mentioned by honourable member. I should like the House to have an indication of the figures so that it may know and so that the people may know just the where this unemployment is taking place. In the reported groups at the end of August the ngures are: Chemicals and oils, 1; basic metals, 13; nonelectrical plant and machinery, 69; electrical machinery and cables, 278; vehicles, 77; textiles and knitted groups, 2,266; skins and leather, 24; clothing, 547; footwear, 407; furniture and furnishings, 5; paper products, 1; other types of to industry, 11; other metal manufacturers, 9; bricks and tiles, 21; pottery, 2; and meat slaughthas to ering, 8-a total of3,739. Those ngures indicate the concentration that in the textiles and knitted groups of indusNo tries and in the clothing and footwear industries. thosefiguresare left out, the remaining figures to are almost negligible. The concentration in the State of Victoria is shown by the number of people in receipt of special readjustment assistance at the end of August. The total Australian situation is that 1,733 people were in receipt of assistance, and of that number 1,146 were in Victoria. The further indication that comes from figures is that most of these people are concentrated in very few areas. Most of the people who are out of employment, and have been for have any length of time-for more than a week or 10 he days-ar e in those areas. In Geelong, 36.8 per cent were out of employment for less than a 180 month; in Shepparton, 38.7 per cent; in Wangaratta, 38.3 per cent; in Kempsey, 32.5 per cent; and in Launceston, 43.9 per cent. Those are the figures for the areas in which unemployment is at when can the the highest level. The action taken to deal with the situation has to be specific. To be appropriate it has to be directed at the industry concerned and at the place by concerned. It is the intention of the Government to bring about re-employment in the areas condecerned, in the places concerned and, if possible, is in the factories concerned by measures which will be taken and which will be administered by the Interim Structural Adjustment Board that was appointed last week. I point out also that I mentioned yesterday that the Government had adopted a policy appropriate to the circumstances that prevailed in 1973 and we are not dealing, as we were then, simply with inflation. We are dealing now with inflation and unademployment as a result of economic circuma stances which generate very largely in the econwhich may be omic system itself. I pointed out yesterday that the policy adopted the to deal with that situation included an appreciation of the Australian dollar. I said yesterday that when the Government was satisfied that circumstances had changed policy would change, and policy changed last night in respect of the value of the Austrahan dollar. I point out that the depreciation of the Australian dollar, which the Government brought about lasc night, will give considerable protection to the industries which I have just listed and will result in re-employment in those industries, as well as helping the establishment of confidence by business which will allow investment to proceed at a more rapid rate. The policy adopted last night is appropriate to the circumstances that prevail now. Never before in the history of this country-at least since World War II-have we had a government which has applied policy appropriate to circumstances and which is ready to change if circumstances change. NA",22
13,Mr SNEDDEN,DEVALUATION OP AUSTRALIAN,"Does the Prime Minister visits deny that profits were made on overseas money markets arising out of the devaluation decision announced this morning and the circumstances preceding it last night? If he does deny that profits were so made, does he deny that the opportunity was created for making those profits? I ask the Prime Minister whether he recalls stating publicly on 29 November 1973: It would be quite improper for a Minister, for vice adviser, to allow persons who are not sworn to secrecy know matters in a forthcoming Budget or proposed or interest or customs changes. Does he still hold that view?",23
14,Mr WHITLAM,DEVALUATION OP AUSTRALIAN,The answer to thefirstquessponsibility tion is: I do not know. The second question does not arise. The answer to the third and fourth questions is yes. NA,23
15,Mr HURFORD,VISITORS TO AUSTRALIAN POSTS,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister in his capacity as Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is it a fact that some of Australia's posts abroad are sorely taxed by the number of visitors they are obUged to look after? For instance, is it a fact that our Commission Hong Kong was subjected to about 32 visits members of the Queensland Government and Parliament last year and our post in Japan received a similar number from that source? view of the lack of co-operation by the Queensland Government with the Australian Government what is the Australian Governwould ment's poUcy in relation to this matter?",23
16,Mr WHITLAM,VISITORS TO AUSTRALIAN POSTS,"It is true that the Premiers write to me very frequently requesting that assistance be given to them, as Premiers, or to some of their Ministers, officials or fellow parliamentarians when they are visiting other countries. NaturaUy the Australian posts are wilUng to cooperate and the Premiers have thanked me for the co-operation that has been fonhcorning. It is true, however, that this is a very considerable burden on the Australian Government. It would not appear to us to be by any means clear that the visits were required by any activities within the jurisdiction of the State parUaments. After all, the only parUament in Australia which has any international jurisdiction or standing is this Parliament. The State ParUaments are still, in constitutional terms, British colonies. They have no international standing. They are not given international recognition. Nevertheless, it is a matter of pubUc knowledge that most Premiers CURRENC Y spend more time out of Australia than the Prime Mmister himself. There have been more overseas by State Ministers last year and this year than there have been by Federal Ministers. NA NA",23
17,Mr SNEDDEN,CURRENC Y,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has just said that he does not know whether profits were a Public Sermade on overseas money markets. Does he not to realise that this represents a scandalous situcurrency ation? Is he prepared to leave this scandalous situation without inquiry? If he does not know whether profits were made on overseas money markets, does he not believe that he has a reto the Australian people, to the Government and to this Parliament to ascertain whether they were or were not made and, if they were, how much money was made and by whom? Will he now agree to the holding of an inquiry to ascertain the facts? NA",23
18,Mr WHITLAM,OVERSEAS,"If there has been any improper speculation in the Australian currency during the last 24 hours I have no doubt that it will be reported to the Treasurer. I have no doubt of that whatever. I can only repeat that the right in honourable gentleman, for all his bluster and for from all his allegations, has not produced one tittle-or, as his Deputy would say, one scintilla-of evidence. The Deputy Leader of the In Australian Country Party is handing a newspaper to the Leader of the Opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party know quite well that all one can do on the basisMr Snedden-Are you prepared to leave this scandalous situation unresolved?",23
19,Mr WHITLAM,OVERSEAS,"The Leader of the Opposition is fabricating a scandalous situation. The it. scandalous situation, I repeat, arose when he was the Treasurer and for 3 days was locked in a public brawl with the Leader of the Australian Country Party. As a result of that brawl there were 3 days of speculation in the Australian rency in London and in most other money marlate kets. As I have said, everybody knew what the result of a brawl between the right honourable gentleman and the Leader of the Australian Country Party would be. In case anybody is impressed by all this bluster and fury right honourable gentleman I point out that knows perfectly well that anything concerning the conduct of a member of this Parliament can be referred to the Committee of Privileges.",24
20,Mr ANTHONY,OVERSEAS,You will not let it.,24
21,Mr WHITLAM,OVERSEAS,"I could not stop it. If an allerumours gation before the Committee of Privileges is of the based on a newspaper report the first witness is prices the reporter. The reporter obviously would swear mours that he had informants. He would also refuse to tralian name those informants. Everybody knows those ing 2 facts: The reporter always swears to the truth of could what he wrote and always refuses to name his cessions informant. The right honourable gentleman knows this perfecdy well. Mr Donald Cameron- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Committee of Privileges deals with trespassing against the Parliament, not with secrets of government. This is completely out of order.",24

Is it a fact that a large number of plications have been lodged by residents of to migrate to Australia? Is there a considerable delay in the processing of these appUcations? Will the Minister give consideration to increasing the staff of the Department of Immigration Fiji to enable the more expeditious processing these applications for permanent entry to Australia?,24
24,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,FIJIAN IMMIGRANTS,I do not know the bank said number of appUcants for migration to Australia from Fiji. I do not know whether there is undue delay. I will examine the matter and if there is undue delay I will see what can be done to rectify NA NA,24
25,Mr SINCLAIR,CURRENCY,"Has the Treasurer any evicurdence of any speculation on the London market in the trading last night? If so, what is that evidence? If he has no such evidence will he ensure that an investigation is made of the volume of Australian bonds traded on the London market and will he report the substance of that from the trading to this Parliament? he Mr CREAN- I have no such evidence but for the benefit of the questioner I will read 2 cables that I received today from London on this matter. The first reads: Rumours of an Australian devaluation have been circulating in Britain for months. For this reason the latest wave of caused only a slight ripple in the Australian sector London Stock Exchange. Brokers said that generally of Australian shares had been adjusted to take account of such a possibility but they said that the devaluation ruserved to reinforce a slight firming tendency in Ausmining shares today. Investors considered that minshares might be a better prospect now as companies earn more Australian dollars from mineral exports but on the other hand mining companies had lost some tax conin the recent Australian Budget brokers pointed out. The other cable reads: Rumours . . . I repeat' rumours'. One cannot be responsible for rumours. I do not think anybody has been punting on a revaluation of the Australian currency in recent times. The whole contemplation has been about a possible devaluation. As I indicated, rumours have been circulating in Britain for months. The second cable read: Rumours of an imminent devaluation caused a flurry of selling on the foreign exchange market in London today. The rumours spread rapidly through nnancial circles following a Melbourne newspaper repon. to I sometimes wonder how a journaUst sees his job caras a journaUst against what might be called beimportant national interests. I have no admiration whatever for those who, knowing that ap-something is secret, will take advantage of a few Fiji hours for one day's story. I am sure that all honourable members opposite who were Ministers in the past have had the experience of certain things which they would not like to have had in divulged in fact being divulged before they of should have been. The cable continues: The rumours spread rapidly through financial circles following a Melbourne newspaper repon that the Government had decided on a 12 per cent devaluation. One Australian that trading was normal until late this afternoon, when there was a sudden burst of selling activity. I hope honourable members opposite will listen to what follows. The cable goes on: Much of the selling pressure came from international commodity and commercial quarters with links in Australia. Banks continued to maintain fairly stable rates for the Australian dollar despite the selling wave. One bank spokesman said that transactions went through immediately in the case of transactions which were for 'regular customers' or which were considered to arise out of'genuine business*. In of 'speculative' moves, the bank offered to complete the transactions tomorrow, he said. Mr Snedden- I rise on a point of order. The honourable gentleman read from a document. In accordance with the Standing Orders I ask for the whole of the document to be tabled.",24

27,Mr CREAN,CURRENCY,I table the whole of the document. I resent the suggestion that I am giving only selected parts. You can have the document. NA,25
28,Mr FRY,RACISM IN SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS,"Has the attention of the Minister for Education been directed to the article 'Racism School Books' in the latest edition of the tralian Quarterly*? Is the Minister aware that article demonstrates that most social science books now being used in schools develop and reinforce racist attitudes in the students, and the most effective way of reversing this situation is for the Curriculum Development Centre to undertake the task of preparing such textbooks? Will the Minister use his best efforts to ensure that this project is given top priority by the Curriculum Development Centre?",25
29,Mr BEAZLEY,RACISM IN SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS,"I read an article in the 'AusTrade tralian Quarterly'. I would like to inform the honourable gentleman that the Australian Government and the State governments, which view jointly have an interest in the Curriculum Development Centre, have authorised it to carry out research into the whole question of the ing of social sciences in Australia. The purpose this is to endeavour to ensure that the teaching social sciences in Austraha is valid. In addition, the Curriculum Development Centre has authoramounts ised Dr Betty Watts to supervise the preparation of what I might call a teaching kit on the nal peoples. There are many cultures among Aborigines. I would hope that thefindingsof Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies would go into our schools and our school textbooks. However, I think that the article in the 'Ausminutes tralian Quarterly' was itself an extremely traUan prejudiced piece of work. It had a lot of strictures to offer on European cultures and what it regards as fallacies in European cultures. The article tained the complete impUcation that, although children may derive bias from many quarters, they derive bias from the one quarter which is under the control of the Government-school textbooks. I hope that school textbooks will not be under the control of any government. I want school textbooks to be produced by scholars who are seeking to advance vaUd information. I the case would think that the assessment of Aboriginal culture should be honestly done according to anthropologicalfindingsand according to the facts. I agree that bias of a destructive kind against the people would of itself be entirely unscientific because the cultures that people have are usuaUy the products of their environment and situation, and any inferences of superiority or inferiority arising out of them would be unscientific. I would hope that there is no suggestion of government direction of scholarly research. NA NA",25
30,Mr ANTHONY,CURRENCY,"The Deputy Prime Minister will know that one of the conditions laid down in by the unions for their discussions with the 'AusGovernment on wage restraint is that the this Government wUlreintroduceimport quotas and textprovide assistance to industry to restore full employment. I ask the Deputy Prime Minister that whether the Government considers that the action which it has taken on the exchange ratefor which I commend the Minister, particularly after his statement to Parliament yesterdaymeets the conditions that the unions want.",25
31,Dr JF CAIRNS,CURRENCY,"This is a very important matter. It is true that the Australian Council of Unions-it has taken a position that is widely understood as being representative of the of the trade union movement-ha s submitted to the Government that, in the course of establishing what would be a common policy to deal with the present economic situation, includteaching both inflation and unemployment, in of Australia, the Government should consider of favourably the introduction of import quotas or the introduction of quotas allowing smaller to come into Australia than exist under quotas already. It is true also that I informed the AborigiPresident of the ACTU last week that the Government would give consideration to that the request. That is still our position. I pointed out, in answering a question a few ago, that the depreciation of the Ausdollar has the effect, among other effects, of protecting those industries that are under pressure. Whilst I am sure that no remedy can conhave an effect for a month or two, because of the time taken for orders that are already made to reach Australia and to be sold, I would hope and expect that the depreciation of the currency would have the kind of effect that the ACTU and the unions want. I hope that the unions and the workers will understand the effect of that depreciation and that it will be unnecessary in the interests of industry and the countiy to proceed any further by any other protective measures at all.

36,Mr CHARLES JONES,BROKEN HILL RAIL SERVICE,I reaUse the honourable member's problem concerning the curtaUment of New South Wales passenger services. One of the unfortunate aspects is that the New South Wales Department of Railways is closing down quite a considerable number of railway services throughout New South Wales without having due regard to the needs of the people in those areas. This Government has made numerous offers. The Prime Minister made an offer as late as June this year at a Premiers Conference. He made an offer in his policy speech of December 1972 and he repeated it again in May 1974 that this Government is prepared to take over these services and to accept fuU responsibiUty for them. Before we would be prepared to consider these matters they should be given a complete and total inquiry to determine the harmful and sociological effects on the people inPar- volved. Unfortunately the New South Wales Government has not done all of these things.

Customs Tariff Proposals No. 13 (1974) which I have just tabled give effect to that decision. The Government's decision to implement the Commission's recommendations will mean that a general rate of 25 per cent will apply to gloves of the industrial type that are wholly or partly coated or covered with artificial plastic material and to uncoated knitted or crocheted gloves that are suitable for use in the production of such industrial type gloves. Minimum rates of duty will apply to all other goods covered by the Commission's report, such as dress gloves. The new duties will operate from tomorrow.

82,Mr DALY,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"May I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Wool Tax Bills (Nos 1 to 5) and the Wool Industry Bill, as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, Mr Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 7 Bills to be discussed in the debate.",30
83,Mr SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Is it the wish of the House to adopt this procedure? There being no objection, I will allow that procedure to be adopted.",30
84,Mr SINCLAIR,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The Opposition accepts the proposition by the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) that these 7 Bills of should be debated together simply because it is a lot easier for those of us who have an interest in the wool industry to talk in general terms second reading debate on the subject of wool, even if the measures are disparate. The wool industry, of course, is very vitally affected concerned with each one of these measures. Although they are today being debated at the one time the proposals that are advanced within each one of them are different. The Opposition fact has a point of view that relates to each one of these Bills. The Wool Marketing (Loan) Bill, which is the first of the measures to come forward, is one with respect to which we intend to move an amendment at the second reading stage. I shall elucidate the detail of that amendment in a moment. The Wool Tax Bills (Nos 1 to 5) relate to a levy to be charged on wool growers' incomes. In regard to those Bills there is also an amendment which will be moved in relation to the Wool Industry Bill, but relating specifically to the funds collected under the Wool Tax Bills. The amendment provides that the money collected should be paid into a trust fund from which its payment to the Australian Wool Corporation can be ensured and about which reports may be made to this Parliament. We propose to move at the second reading stage to the Wool Industry Bill, an amendment which relates not to the passage or non-passage of this Bill but to the consequences which flow from a statement made initially by the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Second Reading Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) when the legislation was first introduced into this House at the beginning of this year, and an implication from the Budget of the Treasurer (Mr Crean) the other night as tb the dollar for dollar aspect of the payment by the Government and payment by the industry. The detail of that second reading amendment is a product of some very commendable research by the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey). I commend him for the study that he has put into the details which have brought forward this amendment. I turn first to the Wool Marketing (Loan) Bill. This piece of legislation is, of course, one for which the Treasurer is responsible. I mention that because we are talking about the wool industry. One ofthefirstthings I wanted to say in relation to the 7 Bills is that from our side of the House we regard it as rather strange that there should be apparent distrust between the members of the Ministry which has seen expression in this legislation-whe n I say this legislation I am speaking in the compass of all the Bills-in the sense of the overseeing of the work the now Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) by the Treasurer to a greater degree in a than has previously been the case. When we were in government there were, as there must be, constant consultations between and the Treasurer and the then Minister for Primary Industry. In this instance we find that more and more the function performed by the Minister for Agriculture is to be supervised by the Treasurer. in It is true that the Wool Marketing (Loan) Bill and the Wool Tax Bills, tend to be in the Treasurer's province. But I tliink that it is necessary for the wool industry, and those associated with primary industry generally, to be conscious that they are falling more and more under the intervention of departments other than that which is nominally responsible for the guidance of agriculture. Of course, they have always been conscious of the role they play in the economy. In fact, the wool industry has quite rightly been looked upon as having played a major part in the development of Australia and as such it has been involved in the total economy. But I think that it is unfortunate if, in the expression of legislation any personal suspicion-whic h I am sure does not apply to the personality of the Treasurer, nor to the personality of the Minister for Agriculture-is perpetuated in a way which means that one cannot act without the other also saying yea, or cannot refuse to act without the other saying nay. It would seem to me that surely even in a Labor administration they should be able to resolve their differences so that one man may be given the responsibility. The Wool Marketing (Loan) Bill is to provide funds urgently needed for the operation of the Australian Wool Corporation. There does to be some confusion as to the degree to which the banks were able and available to advance funds for the purposes of the marketing operthis ations of the Australian Wool Corporation. The Australian Wool Corporation, apparently in conAustralian junction with the Government, had some diswould cussions with the Australian banking system. The banks, the Corporation and the Government people, however, seem to have different as to the stage which those negotiations had reached when the Government decided that it would introduce this form of assistance. We are told on the one hand by the Corporation and the Government that there was no alternative but that funds be advanced from the Government. The banks on the other hand have said that they believe that discussions that were then continuthat ing with the reserve bank might well have bled them, either through the release of statutory reserve deposits over the period which will be covered by this legislation or, in any event, the period within which the Corporation done expected to borrow the funds necessary for it perform adequately its functions, to make the necessary advance. However, whatever the result, this legislation enables the Government provide the money. At first blush, of course, that is a very commendable action by the Governthat ment. The Government is providing money to assist the industry in the preservation of a floor price to ensure that growers receive an adequate return. But again, I think the benefits need to be analysed because to us they are somewhat illusory. Firstly, so far as the loan is concerned, we regard the whole circumstances of borrowings by the Australian Wool Corporation as being preferably in the commercial stream. Of course there is an area where some funds must be advanced, and a $ 13m advance is already part of the capital of the Australian Wool Corporation. If the other funds were to be considered in the same light, indeed, I believe one should rightly query whether $163m was the rightful capital. In this instance of course the funds are not a grant; they are a loan, and a loan on commercial terms. In other words, the period and the interest are to be set in the same way as though the money were to be borrowed from the banks. The Opposition is concerned that a government which is responsible for policy should also be the banker. We are concerned because of the wool marketing report, a report which has very many commendable features, but a report which, if the Government is in a position not only of advising on policy but also of acting as principalfinancier,can be changed in any way which suits the will of the Governseem ment. A wool marketing scheme could be implemented without reference to the Australian Wool Industry Conference, without reference to Parliament or to any of those who have an interest in the whole scheme of marketing of the wool clip. If that were to be so, it be of very great concern, not only to the members of this Parliament but, I believe, also to the whole Australian community and in particuattitudes lar the wool growing section of it. We believe that the $150m advance is not quite as it is presented. We believe that in the circumstances, however, there is no alternative but that we support the provision of the funds. But the purpose of our second reading amendments are, in the first place, to assert that we believe the Government should have maintained a enanational economic climate which would have enabled the Australian Wool Corporation to borrow the funds commercially. Ifit was not able over to do so, then at the very least it should have with the wool industry as it has done with to the wheat industry and other primary industries; that is, advance funds from the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank. Certainly, then to the wool growers would receive the benefit of the preferential interest rate that is provided from source and they would therefore be in the same position as producers in other industries. But they also would be able to operate in a way which would put them on a completely similar basis to producers in other industries. The second part of the amendment expresses our belief that if the funds are advanced-the expectancy, of course, is that they will be-as soon as the Uquidity of the community permits the Wool Corporation should repay to the Government those funds advanced under this particular legislation and then operate from normal commercial sources. In other words, we would accept as being a necessary continuing part of the funds of the Corporation the $13m worth of capital which it has, but we would expect that borrowings made in accordance with this legislation would be repaid to the Government as soon as the Uquidity circumstances in the community permit and that borrowings then be made in the normal commercial sense. I do not want to go into great detail on this, but it is quite obvious that there is a chain in thefinancingof the wool industry which, I believe, is of very real interest. It is a chain which begins at the production end with the primary producer. It flows through the marketing operation, in the instance of both the Wool Corporation and the wool brokers and private buyers. It flows through to the buyers themselves and ultimately through to the processors. Any interruption of such a significant amount as the $150m which is referred to here must be seen as interfering in a chain of commercial relationships, and I think this is of concern. So it is our intention to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Wool Marketing (Loan) Bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your guidance. We have 7 Bills to debate. Should I move my amendment at this time or should I move it when we are specificaUy discussing the Wool Marketing (Loan) Bill? I suspect that I should move it at a later stage. There are 7 BUls and I was not too sure at what stage I should move the amendment. The Opposition will be moving an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Wool Marketing (Loan) Bill at the appropriate time. The impact of the amendment is that, while we are not refusing the Bill a second reading",30
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS," scheme Order! I think it would be appropriate the amendment to the first Bill, the Wool Marketing (Loan) Bill, at this stage.",32
86,Mr SINCLAIR,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"In relation to the motion the second reading of the Wool Marketing (Loan) Bill 19741 move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view stituting the following words: second reading, this House(1) expresses its concern at the Government's failure to maintain a national economic climate in which the Australian Wool Corporation would be able to borrow commercially funds necessary for its functions and (2) is of the opinion that the Australian Wool Corporation should at the earliest opportunity repay any borrowings under this Bill from Australia and reven to normal commercial sources for rural borrowings or such borrowings as it may need for its marketing operations.'. I deal now with the Wool Tax Bills (Nos. 1 to 5). These Wool Tax BiUs provide for a levy of 5 per cent to be paid by the wool grower in order to provide a sum of money from which a fund can be built up. In the first instance, of course, these Bills operate only untU the end of the current wool selling season-until 1 July 1975-and they commence on 2 September. The purpose of these Bills is to raise by a 5 per cent levy money for the marketing purposes of the Australian Wool Corporation. The Opposition does not oppose that proposition. However, we are concerned that money raised in this way should be spent directly for the purposes for which it is intended. In the short term there is no doubt that the Wool Corporation will need significant capital injections; but, in the long term, if this particular levy were to be extended into subsequent years-this would apply even in this year if there were to be a marked upturn in the demand for wool in the later stages of this wool selling year- a surplus could develop. The Opposition is of the opmion that this money should be paid into a trust fund and that within that trust fund the money should be identified as being contributed specifically for marketing purposes. If the fund has a credit balance, then that money can attract interest and at some future time it can, if necessaiy, either be used as a basis for a marketing scheme or be repaid to the growers if circumstances are such that the money is not required. So we believe that a specific trust fund needs to be created with respect to these Wool Tax BUls and that it should be not the old type of research and promotion trust fund, to which I will refer in a moment, but a fund consisting of the moneys received from the levy applied for the purpose of operating the marketing within the function of the Australian to move Wool Corporation. I understand that the Government had intended at some stage to create such a trust fund for as we intend from moneys received from the levy. The reason, of course, relates back to the concern that we expressed at the time of the appUcation of the meat industry levy. By means of a to subsimilar amendment to that legislation, we pro'while not refusing the Bill a vided for the setting up specificaUy of a trust fund which would be used for the purpose of the meat industry. We believe that, just as in that industry there is a necessity for a specific trust fund, there is here also. We believe, of course, that there needs to be an identification of payments into and out of the fund. We believe that a report on the substance of the payments into and out of the fund needs to be tabled in this Parliament annually. In that way we beheve that growers' interests can be protected. The point of view has been put to me that perhaps it would be advisable for individual contributions to the fund to be identified so that those who are paying in at this initial stage can at some later stage, if there to be a repayment, be repaid to the same degree. In administrative terms this may well prove to be impractical, but I believe that it is necessary that at the very least there be a trust fund and an accountability of moneys received in this way. Politically, there is one aspect of this matter that very badly needs to be brought to the light of day. The Government has endeavoured to make some capital out of the fixing of a reserve price level of250c per kilo for clean micron wool. It has been suggested that this is an extraordiworse. narily magnanimous gesture to the wool industry and one for which all wool growers should be forever grateful. There are 2 elements that need to recognise, however. The first is that this per cent levy means that, with a 20 per cent on a $S00m turnover by the Australian Wool Corporation, the wool industry itself will pick any loss that may be incurred. In other words, this Government is not carrying the can for the the wool industry. The wool industry itself is being required to contribute in such a way that it is rying on its own shoulders the whole burden of for it. the financial loss, if there should be one, on the functions of the Australian Wool Corporation. So, for all that the Government comes out and makes great play about a 250c per kilo base price, it is not a base price in the sense of guarantees that been given by governments stituted by the Parties which sit on this side of the House. It is a guarantee given in the recognition that the wool industry itself will bear the loss, which is a loss of up to 20 per cent or $47m in this 12 month period, on any marketing operto ation of the Australian Wool Corporation. The second aspect of the 250c per kilo base price needs to be recognised is the degree to which level is not as high as thefiguresmight indicate some people who look at them in bland terms. course, it is calculated in cents per kilo, and not a price in terms of clean 21 micron wool which can be related to the old terminology of the industry. It is not greasy wool, but clean wool. It is measured in terms of microns and not in terms of the old 60s, 64s and 70s quaUty count. On the calculations that one can make, it is not that much better than the 36c per lb base that we provided in days gone by. Of course, that 36c per lb guarantee was in fact subsidised entirely by the Government. The wool growers were not required to contribute. In this instance they are required to contribute. They are required to contribute the $47m that these Wool Tax BUls represent. I think that it might be better if we were to look at this matter in terms of the 90 per cent is increase in the seUing costs or the costs of operation of the wool growers and to look at the actual degree to which the 250c per ltilo reserve price can be translated into the old terminology. If we were to do so we would see that it means approximately 99c per kUo or 45c per lb. If we were to look at it in terms of the 90 per cent increase in costs it would not be in fact very much greater than the 36c in quantitative terms. If we were to take into account the 5 per cent deduction-the $47m to which we have just been referring-w e would find that it is in fact considerably So all the great play that the Government has made of the contribution that it has made to the wool industry is one of those tricks to which they we are becoming accustomed from the Govern5 ment in the presentation of things financial. In loss saying, 'We are giving to you, the Australian people, these magnificent benefits', the Governup ment is completely forgetting the fact that the taxpayer is the one who is called upon to pay for sum total of their cost. In this instance it is the wool grower who has been told that he is getting cara benefit and it is the wool grower who is paying Mr Kelly-Like a cow which sucks itself.",32
87,Mr SINCLAIR,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Precisely. We commend the industry for the degree to which it has been able the to support Australia for so long. We know that conthose who operate within the industry are a pretty independent lot. I think that they need to be recognised by aU Australian people as still first being an independent lot because the Government is certainly not helping them, to the degree which or in the way in which it would assert. The Government is helping them only to the dethat gree to which there is a mechanism through the which the wool growers are required to contribto ute this 5c per kilo. So whUe we support the Wool Of Tax BUls we would require that a trust fund be it is estabUshed into which can be paid the funds allocated through Consolidated Revenue, that they then be identified with respect to the wool industry, that they attract interest when they are in surplus and that they be used in such a way that each year there is an accountability to the Parliament and to the Australian wool growers so that they will know where their money is going. The third of these groups of Bills is the Wool Industry Bill. This Bill wasfirstinuoduced at the very beginning of this year. It is a Bill which is significantly similar to measures that have been passed by this Parliament on other occasions. The only difference, of course, is that when the Wool Industry Bill was introduced much to-do was made by the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson), who is now absent in the United Kingdom, to the effect that tilings were good in the wool industry and that therefore it was possible for the basis upon which the industry contributed to research and promotion to be varied. It was suggested that the Government should pick up a greater percentage of the contribution for research and that perhaps the industry might maintain a greater contribution in return for promotion. Nonetheless it was asserted that there should be a dollar for doUar contribution over the period for the purposes of research and promotion. It seems, however, that the Government has forgotten in its reintroduction of this legislation that things are not quite as good as they were for the wool industry. The Government needs to recognise that the levy that it has now placed upon the industry-if thefiguresthat came out during the presentation of the Budget by the Treasurer are to be taken into account-ma y well need to be increased to the maximum of 3 per cent that is provided for in the legislation, although the amount initially intended, if we were looking at a levy to be sufficient for the tribution at current prices, would have been only 2.4 per cent of the gross proceeds, which is the amount referred to in the second reading speech made by the Minister for Northern Development when the research and promotion budgets were originaUy collected. Of course, it was intended and explained by the Minister that the levy should be lifted to 2.75 per cent so that there would be a surplus at the end of the financial year. I reiterate that since the time when this legislation was introduced there has been a significant deterioration in the returns for wool sold on the world market and that, as a result, the amount that will be received in accordance with this Wool Industry Bill is such that it is unlikely that at 2.75 per cent there wiU be an abiuty to meet the 50 per cent of the $49m contribution required for those purposes during the course of the present year. As the amendment which I will move at the appropriate time to the motion for the second reading of the Wool Industry Bill indicates, it seems that the Treasurer has provided in the Budget for only the sum of $22m this year, which means that the industry will be required to contribute $27m, which is less than the $1 for $1 contribution that the Minister for Northern Development, in presenting this Bill, said would be the basis for industry contributions. We have asked in our amendment that the Government take note of its undertaking and make an appropriate variation to the legislation in order that, preferably, there should be an increased contribution by the Government so that the budget for the year can be met. It would seem that perhaps the only way in which this can be accomplished-it being outside the province of the Opposition to provide additional funds-wil l be by the Treasurer providing in some way from one of the funds over which he has control for a supplementary allocation from the Treasury for the purpose of increasing the Government's contribution to the one-half or $24.5 m that is necessary to provide for a $1 for $1 contribution from the Government. The alternative, of course, is for the levy to be increased to 3 per cent of the gross proceeds, which would enable the wool growers to provide the $27m which, given the state of the industry and given the additional 5 per cent levy, would be a very severe penalty upon the Australian wool growing industry. One other thing that I want to stress with respect to the Wool Industry Bill is that it is when things are crook that the Government needs to come to the party. Regrettably under this legislation promotion is becoming more and more a burden for the induscon- try; yet it is promotion which so demonstrably, through the activities of the International Wool Secretariat, was responsible for assisting wool back to the very high demand situation that existed during late 1972 and 1973.1 believe that it would be most regrettable if, because of the restraints imposed by this legislation, promotion itself and the funds avaUable for promotion were to be prejudiced because of the degree to which there has been a change in the balance between industry and government contributions. Indeed, I think that it is quite critical that research be maintained. I commend the Government for its contribution in that area. It is, of course, a contribution which we, when in government, initiated, expanded and completely endorsed. It is also necessary that the Government recognise the problems that have been imposed upon the operations of those who are promoting the Australian wool cUp. We believe that the functions of the International Wool Secretariat have been well worthwhile in the interests of the Australian industry. There are many who have looked at it and have been critical of it. Indeed, I was one. As a Minister I initiated an mquiry into its funcuons and operadons. But I believe that in at least one areaperhaps I can refer briefly to it-that is, in the plication of research, much of which was initiated by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the International Wool Secretariat has been able to translate out of the cobwebbed files that seem to abound in so many areas of agricultural extension the knowledge that is obtained in research institutions into the field. It translated the knowledge that came from the CSIRO into the wool processing plants. The processes we saw in terms of both permanency of colouring and the permanency of creases, even in the anti-shrink characteristics of cloth, are processes that the International Wool Secretariat has been able to promote in the field. The contribution by the growers has played an important part in making this possible. But when the industry is down and returns are down it is the Government's responsibUity to supplement that contribution. I regret that in accordance with this legislation there will not be for promotion purposes the availability of money tofinancethe operations of the International Wool Secretariat if the industry should take a downturn beyond its present point. It is difficult in a brief time to cover the ambit of 7 separate Bills, each one of them vital for the Australian wool industry. The growers themselves need to recognise the degree to which the Government is not itself carrying the can for the difficulties of the industry. The industry itselfthe Australian wool grower-is being called on to subsidise any deficiency in wool marketing returns and in the functioning of the Australian Wool Corporation. For that reason the several amendments which I have identified will be moved by the Opposition during the course of this debate.",33
88,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,The Deputy Leader of the Country Party has moved an amendment to the Wool Marketing (Loan) Bill 1974. Is the amendment seconded? Mr Street- I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,35
89,Mr WHAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS," I refer to one comment that the previous speaker, the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), made concerning the influence of Treasury over the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) on this occasion. These words must come passing strange to anybody who was associated with the previous reserve price debate in 1965. It was common knowledge, never denied, that the then Treasurer, the right honourable member for Lowe (Mr MCMahon), was instrumental in refusing Government support for ap- the reserve price at that time. Either directly or indirectly, the Treasurer on that occasion was almost completely responsible for the fact that the reserve price was not passed in 1965. The influence of the Treasurer then far exceeded any sort of influence that the present Treasurer (Mr Crean), who is sitting at the table, exercised over the Minister for Agriculture on this occasion. The justification for this particular scheme has been deeply rooted in debate that raged fiercely in 1965 and went back beyond that time. A great deal of work was carried out on this subject in the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and in various universities in Australia. The reserve price plan, as we see it now, is a sophisticated version of the true principles that were enunciated during the referendum in 1965. My views on this have been firmly recorded and were published in 1972 in the journal 'Sheep Breeding and Wool Technology'. To give some background to this I refer to that article. Regarding justification for this particular mechanism I draw the attention of the House to the factors that influenced price formation in the wool market. There is in this world an underlying demand for textile fibres which is extraordinarily large, so large in fact that within 3 years the aggregate demand, the new demand, for textilefibresas a whole could cope with the total wool production. Given this rapid increase in demand for textilefibresthere is a consequent reduction of influence in the total by wool itself. It is likely to become, and is becoming, a specialist textile fibre that will be used in uniquely specialised end uses in the future. An examination of price movements over the past years suggests that the changes in demand which underly the changes in price are unpredictable. Many people lose sight of this fact. These changes are due to changes in fashion and income movements. During periods of relatively low domestic income, people in the domestic situation can easily defer the purchase of clothes, particularly wool products, and return to the purchase of those clothes when incomes are high. As it is very difficult to predict movements in domestic incomes in the various wool consuming countries the safest assumption, when looking at the wool market, is that the price formation or the actual price at any given moment is a random event. God's hand is not often on the shoulders of these people who predict the future of the wool indusfloor try. None of them has yet illustrated that he have this divine inspiration. I think it is only senperiod sible to assume that the price movement in the wool market will be completely random in future. If we accept that proposition we can ahead and formulate exacdy the sort of proposal the House now has before it. This plan has evolved over time. The ford Committee instituted a flexible reserve which is, as it were, the second leg of this particuthe lar proposal. Because wool prices are so variable and so unpredictable it is vital that we bring more to bear on the market than simply the ible reserve price, the mechanism of which I will describe in a moment. We need this underlying support in the market which we now have in this fixed price for wool. Price stabilisation, such this represents, can be regarded as an insurance against low market prices during temporary periods of recession in the wool market. Subswing sidies-this is mainly the area in which such scheme has been criticised-becom e necessary only to sustain a price stabilisation scheme where the marketing organisation deliberately incorThis porates a welfare component in its floor price. When price equalisation is viewed as an perience insurance against fluctuating incomes for wool growers and not as a means of subsidising secinevitability tional groups, a scheme such as the one the House has before it can be developed on a purely commercial basis. Mr Kelly-You are not holding your own people in the chamber.",35
90,Mr WHAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Do not call for a quorum, my friend. No individual grower or private enterprise group in Australia can provide the capital backing to support an insurance scheme large enough to cover the Australian wool market against low prices, but a national trading group supported by the Government can supply this capital. This is another factor that needs to be considered. The wool market in Australia is big business- $ 1,000m a year; sometimes more, sometimes less. If in private enterprise we were dealing with such big business we could be sure that the reserves behind that private enterprise group would be considerably more than the reserves with which we are now endowing the Wool Corporation. This problem of providing suppon for such a huge industry undertaking in Australia can be solved only by government support and interventions such as we have in this Bill. The scheme we are now considering has this floor price justified on commercial grounds. price should be based on the objective of does averaging rises and falls in the market over a of, say, five to ten years. It should provide a cenain minimum income for growers over this period. The flexible reserve price is operated go above the floor in order to maximise growers' returns and make sure that the country gets the maximum return for wool. This reserve should follow just below the market price when prices Craware rising, come out above the market when price prices peak and follow the market down above market price in order gradually to let the market back to thefloor,if necessary. Such a system provides a sensitive indicator of changes in flexthe market price. When the reserve comes out above the peak at the turn in prices the trading group can purchase wool which can never be sold at a profit because it was bought at the peak as of the market. This can be regarded as part of the premium paid for insurance. On the other hand, when the Corporation buys wool on the downor in the trough it can subsequendy sell the a wool at a marked profit. Many people who criti- cise the present scheme do not have a sense of history so far as the wool industry is concerned. market has fluctuated violently over the last twenty to thirty years. .Anybody who has had exwith it can. never get unduly perturbed when the market rises and falls. There is an that the market will continue to do this in the future as it has done in the past. I turn now to the actual mechanism that has been established. The selection of 250c a kilo clean for the floor price is a very good choice. This particularfloorwas broken in 1963 briefly, and also, for a long period, from 1949 to 1956. If we take the 20 years from 1954 to the present it will be seen that this is exactly where the market comes out-at 123c a lb greasy. On that point I would like to correct the arithmetic of the honourable member for New England. Once again it seems to be failing. The 250c per kilo clean for 21 micron wool, which for those who like the old jargon is the 64s, represents 123c per kilo greasy. The honourable member says that this is not very much more than the 36c per lb greasy at which the market was previously supported. The 123c greasy has to be compared with 79.2c, which is 44c more than the 36c which the honourable member said was not very much more. It is 8c more than the actual price at which the market was supported as recently as 2 years ago. I repeat thosefigures.The 123c greasy is the floor that this scheme puts into the market, and 79.2c greasy is thefigurethat would have apThe plied if we had retained the 36c per lb greasy. It is interesting to see what would happen. There is only one occasion when the 36c per lb was the lowest price paid in the market, and that was in the year that the 36c a lb price support scheme was brought in. It lasted for 2 years. In relation to price movements over the years, 123c represents a very intelligent estimate of where the floor ought to be. Of course, we heard a great deal of comment about 300c being the floor. It is interesting to observe that 300c for 21 micron wool turns out to be about IS8c greasy. It was only exceeded on 2 occasions-for a 2-year period from 1949 to 1951 and in 1972. It is interesting also to observe that the floor we have now established in the market has been penetrated only once since 1956. So we have given to the market much more security than it ever had before. We have given it the sort of security that previous governments, have never been able to provide. We have grasped the nettle. In this Bill, which provides $I50m to finance the operations of the Australian Wool Corporation, we have introduced a revolutionary principle into wool marketing. Mr von Bibra has said that the agreement between the industry and the Government representsa.milestone in the history of the wool industry. He said: After very many years of dissension and debate within the industry and with governments, we now have a commerically viable marketing proposal which can overcome the crippling uncertainty that has been evident in recent times in the wool market. That, in itself, will be of ducers and to wool users around the world. Mr von Bibra's views obviously were not shared by Mr Roberts, the President of the Australian Wool growers and Graziers Coundl. He is reported in the 'Queensland Country Life' as saymg that he was disappointed that the Government had not supported the Coundl's proposal of 300c as a firm floor price fpr wool. His disappointment was so great that he. could barely say that he was pleased that the principle of a floor price had been established. This was reflected in the editorial of the 'Queensland Country Life' and gives some indication of the reason why the revolutionary poUdes of this Government are being regarded by the electorate in the country areas with disfavour. The 'Queensland Country Life'had this to say: The Whitlam GovernmenlVlack of concern for the fare of rural mdustry was demonstrated by its reluctance back the Wool Corporation'sfloorprice plan. Fortunately, common sense prevailed, but the guarantee falls far short of what the industry needs. AU the editorial could do was criticise when we have introduced into the wool industry one of greatest steps forward that has ever been for the industry in insurance terms by setting a floor price which is completely justifiable in commercial terms and which offers the growers of this country a reasonable level of income when the going is tough. That point needs to be emphasised. This is an insurance proposal. We are not proposing a revolutionary change in wool marketing because this scheme has very Uttle to do with wool marketing. It has everything to do with insurance. It is very imponant to make that distinction. Wool marketing and its technical aspects are a completely different subject. Let us consider another aspect which has attracted criticism. I notice that in the 'Australian Financial Review' criticism has been levelled at the scheme. There is tendency to indicate that this scheme involves $ 150m of taxpayers' money which taxpayers will never see again. That of course is absurdly wrong. If instead of paying $53m to growers during the period of the wool price deficiency payment scheme we had in fact spent that money on wool-the growers would have had the same incomes-w e would now have something like $ 100m in reserves for the Corporation. Let us never do that again. The $53m was wasted with no particular advantage to the wool industry except that it provided temporary respite for the growers at the time. The money would have been far better spent on wool which subsequently could have been resold during what has proved to be the second highest boom in wool marketing since 1950-51. enormous relief to both wool proLet us consider events in sequence. A grant of $ 150m is to flow to the Wool Corporation out of government funds to purchase wool. The criticism that the 'Australian Finandal Review' has levelled at this grant is that the money coming from private banks would have mopped up liquidity in the economy. But because the money is coming out of Government funds, it will not mop up any liquidity in the economy. Whether we need to mop up liquidity at the moment is a moot point, but let us argue for a moment that we do. The argument is completely false because the Wool Corporation is purchasing wool which otherwise would have been sold to foreign buyers whose money would have flowed into our foreign reserves and increased liquidity internaUy. The fact is that there is an off-setting flow. welThere is a marginal impact on liquidity and it is to very difficult to predict whether it is positive or negative because it is a difference between the money suppUed on a credit basis from the funds backing the Wool Corporation and the overseas reserves that would have accrued if the wool had the been sold to overseas buyers at low prices. We made have deferred the aggregation of overseas reserves until a later date to sell the wool at a higher price and therefore increase the aggregate that we get in terms of overseas reserves. The liquidity argument stands or falls once we look at the sequence of events. (Quorum formed). Before the quorum was called, I was referring to the effect of the reserve price on the internal liquidity of the economy. As I have demonstrated, there will be a marginal effect in the short term. In the long term the effect of the reserve price will be to increase our reserves when the wool is sold off at a profit. As the honourable member for New England has pointed out, the wool industry itself has opted to contribute $50m to cover the risk element involved in the insurance scheme. In my view, the money will not be needed. It is a question of how good the judgment of the Corporation is on this particular issue. It is reasonable to ask the industry to contribute $50m to this, the best insurance proposal it has ever had. Many other agricultural industries would envy the security that this scheme will be bringing into wool marketing. We have the interesting phenomenon too of the private banks not being able to supply funds at this time. Admittedly this is for reasons that are rather extraordinary, but it is interesting to speculate on what would have happened if the private banks had been financing the Wool Corporation and had to call up funds at a time such as this. The dependence of the Corporation on private banks could prove to be shaky in the future. It is fortuitous that such a weakness has displayed itself at the beginning of the scheme. It is worth remembering that the precedents have been established for financing what are fundamentally commercial business operations through government funds. I refer, of course, to Trans-Australia Airlines, Qantas Airways Ltd and, to some degree, Ansett Airlines of Australia. We have these precedents in all economic activities of the Government In this complex of Bills we find witness to the fact that this Government is concerned about the fundamental issues which worry the agricultural sector. In the case of the wool industry, the Government has brought to bear all the research and knowledge available to provide the wool industry with an insurance scheme which can be supported technically and in every other possible way. It is a step that the previous Government was not brave enough to take. As the honourable member for New England has reminded me, the previous Treasurer prevented his Government from taking such a step. This Government has been brave enough to take that step.",36
91,Mr STREET,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS," I have much pleasure in seconding the amendment moved to the motion for the second reading of the Wool Marketing (Loan) Bill by the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party, the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). Before developing the arguments inherent in the amendment, I wish to refer to comments made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan) in relation to the 250c per kilo clean guaranteed price which operates for the present season. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro alleged that this price was 44c per lb more than the price of 36c per lb guaranteed by the previous Government. That was the price guaranteed by the Liberal and Country Parties when we were in government and when wool prices were disastrously low. Two points need to be made in relation to that claim. Thefirstis that under our scheme, when we guaranteed 36c per lb, any gap between the price actually realised below thatfigureof 36c per lb was met by the Government; there was no liability on the grower. In the present circumstances, any losses made as a result of the operation of the 250c per kilo clean price becomes a liability of the grower. I do not want to debate at this stage therightsor wrongs of that situation. I merely point out to the House that the present proposal is entirely different from the previous arrangement; they are not comparable. It gives me no pleasure to say so, but it is quite dishonest for the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to petend that they are comparable. The second point is that the disastrous economic policies of the present Government-or , rather, its disastrous abrogation of economic responsibility-hav e meant an enormous increase in costs, not only to the wool industry, of course, but to all Australian industries. But it is the wool industry about which we are talking at the moment. It is incontrovertible that since the Labor Government came to power there has been a huge increase in costs of production. I make this point: The grower is not interested in his gross return if, for example, his gross return is $10,000 but his costs are $10,500 In that situation the guaranteed price becomes only of academic interest to him. Therefore, again it is entirely dishonest for the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to allege that today's scheme and price are comparable to those of the years when the price of 36c per lb was guaranteed under the Liberal and Country Parties Government's scheme. Dr Gun-Don' t you care about the shearers?",38
92,Mr STREET,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Yes , I do care about the shearers. The honourable member for Kingston makes a good comment. There is a grave shortage of shearers in the industry. For many years, the grazing industry has been trying to get agreement on a scheme which would enable an apprentice system to be introduced for the industry. It has my complete support and, I am sure, that of the Opposidon. We are acutely aware of the need to encourage young men to enter this industry. The main purpose of the first series of Bills is to make provision for the future of iinancing research and promotion for Australia's greatest industry. There has been a long history of industry and government co-operation in this field. A joint fund has been established, as has been done with respect to many other primary industries, usually on a $ 1 for $ 1 basis. It is quite reasonable that the Government should contribute to such a fund,firsdy,for the very reason I mentioned a moment ago, that is, that this is our greatest industry. It is a major export earner. But it also has important and diverse effects through the economy itself. So, it is good business from the points of view of the Government and the community for the Government representing the community to contribute to this fund. I also bring to the notice of the House the fact that included in the costs which the levy on growers has to meet is the cost of the administrauon of the Australian Wool Corporation. It is wise to mention this fact to remind growers that such organisations do not run for nothing. They must be paid for. In this instance, and I think properly, the organisation is paid for by the growers. It is up to them to ensure that they get good value for money. I believe that in the Australian Wool Corporation the growers have had good value for money and I hope that they will continue to get it. We are beginning to see, although it is impossible to put a precise value on them, some of the results, inevitably long term in nature, of the expenditure in the past on research and promotion. The honourable member for New England mentioned some of the developments which have taken place, such as machine washable wool, drip dry characteristics, fast pastel shade dyes and similar advances, nearly all of which, I remind the House, have been initiated within Australia. It is difficult, if not impossible, to put a precisefigureon the value of that work. But there is general agreement throughout all sections of the industry, not only among the growers, that the great dedication of Australian scientists and research workers, and their coUeagues overseas, is now showing results. It has been shown possible that the nexus between the prices of synthetic competitors with wool and wool itself can be broken; in other words, that a quaUty image for wool can be established which enables wool to command a premium price over otherfibres.But there is a need for a continuing research effort. Research which is hampered by not knowing whether it will receive finance next year or the year after is inevitably inhibited. There is a need to enable those carrying out this research work to have some guarantee of future income- I am talking of the International Wool Secretariat in particular now-to enable them to undertake the programs which they should undertake. As a consequence of this legislation, the industry has agreed to raise its contribution for research and promotion, much of which will go to the International Wool Secretariat. Because wool prices have fallen, and even taking into account the guaranteed floor price, the question now arises: Will the 2.75 per cent levy be sufficient? We know that, under the legislation, it is possible to increase the contribution to 3 per cent. The growers naturally are hopeful that this will not be necessary. In the second reading speech which he delivered on this legislation last year, the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) indicated that in the first year of this 3-year program, as before, Government and industry would contribute to the fund on a $ 1 for $1 basis. The Government subsequently would increase its proportionate contribution for research while reducing that for promotion. The point I raise now is the relative responsibuities of the industry and the Government for the first year. I refer to page 60 of the attachments to the Budget Speech which shows that the expenditure for 1974-75 for research, promotion and other expenditure on wool will be $44.3 m. We know, according to the legislation, that there is a Umit on government expenditure for 1974-75 of $22m. Obviously the balance requires, near enough, a $1 for $1 contribution by the industry. I draw the attention of the Minister to the estimates of receipts and summary of estimated expenditure of the Budget, as shown on page 29 of Budget Paper No. 4. It shows that the expenditure for Wool Industry-Promotio n and Research (Act 1972-73) in 1974-75 will be $49m. By legislation the Government's contribution is limited to $22m. If the total expenditure is $44m the Opposition has no argument as the money will be supplied on a $1 for $1 basis. But if the total expenditure is to be $49m and the industry is required to contribute, therefore, $27m, the money will not be supplied on a $ 1 for $1 basis. We hope that the Minister will be able to explain this, otherwise the Opposition will probably find it necessary to move an amendment making the position quite clear. The net effect of the new legislation will the third year, to lower the Government's contribution. Instead of being on a 50/50 basis it will be on the basis of a 40 per cent contribution by the Government and a 60 per cent contribution by the industry. As I mentioned before, the amount raised by the levy is directly proportional to the proceeds from the sale of wool. With declining wool prices, not only does the question arise whether sufficient funds will be available for the International Wool Secretariat, but also the point arises of whether this will be too severe an impost on the industry itself on a time of declining prices. I remind the House that when prices reached a disastrously low level before, the Opposition Parties when in government came to the decision-quite a right one in my opinion-to make a $2 for $1 contribution during thetimeof the industry's difficulties. I hope that a similar sympathetic approach will be shown by this Government should the net returns- I emphasise the words 'net returns'-fal l to a dangerously low level. I turn now to some of the other Bills that we how many are debating in this very complex debate encompoint passing 7 BUls. I refer to the proposed 5 per cent sons levy on growers tofinancethe possible losses on have the Australian Wool Corporation's trading operyears aago. ations. I emphasise again that this is a quite was only 2Iyears different levy from the previous one which I money values. Theagoreason mentioned and which was on a joint industry not be compared directlywhy and government basis. This is a grower contribuscheme is that the previous with tion. There is no corresponding government reserve scheme in the true meaning was UabiUty. A lot of nonsense has been written in the pression at all. It was a deficiency of Press lately about the Government's using taxpayers ' money to prop up the wool industry. The scheme reports are confusing 2 things. First of aU they party are confusing the fact that no government conprice tribution is involved in the 5 per cent levy; secThis isit acould ondly, they are confusing the fact that the $ 150m spUtting hairs; advanced to the Australian Wool Corporation by the Government is a loan and not a grant. Not only that-the industry has tofinancethat current rates of interest and by the levy it has meet any losses which might be incurred by Corporation as a result of its buying-in activities. This emphasises the basic philosophy of the Ausliament, traUan Wool Industry Conference and its Wool PoUcy Committee in particular. It is the firm intention of the Conference, and it always has been, to maintain the Australian Wool Corporond ation as an autonomous body. This is quite vital if the industry is to continue to be the master of its own destiny. The Australian Wool Corporation had no reason to suppose that thefinancerequired for its operations would not be avaUable from normal be, by commercial sources. The only reason it is not avaUable from normal commercial sources is the disastrous economic poUcies of this Government. I need to refer only to the savage cUscriminatory attitude and the measures taken by the Labor Government against primary industry in general. Now, probably by mistake, the Government finds itselffinancingthe operations of the Australian Wool Corporation. It is not surprising, in view of this record, that the Opposition has grave reservations about the wool industry's going into pawn to this Government. Therefore we have moved the amendment in the terms given by the honourable member for New England, the Deputy Leader of the Country Party. I have much pleasure in seconding it.",39
93,Mr KERIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"By and large speakers in this debate have attempted to make quite a few constructive points about the wool industry generally. We have seen a tendency to bog down a bit. There has been some rather tortuous argument on the question of prices, such as how many cents will be paid for greasy wool and cents will be paid for clean wool. I out at the outset that some of the comparithat are being attempted refer to parameters that are not directly comparable. We situation that is simUar to what it was 2 remind members of the House that it when we started to look at this scheme canthe previous scheme not a the expayments whereby the Government came to the when the prices dropped below 36c a lb. The Government then sold the wool at whatever get and made up the difference. fixed reserve price. This is not simply this is a very different animal. I was genuinely confused by the approach loan at taken by the honourable member for New to England (Mr Sinclair). In his speech he said on the the one hand that decisions about the wool industry should more properly be made in Parbut on the other hand in his amendment he said that the financial arrangements should be made outside the Parliament. I do not particularly disagree with what he is getting at in his secpoint, but impUcit in the activities of the Australian Wool Corporation is this ability to act properly as a marketer in the market. The Government, when it found there were problems with the trading banks which are the usual source of finance for industries, acted perfectly flexibly. I think it is a bit ironic that this cognate debate on wool legislation should come on the day after the Government was censured for having no regard for the economic conditions of the various primary industries. Of course, this debate is taking place less than 24 hours after the decision to devalue. As the Green Paper clearly showed, flexible exchange rates are to be the normal business pectancy of the future, particularly for any counhas try trying to reduce tariffs when the world monetalways ary order is in disarray. Devaluation has been carried out in the singular interests of wool industry or exporters generally any more than revaluations of last year were carried persecute the farmer. I have said before place that the reason why the previous Government did not revalue and cut tariffs in 1971, as could have been recommended, was due to the Country Party tail wagging the Liberal dog to the parlous situation in the wool industry at thetime.It was a very hard decision. The point make is that because wool historically has been so much a consideration when currency matters were being scrutinised the devaluation must be of importance to the industry as a whole. This, together with other measures the Government has announced, must give the industry more conmitted fidence in the future. The increased levy made the growers can now be made in trust. It was industry's wish. With reference to the second part of the amendment of the honourable 1960s. member for New England I think it was the desire of the farmers themselves to have some commitment to the industry, apart from governfuture ment commitment, to give them more indepenwool. dence. This is the reason that the farmers were happy to accept the added levy. But, more importantly, the devaluation decision the and Government has made has taken a load off the Australian Wool Corporation which is in a more responsible position than ever before. The buyers of our wool, particularly our friends in Japan, will benefit by the decision. with interest that I have seen the wool futures market in the last few weeks anticipate the devaluation up till this week. The Bills before House are simple and undramatic. They could be regarded purely as machinery measures except for the background on which they are superimloans posed and the dynamic situation which exists present. The decisions represented by these Bills have been praised by the industry and deserve be so praised. A major point that must be made is that the Government's action with regard to the wool industry and the way in which the Minister for Agriculture, Ken Wriedt, has quietly, patiently and logically tackled the problems of our major industries are in no way a panic measure. The way the Minister for Agriculture has consulted and negotiated with the wheat industry, the way he has stood firm against pressures when he did not believe in them and the way he has fought, without running to the Press on issues where he has felt his colleagues have erred, has been a model for any person wishing exto observe responsible Cabinet government. He takenflackwithout becoming ruffled. He has tried to explain the reasons for actions not with which he has agreed or even privately the disagreed. To say that the Treasurer (Mr Crean) of this Government is in any way superimposing out to the wishes of his Department over the in this Department of Agriculture is nonsense. The present situation is that proposals of the and Minister for Agriculture have been subjected only to the usual Treasury scrutiny. The decision I to strike a fixed reserve price for wool at 250c a kilo of average clean micron wool and the decision to devalue are not panic measures, as I said. The decision to make 250c the level of the fixed reserve is in accordance with thefigurethat the Australian Wool Corporation itself has subto the Government in its overall case for by market reform and wider powers. The debate the about fixed and flexible reserve price schemes has been carried on in Australia since the early One only has to think back to the memorable days when Sir William Gunn tried to convince the industry of the wisdom of accepting the reality of trade in commodities such as An incredible amount of academic, industry practical grazier evaluation of various proposals has been carried out. The theory and application of buffer stock schemes has been well canvassed. Today's legislation is a very logical development of moves for reform in the industry over a long period. I must stress that these steps It is do not themselves represent total market reform or any finality in the debate on this commodity. What the legislation represents, above all, is an the insurance againstfluctuationsand a breathing space for the industry. To continue my analogy, we only have to hold our breath to be sure that advanced by the Government will be at recouped. Contrary to the Une taken by the city Press, taxpayers' funds are not in any way at risk. to Of course, it can and must be clearly stated that the last government would not make such confident decisions about the wool market. The right honourable member for Lowe (Mr MCMahon) when he was Treasurer or Prime Minister would not buy afixedreserve scheme on behalf of his Party. In 1970, due to fears of future, the past Government backed the market with a flexible reserve price scheme which greasy amounted to a shaky guarantee of some 79c kilo average greasy, in today's terminology. The fixed reserve scheme we have introduced gives firm guarantee of 123c a kilo average greasy. fact, the market is giving a price very close to at present. It might be slighdy above it at the present day. People may say that things are different now and that we are now in a far different industry situation but I do not believe this is so. People making claims such as this should substantiate them. As my colleague, the honourable Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan) has said, the price we are now guaranteeing on afixedreserve, not just as a deficiency payment, is 44c a lb above that the last Government. That was only 2 years ago. Even if we take the most pessimisticfigurefor inflation in that period of 20 per cent, we find that the increase in afixedreserve is in order of 55 per cent. The price of 123c a kilo only been exceeded in 6 years of the 23 years that the past Government was in office. This does mean that the price must hold at 123c but that the floor below which the price will not sink. parently in the past the Country Party would agree to afixedreserve price scheme if we are believe what the honourable member for Richgrower to miU. mond said on 15 November 1970. He said: . . . the scheme was not intended to force or defy the wool market, but to test it and to get the best and realistic price the market can pay. I am afraid that growers who believe that wool users can be forced-i day of ready availability of cheaper, though perhaps textile substitutes-to pay a certain price for wool, facing up to the realities of the situation. The honourable member for Richmond was prospects clearly implying that he was opposed to a floor price and that the market should be allowed to fall to levels dictated by buyers in the auction room. In those days also there were no proproduct. ponents of a floor price scheme within the Lib2. eral Party. As well as guaranteeing funds, the product. Labor Government has acted to expand the powers of the Australian Wool Corporation. Again, these powers are-and other powers now under consideration, if granted will be- a logical points: extension of marketing research and the Government's desire to guarantee orderly marketing. The Australian Wool Corporation now has powers to control the flow of wool on to the market and the nominal power to persuade growers to hold wool on their property. The Australian Wool Corporation in my opinion needs to have the power to buy outside the reserve price the scheme if an opportunity presents itself. It also needs to have the power to trade in other than wool. I think at this stage the Australian a Wool Corporation would be wise to look carefuUy towards the next step. I think it would be aadvised to absorb its new powers and work In towards refining the plan it has put up to the that Government. The present plan still causes me concern with respect to the concepts of ceUing price, aUocation and key user. Having said that the measures taken by the Government do not represent complete market reform, it needs to be said that developments in technology and marketing techniques must continue to run parallel to our moves to give insurance and ameUorate member for fluctuations in the market. There is stiU a lot of work to be done with of respect to handUng and work on the mUl end of the pipeUne as far as objective measurement is concerned. What we need to do now is to talk of will an overall marketing system. Although we are the starting to see this sort of system develop in has Australia it is not so certain that we understand the mill end in terms of lot size and stock holding not in particular. MUl confidence needs to be is retained. We must work more on this end of the Apwool pipeUne. The handUng system that needs to not be developed by research very carefully from to now on must centre on the flow of wool from I have only a few other comments on these BUls. Other honourable members have raised the most question of promotion. Again, I would like to see those wool far more scrutiny, particularly in the Intern this national Wool Secretariat and some of these inferior bodies engaged in wool promotion. Criteria have are not to be met for advertising and promoting agricultural products if they are to have reasonable of success. Ross Parish, an agricultural economist, set out in an article the following product characteristics favourable to advertising: 1. The existence of an opportunity to differentiate the The presence of imponant 'hidden' qualities in the 3. The association of powerful emotional buying motives. Also favouring promotion were the following 4. A favourable demand trend. 5. Existence of many potential consumers. 6. A fast turnover of buyers. 7. Frequent product changes. 8. Frequent price changes. It is in that sort of setting that one needs to ate promotion in the wool industry. I am afraid that in the past it simply has not been carried out. If one wants to sum up this criteria to see what general criterion of effectiveness one can give, one has to find out whether it supplies the consumer with useful information. Comparing the characteristics of wool with the checklist I have given, only items 1, 3 and 4 seem to be relevant to wool-to separate the identity of wool from synthetics and because the demand for wool is responsive to fashion and income changes. On the other hand, apart from these criteria, synthetics appear to be favoured by the check Ust numbers of 2, 5,6 and 7. Along with Parish I see wool promotion as essentiaUy defensive with so many resources committed to wool production in Australia. Promotion to offset the potential risk of not advertising in competition with synthetics could be justified even in the absence of clear evidence of the potential pay-offs. Wool is a commodity which also suffers in that if your promotion is very effective there may be times where aU you are doing is simply accentuating the trends. I commend the BUls to the House.",40
94,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"This is an important debate for the wool industry because as a result of a series of events that have been put in train by this Government the wool industry, with other export and primary industries, has got into a very difficult situation. One of the remarkable things about the poltiical perspicacity of the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) seems to be that every time he is defeated in Cabinet and every time his Government puts the boot into rural industries he is able to persuade farm leaders that he is a good chap after aU because the situation would have been so much worse if he had not been there. But after some of the decisions that have been announced throughout this year I think that most people would agree that the situation could not have been worse whether he was there or not. We know the factors that have contributed to this long series of events. We know of the rapid increase in inflation in particular. We know the successive revaluations-the revaluations effective upwards-whic h have done an enormous amount of harm to a great many rural industries. We have the situation in which costs have been increased by 90 per cent over a three or four year period and 40 to 45 per cent in the Ufetime of this Government. That is a record of which the Government surely should not be proud. I think there are many problems confronting the industry which farmers will not realise for the next 8, 12 or 14 months because I suspect that a good evalumany people are still carrying out contracts and work that was negotiated last year when income was much better and costs were much lower. These people are banking in part on income being maintained at roughly last year's levels. I suspect, and I hope I am wrong, that there might be a good number who do not realise that in the beef and wool areas farm income will be half of what it was last year. This will become increasingly evident as more wool, sheep, cattle and calves are sold. One of the problems for the farming community, and one of the problems for every industry throughout Australia, is that of liquidity. Liquidity problems will be monstrous. One has only to look at a situation in which costs will have gone up by the end of this year and in which actual inflation will be about 40 per cent over 2 years. The costs in the farming sector over a 3-year period which concludes at the end of this year will have in fact doubled and income will have been halved. The liquid resources therefore avaUable to farmers have been cut in half but their requirements and needs for carry-on funds, for liquidity, will have been enormously increased. A person in a secondary industry who is carrying $100,000 worth of stocks would now need $120,000 to $125,000 worth of stocks if he wanted to maintain the same level of activity. But the situation will be so much worse in the farming community because of the fall in gross income and because of additions to runnning costs which have in fact nothing to do with inflation. If we try to measure the increase in costs to the farming community the figure wiU be much nearer 100 per cent than something like 30 per cent or 40 per cent. It is against this background that these Bills have been introduced. When the wool levy was increased some time ago for research and promotion the Government contribution was significantly reduced. It was cut. At that time the Government said: 'Oh, the industry is prosperous; the industry can afford it'. The corollary and logic of that, now that the industry is not so prosperous and is facing severe liquidity problems of and therefore needs the benefit of promotion and research, especially in the field of shearing, ought to be that the Government will increase its contribution. But that, of course, is not in the Government's philosophy or manner. The main elements of the legislation will, of course, affect the Australian Wool Corporation. Bank finance is not available not because the Corporauon does not want it, not because the banks are unwilling to finance the Corporation, but because of the economic policies of this Government which have been utterly disastrous and which are ruruiing in about half a dozen directions at once. The Budget which was presented last week will, as a result of the squeeze has applied to the private sector of the economy and its expansion of the government sector, add enormously to inflation, will add to our balance of payments problems and will add also to the level of unemployment because of the blow which it has struck at business confidence. This week we have a devaluation in somewhat murky circumstances which runs in a quite different direction. If the Government had a devaluation in mind a week ago the Budget ought to have been of a very different kind from that which was introduced. These are the circumstances in which we are looking at this legislation. Bank finance is not available because of the overall Australian liquidity situation in which business and farmers throughout Austraha will be short of thousands of millions of dollars of liquidity throughout the next 8,10 to 12 months. Thus we need Governmentfinanceto support the industry and a 5 per cent industry levy. Of course, the Press, the media and the Government have done nothing to discourage the situation. The media have tended to suggest that these are funds that the taxpayers are providing at some cost and risk to themselves. Of course, the industry stands behind the funds. These funds are lent on the security of the clip. The growers' contributions and not the funds that the Government might provide pay for any loss that may occur. The Government has not been particularly generous. I am advised that the interest rate to charged is something approaching 14 per cent, and if anyone thinks that is a gift to the wool industry, I do not know what is. I think it shghtly sinister that the rate of interest on funds being made available to the Corporation has not in reality been published. If, as has been suggested, the rate is approaching 14 per cent, think that such a decision is a scandal of which the Government ought to be ashamed. The Australian Wool Corporation has over long and difficult period provided substantial support to the wool market. The Corporation is significant improvement on the free and uninpresent hibited auction which I have opposed since at least 1962. The Government claimed when it was in Opposition that it would support inflation organised marketing for the wool industry. One of the tragedies of the present situation and of the causes of the present market circumstances is the demolition job being carried out by those 2 destroyers of primary industries-the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan) and the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson). They have attacked the Wool Corporation and it they have made it quite plain that they believed - on e is a Minister; the other might not matterthe Corporation in trying to sustain a temporarily difncult market situation had gone beyond guidelines set by the Government, although there is information to suggest that the Corporation had discussed these guideUnes with the Government shortly after the election and that the Corporation was acting in conformity with the guideUnes, and from members and the Chairman of the Corporation I would have expected nothing else. But the Minister and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, supported by the Australian Labor Party and by the Government did a very effective job of destroying worldwide confidence in the Corporation and in the Government's determination to back the market which was quite essential to hold the market at the price of 300c a lrilo. As a result of Government action the price has been dropped by 50c a ldlo; But the Corporation has to buy as much wool at that price as it would have had to buy at the higher price. I would venture to say that if the price had been set at 300c a kilo the Corporation would not have bought one additional kilo of wool. It is not the price that deters people in the present circumstances from buying wool; it is the need to know that the price that is set will be maintained. But the Government thought that be the poverty level-and it is a poverty level at 250c a kUo-woul d be adequate for the wool industry. That might not have been so in earlier is days when costs were very much less than they the are now. It would have been a good price in days when there was a deficiency payment and a guarantee of 36c per lb. But the present price is I about 44c per lb, translated into old terms. Since the days of 36c per lb guarantee there has been a 90 per cent increase in costs and 40 per cent inflation over the last 2 years-las t year and this year. a By the end of thisfinancialyear I believe there will have been an increase of 100 per cent in total a costs over the last 3 years. So to compare the guaranteed price of 44c per lb with the old one of 36c per lb one would really double the old price to 72c per lb, making allowance for and cost increases, aU caused by this Government. Then one would have a situation in one which one would be comparing the 44c per lb with the 72c per lb which would have been the comparative figure on the basis on which the industry was being paid three, four orfiveyears ago. That would not make the Government come out so well. It does not make the Government's generosity or its view of the wool industry sound quite so well. One of the tragedies of this situation is that I do not really believe that enough people in farming industries have done their homework about the increasing costs which have come upon them over the last year or two and the reduced returns which will be affecting so many. The Government might claim that it has revalued and introduced a currency devaluation of 12 per cent. But after a revaluation upwards of about 30 per cent and an inflation over the last 2 years of 40 per cent the 12 per cent devaluation figure appears modest. Again, there is no solution for the industry's problems in that area. There is help at the margin, but that will not overcome the problems and difficulties that have been caused quite directly by the Government, which obviously has no interest in this debate at all. A number of problems have occurred because of the Government's delay in these matters and because of the Government's destruction of the confidence in the wool industry. I should have added that during and after the attack by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the Minister for Northern Development there were Japanese reports that quite obviously the price had been propped up for poltiical reasons. In other words, not unexpectedly overseas buyers picked up the false claims of the Minister and adjusted their buying Umits accordingly. The Australian wool grower is now paying the price for that. As a result of the destruction of confidence in the industry at thattimethere has been a very difficlt marketing situation since. Some sales have been postponed because of shortage of funds and there have been cancellations of sales. Growers who would otherwise have got their reduced cheque on a certain date will clearly have to wait a longer period. I understand that there are some proposals to overcome some part of that difficulty-again , proposals that growers will be paying for. If, as I time. am advised, the interest rate on the loans is at 14 per cent a year the growers will be paying for proposals in a scandalous fashion. The Opponecessity sition, as has been made plain by the amendis ment that has been moved, supports the legisture lation. There is no alternative in the circumation stances that have been created by the Govern the ment. But we are concerned at the degree of conGovernment trol that could be exerted on this industry by this Government. There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that at least some people in the Government are seeking, through a program of inflation, to destroy aU those who have contributed to Australia in the past and who have buUt up some assets, very often from nothing. The farming community is one part of that group. People who own their own homes, who have small businesses, who have estabUshed businesses are being grievously hurt. Those who have retired after working for a long period are being hurt perhaps most of all. Some of the measures that the Government has introduced in such a mean and petty fashion have attacked groups in this area. How the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart), who is sitting at the table, can believe that the retired people in his electorate ought to be attacked as the recent Budget has attacked them. I cannot understand. It is not only people such as that Mr Stewart-What do you mean by that?",43
95,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,The tax on unearned income. I should like to know how somebody who has retired and is 70 years old in the Minister's electorate can go out and earn income afresh- or someone in the electorate of the Leader of the House (Mr Daly). Mr Daly-What has that got to do with the wool BiUs?,45
96,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Because the same tax is aimed in a quite vicious manner at anyone who tries to produce anything in Australia and who employs capital to do it. We have to see the detaUs of the tax when it comes forward, but I would have thought that there would be a large number of supportersMr Stewart-That might be right if you wait until it comes forward.",45
97,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,The Minister is implying that there will be another Caucus revolt. It will be a wonderful thing if there is. I thank the Minister for his admission and for his honesty in saying that before the revolt has actually occurred. Mr Daly-We will get you to use the knife next,45
98,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"We are saving it the up for you, and it will be very sharp. There is a to support this legislation because there no alternative. It will help to estabUsh a strucwhich if wisely used, as it will if the Corporis left to its own account, will help to meet problems and needs of the industry. If the unduly interferes as it has in recent weeks and months that will not be the case. But it will be difficult, in the circumstances that have been created, for the measures and for the degree of authority given the Corporation by the legislation to overcome the very real difficulties which the wool industry is in as a result of the general economic and inflationary problems of the industry. The decisions on superphosphate, petrol tax, the Post Office, local government, education and roads are all kicking the backside of people who live outside of the capital cities. That seems to give a great deal of pleasure to people on the Government side of the House. The fact that they have introduced a measure which partially meets the needs of a great Australian industry will not for one moment deceive a single farmer or a single person who lives outside Melbourne or Sydney.",45
99,Dr GUN,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"All the Oppohas sition speakers so far seem to have made quite great play on what they regard as niggardliness by the Government. I think perhaps what to speakers from that side said in the past ought be quoted in this context. They said that there no such thing as a free lunch. Yet the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has said quite a lot about how the previous Government paid all of the 36c a lb and the growers did not have to pay anything. The same thing was mouthed by the Honourable member for Corantariffs gamite (Mr Street). We just heard the honourabout able member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) saying that the Government is being pretty lousy in not providing enough to the wool growers. I tlunk the first thing that ought to be said that it is not a question of the Government viding anything. The Government does not have income as such; it is other people's money that we are talking about. When we talk about dissome tributing money to wool growers or to anybody else we must always bear in mind, if we are to responsible about this, that if we are to give benefit to some group, such as must deny funds and deny buying power to some other section of the community. When the Government makes a decision to give a benefit a certain section of the community, it is not givnet ing away its own money; it is really making a lective decision on behalf of the community who will pay for what. I think that this is a matter which should be put in its prospective. Notwithstanding that, this measure is uneroded doubtedly very generous to wool growers. There will be very significant short term benefits wool growers. The main benefits of this measure are these: By means of the levy which will imposed on wool growers, the Government will be enabled to ensure that 250c per kilo will the reserve price of the Australian Wool Corporation. A sum of $ 150m will be provided by the Government to underwrite that floor price. What does that mean when compared with past support schemes for the wool industry, such as the one which had a reserve price of 36c per lb and which was mentioned previously? On my understanding, one can equilibrate the two by saying that the yield from greasy wool was about 60 per cent of the yield from an equivalent volume of clean wool. So 250c per kilo for clean wool is something of the order of 160c per kilo for greasy wool which, before metrication, comes down to 72c per lb greasy. According to my calculations, that is exactly double the 36c per lb which was the reserve price provided when the wool industry was going through its very bad slump a couple of years ago. It is true, of course, that there been some inflation since that time; but I do not think anybody, even honourable members opposite, would assert that costs have increased such an extent that they would fully offset this to very generous increase to what I believe is douis ble the price that was payable under the scheme brought in by the previous Government. A measure that would offset any increase in costs is, of course, the reduction of tariffs. We must remember that the 25 per cent reduction in which was brought in by this Government a year ago must have significant benefits for the wool industry. I recall that a report produced some years ago by the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia indiis cated that the added costs to the wool industry prowhich resulted from tariff protection would amount to something like 12 per cent. I suggest, therefore, that the tariff reduction does provide offset against any increase in costs that may have occurred in the last couple of years. So, be there is a very much greater benefit to the wool a industry than honourable members opposite are wool growers, we prepared to concede. I know that this measure has been criticised, particularly in some sections of the Press, as to being too generous and as meaning in the end a loss to taxpayers. I must confess that I also colhad some fears that this would be the case, and I as to was becoming more apprehensive when I could see that the profits from the activities of the Corporation in the previous season were being and it was starting to look as though the growers' contributions would also be eroded. to However, I think that this situation has been changed considerably by the announcement in be the last 24 hours of a devaluation of the Australian dollar. I think we must have a look at be what the situation wiil ""-e in the Ught of this devaluation. I have here a short repon which came into my possession today. It was put out by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. In the context of the devaluation, under the heading * Wool' the report states: In the present situation of a weak demand for wool and heavy purchases by the Australian Wool Corporation, the devaluation of the Australian dollar is hkely to lead to the trade purchasing larger quantities immediate rise in aucdon prices. Later in the season when it is expected that the demand will befirmerand that prices will rise above the AWC floor the impact of the devaluadon can be expected to be reflected in even higher prices. The devaluation decision should reduce the quantity of wool which otherwise was estimated to be held by the Corporation at the end of the season. This means that the in expon income from wool would be greater than the increase in receipts by growers. I take that to mean that the growers themselves will already have received the benefit of their own receipts by direct payment from the Wool Corporation. In the first instance, the devaluation should help the Corporation to clear a lot of its stocks. Then, later in the season, if the market becomes more buoyant, there should be a significant increase in the receipts of wool growers and a further increase in Australia's export income. I think this shows quite clearly that there will be a direct benefit to the wool growers. Of course, in the case of a devaluation, this applies to all sections of primary industry which export. Honourable members opposite, particularly members of the Country Party, are very quick criticise this Government for any measure which they regard as inflationary. But I notice that have come in very quickly to support the devaluation. I think this shows a curious double standard on the part of members of the Country Party because any impartial person must aclend knowledge that there is some inflationary impact in devaluation. Yet the Country Party has not criticised the Government for this policy action because it knows that it will mean a direct increase in the receipts of primary producers. Members of the Country Party are always the same; they are prepared to do anything to vent other people from trying to compensate themselves for increased costs of living-suc h workers receiving increased wages-bu t they do not say anything when it comes to their own secincrease tional interests. We saw this demonstrated very lucidly and very starkly at the last Federal tion. When the Leader of the Liberal Party said that he would control prices, the Leader of the Country Party made it quite clear that able perishables-in other words, what his sectional interests produce-woul d be exempted, because if housewives were to pay less for their foodstuffs it would mean that his sectional interests receive a lower income. The members of the Country Party were not going to have a bar of that. It should not be forgotten, therefore, that devaluation has the effect of increasing directly the receipts of primary producers who export. This is something that ought to be acknowledge by honourable members of the Opposition if of wool, rather than to an they are to be honest about it. I am not saying that I personally do not support the Government's devaluation. In fact, I do suppon it. But the main reason why I support the devaluation announced by the Government is that it protects total gain the impon competing industries in Australia against what is a very abnormal international economic situation. There is a worldwide recession and other countries are faced with rising stocks of unsold goods. They are trying as hard as they can, aggressively, to push those goods in any market that they can find, and that includes Australia. That is a very good justification for the devaluation announced by the Government. I find the amendment moved by the honourable member for New England very difficult to understand. As far as I am concerned, what we want to do is to try to ease the Uquidity situation in Australia, and this measure of course will do that. I cannot see any reason why the banks should lend money to the wool industry rather than anybody else. I cannot see why the banks to should have to lend preferentially to the wool industry rather than to some other industry. I they personaUy would Uke to see some money going from the banks to the housing industry because the signs indicate that a slackness will develop in that industry. I hope that the banks are able to money to the housing industry. Incidentally, this measure will enable that to happen, because this payment of $ 150m to the Wool Corporation will enable a substantial and very rapid increase in the liquidity situation of the trading banks. Presumably, as soon as the Corporation pays the growers, the growers-at least, those of them prewho do not put the money under the bed in a sock-wil l put the money into the bank. That will as immediately improve the liquidity situation of the banks. I hope that then they will be able to their lending to the housing industry. Because of the multiplier effect, they will have elecavaUable an amount considerably in excess of $150m. This is a very welcome side effect of this measure, because it will be injecting a consideramount of liquidity into the economy and should help to overcome the liquidity squeeze with which we are faced. But I cannot understand why banks should be required specifically would to lend to the wool industry. This was not explained by honourable members opposite. As far as I can see their objection to this measure is purely an ideological one. I am less certain about the effects of these measures on the industry in the long term. I am not talking about the taxpayers now; I am talking about the wool industry itself. If the price is 250c per kilo it will be because the interaction of supply and demand has determined that that is the price of wool. It will not be 250c per kilo because the sellers say that that is the price. It has to be remembered that there are substitutes for wool. They are not as good, but there are substitutes. It is all very well for us to say that the wool industry always will be there because it always has been there. Other countries might not necessarily see it in that way. For example, because of the protection that has been put up against wool in the United States, the wool industry has been of comparatively smaller importance in that country. In other words, what has happened in the United States is that wool has virtually been priced out of the market. We do require a viable wool industry. We want it to remain a good export earner for Australia. It is absolutely essential to us to have viable export industries if we are to import the capital equipment that we need for our continued economic welfare. To have a viable industry we must be responsive to the market. If we try to force the market we might not only encourage substitution but also discourage efficiency in the industry itself. The best way to ensure that there is a viable industry is to ensure that it becomes efficient. Whether the industry can do that while it is insulated from market forces I suppose only time will tell. However, I think that the measures which have been taken will provide significant benefits now. Devaluation itself will provide a substantial increase in our export earnings and will help the receipts of wool growers. The measure that has been used to advance money to the Australian Wool Corporation also will do something to increase the liquidity in the economy. The beneficial effects of that will be felt throughout Australia.",46
100,Mr KING,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The honourable deUberately member for Kingston (Dr Gun) commenced his remarks by saying that these measures are rather generous to the wool growers. He went on to plain how the 250c per kilo reserve price for 21 micron clean basis wool works out at 72c per greasy. All I want to say to the honourable member for Kingston is that all the theory world will not improve the actual selling price the grower. If he were to cast his mind back to the results of the first week's trading under the new proposals he would remember that the actual sale price was in the vicinity of 50c. If the actual cost involved were taken off the price would be closer to 41c or 42c. I believe that the honourable member ruined the whole of his argument and that of some of the speakers before him by referring to the importance of the devaluation of the currency and saying that that is going to let the wool industry off the hook. This cognate debate covers almost every aspect of the wool industry, but I feel quite sure that basically the important issue is that of the wool plan announced by the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) on, I think, 27 August last. It is known as the floor price plan. It has been very interesting to note the various statements that have been made since the making of that announcement. I recall what happened in the very early days of that announcement being made. It is true that a number of industry leaders referred to the new plan as being a breakthrough and a milestone in the history of the wool industry. I think that there were plenty of people who welcomed the whole issue before they analysed it thoroughly. There were others, including myself, who just welcomed the principle. I have no arguments against that. But I, and I am quite sure many thousands of others, have never accepted the principle laid down of the price being set by the Government. I was absolutely staggered to hear the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Kerin) say on several occasions-firstl y in a television program I saw one Sunday afternoon and then in response to an interjection yesterday by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street)-that this was an equitable price. I was absolutely staggered to hear that said by a man who represents a large wool growing area. I am mindful of the fact that the seat he holds is named 'Macarthur' because of the early introduction of merino sheep into that area by Macarthur. Thefigureof250c per kilo is a very misleading one. I almost said that it was deliberately put out as a misleadingfigure,but I do not think that I should say that. I am not too sure whether it was put out to mislead, but the figure is, as I have said, very misleading and is not acceptable to the wool growers. Anyone who suggests exthat it is a reasonablefiguredoes not understand the situation. One has to convert the 250c per kUo lb into real values compared with other prices and with ones that the people can understand. First in the and foremost 21 micron wool has been mento tioned. It is a severing of the old principle of the wool count. Twenty-one micron wool is not average wool. The average is not up to the standard of 21 micron wool. I think I should make that point very clear. Only a small proportion of the wool produced in this country is 21 micron or better. The average is well below it. In the not so effective wool growing areas the standard is well below that figure. Naturally any wool that is of lesser standard than 21 micron standard will receive a lower price. The price is based on the weight per kilogram, which again is misleading to many people. Many people keep referring to the price of wool as though it is still weighed on the pounds basis of a few years ago. By converting the presentfigureto the old formula of pounds greasy one comes to light with a different price altogether. It should be always remembered that from the price quoted there is an automatic deduction of about 14 per cent to 14.5 per cent for such things as freight, insurance, handling charges, commission and the like as well as the increased levy of 5 per cent that is over and above the levy of 2.75 per cent for research and promotion. So what it all really boils down to is what the grower receives in the form of a cheque. All he is interested in is the final cheque that he receives. It is unfortunate that people are being misled into believing that they are going to get not a cheque that is based on thefigureof 4lc per lb but one that is based on afigurethat is much in excess of that, as the honourable member for Kingston mentioned a little while ago. The $64 question is: What brought the price down? That is the all important thing. When the present Opposition was voted out of office in 1972 the price of wool was almost at its peak for recent times. I am referring to the period since the early 1950s. But after 6 months in office by the Australian Labor Party we saw a change taking place. We saw the price starting to slip down. Why? For many reasons. I would like to mention one. I refer to an incident that took place in this chamber not so very many months ago when both the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan) and the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) made great play about sapping the confidence of the people in the Australian Wool Corporation. I ask anyone who disputes that statement to check Hansard and see just what they did say and how they brought the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) and the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Sinclair) into the picture. They were the ones who set the ball rolling. I vividly recall that when the Minister for Northern Development, who acts in this House for the Minister for Agriculture, was challenged to indicate what future backing there would be from the Government to enable the Wool Corporation to continue its operations he evaded the question. Whether he had this new proposal in mind at that stage I do not know. However, this upset the industry and the growers and affected the confidence of people. No doubt the buyers took advantage of the situation. Dr Gun-Are you serious?",48
101,Mr KING,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Of course I am. It is a pity that the honourable member did not take particular note of this point because it is one of the reasons for people starting to lose confidence. The matter was referred to Senator Wriedt, the Minister for Agriculture. He said that he would form his own judgment on this issue. He did not support the honourable member for Eden-Monaro or the Minister for Northern Development. He was man enough not to criticise his own colleagues. He merely said that he would form his own judgment. Surely that indicates what he thought. As I said earlier, the Government refused to give an assurance that it would continue providing funds for the Wool Corporation to enable it to buy the quantity of wool necessary to maintain a reasonable and static price. I believe that since then the Government has tended to panic. I do not know how long it worked on this plan. The industry has been making submissions for some considerable time. When the final decision was made, how long did the Government or the Minister give the industry to consider the proposal? I think I am right in saying it was in the vicinity of one day. Wool industry leaders met in Melbourne and literally had to decide in a matter of hours whether to accept this plan. They had no alternative but to accept the plan as presented by the Minister. It was miles too late to start renegotiating. It takes a considerable time for the wool industry to determine a course of action because every State and every sector of the industry must be consulted and this cannot be done in a matter of hours. This is why we find ourselves in a most peculiar position.",49
102,Unknown,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,Sitting suspended from 6.13 to 8 p.m.,49
103,Mr KING,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Prio r to the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was indicating what this new plan really means. I had reached the stage where I could well ask what is the difference between this plan and the previous one, which was the deficiency payments scheme that was known to many wool growers. The previous scheme placed a floor on the market to prevent violent price fluctuations. At the conclusion of that scheme and prior to the introduction of the new one, the virtual reserve price wasranningat 300c or better. That was the lowest price for some considerabletime.The new scheme was introduced with the price at 250c Growers have to pay a 5 per cent levy on wool sold at this price. It is my opinion- I think it is held in many other areas of the wool industry and no doubt in the trade and possibly by some people who have made a close study of the subject-that had the floor price been set at 300c instead of 250c there would have been Uttle more, if any more, wool purchased than is being purchased today. During the suspension of the sitting for dinner, my colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) had some figures taken out to test some of the statements being made by members on the Government side. He asked the ParUamentary Library to calculate how the price of 36c per lb clean wool in 1970-71 would compare with that of 250c per kilo clean in September 1974, adjusted for inflation. It is true that we on this side of the House were somewhat critical of the previous reserve price of 36c, which was only a holding figure because just prior to its introduction the price of wool had reached an aU time record low and something had to be done. The answer that the honourable member for Moore received was that the price was practically the same, excluding the 5 per cent levy on wool sold at thefloorprice of250c a kUo clean. The important point, and I repeat it, is that the price excluded the 5 per cent levy. These are the estimates taken out by the Library and they show that 250c a ldlo today represents a lower return to the growers than they received in 1970. Surely that proves the point that the people who are saying that they are satisfied with 250c know Uttle of what they are talking about. My colleague the honourable member for MaUee (Mr Fisher) drew my attention to some prices which I believe should be of interest to the House. A grower sheared some dorset hom stud rams and sold the wool. He shore 2V4 kilos per head. The return to the grower was 46V4c clear per kuo. That works out at $1.16 per sheep. These were studs and there have been a lot of increases in shearing costs. Anyone who knows anything about the industry will appreciate that the normal rate to have a sheep put in a shed and shorn is running in the vicinity of $ 1.20 per head. The rate for stud rams is double which means an added 45c. So the return to the grower for his wool amounted to $1.16 and his costs came to $ 1.65. That is a loss of 49c per sheep. Yet people on the other side of the chamber say that it is not a bad price; that it is quite a satisfactory one. I repeat what I said before. Those people have Uttle or no idea of the cost. They have to remember- I am referring now to the information given me by the honourable member for Moore-that the price about 3 years ago was about 3 times what the price is today. If today's costs are compared with those of 3 years ago, it will be found that costs are increasing by 90 per cent to 100 per cent. So that is how good this wool scheme is. At the present price level, which is caused by lack of confidence, it is my considered judgment that the $150m that the Government has put aside to lend to the wool industry- I repeat the word 'lend'-at interest which I believe will be about 11 or 11 Vi per cent, will run out in the not too distant future. It is my guess that it will all be gone by Christmas unless something happens. If one looks at the fact that the growers contribute 5 per cent of their income, mindful that interest has to be paid over a 12-month period, one would find that about one-third of the grower's contribution could all be used up in a matter of 12 to 18 months. So I hope that those Government supporters who appear to be proud of this new scheme and take a lot of credit for introducing it to the wool industry for the first time will remember what they have said in a few years time. Perhaps when they move around the country electorates at election time they will remember it. I hope that they will also take some responsibUity if and when the industry decides that this scheme is not quite as they thought it was to be originaUy. As I said earUer in my remarks, it must be remembered that the industry had littletimeto study the proposal. It knew that the old scheme was out and that there was nothing to take its place. The Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) virtually gave the growers 24 hours to make up their minds as to whether they were going to accept the proposal. I trust that members on the Government side will take these things into consideration and that they will also take the responsibUity for the weaknesses of the scheme, so that at some futuretimethey will try to make every endeavour to improve it. I believe the Government must take the responsibUity for the collapse of the wool market. It is as simple as that. Had we remained with the old scheme,' growers would be receiving at least 50c a ldlo more than they are receiving on the present market I am sure that aU those members who are satisfied with the present price will go down in history as either not knowing anything about the industry and its problems, or as directly sabotaging the number one Australian industry, the wool industry. Debate (on motion by Mr Daly) adjourned. ELECTION CANDIDATES (PUBLIC SERVICE AND DEFENCE FORCE) BILL Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time.",49
104,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will be aware that elections are to be held during October 1974 for the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory. Nominations for this election close this month. This follows the recent passage of amendments to the Northern Territory (Adrninistration) Act. The Northern Territory (Administration) Act provides that a person is not qualified to be a candidate for election as a member of the Legislative Assembly if, at the date of nomination, he is employed in the Australian Public Service. If no amendment is made to existing legislation, approximately 11,000 public servants in the Northern Territory could be denied the incentive for or opportunity of standing for election. At present there is no specific provision enabling a public servant who resigns to contest an election in the Northern Territory, to be re-appointed or re-employed in the Public Service if he fails to be elected. Members of the defence force are in the same position. The purpose of the Bill is to enable officers employees of the Australian PubUc Service and members of the defence force, who resign to contest elections for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, to be re-appointed or re-employed if they faU to gain election. Part II of the extends the existing provisions of section 47C, which relates to permanent officers, and section 82B, which relates to temporary employees, of the PubUc Service Act. A person who retired from the PubUc Service to contest an election the Legislative Assembly for the Northern tory may, if he faUs to be elected, be re-apsuperphosphate pointed or re-employed at his previous level. Provision is also made to enable the sections be applied by regulation to elections for legislatcharges ive or advisory bodies of other Territories. wiU be used as necessary in the future. The amendments made to the Superannuation Act by Part III of the Bill wiU extend to these candidates the same superannuation rights and privUeges presently apply to Australian Government emother ployees who resign to contest Federal or State elections. Parts IV and V of the Bill relate to members of the defence force who resign to contest the elec1974 tions. The amendments apply the provisions of the Defence (ParUamentary Candidates) Act and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act to those elections, thus giving members of the defence force sinularrightsto Second Reading pubUc servants. In view of the nature and urgency of this Bill, and the fact that it will amend several Acts, it is hoped that honourable members will not delay its passage to discuss other matters associated with the relevant Acts. I refer in particular to the removal of the oaths and affirmations requirements from the Public Service Act during 1973. I can assure honourable members that opportunity will be given to them to debate that matter when another Bill to amend the PubUc Service Act is introduced later in this session. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr MACKellar) adjourned. WOOL MARKETING (LOAN) BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed.",51
105,Dr FORBES,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"This debate is concerned with one of Australia's greatest industries. It is an industry which stUl earns a greater proportion of our export income, or very close to it, than any other industry. This industry has been done grievous harm by the actions and or poUcies of this Labor Government in the short space of almost 2 years that it has been in office. When this Government came to office, it argued, to quote the Prime Minister (Mr Bill Whitlam), that the wool industry had never had it so good-in other words, that the prosperous conditions which existed for the industry at that time did not justify support from the Australian taxpayers. On that basis, the Government took for many actions which affected the industry. It Terrirevalued the currency. It removed the bounty. It removed the vital taxation concessions which the industry enjoyed. It to removed the subsidy which sought to equaUse for fuel in city and country areas. The This special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen), who is at the table, as Postmaster-General was primarily instrumental in removing concessions to country people in respect of telephone and as telecommunication services. There were many actions of this sort. Later, in the mini-Budget, the Government increased the excise on petrol. This move has vitaUy affected the wool industry in the same way as it affected every other primary industry. The argument advanced at the time to support such action ignored the fact that the industry just come through what was almost the worse cession in its history. It was, and in many ways still is, loaded down with mountains of debts. What I am saying is that the prices received the industry at the time when this Government came to office and took these actions did not reflect the true economic situation of the indusnot try. The industry desperately needed those higher prices in order to make a start to itself from the difficulties in which it was in the period of the rural recession. However, let us assume for the moment that the Government's argument is valid. I ask the Government and the Minister at the table, or whoever accepts responsibility for these Bills the part of the Government- I am not quite sure who it is-wh y the Government is not being connot sistent. If it was reasonable to withdraw conCorporation. cessions at atimewhen the industry was prosperthe ous, why is the Government not restoring those concessions now? Does the Government believe that at the level of costs and prices today industry is still prosperous? Is that an argument that it would use as a basis for consistency? only has the Government not restored those cessions which I have mentioned, but it has dealt the industry further tremendous blows in the Budget for 1974-75. I do not need to repeat the House that inflation has a greater impact an industry like the wool industry, which sells great bulk of its produce overseas, than on other industry in Australia. The Government proposes to introduce a capital gains tax, increase postal and telecommunications charprovision ges-posta l and telecommunication services are vital to people in the country-and to increase charges imposed on the aviation industry. Budget measures will cost the wool industry dearly. Take, as an example of this lack of consistency on the part of the Government, the levy for research and promotion. In introducing the Levy Bill 1973, on 2 May 1973, the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) said: Thus values compare favourably with prices realised the years when the industry alonefinancedexpenditure wool promotion. For these reasons, the Government considers that in 1973-74, wool growers should finance share of the expenditure on research and promotion its decision to provide $22m for this purpose and for of administering the marketing functions of the Australian Wool Corporauon represents cumstances. That is what the Minister said in 1973. He said that the industry was prosperous and was getting good prices and therefore could bear a greater proportion of the cost of financing wool prohad motion and research. As a result the Government reincreased the levy and reduced the Government's contribution. What do we find in these Bills before us? Do we find that to be consistent by with that argument the Government has reduced the levy for wool promotion and research and accordingly has increased its contribution? We do find anything of the sort. The levy remains exactly the same, despite the change in the econextricate omic circumstances of the industry. The Government claims that the $150m being provided for the Wool Corporation to carry on its activities is a recognition by the Government- a sympathetic Government, its supporters say-of the problems of the industry. I have no on hesitation in welcoming the Government's action in providing this money, as long as it does use it to interfere with the activities of the I believe that we will need-give n attitude of this Government-to watch that situation very carefully. Apart from that particular consideration I have no hesitation in saying the that I welcome this measure. I have always believed that a floor price scheme is in the interests Not of the industry. That having been said, I ask: conHow generous and how adequate is the Government's action? I think that we can come to a conclusion. We can make a judgment about the adto equacy of the Government's action and about on the claims by the Minister, the Government and the Government supporters that the Government is any being extremely generous to the wool industry. We can make a judgment by comparing the to present situation that is being achieved by the of this $150m and the conditions on which it has been made available with the situation that existed under the previous LiberalThese Country Party Government. The House will remember-it has been mentioned by almost every speaker in this debate, but needs to be said again-that the previous wool Government underwrote a price of 36c per lb. Wool The present Government is providing money to underwrite 250c a kilo. This sounds a substantial improvement on the present situation, and it has been represented as such by the Government. In in fact, when one does somefiguringon this matter, on it becomes quite apparent in relation to the only a greater thing that matters-the real return to the and that grower-that his real return from the new situthe cost ation is very Uttle different, if different at all, from the previous situation. This is because of a reasonable balance in the cirthe enormous increase in costs to the industry as a result of the economic mismanagement, the inflation and the general ineptitude of the handling of the economy by this Government. In addition to a situation where the grower real terms will be no better off under the new rangement than he was under the old, taken population. purely on the basis of the floor price arrangeIt ments the growers are much worse off. They are worse off firstly because they have been deprived, as I mentioned earlier, of the other sistance that was provided by the previous great Government-the superphosphate bounty, the taxation concessions, the telephone concessions and all the rest of it. These were essential ponents in determining the real economic situthe ation of the grower. Secondly, under this legistion lation the grower now has to pay a 5 per cent levy designed to meet the losses incurred by the poration. The levy will produce $47m. I do not object that. It has always been a pohcy of the industry to stand on its own feet. I congratulate the indussignificant try, I think it is highly desirable. I mention it the context of the claims made again and again by Government supporters that the Government selves is being generous to the industry. Mr Daly-So we are.",51
106,Dr FORBES,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The Government is not being generous to the industry. To bandy around a figure which represents 250c a kilo and to say that it is extremely generous in the light of the factors in the situation which I have mentioned is a travesty of the truth. To represent this as generous assistance to the wool industry is quite laughable. It is assistance which will cost the Government nothing because the growers are meeting the losses, not the Government or the taxpayers. It is assistance, I repeat, which will cost the Government nothing and will do very little indeed to compensate the industry for the incessant rain of blows that has fallen on it from the policies of this Government. We have no other course open to us but to support the legislation. As many speakers on this side have said, and I have underlined, we regard it as a marginal minimal action on the part Government. I agree, as most of the newspapers in Australia have suggested, that this is somelar thing which the Government was dragged into almost against its will and almost without knowearUer, ing what it was doing. If it had not moved in a hurry and at such a run this minimal marginal action to assist an industry to which it has so much harm would not have been taken. I supthinks pon the legislation.",53
107,Mr LUSHER,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS," I welcome the Government's recognition of the problems that are facing the wool industry today. We are talking about a 51,000m industry. It is still in Australia's greatest export earner and it stUl inarvolves a very significant ponion of the Australian It is beset with aU sons of problems. has the problem of low prices and rising costs, the classic squeeze situation. It should be made clear that the Government is not reaUy commitasting itself to any great deal of suppon for this industry. It is not committing itself to any expenditure of taxpayers' funds. This money is being made avaUable on a loan basis and the comfunds will attract interest at something around current levels. I will come back to the quesof interest a little later. It is sufficient to say at this stage that no taxpayers' funds are going to Corbe wasted as has been suggested by many different sources in recent weeks. The industry tc will in fact have a 5 per cent levy placed on it which will amount to $47m this year. This is a sum of money. It is this levy which will in in fact absorb any losses which may be incurred. It is a levy on the growers and the growers themwUl have to foot the bUl for any losses that may be sustained by the suppon operation. There is no question that the $150m is welcome but it must be seen in its true context. The industry would have been more than happy to have borrowed this money commercially but the way things worked out it is a government provided sum of money. It is interesting, I think, to look back on the banks' attitude to the proposal that they should in fact provide the money and guarantees for this operation. The banks were prepared to do this as long as the Reserve Bank was prepared to allow them to have access to statutory reserve deposits. If the bank had been a Uttle more flexible in its approach to the liquidity situation, this may have been achieved. The Reserve Bank itself could have made funds avaUable perhaps at more attractive interest rates than may now be the case, through the rural credits department. The word that has been floating around is that whatever decision might of the have been made by the banks in deciding whether they were going to support this particuproject was going to be, in fact, overruled by a government decision which had been taken that the funds would be provided by the such Government in this particular case. I do not know whether there is any politics behind that done decision. I do not know whether the Government it can gain some political points because the Government itself is providing those funds. It can now be said that the Government has made a commitment and that the industry cannot say that the Government was not responsible for providing this money. I support the Government. I support the Treasurer (Mr Crean) and the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) for in fact coming to the aid of the industry. I sincerely hope that at some later stage we are not put in a position where politics are brought into this situation and the industry is held up to ransom. I hope we are not put in an invidious position simply because the Government itself provided the funds in this situation. This is, I think, very important in the light of the amendments which have been moved by the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) because the industry wants to get itself on to a commercial and a viable basis. The industry wants to be able to borrow and to be responsible for its own funds. The industry wants to be able to be free of pohtical manoeuvrings, if that is going to be at all possible. I think the point was made earlier that the Government's policy of providing funds was potentially dangerous. I think it was pointed out by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan) that the wool industry would be fairly happy to be dealing with the Government in this situation. I do not think I am misquoting him. But I think that the position is rather the reverse. I think the industry would rather be dealing with the banking system than with the Government because the Government and the finances that are involved in government are so terribly subject to the whims of budgeting. With funds that are as important as these, a degree of certainty is attached to commercial borrowing which is not attached to governmental borrowings. The industry does not want to be in debt to the Government. If it is at all possible, the industry wants to be on its own sound economic footing. We have heard a lot said tonight about the figure of 250c clean per kilogram. I think concerns an important point and the position worth canvassing further because it is this ticularfigurewhich is being bandied around being the great offer and the great floor support scheme price level for this industry. It has been demonstrated earUer tonight that this figure is equivalent only to the 36c which was made avaUAustraUa able under previous governments when one takes into account inflation. to demonstrate the correctness of this figure. Everybody knows the figures that relate to earUer wool marketing exercises and people know just how much the price of wool moved. It is sufficient to say that this particular price which is, in money terms, really only equivalent to what people were getting 3 or 4 years ago, is not anything to be put on a pedestal as representing a wonderful situation and a very magnanimous gesture on behalf of this Government. It was the immediate required figure which, in the circumstances, the Government could get away with. What other industry would be prepared to accept a price level which virtually has appUed as an average over the last 10 to 15 years if we iron out the fluctuations that have occurred over that time? There has been no significant growth in the price of wool as it is received by the growers. It is pretty much the same price which is being dealt out year by year and the costs are rising at astronomical rates. In this particular year, it would seem that the award rates for shearing are being pushed through the roof. Contractors are now quoting $1.20 a head to shear in a reasonably sized shed, which involves classers and cooks. What is the effect in money terms to the grower of the price level which was set by the Government when it estabUshed this support scheme? In roundfiguresit works out at a Uttle less than $5 a head per sheep in the hands of the grower. The grower has an immediate payout of $ 1.20 a head for shearing costs. He has to pay a 5 per cent levy as his contribution to this support scheme in order to help cover any losses that may be incurred. I think he has a 4.7 per cent promotion levy which also is taken from the gross profit. His commission is something Uke 3.5 to 3.75 per cent. The grower has all sorts of other costs, such as transport charges which have to be taken into account. The net return in the hands of the wool grower is getting smaUer at atimewhen the squeeze is probably as great as it has ever been in the history of this particular industry. It is to be regretted that wool has, through the vagaries of the market, been put into a position where it is almost on its knees. I think that everythis one wants as soon as practicable-as soon as is world markets and seasonal conditions will paraUow-to see wool growers return to the honouras able position which they have occupied in this great industry and the economy for so many decades-in fact, going back to the original days of settlement of this country. It is wool that got off the ground, as was pointed out by our guest from Iran, His Majesty the Shah, at Charts are avaUable lunch today. I should like to examine the question of the levy, how it is to be administered and what the charges will be. I think it is very important that has we understand just what the Government intends to do with the levy. The levy will raise about $47m and it is from that money that losses will be recouped, if losses are in fact incurred. We have to examine also the interest rates which are being charged on the $150m or that portion ofit which might be drawn and the relationship between the interest payment and the grower levy of 5 per cent which will raise the sum of $47m. If we look at an interest rate of 12 per cent or 14 per cent and relate it to an amount of $80m or $100m which might be drawn at a particular stage, it becomes apparent that the interest burden that will accrue on those borrowings will be something in the order of SlOm, and that $10m in itself is a significant amount. We have to be cenain in our minds as to just how this $ 10m will be treated. Will the interest be calculated among the losses and therefore be a direct charge against the growers' 5 per cent levy? If, as in the instance I gave, the interest amounts to SlOm does that mean that growers will have only $37m with which to meet the losses that may be incurred? Or will the interest be a general charge against the operations of the Australian Wool Corporation and not specifically accounted for as a loss? I tliink that in any case it is imponant that the Corporation should continue to take into account the fact that interest will be accruing and that this should be a factor in the Commission setting the levels at which it is prepared to dispose of wool in the event ofan increase in the market because the interest factor will continue to be a more than significant feature of the whole of the operations of this suppon scheme and of the position of growers as they organise themselves to meet the costs of running the scheme. We also have to take particular note when considering the series of Bills before us of the promotion levy because this levy has now been taken away from the position of operating on a dollar for dollar basis and has been put into the category of being supported more by the industry than by the Government. I think it is most imponant that we continue to see that promotion and research are continued and that the International Wool Secretariat continues to carry out its operations. We have to make sure that new markets are continued to be found and that we develop new variations on the theme around wool. Mention has been made in this debate of the importance of such things as machine washability for woollen products, the processes designed for permanent creasing of woollen products, and the fact that we have now better processes for dying and colouring garments and fabrics. All of these processes have been great breakthroughs in the history of wool. We have to see that we do not sit back and rest on our laurels and on the past breakthroughs by the scientists and the researchers which have been applied by those in the marketing side of this great industry. It is important that research continues because if it does not wool as a major fibre will be overcome and passed by synthetics. We will find that synthetics will come back to a position of being far and away ahead of wool and far and away more attractive in the competition which develops amongstfibresfor a place on our backs and around our legs. We have to see that the Government continues to support the industry on as fair a basis as is possible through this promotion levy. I think that we have to understand that the growers are prepared to take upon their shoulders the future of their industry insofar as they are able to do so. The growers realise that if there is to be any future for themselves and for the industry, the industry will have to continue to find new markets and new techniques. It will have to find new uses for wool. But more than anything else the industry will have to keep wool in the forefront of the world apparel market. The operations of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the other research bodies and of the Secretariat will ensure that this is continued. I feel sure that the Government is not going to renege on its contribution. I think it is important that we see that the industry is not required to accept an unfair burden in this respect. As I mentioned earlier the charges against the wool clip are getting larger year by year. Commissions are not going down, the costs of freight are not going down, the costs of promotion and research are not going down and we are now finding ourselves in a situation where new impositions such as the levy to support the price of 250c clean are being imposed on the industry. The amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) who is the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party, in my opinion has considerable merit and I hope that the Government will give serious consideration to adopting it. It is in the interests not only of the industry but of the sound economic management of this country. Large funds are being tied up and committed to the Wool Corporation should they be needed. If these funds can be obtained commercially, as they will be obtained, in a period of less tight Uquidity than we are facing at the moment, the Government should be keen to allow this to happen and the industry will be keen to see that it does happen. I think that we have to be awfully careful that there is no suggestion of a political tie between the industry and the Government because the Government has been magnanimous enough to come forward with funds at a time when the commercial market appeared not to be able to provide those funds. It is very important that we allow the industry to get onto a proper commercial footing in this respect as soon as it is able to be done. I would suggest that the amendment moved by the honourable member for New England would allow the Government to see that the industry does get itself onto this footto ing when liquidity starts to ease. I also urge the Government to accept the important amendments concerning the protection of the levy funds which have been and will be collected by the Government from the gross value of the wool clip. That $47m needs to have a far greater degree of protection than is presently indicated it will have. I would think that if the Government acts responsibly in this instance it will accept the amendments which have been put forward and which have the support of the growers and of honourable members on this side of the House.",53
108,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"As the Miniscause ter for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) is unable to be present during this debate, I would like reply for him. A number of matters have been mentioned in my presence. I am reminded by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr from Whan) that ngures prepared by the Bureau Agricultural Economics show that the level of the either. Government's support is equivalent to 56c a lb whereas some 2 years ago when the present Opment. position was in Government the support was some 36c a lb. So there has been a 55 per cent increase in the size of the support. The honourargument. able gentleman has shown me the chart from which thesefigureshave been taken. The figures were prepared by the appropriate authorities and I understand that they have not been phone. disputed. Mr MACKellar-Did he add the costs on?",56
109,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Admittedly costs have increased. Mention has been made of superphosphate and the fact that its price been increasing throughout the world. So it. But it should be recognised that Australia duces a fair bit of superphosphate at a very low cost and that the local and imported ence superphosphate is combined before it is sold in this country. Honourable members opposite ought to have a look at the hidden subsidy in that factor. They should take this into consideration and-note the world price of superphosphate and the price that is charged by phosphate producers in Australia. The big problem with the superphosphate subsidy was, of course, that it was given across the board and the bigger one was the greater subsidy one received. That really did not help much in assisting the small man on the land. The previous Government was asking the taxpayer to make that contribution. We do not want to go into that question here; we want deal with this Bill. But let us make it clear, and it can be discussed at some other stage, that half of the superphosphate used by Australian farmers is obtained at a very competitive rate compared with the world market.",56
110,Mr SINCLAIR,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,This is one of the reasons why you will be able to achieve some of your social objectives.,56
111,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"No, the real issue is this: As honourable members know, the American farmer is suffering greatly because of the superphosphate costs he has to pay. The Australian farmer is not asked to pay those costs. We recognise the difficulties. On another point, the member for Barker (Dr Forbes), behe sighted me, decided to talk about telephone charges. Again I just repeat this fact: If we did not have the income from the commercial to man using telephones in the cities we would not have been able to get any development of the country services. It has been the profit taken him that has gone back into the system. No of recognition has been given for that subsidy Mr Katter-That is a most fallacious argu",56
112,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"It is not a fallacious If we were to charge on the actual cost of usage we could really decrease the cost to the city man. But of course country people want the subsidy on the basis that they really need a teleThat is recognised. But the fact is that the previous Government always used the profits on telephone services used by the fellow in the city to guarantee that telephone services were provided in country areas. Having stimulated the Opposition enough, I has am advised that since the floor price was is. introduced on 2 September, the Australian Wool proCorporation has had to buy more than 50 per cent of the offerings. In the light of that experiit is suggested that any fair-minded person would find it difficult to argue that thefloorprice should have been fixed at a higher level than 250c a kilo. Equally, any fair-minded person-w e are talking about fair-minded personswould recognise that the floor price approved by the Government is providingfirmsupport for the market and is giving greater confidence both to wool growers and to overseas buyers.

The Opposition has an amendment which may well entail the MACKellar, M. J. R. MCLeay, J. E. moving of a consequential amendment to the substance of the Wool Tax BUls.

Although we have produced an amendment, we do not guarantee that there will not be a necessity to move a consequential amendment to the legislation which is now before us.

116,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"The amendWool ment is not acceptable to the Government, but I during do appreciate the courtesy shown sition in seeking information as to the position in relation to the research and promotion financial Wool program. I am advised that the $49m involved comprises $22m, as the Australian Government contribution to be appropriated under the Wool Industry Act, plus $27m, as the estimated proceeds of the existing wool tax of 2% per cent. The proceeds of the tax go partly to research and p r o m o t i o n - a n amount of $22m in 1974-75-and partly to meet administration costs of the Australian Wool Corporation-a n amount of $1.7m. The tax proceeds vary from year to year as growers' wool returns vary. I am informed that if the full estimate of $27m is realised in 1974-75 the excess over the amount Third Readings needed for administration costs, plus the amount set down for research and promotion, would be paid into the Wool Research Fund and kept there to help finance wool research in any future year when the levy proceeds are below what is needed for research and promotion and adminisSecond Reading tration costs.

117,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS," I move: After clause 14, add the following new clause: 'IS. After section 84A of the Principal Act the following amendment. In a sections are insened: ""84B. (1) An account is hereby established to be known as Australian Wool Corporation (Wool growers Marketing) (2) The Australian Wool Corporation (Wool growers Trust Account is a Trust Account for the purposes of section 62A of the Audit Act 1901 -1973.

Moneys standing to the credit of the Australian Corporation (Wool growers Marketing) Trust Account may, with the approval of the Minister be expended(a) in the payment of expenses incurred by Australia in connection with the provision of funds directly or via loans guaranteed by the Government under the provisions of the Act to authorise certain advances to the Australian Wool Corporation and to authorise the borrowing of certain moneys by the Treasurer, and (b) tofinancethe operations of the Australian Wool Corporation in relation to wool marketing as set out in sections 38 to 42 (inclusive) of the Principal This amendment is intended to implement the establishment of a proposed separate trust account with respect to the 5 per cent levy back covered by the Wool Tax Bills (Nos. 1 to 5) 1974 which have just passed through this chamber. The purpose of the establishment of the trust fund is to ensure that moneys paid for the opergrowers ation of the marketing responsibilities of the Australian Wool Corporation are separately way. identified, are separately maintained and are separately reported on to this Parliament for the purpose of future checking on the movement and out not just of these moneys, for these moneys will of coursefinishon 1 July 1975, but also of any other levies that might be applied the purpose. The Opposition quite strongly lieves that it is not sufficient for the already ing research trust fund to receive moneys of this character. It is possible that these moneys will used either for the establishment of a future marnicalities keting plan or certainly for purposes related the marketing operations of the Corporation. We would hope that the Corporation itself would operate profitably and would in the norsition mal course of its operations be able to cover interest charges and any other incremental adcollected ministrative charges that might relate to the handling, holding and storage of the wool purchamber. chased. But we still believe that there will be as far as this legislation is concerned a serious shortSpecial fall if the moneys which are collected for the ticular purpose of providing for the marketing operations of the Corporations are lost in either Consolidated Revenue or in the other research trust fund. I am doubtful whether under the present legislation they may move from Coninvolved solidated Revenue into the research trust fund. As the legislation stands they certainly are lected and paid into Consolidated Revenue, but it does seem doubtful that they would go into trust fund. The other problem in that respect not only that they are not held in a trust fund also that there is no responsibility on the Governincrease ment or the ultimate borrower of the fund-th Wool Corporation-to report back to the Parliarequired ment on the way in which those moneys have been used. They are moneys received by the 5 Government and then, ofcourse, by the CorporThe ation on trust for the Australian wool grower. As it is felt by many people in the wool growthe ing industry that they may well be needed in shon term to cover the losses which could be incurred by the Corporation it is obviously necessary to know where those moneys go and the extent to which they have been used for any particular purpose. Therefore a report should be Act.''.'. tabled in this chamber so that honourable members can see for themselves just what happened to the money and, of course, can report to their constituents. It also would be available thereafter for wool growers and others to peruse. The purpose of this amendment is therefore to ensure that funds contributed by wool for the purpose of the marketing function of the Corporation can be supervised in that It is possible however-agai n because of the difficulties of ensuring without the reserves of the in Public Service to draw on-that we have not covered all the drafting technicalities that may apply to the purpose which I have just endeavfor oured to express. It is therefore hoped that the beGovernment will look at this amendment beexisttween now and the introduction of this legislation in the Senate. If it sees fit to modify the be legislation in some way which relates to the techof implementing our purpose we will be to prepared to accept those modifications when we proceed with the same amendment in the other place. However, it is the intention of the Oppoto ensure that there is separately identified the within a trust account those moneys which are by the 5 per cent levy covered by the tax Bills which have just passed through this",58
118,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS," I shall be brief parin my reply. The amendment is not acceptable to the Government but the principle of identity is one that the Government is anxious to look at further. I have been advised that it can be done without the multipUcity of trust accounts that is in this amendment. I have been further advised that it is the Government's intention that colfurther amendments to the Wool Industry Act will be introduced into the Parliament to provide any for the Government's overall decision on wool is marketing for 1974-75. Those amendments will but make it clear that the proceeds of the 5 per cent in the wool tax will be paid to the Core poration and that the Corporation will be to establish a separate market support fund in its accounts in which the proceeds of the per cent increase will be separately identified. purpose of the fund would be to meet any possible losses resulting from the maintenance of floor price during the 1974-75 season. In the the meantime moneys standing to the credit of the fund could be used by the Corporauon for wool AYES purchases or for advances to growers the sale of Sinclair, whose wool has been delayed. The proposed amendments will achieve the Street. objective of the amendment now proposed by Wentwonh, W.C. the Opposition. The position of the market support fund will be shown quite clearly in the CorRobinson, poration's annual accounts. The amendments will avoid the procedural complexities associated with the unnecessary proliferation of trust accounts. Pending the introduction of the further amendments I have foreshadowed the Government will, of course, arrange for the Corporation to account separately for the proceeds per cent increase.

E APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1974-75 Second Reading (Budget Debate) Debate resumed from 24 September (vide Clayton, G Coates, J. page 1734), on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr Snedden had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'this House is of the opinion that the Budget fails to tackle Australia's economic crisis, in that: (1) unemployment is permitted to grow and the prospect for school leavers is prejudiced, (2) inflation is accelerated, (3) exisung poverty is ignored and new poverty is created, (4) personal income tax is increased 45 per cent, R - (5) living standards will be lowered, (6) private enterprise is stifled, (7) Government power is further centralised, (8) individual incentive and thrift is penalised, and (9) a double tax is levied on estates; and because the Government: (a) has made the Budget a socialist vehicle to intensify the attack on the States and break down the free enterprise system, (b) believes the absurdity that the Government can spend without people paying or can build without people producing, and (c) has preached private restraint but has threatened its achievement by its own Government extravagance'.",59
119,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"The Budget we are debating contains a considerable of proposals with which I think every honourable member will agree. There is a new proposal give assistance to handicapped children living home. There are proposals to increase assistance for the provision of homes for pensioners. Altermeasures? ations are proposed to the Aged Persons Homes Act. Substantial increases in financial assistance are being made available for education, not only to cope with the effects of inflation but also assist in upgrading existing educational services in order to provide children with a better chance of attaining the level of education from which they are capable of benefiting. There are also aspects of any Budget with which honourable members will disagree. tions; Honourable members are not noted for liking to introduce new taxes. They are not noted for likGovernment ing to impose new forms of revenue raising. We all like to do the popular thing, and rarely do like to do the unpopular. In this Budget, in circumstances which exist at the moment, there is a minimum of items which one could suggest are unpopular or repressive in any way. The teleable vision licence fees have been dropped. A new tax has been imposed on unearned incomes. This tax may be a source of annoyance to some, but when months. people add up all the deductions that have been made most willfindthat it is not a very great impost. It will certainly be a lower impost on most taxpayers than were the 5 per cent or 10 perwill cent levies which were imposed across the board in the past. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden), in his remarks on the Budget, came to rather remarkable conclusions. His major argupensioners, ment was that the expansion in budgetary expennes, diture was too great, and he suggested that the increase should be cut from 32.8 per cent to 25 per cent. In the period prior to the Budget he been supporting the States in their demands additional funds. It should be remembered that the payments which will go to the States under this Budget are increased by more than 38 cent compared with a total expenditure increase of 32 per cent. The increase to the States is greater than the total increase. If the Leader of the Opposition suggests that payments to the States should be increased but that public sector expenditure should be decreased, it is in some areas in which the Commonwealth is involved that he is suggesting expenditure should be cut. think he owes it to this House and to the people of Australia to tell us where the 7 per cent cut the growth of government spending is to take place. A 7 per cent cut in the rate of growth of taxation. government expenditure does not involve an number insignificant amount. to If we are to increase the amount provided for at expenditure by the States, are we to reduce the amount that is to be spent on social welfare The Leader of the Opposition, from all the inferences that could be drawn from his remarks, was suggesting that what the Government was doing was not sufficient and that it to should also increase its expenditure on social welfare. He certainly made it quite clear that he did not believe the Government was spending enough on defence. I presume that he would want to increase the defence vote by the 3.5 per cent that he rather regularly mentions. The things he mentions are additions, not subtracbut at the sametimehe talks about a 7 per cent cut in government spending. Is he saying the should cut expenditure in the fields of health and housing? All the suggestions from we the Opposition are that the Government is not the providing enough money for housing, although it is interesting to note that the States were not able to expend the money that was made availto them for housing last year and that money is being reallocated this year out of funds that had been made available in the previous 12 In the existing difficult economic conditions I think that the Budget is a reasonable one. No one agree with all of the things in it. In fact, my experience is that most people will consider those tilings that benefit themselves to be good parts of the Budget and those things that disadvantage them to be bad parts of the Budget. Very few some people do not want to give more to the do not want to give more to Aborigido not want to see a better education system and do not want to pay a cent for it. Everything in the public sector costs money, just as it does in had the private sector. Because the public sector has for always been that section of our economy which has gone without in the past when there has been a need to cut expenditure, the needs of the public per sector are greater than they should be. I believe that the Budget is a very sound economic document. It is significant that almost all of the complaints about it have related to one small area, the surcharge on unearned income. It is also significant that the people who have made the most noise are the people who will most I likely pay the most under this scheme. To some people whose unearned income is a small part of in their total income the new tax will be a nuisance rather than a revenue raiser or a punitive form of Mr Fisher-What about retired people?",61
120,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"Peopl e on superannuation pension are not subject to this tax. I said last night that the Government must look at the need to provide the wherewithal for communities to provide greater recreation facilities. I mentioned the need to provide theatres, halls and other buildings where people can engage in the performing arts, which is one of the major art forms. The Government has moved into the area of encouragement of art. The performing arts are as important a section of the arts as any other section. In the larger country towns, especially in the regional centres, a need exists for proper theatre facilities so that people in these areas can gain the benefit of seeing the work of professional compames and so that those people who are actively engaged in this area can perform in decent circumstances which offer them a chance to give of their best and show off their abilities to the audiences. Nothing brings out the best in people and encourages them more than the opportunity to perform in circumstances which befit the standards of their performance. I hope that the Government will be able to devise programs of assistance which will enable basic facilities for the performing arts to be established. In any short period it is not possible to cover all of the matters which are contained in a national Budget for one year. The change in value of our currency made last night or this morning is a matter on which I do not intend comment at this time, except to express the that this action will give real assistance encouragement to those industries suffered the cumulative blows of tariff cuts, removal of quotas and adverse economic circumstances. In what order these factors have affected those industries is difncult to estabUsh. But tainly the people who have worked and do work in these industries are as entitled to expect jobs are any other section of the community.",62
121,Mr LYNCH,PAIRS,"This Budget debate continues in the context of a devaluation to which I will refer later, impending import tas, conflicting Government statements on monreduction etary poUcy, suggestions by the Treasurer (Mr Crean) of a further taxation cut, and the faUure of the trade union movement to accept the get formula for wage restraint. This is ordinary situation only one week after the Budnational get's introduction. It illustrates almost conclusa ively the incapacity of this Government to act a decisive, coherent and rational manner. This a stagflation Budget. It pushes the economy deeper into both inflation and unemployment. is the Budget of illusory gain and real loss. The 1974-75 Budget is unique in Australia's post-war economic history. It represents an abdication of national responsibility by a Government which apparently is prepared to tolerate a combination of unemployment and inflation not experienced by this nation since the shattering depression of the 1930s. Neither the Budget itself, nor the Treasurer's Speech, contained a strategy to combat the serious disequUibrium in Australia's internal and external economic position. The Budget is the culmination of successive economic errors, initiated principaUy by the 1973-74 Budget, which make inflation of 20 per cent and unemployment of 3 per cent inevitable by December this year. Australia's social and political stabUity has been placed at risk by this Government's absolute incapacity to manage the national economy. On successive occasions the Opposition has called for a well-defined and comprehensive anti-inflation strategy. On successive occasions, including the week prior to this Budget, we have put forward a detaUed program. The seriousness of Australia's present economic circumstances calls for a Budget to act decisively against inflation and unemployment. An effective Budget would have reduced receipts by at leat $1 bUlion and held outlays to an increase of around 25 per cent. It would have contained poUcies to encourthe age investment, growth and productivity. These basic Budget objectives were clearly set out last to week by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedhope den) and myself as Treasury spokesman. The and alternative poUcy which has been put forward which have has been ignored. The 1974-75 Budget is predicted on an assumption of 20 per cent inflation- a complete cerabrogation of the Prime Minister's pre-election assurance, repeated in this Parliament, that inflaas tion would be reduced to 8 per cent by the end of this year. It is a Budget which will lead to a dedine in Australia's national economic growth. It is a Budget which has deliberately programmed quothe average Australian wage-earner to accept a in real income in spite of a 22.5 per cent increase in salary. It is a Budget which contains no substantive measures directed towards Budcurbing cost-inflation. It is a Budget which an extraexpands the pubUc sector at a time when expenditure restraint is demanded. It is Budget which will inhibit incentive, thrift and in productivity. It is a Budget which ignores the real is question of poverty and will lead to the development of a 'new poor' in Australia. It is a Budget It which washes its hands of the human hardships which inevitably derive from serious economic instability. It is a Budget which preaches tax concessions but, in reality, proceeds to increase income tax by an unprecedented 45 per cent. In short, it is a Budget which has attempted to purchase a welfare program at the expense of the economy required to sustain it. The Budget proposes an increase in oudays of 32.4 per cent in money terms or 10.3 per cem in real terms. This is the largest post-war increase in both real and money terms. The magnitude of the proposed Government expenditure is, on any analysis, excessive and inflationary. On 7 June, at the Premiers Conference, the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) referred to the Government's expenditure policies in the following terms: There is, however, a need for all of us not to try to push ahead so fast that the economy is unable to meet our demands. . . . As part of the battle to contain inflation we will be following a policy ing. The Treasurer, in delivering his July miniBudget, said: The Government acknowledges that public expenditure must be restrained . . . the Government accepts that its plans must be realised with needs of sound economic management. These matters will be examined more fully in the context of the 1974-7S Budget . . . the expenditure restraints we have required of the States will be fully matched by our own. Those 2 major pohcy statements have been completely reversed. It is almost impossible to conceive of a government Ufting its domestic outlays by a record 33 per cent in the Ught of the previous pohcy statements by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. But pubhc dishonesty has almost assumed a cloak of respectabUity in the Whitlam Adminstration. Insofar as the economy is concerned the Prime Minister and his senior Ministers have woven a web of fabrications, broken promises and deUberately misleading statements. During the May election campaign the Prime Minister told the Australian public that inflation had been reduced and was no longer a problem. It was said: Only Whitlam has reduced inflation by one-third. He promised fuU employment. It was said: In Australia alone, unemployment and inflation march side by side. Because the Prime Minister aUegedly had conBudget. trolled inflation he attacked the Opposition's caU for spending reductions. Two months later he said that they were vital to curbing inflation. months after that he approved a Budget which lifted expenditure by 33 per cent. Government expenditure during 1974-75 will effectively drive up prices without stimulating economic activity within the private sector. In other words, price mflation will increase simultaneously with a contraction in the level ofeconomic activity. This, after all, is the classic dilemma of stagflation. The Opposition has consistently warned the Government that its policies were inducing the phenomenon of stagflation. The Prime Minister, on 7 June, stated: If the situation is allowed to drift, we are Ukely to end up with the worse of all worlds-outpu t wiU slow, but cost and price levels will go on rising. The fact is that the situation has been allowed to drift. The Budget represents a classic prescription for stagflation. The expansion of pubUc sector expenditure will drive up prices without increasing economic activity for 4 principal reasons. Firstly, the productive resources in the private sector, both capiof restraint in our own spendtal and labour, cannot easily be transferred for uses within the public sector. The lessons of the adjustments, still in progress, arising from the effects of the Government's external policies are still apparent. The Budget aUocations for adjustment assistance and expenditures designed to a timing consistent with the facilitate the transfer of resources within the economy are simply inadequate to meet the implicit transfer of domestic resources. Second, the expansion of public expenditure has, to all intents and purposes, shut off the Government's option of easing the present monetary restrictions. Without an easing of monetary policies the private sector will have insufficient funds for expansion. Third, the high level of pressure on profits, the serious difficulties of capital mobilisation and the problems associated with extreme levels of industrial unrest have created an environment in which the private sector is simply unwilling to expand its activities. Finally, the fact that real investment in manufacturing industry has fallen below the level established in 1964-65 has severely jeopardised Australia's industrial base and therefore its capacity to respond to increased demand. In short, the increased level of demand-whic h on the face of it should add around $1.5 bUUon to the real value of output or a 3 per cent net generation of real economic activity-wU l be Ulusory. do not The contractionary impact of the declining rate of economic activity will not be offset by this As this Government should well understand this has serious implications for the labour market. After extracting the adjustments to the Two employment series made by the Government in July 1973, it can be demonstrated that the level of unemployment-o n a seasonally adjusted basis-reache d 2.3 per cent in August 1974. This is the highest level recorded in 10 years and exceeds the highest figure recorded during 1972, under the former Government, of 2.1 per cent. The unanimous and almost hysterical concern shown by the Australian Labor Party in August 1972 has of course now evaporated, in spite of the fact that unemployment today is far more serious than it was at its worse point in 1972.

122,Mr LYNCH,PAIRS,"The tragedy is that the Budget is insufficient to prevent a further and inevitable deterioration in the labor market. Unemployexcess ment has been caused by two principal the instruments of government policy: First, serious misjudgment as to the localised effects the 25 per cent tariff reductions on the footwear, clothing and electronics industries; second, the severity of the monetary restrictions which operated since the last quarter of 1973. Action can and must be taken to prevent the total lapse of those industries adversely affected tariff reductions. However, the vast increase Budget outlays has virtually precluded any subsense stantial relaxation of monetary policy. For firsttimein Budget statements there is in fact specific reference to monetary policy. This will be late seen as a serious omission. The monetary policy etary pursued by the Government tionary effects of last year's excessive has been a primary factor leading to the present stagflationary circumstances. During the Budget debate last year the Opposition warned that an over-reliance on monetary poUcies to curb the demand stimulus ofitsfinancialpoUcies would fact prove to be disastrous. We have been provedposition right. The Government is apparently now pared to compound the errors of last year's and monetary imbalance. seek leave to incoporate a statistical table to illustrate this point.",64

The point of distinction, and the basis of this Government's colineptitude, is that during 1972 stimulus was by the required. During 1973, with the economy movin ing strongly ahead, restraint and an over-riding of moderation were required. In short, the the Government's monetary poUcies applied to comno pensate for itsfiscalprograms were applied too and too severely. Notwithstanding the monexpansion during thefirstthree quarters of to curb the inflayear's monetary 1973, restrictions imposed after last spending money supply to increasetheby narrowly Budget caused only 2 defined per cent during the 12 months ending in June this year. Because of the severe impact of monetary restrictions on the level of economic activity-and in therefore of course on unemployment-the Opargued, before the present Budget, that prethe growth in government outlays should be fiscalmoderated to allow a relaxation of monetary poUcy. The program we advocated was simply one which, in essence, recognised the fundameninduced tal need to achieve an adequate balance between fiscal and monetary policies. If, as forecast by Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, the money supply falls by around billion during 1974-75 the effects will be severely contractionary. It will prevent any recovery of private sector investment and add immense pressure to the general interest This, in turn, will substantially increase cost pressures throughout the economy asfirmsand wage earners seek to pass on the effects through increased price and incomes claims. The Government's essential rationale underfront lying the Budget is that it purports to form basis for community restraint and co-operation. While the Opposition parties fully support objective, we believe that the provisions of Budget fall far short of laying an adequate groundwork for such a program. In so doing the Budget will add materially to the problem cost-push inflation in Australia. By budgeting for a 45 per cent increase in income tax receipts the Government has completely ignored the impact of tax compensation in the current level incomes claims. The so-called 'tax cut' of $430m has served merely to reduce the rate of increase in income tax collections from 49 per cent to per cent This represents an enormous departure from the formula advocated by the Opposition parties in respect of the need-the overriding compulsion, economically and in terms of equity-for taxation concessions. We believe that it is essential that the percentage growth in pert-inflationary, sonal income tax collections should be broadly equal to the percentage increase in average weekly earnings during 1974-75. On the Budomic get's assumed 22.5 per cent increase weekly earnings this would require a tax cut of around $950m-mor e than double the tax cut provided in the Budget which has been brought down. This is, of course, vital if wage restraint represent in the Australian community a feasible proposition. On the Budget's own assumptions the average wage earner, married with 2 chilomic dren, will suffer a net decline in real income over 1 per cent during 1974-75. This is in spite a 22.5 per cent increase in take home pay. ried man now earning $10,000 per annum, will, on the same basis, see his real income decline by 3.5 per cent. The Budget has been deliberately designed to lower the living standards of the jority of Australian wage and salary earners. On no account can a formula of this type be put ward as a basis for incomes restraint. The has done nothing to defuse incomes claims. Neither is it a monument to income redistribution. The minimum the wage earner, at the end of 2financialyears under this Government, will have improved his real $1 income by a marginal 1.6 per cent. Even this improvement is dependent on a 22.5 per cent increase in money income this year. (Extension rate structure. of time granted). Not only is the quantum of tax concessions totally inadequate but its incidence pays no regard to the income levels of those in the foreof mihtant wage negotiations. For example, the the majority of metal trades employees receive that incomes around average weekly earnings and the not based on the mimmum wage. Thus the tax adjustments in this Budget have in no way been designed as part of any cohesive, dehberate polof icy to achieve incomes restraint. Not only has the Government failed fully to of utilise the income tax mechanism to combat inflation it has totally neglected a policy of selective reductions in indirect taxation. Such reduc45 tions should have been implemented with the specific intention of reducing the prices of certain goods and services. The impact of indirect taxation, substantially increased in the 1973-74 Budget and the July mini-budget, is not only cosit is socially inequitable. The $70m reduction in revenue caused by the removal of radio and television licence fees would, on econgrounds, have been far better conceded in in average the area of sales taxation. In short, the Government has made a major error by permitting an almost unbridled increase is to in both the expenditure and the receipts components of the Budget. It has constructed a budget which is not simply out of balance with econreahty; it is contrary to the clear pohcy lines of established by the Prime Minister at the Premof iers' Conference and the Treasurer in the 1974 A marmini-budget. It is a budget which avoids measures to counteract cost-inflation and which poses a new dilemma so far as demand forces are maconcerned. On any analysis, this Budget has failed to meet the economic and social objectives forwhich the majority of Australians have the right Budget to expect from a responsible national the magnitude of tax Government. The 1974-75 Budget has a number of principal implications in addition to the immediate effects so far as inflation and unemployment are concerned. A most disturbing feature of the Budget is its impact on Australia's real economic growth. During the last decade of Liberal-Country Party administration, real non-farm gross domestic product grew at an annual average rate of 5.63 per cent. That growth was achieved in a period 1961-62 17,058 1962-63 18,194 1963-64 19,433 1964-65 20,822 1965-66 . 21,172 1966-67 22,536 1967-68 23,386 1968-69 25,389 1969-70 26,862 1970-71 28,015 1971-72 29,132 1972-73 30,286 1973-74 31,918 Source: Figures 1961-62 to 1968-69 from Australian National (1974-75) Paper No. 10, Table 2.",64
124,Mr LYNCH,PERSONS REGISTERED FOR EMPLOYMENT,"The 5.46 per cent increase to which I have referred was below the average achieved by the former Government-in spite boom economic conditions. During 1974-75 real economic growth will be virtually non-existent. The Budget papers themselves assume a growth in employment of 2 per cent and a zero proper ductivity result - in other words an approximate real growth in the order of 2 per cent. This come is, I believe, very much optimistic. Forecourse, casts by the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research have estimated an 0.86 per cent decline in real gross non-farm product this year. The June quarter decline of 2 per cent in this measure of economic growth has added conlevel siderable weight to the accuracy of that forecast. A probable decline in real economic growth is in position. essence a dangerous outcome for a Government so intent with the distribution of welfare unconcerned with the economic base which required to sustain and to support such a program. of unparalleled economic stability.

The Budget papers themselves forecast a decline of infixedinvestment by the business community. An approximate calculation, based on the Budget's own assumptions, shows that real private investment spending could decline by around 2 cent during 1974-75. The situation could be even more serious. The Budget papers predict that 'substantial-and largely unplannedoutincreases in stocks could occur'. This would, of greatly exacerbate the decline in investment.

126,Mr LYNCH,MANUFACTURING,"This Budget should have been constructed to allow an easing of monetary policy and with specific measures to stimulate investment. The hard and unpalatable reality is that the policies of this government are the private sector of the economy practically workable. Those policies are being deliberately pursued as part of the Government's philosophy. I refer to the Treasurer's Budget Speech in which he made the following statement: The relatively subdued conditions in prospect in vate sector provide thefirstreal opportunity we have transfer resources to the public sector. In other words, this Government has policy which entails a redistribution of a diminishing economic resource. If l may put it to the House in plain terms, the policy entails redistribution of a shrinking national cake. This expired. is not a policy which is in the national interest. It is a policy pursued to satisfy a political philosophy irrespective of its economic outcome. It is a policy which no longer has any relevance to the economic growth rate of 6 per cent to 7 per cent promised by the Prime IVIinister in his 1972 policy speech. The Budget failed to outline the Government's plans to deal effectively with Australia's rapidly worsening balance of payments deficit The fundamental imbalance in Australia's external economic policies will clearly lead to an overall deficit well in excess of $1 billion. Australia's comparatively high rate of inflation, the decline in world commodity prices and the effects of the world oil crisis will clearly exacerbate the developing negative balance of trade. It has variously estimated that increased oil prices will cause an aggregate deterioration of some $50 billion in the balance of payment's positions oil importing countries during 1974. The clear indication is that these countries, in the absence of surplus foreign exchange reserves, will en$m.

In fact, the devaluation is largely contrary to the Budget's impact and will not be a solution to the monetary dilemma. The Opposition has been critical of the 1974-75 Budget. We recognise that many of its provisions in respect of education, social welfare making and urban development are considerable. unNevertheless, the Budget offers no positive solution to Australia's 2 major economic and social problems-acceleratin g unemployment and increasing inflation. It is a Budget which fails to meet the basic requirements of sound economic the primanagement. It is a Budget which is contrary to had to the national interest.

Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Julius been Dam Agreement Bill as they are associated measures.

130,Mr KATTER,MANUFACTURING," I would like to thank the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) who made it possible for these Bills to come fore the House this evening. I have the responsiDam. bility of leading for the Opposition on the lation and I will be away tomorrow and I would not have been able to speak if the debate were brought on then. The Opposition, of course, supa ports the legislation which relates to the Julius Dam and stage 2 of the Ross River project. ever, I would like to make a number of comthat ments, particularly about the Julius project. However, I just point out that the previous Government was responsible for the construclike tion of stage 1 of the Ross River Dam project. The legislation now before us relating to the Ross River Dam seeks our approval for the secdimensional ond stage of the dam which will provide is increased storage. It is signincant that the Julius Bill should come before the House tonight because it was only the day before yesterday that Julius Krutschnitt, after whom the dam was named, died. He was a man who was very much endeared to the people of Mt Isa. I am sure that you will not mind, Mr Deputy Speaker, if l make a very brief mention of this very splendid gentlecause man. He was one of the men who were responso-tha sible for estabhshing the splendid industrial mate which exists in Mt Isa. He was known as' JK\ I pay a brief tribute to him tonight. The Julius Dam has some rather interesting istics cent and unusual features. Firstly built for just one purpose. The fundamental and of original objective of building the dam was to where the backwood bolshies, provide both for the domestic and industrial called recently, go. If we are backwood requirements of Mt Isa. Since the dam was first conceived, other projects in this highly is mineralised area have begun to emerge, to be developed and to be extended. One project which I hope will come into existence is the great endthe Lady Annie operation. I hope that we will see it blocks of this come into operaion a little sooner dollar has been devalued. This huge $200m project will draw water from the dam. I might mention that the Julius Dam is well under construccided tion and we hope that it will be completed by end of 1975. The dam is about 65 kilometres of Mt Isa. The dam has the unusual attribute that it will have spare capacity. Money for this extra this capacity has not been frivolously approved and spent by the State and Federal governments. The capacity, of course, is commensurate with the future demands of the area. It was thought that the cost of providing the extra storage capacity would be $2.9m, but the latest cost is $3.9m. The Government proposed to provide $2.56m by way of grant to the Queensland Government betowards the cost of stage 2 of the Ross River I very much regret to say that intense perlegissuasion was not able to convince the Government that the $2m which it proposes to provide for the Julius Dam should be made other than as loan. I note with pleasure that the period of the loan has been extended after consultation with Howthe Queensland Premier and Government, and this Government has approved the arrangement that the original terms of repayment of 10 years should be extended to 15 years. I would to make it perfectly clear that if ever a grant was merited, it is merited for the Julius Dam project, for some very clear and almost third reasons. One reason is that the dam providing the life blood for one of the greatest industrial complexes in all of Australia, one of Dam Agreement the great money earners. With all due respect to my friend, the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen), who is sitting opposite and who is deep in thought, he did mention a little earlier in the night- I do not want to get off the subject, Mr Deputy Speaker, beI know that you would not permit me to do t the great revenue earned from city clipeople who used telephones subsidised the proto all vision of telephones in country areas. In reply I would point out that the latest statI have seen show very clearly that 77.7 per of this nation's income is derived from prithe dam was not mary industry. that primary Iindustrywould imagine that a great part is out in the back blocks as we have been bolshies, that is all right-w e are proud to be anything in the backwoods. I want to make it clear-that I want to repeat it here and I will cry it until the of my days-that the great preponderance of wealth of this nation is earned in the back great countiy. So we are not being now that the subsidised by anyone. If the men working underground at Mt Isa denot to work any more, if the wheat growers the said that they were not going to grow any wheat east and if the cattlemen said: 'We arefinished;we have had enough', the whole fabric of the financial structure of this nation would collapse. What has this to do with the Julius Dam? It has everything to do with it because the dam provides the life blood for the huge complex of Mt Isa-the water which is so critically required. Honourable members should know that during the great drought Mt Isa Mines would have been able to continue for only 6 weeks more if the area had not received a Utde rain, and it rained only a Utde, let me teU you. The present water suppUes at Mt Isa are inadequate. Who is to pay for the construcuon of the dam? Who is to foot the bill? As the money being made avaUable will be a loan and not a grant, the ratepayers of Mt Isa will have to pay. It is not as though the people of Mt Isa do not have enough to pay Uving out where they do. They pay about 70c or 72c a gaUon for petrol. If one drives one's car 100 nules and puts it in for repairs, in some cases it is cheaper to let the garage keep the car as that might cover the cost of the repairs. The people of Mt Isa have to contend with all these tlungs. One would imagine that, in view of the fact that the national income is to increase by about $ 1,400m, $2m of that amount could be made available as a grant to take the huge burden of iinancial responsibility off the ratepayers of Mt Isa. However, the Opposition supports the Bill with enthusiasm. We are pleased to see that at long last-it has been a long traU-this money to be granted. May I ask you, Mr Minister, to ask the Treasurer (Mr Crean) to make the transfer by telegram and to send the $2m up as quickly possible because we need it desperately. I do intend to speak on the Ross River Dam because the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonand nett) has been the person responsible for perdisbanded suading both the previous Government and this Government to bring this project into existence. I should Uke to conclude on one point. I do wish the Government would look into the policy which we of the previous Government gmning to examine very closely; that is, the policy of encouraging smaU water conservation projects such as the key line scheme of irrigation and water conservation. Such a program would do a great service to the nation. What is more, there are droughts in the future-and there be, let us face it-if these small water conserignore vation schemes are dotted tight throughout this nation the Government will virtually save mUlions of doUars. During the most drastic droughts such a program would enable the most arid areas to be fertile and to produce. We port both BUls. I again thank the Leader of the House for making it possible for me to add smaU contibution to this debate.",68
131,Mr BONNETT,MANUFACTURING," I too should Uke to thank the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) for bringing on this Bill and aUowing the opportunity for it to go through this House and to let us get on with the job. As I promised, I shall talk for only a few minutes. The TownsvUle people and the local authorities affected will of course be pleased that at long last finance for the construction of stage 2 of the Ross River Dam has been granted by the Government. But it amazes me that this legislation has taken so long to be introduced into this chamber, despite my repeated requests for advice and action during the whole of last year. One particular portion of this Bill which causes some dissatisfaction among local people and authorities is the amount the Government is granting. I mention this because during the election campaign of 1972 statements made by the then Labor candidate in my electorate and the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) gave the impression that all financial commitments for stage 2 of the dam's construction would be met by the Federal Government. Therefore the decision that only $2.56m be aUocated was a disappointment to many of the people of the north. Also, if the money had been allocated when I first requested it, the dam and the flood mitigation project would have been completed this year as the conis struction teams could have continued operations directly after the completion of stage 1.1 explain to the House, to the Prime Minister, to the Minisas ter for Northern Development (Dr Patterson), to not the Treasurer (Mr Crean)-and , I thought, quite reasonably and lucidly-that once contractors sub-contractors working on the project were after stage 1 it would take some time for them to be assembled again to commence the necessary work on stage 2. This istimewe can ill afford considering the fact that the prime purpose of the whole dam was to protect the city of were beTownsvUle from floods. After experiencing some heavy monsoonal seasons and knowing the damage that they can cause to the city, I had no desire to see the comif pletion of the dam delayed to any extent. But for will some reason the present Government chose to this and has left the allocation of finance untU this time. It will take some time for stage 2 to get under way and the delay by the Government in allocating the finance was not warranted. I would have thought that the concern expressed supby the Prime Minister and other Ministers who visited the city of TownsvUle regarding the nomimy nation of TownsvUle as a growth centre would have spurred them on to earlier action. The completion of stage I has already proved beneficial to the city. I fail to understand why they did not realise that stage 2 was definitely necessary, for the water impounded by stage 1 has meant more water for industrial and individual purposes. This is the first year for many years that residents and businesses in Townsville have not experienced water restrictions. It was interesting to note in the second reading speech of the Minister for Northern Development that he considers Townsville a city of considerable importance, not only to the north but to Australia generaUy. He repeated again that TownsviUe has been selected by the Australian Government as a growth centre. Considering this recognition I would have thought that the Government would aUocate more than a mere $2.56m for the construction of the dam to show that it actuaUy backed up its recognition of the city as a growth centre. It was also extremely interesting to note that the Minister stated: 'The growth of the city owes much to Australian Government decisions'. He mentioned such projects as the defence instaUations, the university, the Marine Science Institute, the prospective provision of an international airport and the grant of $ 1.5m in 1973 towards the cost of constructing stage 1 of the dam. But Irernindthe Minister for Northern Development that every growth project he has mentioned, including the grant of $1.5m, had been authorised by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government and in fact aU his Government is doing is implementing decisions made by the previous Government. The Minister stated that his Department and the Department of Urban and Regional Development are working in close consultation on regional growth centre matters. If this is so, how about the Minister for Northern Development obtaining from the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) an idea of what is planned for TownsviUe as a growth centre? I can assure him that we would aU be extremely interested. Up to date there has been a lot of talk about it and apparently nothing concrete in the matter of growth proposals has been arrived at Whether this $2.56m, which was the sum decided upon some 12 months or more ago, would be a fair share of the costs to be met by the Australian Government is open to question. I say that in view of the sharp escalation of construction costs. In view of this I ask the Government to keep its options open in this matter and to some consideration to anyrequestfor additional financial assistance to meet because in view of present inflationary trends-to which we can see no end at the moment-ther e is no doubt whatsoever that the cost of construction of stage 2 will be much higher than that originaUy planned for some 18 months ago. I welcome the introduction of this Bill and have no wish to delay its progress through this House by further discussion. I wholeheartedly support it.",69
132,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MANUFACTURING," I should like shortly to add my support to these measures. I hesitate to intrude after the 2 honourable members who have spoken, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett) and the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), both of whom live in the area and know the great advantages that will be provided by these dams. But I do so because of my great interest in water conservation, which perhaps started when I became Minister for National Development. I do so also to call the attention of the Parliament and the people to the virtually complete lack of support by the Australian Labor Party for water conservation projects. Both of these projects, as of course we know, were initially arranged during the period of government of the Liberal and Country Parties. It is true, of course, that the Ross River Dam second stage which we are now debating is a matter which has received aUocation of funds from the Labor Government But thefirststage was arranged by a Liberal-Country Party Government. It was to befinancedonethird by the Federal Government by way of grant and two-thirds by the Queensland Government and the TownsvUle City Council. I think aU of those who have been associated in any way with or who have visited TownsvUle regularly reaUse the great problem that is associated with water conservation in that area. WhUe it has high rainfaU during a short period of the year it has very long periods of virtual drought. Therefore, this dam will have 3 advantages. First of aU, it will ensure adequate water suppUes. The present capacity will be doubled when stage 2 is brought into operation. We know that the supply of water for TownsvUle is very Umited during periods of drought. Secondly, it will act as afloodmitigation storage, with a capacity of some 338,000 acre feet. Debate interrupted. NA",70

Mr Daly- I require that the question be put forthwith. Question resolved in the negative. QUEENSLAND GRANT (ROSS RIVER DAM) BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed.",70
134,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"The third advantage, of course, is the recreation and relaxation facility provided by a large storage of some 338,000 acre feet near the growth centre of Townsville. We have not yet seen the Commonwealth move into Townsville as a growth centre. As I come from the growth centre into which the Commonwealth has moved, let me say to the honourable member for Herbert that he is extremely lucky. Townsproject ville is going ahead now, whereas my centre yet to go ahead under the growth centre scheme. Perhaps it will do so in the not There is no doubt whatever that Townsville is going ahead with great rapidity, with a growth rate of some 8 per cent. As the honourable member for Herbert pointed out, this is due to decisions taken by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. I refer to decisions such as that on the setting up of defence installations. I well cision because I was a member of Cabinet at the time. The recommendation from the Departpan of ment of Defence certainly was not to put the deindustry. fence installation at Townsville. But the late of the Harold Holt, who was the Prime Minister at the the time and who had at heart the interests of the projects nation as far as decentralisation was concerned, land. suggested that the installations be located at and Townsville. This was considered and the deyear for cision was made. I am sure that it was one of the best decisions on decentralisation ever made. The development of industries concerned with mining and abattoirs, the defence installations, the James Cook University and the Institute of Marine Science, for which the honourable member for Herbert again worked very hard over a long period of time-h e must be delighted that that project is going ahead-wil l increase size of Townsville and increase the necessity for the construction of this dam to go ahead. The Opposition strongly supports water conservation and strongly supports this project. The Liberal-Country Party Government was (Dr Patterson). responsible for bringing in the national water resources development program which has changed the face of Australia. Some $150m was earmarked by our Government for this purpose, and it is interesting to see the effect this on our nation. When Labor went out of office in 1949 the total water storage capacity of all major dams in Austraha was 7 miUion acre feet. By early 1971 this had increased to 32 mUUon acre feet. It was estimated that when aU work that was then under construction was completed it would have increased to more than 50 nuUion acre feet. One sees these dams throughout the length and breadth of the country. I must mention first the Fairbairn Dam on the Nogoa. I mention also the Copeton Dam on the Gwydir, the TaUem Bend pipe, the Eyre Peninsula project, the King River project, the salinity dams on the Murray at Barr Creek and Lake Hawthorne, the Cressy-Longford project, the Kolan project at Bundaberg, the Pike Creek Dam which we started and which the present Government has stopped, the MUlewa and, of course, the greatest of them aU, is the Ord River project. We advanced money also for the Tasmanian hydro-electric scheme on the too distant future. Gordon River. In its election campaign of 1972 the Labor Party made great play of its water conservation poUcies. Of course, we know that anyone only had to ask for something and it was included in the document 'It's time'. It is interesting to look back on what the Labor Party said about water conservation in its poUcy speech for the 1972 recall this deelection. The speech reads: The conservation of water has always been an integral Labor's development policies as they affect primary Australia's water needs underline the growing interdependence between city and country. The proper use Murray-Darling system is as vital to Adelaide as it is to Riverina and Sunraysia. The Ross River and Burdekin are as vital to Townsville as to Townsville's hinterThey will be prime responsibilities of the Conservation Construction Authority, which will be financed from the $47m which Victoria and New South Wales will pay each the next SO years for the Snowy Mountains Scheme. I would like to know what has happened to the Conservation and Construction Authority and what has happened to the $47m which was supposed to be spent on it each year. As I said previously, all that the present Government has done is to cancel one project, namely, the Pike Creek project-lucidl y the 2 States involved the realised how essential this project was and they are carrying on the work themselves, although at a reduced rate-and to start one project, the Kinchant project. As I pointed out previously in the House, that project was started in the electorate of the Minister for Northern Development",71
135,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT,The Government also reneged on the $2.1 m for the weirs on the Namoi.,71
136,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes , the honourable has had member is correct there. Of course, I have excluded the Dartmouth Dam because that was a project which we had under way. Had it not been for the obstruction of the South Australian Premier, Mr Dunstan, that project would be completed today and probably the dam would be almost full or certainlyfilling.The posiuon is that that dam is just commencing to be built. What has happened to the request by Sir Charles Court for more money for the Ord project? In August 1965, when the present honourable member for Dawson was not a member of this House, he put out a pamphlet on the economic justification of the Ord River project in which he said: The additional investment required to expand the from an irrigable area of 30,000 generate increased benefits significantly in excess of increased costs. That is an interesting comment. Of course, he thing could say that when he did not have responsibility for these matters, but today he does have responsibility for them and of course he has rejected Sir Charles Court's request. I do not that he has actually done that. It is probably case of the Treasury wirming. I think everyone associated with water conservation one of the hardest things of all is to convince a Treasury official that there is any benefit in water noteworthy conservation. The Treasury has a motto which is omy of Australia. to the effect that there is only one thing which is more uneconomic than allowing water to flow burden out to the sea and that is storing it in uneconomic does dams. So the Treasury has won with ment, with the assistance of other honourable members. The Minister for Northern DevelopI ment should either put up or shut up. This Government which promised the world in water conservation, has broken that promise, among many others. I do not want to delay the House unnecesschase arily, but I have here a quite long letter sent the Mayor of Bundaberg, claiming that it much more important for the Kolan scheme at Bundaberg to proceed than for the money to be spent on the Kinchant Dam which he claims was of much lower priority. But I will House by reading that letter. All I can if these are the priorities of the present GovernSpecial ment it is no wonder that the former honourable honourable member for Wide Bay was defeated at the last the debate. Imembers election. It has been mentioned that there is to difference in the iinancial arrangements for 2 projects in that the moneys for the Julius will be provided by way of loan and the moneys for the Ross River Dam will be provided by way of grant. I do not want to make a point of this. think the decision to make a grant for the Ross River Dam was made originally because it was felt that the Commonwealth, through its defence installation and its university and other installations in the area, would be responsible for using a considerable part of the water and therefore it should make a grant. However, I suggest that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation should be asked to look very carefully at the Julius Dam project to see whether it is not possible to use a system which it introduced some years ago and which involves the use of cetyl alcohol to prevent evaporation. The climate in these northern areas is such that there is enormous evaporation, enormous loss of project water. This system has proved successful in some acres to 200,000 acres will areas and as long as this film of cetyl acohol could be maintained by means of afloator some of that sort undoubtedly the dam would be much more effective than it otherwise would be. Thank goodness we have one Minister- I say this in favour of the Minister for Northern say Development-wh o recognises the contribution a made by the rninerals industry and the necessity for these projects to proceed. In this second readknows that ing speech the Minister said: The mining industries of northern Australia are making a and vitally important contribution to the econThey will continue to do so in the future and, in one way or another, we must assure that the heavy of costs for water, transport and other basic facilities not act as a deterrent to those people whose personal contribution is indispensable to the success of the developthis Government of our northern resources. believe that every supporter of the Government should read, mark, learn and inwardly digest those words because, unfortunately, the Government seems to have forgotten them. We get support nowadays not for productive matters of this sort but for unproductive matters-for the purof the painting 'Blue Poles' and for teachby ing people how to throw boomerangs. It makes was one wonder where the Government is going. Thank goodness it is in this case opting for something which is productive. I strongly support the Bills and congratulate the Government for pronot delay the ceeding with them. say is that Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith Minister of State) (10.41)- I thank the have who have contributed to noted that the Opposition is not opposing this legislation. I have also noted be a the appreciation expressed by honourable these members opposite of the work done by the MinDam ister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson), who is unable to be present this evening because he is absent from the country in the course ofhis I duties. The 2 significant factors are that the Queensland Grant (Ross River Dam) Bill involves a grant, for the reasons honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn), and the Julius Dam Agreement Bill involves a loan. That, as it appears from the instructions I have been given, was the proposition accepted by the Premier of Queensland. It provides for additional storage. I want to make one comment. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett) spoke about Townsville. It is obvious that it has a bright future. I am not aware of whether the Premier Queensland has proclaimed Townsville as growth centre to the extent that would be required. If he has I can guarantee that it will proceed. But one of the great difficulties that have is in getting the State governments to agree to nominate areas as growth centres. When I was in Queensland one of the difficulties I experithe enced was in trying to ascertain whether TownsSouth ville is going to be a growth centre in the future or whether it is going to be Gladstone or where else. While there is that indecision there is not going to be the progress that obviously is warranted. I shall say no more about the remarks that have been made in this debate because think that everybody is in agreement with proposition. I thank honourable members for their remarks.

Unfortunately the position has deteriorated somewhat alarminingly since the somehonourable member for Maranoa drew the attention of the people of Australia to this threat. It has deteriorated to such an extent that a warning has been given in the grimmest and gravest I possible terms that the anticipated harvest of the some 600,000 tons of wheat in Queensland is threatened. A similar situation exists in north-western New South Wales. This is an appropriate occasion to talk about locust plagues because I understand that in the Budget discussions a proposal will be outUned to set up an Australian plague locust committee. However, this committee will be rather limited in scope and will refer only to plague locusts. I point Third Reading out that in Queensland last year, and in other years when locusts were in plague proportions, the plague locust was the one which gave the least concern of all. Last year out of the total of a $410,066 spent by the Queensland Government only $14,810 was spent on the spraying and eradication of the plague locust. I wonder why the Australian Government has seen fit not to Second Reading include in the proposed program the spur throated locust and what is called the migratory We of the Opposition submit that the stage has been reached when the spur throated locust should be included in an Australia-wide scheme because- I point out, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we in Queensland are not proud of this-unfor Queensland has exported it to northern New South Wales. The migratory locust should be included also because it is found not only in Third Reading the Australian scene but also in Africa, Europe and Asia. The spur throated locust probably is the most damaging of all because it respects no crops. It attacks them all. It also attacks grass this is of particular concern to the cattlemen the area of my friend the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) who already have been savagely hit by floods. I think we should pay tribute to the nonourabie member for Kennedy for the tremendous amount of work he has done in his area and in drawing the attention of governments to the great damage caused by locusts. In his area they have had floods. In otherwas areas they have had droughts. They have were suffered also from low prices and increased costs over which they have had no control. The cattlemen will be affected by the spur throated locust as well as the grain men. ° The migratory locust is somewhat more selective. It does attack the main crops in the area, sorghum and wheat, but keeps away from the broad leaf crops such as sunflower, safflower cotton. I am not one who advocates immediately running to the Federal Government when there is an isolated outbreak of any plague, locusts or anything else. I believe there should fairly well defined principles covering this. If there is a local outbreak the property owner should be the one responsible for control for conthat trol and eradication procedures. If the outbreak spreads there then should be involvement by State. When the outbreak becomes a national cato tastrophe I submit it becomes the responsibility of the Federal Government to initiate control measures because of the national importance of it. It is significant to point out that in Queensland last year the State Government provided 50 cent of the cost of insecticide necessary for sprayedge. ing. The other 50 per cent was covered by a bination of the individual and the local locust committees which were in effectfinancedby the local shire councils. Of course, this on top everything else is placing a further strain on rather limited sources offinanceavailable to the local authority areas. I am pleased that the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) and the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) are in the House tonight. ask them to take up at one of the future Cabinet meetings the matter of why the Commonwealth Government at this stage has not contributed, notwithstanding requests from the Queensland Government, half the $14,810 which the Comdone monwealth promised to pay to the Queensland Government for the eradication of the plague locusts that I referred to initially when there only one outbreak The sum is only small but I tMnk the principle is the thing that matters. would be appreciated if they would ascertain from their Cabinet colleagues the reason for andnon-payment of this 50 per cent contribution in which had been promised. The amount is not great but a principle is involved. It cost $ 172,286 to eradicate the spur throated locust and a $222,969 to eradicate the migratory locust. The cost of keeping the Army in thefield-and the Army is to be thanked for the tremendous contribution it made-wa s some $40,000. The cost factor, however high, is proportionate to what saved. It is estimated that the total losses $3m but the crops saved were worth $ 14m. It is submitted that these sums of money-the total loss involved and the estimated savingsare of significance, particularly if there is to be a continuation of locust plagues which Queensland seems to have suffered over the last few years. Locust plagues are a national disaster and it is unreasonable to expect individual landholders and and State resources to have to pick up the bill and spend, as they spent last year, in excess of $400,000 exclusive of the cost of associated be it equipment. The cost to landholders in be Queensland last year was estimated at $500,000. Clearly this is an intolerable situation. If climatic conditions are favourable for locust hatchingsis, if moisture conditions enable the host to build up to plague proportions-it is unacceptthe able to expect the Queensland primary producer meet once again a bill of this magnitude. I ask those Ministers present to treat this matter with concern. The only successful way of eradicating a locust plague is to have everything in readiness in anticipation of such a plague, such anticipation per being based on available material and knowlThere can be a problem of insecticides not combeing readily available. There can also be the associated problem of ensuring that any insecticide used does not have any residual effect on of man or beast. The insecticides used have been the dibron, maldison, carbonyl and diazanon. I hope that moves can be taken to ensure a stockpile of these necessary materials. It is also to be hoped that the Army will have sufficient fuel. My colleague, the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes), drew the attention of the House to I the great problems created for defence manoeuvres because of lack of suitable fuel. It is hoped too that these plagues will not occur with the monotonous regularity that they have because they are eating the hearts out of many the primary producers in the areas affected. Those producers have to put up with was this problem on an almost continuing basis. They realise that the world is desperately short of food It and is crying out for supphes to keep people alive in poorer areas. This is a matter of the greatest the importance. It is of deep national significance and I trust that the Federal Government will treat it as such. People are concerned, great perParliament sonal hardship is being caused and it is no use parrying with Olympic expertise a situadon in which people are being gravely hurt.",73

142,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"During the latter part of July and the early part of August I raised in this House a question referring to the administration of the Miniswere ter for Services and Property (Mr Daly). That members. question related to what I believe to be an unfair distribution of extra secretarial help to Governspeech ment supporters prior to the 1974 elections at the expense of fairness to members on all sides of this House. Hansard of 24 July 1974 records on pages 619 to 621 my initial speech, and that tions night the Minister, as recorded on pages 621 to sard: 623, made his initial answer. Shortly after that the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) expressed a concern that he felt. The Minister again spoke on 25 July 1974 as recorded on pages 725 to 727. I followed him and my speech is recorded on pages 727 to 729. On 31 July 1974 I spoke again, as recorded pages 913 to 914. On 1 August Mr Daly spoke, as recorded on pages 1026, 1027 and 1028. Mr MCLeay, the honourable member for Boothby, followed him as recorded on pages 1030 and 1031.1 spoke again on 2 August, as recorded on pages 1097 and 1098. Following that I placed notice question No. 853, directed to the Minister. This is the text of the question: (1) What are the names and Party affiliations members and senators who were allocated extra secretarial assistance at Government expense during the period 29 April 1974 to 17 May 1974, what were the those persons requested the it given to each of them. (2) Did Senator Marriott complain to him, at least 2 weeks prior to the election date, and then to the Departmental officer, that in Tasmania the to members of the Australian Labor Party. (3) Will he provide a copy of the directions to members of in which advice as to the availability and terms of use of extra secretarial assistance was given; if not, why not. (4) What date was the advice sent out. (5) Were some Opposition members in South Australia refused extra help which brought about an angry reaction (6) As a result of this reaction, is it a fact that the South Australia relieving pool had to be reallocated and members pool withdrawn from members of the Australian n answer to Labor Pany. Excluding any permanent arrangements for extra secretarial assistance at appointed times, what were the total extra man hours given by way of extra assistance to(a) Members or senators of the Australian Labor Pany, (b) Members or senators of the Australian Country Pany, (c) Members or senators of the Liberal Party of Australia, and (d) Senators of the Democratic Labor Pany. (8) Were cenain members refused assistance; if so, who they, and what was the Party affiliation of each. (9) In which States was extra help given only to ALP (10) Did he deny any knowledge of the foregoing in a on Wednesday, 24 July 1974; if so, why. . The Minister answered eventually in these terms: I refer the honourable member to the statements made by me on the adjournment of the House relating to his accusain relation to the above mentioned matters, vide HanHansard 24 July 1974, page 621; Hansard 25 July 1974, pages 725 to 727; Hansard 1 August 1974, pages 1026 to 1028. So much for open government. It is a lot of bunkum. In closing this matter I make a plea to the Minister to recognise that what happened at on thattimewas notright.The Minister simply says that he who puts in his orderfirstgetsfirstclaim. On that principle I could immediately put in an order, because Mr Bob Hawke has given notice that there will be an election next April. This matter can be politically exploited at public exon pense. I believe that the Government gave members of the Australian Labor Party a bonus of at least $7,000 in extra secretarial assistance of all during the campaign. It is only fair in the name of democracy that a system be devised to ensure that all get a fair crack of the whip and the ardates that each of rangement is not exploited. extra help, and for how long was",75
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 11 o'clock, the House stands adjourned till 10 a.m. tomorrow. entire pool had been allocated House adjourned at 11 p.m.",75
