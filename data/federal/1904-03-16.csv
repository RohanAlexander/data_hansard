1,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I wish to make a further statement to the House in reply to a question asked, by the honourable and learned member for Corinella yesterday. It is this: I am advised that new names may be added to the electoral rolls of persons who are qualified under the Franchise Act, and who have applied for enrolment prior to the issue of the writ. Consequently all persons who have applied since the issue of the writ for the election on the 16th December last, and whose claims are in order,, will be enrolled for the election to be.held' on the 30th March. All electors whose applications for transfer have been received' by the returning officer or registrar before the issue of the writ will also be enrolled, and entitled to vote at the election. COMMONWEALTH STOCK.",12
2,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Treasurer if steps have been :- taken to have Commonwealth stock placed . upon the list of British trust investments, so that that stock, when issued, may not be at a disadvantage as compared with State stock?",12
3,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"The matter has not been overlooked. I brought it under the attention of the Prime Minister some time ago, in order that the necessary steps might be taken for the introduction .of .a Bill for the Act required to give the guarantee necessary before the British Government will put stock upon the trustees' list. As there is no Commonwealth stock now on the London market, nor any likely to be placed there in the near future, that Bill was not introduced last session, but it will probably be dealt with this session. COST OF ELECTIONS.",13
4,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"On Tuesday advice last there appeared a statement in the setting forth the cost of the recent general elections, in which : there are manifest errors. .'For instance, the cost Sydney election is put down at ,£781, though I am informed that it was not thing like so much; while the West Sydney election is stated when in point of fact it cost much more. Of course, arguments and deductions drawn from such statements must be quite wrong. opened",13
5,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"My attention journ has been drawn to the matter. It appears of that some of the accounts for the of the Act.. divisions named were by some mistake journed charged to.the other division; but before the statement was finally revised for presentaenrolled tion to Parliament, the errors to which the honourable member refers were discovered must and rectified. . I do not know why there my was such a hurry to give the information that to the press before revision; but those are arc the facts of the case. The correct informavote. tion was placed upon the tables of both from House of Parliament. COLONEL PRICE.  Minister for Defence if the article appearing in this morning's Argus, and headed, "" Colonel Tom Price. A Question of Retirement. An Interesting Position,"" contains the facts of the case. Has his attention been called to the matter?",13
6,Mr CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I do not know what foundation exists for some of the statements which have been published in the Argus, but I shall be very pleased to make inr quiries on the subject for the information of the honourable member. WIMMERA ELECTION.",13
7,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Does the Minister for Home Affairs object to lay upon the table the instructions issued to the returning officer as to the recepti n or non-reception of the ""Q"" votes at the Ni-Ni polling place during the Wimmera election ?",13
8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have obtained a copy of those instructions; but perhaps I may betaken as answering the honourable and' learned member's question if I read thereply which has been furnished to me in answer to a letter appearing in one of today's newspapers, and signed by the unsuccessful candidate, Mr Max. Hirsch. It is this:Mr Hirsch asserts that the reply to the honourable member for Illawarra yesterday contains a> "" positive misstatement of f a c t "" as to the given by the Attorney-General's Departpress ment. There was no misstatement.. That advice was given in writing on aist December last, is recorded in both Departments, and a copy is attached. It exactly agrees with the of the East statement made yesterday. any Mr Garran's memorandum, there referred cost of the to, is as follows:as ^265, Memo, for the Secretary, Department of Home Affairs. The polling booth at N i - Ni not having been on polling day, the proper course is for the returning officer or presiding officer to adthe polling to another day, and give notice the adjournment, as provided by section 153. A difficulty arises as to whether, at the adpoll, "" Q "" declarations should be accepted from, aud ballot-papers gWcn to, electors, for other polling places in the division. This is a matter in which the presiding officeruse his discretion. For the guidance of that, officer, if he desires advice,-I may say that in opinion the adjourned, poll being only for . polling booth, only those persons whose names', enrolled for that polling place are entitled to. As, however, the matter is not wholly freedoubt, it might perhaps be desirable to allow "" Q "" declarants to vote, if the ballot papers, can be kept separate--e.g. , by taking their votes, at a separate booth, with a separate ballot-box. The officer conducting . the scrutiny would then decide, in his discretion whether to count the votes' . or not; and in the event of a petition the Court t>£ Disputed Returns would have the materials for declaring the result of the election. (Signed) R. R. GAKRAN, Secretary, Attorney-General's Dept. 21/12/03. Mr Hirseh's statement that portion of the judgment of the High Court was "" suppressed"" ' in my reply is equally Unfounded. To correct"" the misleading effect of an isolated passage S noted from the judgment of the Argus, I quoted le immediate context of that passage'; Nothing was suppressed, and no such inference was drawn'.... as is suggested' by Mr Hirsch. The additional passage from the Chief Justice's judgment quoted by Mr Hirsch also involved what he would term "" a suppression of fact,"" since he omits the following very revelant passage :"" It has been pointed out that if the view of the petitioner was accepted, the result would be that, when by accident one polling-place in an electorate was not open on election day, there would be, in e0ect, two entirely separate polls for the whole electorate, because when the adjournment came each party knew exactly how many votes had been cast for him, and each would collect together all the electors who had not voted before, and bring them to the adjourned poll, thus making practically a fresh election. In view of the provision that all elections should be held on the same day, it was plain that the Legislature thought that'was a very undesirable thing to happen.""",13
9,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Can the Prime Minister say whether that opinion was forwarded to the returning officer prior to the date of polling?,14
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I shall be happy to ask the Minister for Home Affairs to inform the honourable and learned member. The opinion I have read was sent to the secretary to the Department for Home Affairs, and forwarded by him to the Chief Electoral Officer. What further steps were taken I am not at present in a position to say. NEW MEMBER. Mr CAMERON made and subscribed the oath of allegiance as member for the electoral division of Wilmot.

11,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"the Minister for Defence, upon notice Whether the n t h Australian Infantry Regiment (WA.) is the only regiment on a non-paying footing. If so, why?",14
12,Mr CHAPMAN,Unknown,-In reply to the honourable member I have to stateThe n t h Australian Infantry Regiment is not the only regiment which is not paid. MEDICAL SCHOOL OF INSTRUC,14

15,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Have any officers in the Customs Department at the Port of Broome been suspended, removed, or discharged recently ? 2. Have any charges been made or is any inquiry proceeding in connection with officers at this port ? 3. If officers have been discharged, what is the nature of the charges laid against them?",14
16,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"In reply to the honourable member's questions1. No. officers have been suspended. Two of the officers who performed Customs duties at this Port were State officers who acted for the Commonwealth, by whom the salary of one of these was partly paid. The State Government has been notified that the services of these State officers are no longer required. It is intended to remove the junior officer, who is not in the State service, to another position. 2. No charges have been made, but inquiries into matters at this port are continuing. 3. Officers have been dealt with as described in answer No. 1. Reports prove that the business was conducted in a very lax manner. NA NOTES.",14
17,Mr HUME COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"for Mr KENNEDY) asked the Postmaster-General upon notice Whether the Postal Department is responsible for the suspension of the sale of duty stamps and promissory notes by postal officials in charge of contract post-offices; if not, will the Postmaster General inform the House how the present condition has arisen under which duty stamps and promissory notes are not purchasable by the public at contract offices at present?",14
18,Mr DEAKIN,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"On behalf of the Postmaster-General, I have to say thatThe sale of duty stamps and promissory notes is un'der the control of and regulatd by the State Government. The Postmaster-General is not aware of the reasons why such stamps and promissory notes are not supplied to officers in charge TION. of contract post offices for sale to the public.

Debate resumed from March 15 (vide page 542), on motion by Mr MAUGERThat the A'ddress be agreed to by the House.",15
21,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY," Honourable members opposite may think that, as the vernment are always anxious to expedite public business, I am not altogether acting in accordance with that desire in rising speak upon the Address in Reply. But my excuse is that I am one of the few members of this House-ther e are only five altogether - wh o represent the far-off State of Western Australia; and I think that it is incumbent on all of us to be, perhaps, a little in evithe dence on such occasions. might be thought by the people of our State, and, perhaps, by the people of Australia generally, that Western Australia had efficient representation in this House. also regret as much as any honourable memby ber can do that on the few occasions when I have had the opportunity of addressin ing the House, I have had to refer to matters which particularly affected my own State. That was not because I am out of sympathy with the conditions or the affairs of other parts of Australia, or cannot take a suffiStates ciently wide view to consider them; but because Western Australia has such a small representation. On the other hand, great States of New South Wales and toria are so largely represented, and have so much influence here that it different appears to me that it is not so necessary their members to speak in regard to their affairs. I cannot, forget that Western Australia is far away from the eastern States, that she occupies an immense area which is sparsely settled, having only a little Electors Enrolled. over 230,000 people all told, and that she is isolated. We in Western Australia have 18,163 no means of communication with these 151268 States except by a four days' voyage by I9J 77 2 38,896 sea to Adelaide. I am very sorry at the 36» 55 8 beginning of my remarks to have to admit 35,018 that this isolation is already spoiling the - Federal sentiment in Western Australia; and unless some means are taken 1901. to prevent it, and that pretty soon-o r at any rate unless some hope is.' extended Males only. to the people of that State-al l I can say 3)9^5 - is that that Federal sentiment must continue (Informal, SS.) to get weaker, and must soon end- I assure the House that I hope that it will not be so-in open hostility. Honorable MEMBERS - Oh !",15
22,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I do not think that is an improper remark for me to make. I am only stating what I fear will be the case. I very much regret it, and I hope some means will be taken to prevent it. There can be no doubt that the idea - of Federation and the very meaning of the word is a joining together. GoThose who desire the success of Federation must assist in the first instance, in removing isolation. Whether rightly or to wrongly, there is no doubt whatever of the fact that the people of Western Australia - a large number of them at any rate-in agreeing to join in a Federation with their fellow countrymen in other parts of Australia, believed, and had good reasons for belief, that the union would soon result Otherwise it in the barrier of isolation being removed. They believed that they would soon have railway communication between Western no Australia and the eastern States of the I continent. That was the main lever used all of us who advocated Federation: It was the lever used by the prominent men Eastern Australia to influence those who had lived so long in isolation, and who had become accustomed to that position. They were told that this communication of Western Australia by railway with the eastern must be an early result of Federation. We all, I think, admit that, Australia being an island continent, inhabited by the the same race of people, there is no room here Vicfor six different and almost sovereign States. If it were otherwise-if we were peoples with different habits and for different ambitions-the case might be different; but that is not so. We all come from the same stock; we have the same history; we have the same ambitions for the future ; we are citizens of the same Empire. Therefore, there is no room upon this continent for six sovereign States with independent Governments. The argument was excellent when we all used it, that union was not only necessary, but reasonable and business like; but it must be a real union, and not one in name only; not a sham, such as our union is at present, and such as it must continue to be so long as we have no means of communication between the great western and the great eastern States, except by embarking upon a four days' sea voyage, for the greater part of the journey far out of the sight of land.",15
23,Mr GLYNN,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,How did the American States get on before the use of steam was introduced ?,16
24,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I do not know, but should say very badly. I think that we may judge of our own case for ourselves. The honourable and learned member is so erudite that it is of no use for me to attempt to cross swords with him. I recog-' nise that no honourable member in this House has a mind stored with so many historical facts as he has. nately, i.,ooo miles of practically uninhabited country will have to be traversed by the proposed railway. makes the position more difficult than it would be if settlements were established at frequent intervals along the route of the railway. I am glad, however, to be able to say that some real advance has been made in this matter, and that the Governor General's Speech conveys the information that the Government intend to ask the House to approve of a survey being made.",16
25,Mr WILKS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Did not the Minister write that paragraph?,16
26,Sir JOHNFORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I did not.  ter has decided that the survey shall be made for a railway by way of the Gawler Ranges, and not through Tarcoola?",16
27,Sir JOHNFORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I have not decided anything. No doubt a railway could be constructed by the Gawler Ranges route for ^500,000 less than by the Tarcoola route, and as the House is in an economical frame of mind, that consideration may weigh with them. That, in itself, however, is not a sufficient reason why the route should be adopted. I wish to see the railway constructed, and I am not very particular as to which route it follows. The project for the construction of a railway to connect Western Australia with the eastern States was not received with much favour when it was first submitted to the House; but I am glad to say that it is now viewed with niore favour, and that it has gained ground in the estimation of the people. Even in South Australia-where , for some unknown reason which I could not understand, the project was regarded with disfavour- I believe that the people are beginning to see that it would be very beneficial to them, and would confer as great an advantage upon South Australia as upon Western Australia, and I look forward to the time, and that very soon, when any objection that may have been raised by that State will be removed. I have not the slightest doubt that success will attend our efforts, but whether immediately or some time hence must depend largely upon public opinion. We . shall have to be content to wait till Parliament, with full information before it, is able to arrive at a decision in regard to it. There is no use in my saying that it is a good project, that it would prove payable, or that it would impose no burden on the people of Australia. What I have to Unfortu- do, and what the people of Western Australia and all those interested have to do, is to use every effort to induce the House and That the country to view it with favour. I have always been content to accept that position. I have, however, always entertained a very strong objection to a situation in which any State should be able to say- "" We shall prevent you people of Western Australia from being connected with the other States by r a i l ; we shall not allow you to be brought into communication with your neighbours by railw/ay, because there is rsection in the Constitution which says that our consent has first to be obtained."" I have no hesitation in saying that that section was not embodied in the Constitution with any idea that it could be availed of for such a purpose. The design of the framers was to prevent the Commonwealth from interfering with the States in regard to matters relating to inter-communication within their own territory, and it was never contemplated that one State should be able to block another from being connected with the other States by railway. Any such idea would be absurd, and entirely opposed to the principles of Federation. No State with any self-respect would be content to restunder such a condition for a minute, and if I thought that South Australia or any other State would be able for long to prevent Western Australia from being connected with the other States by rail-to prevent that inter-communication between the States which is the very life-blood of Federation- I should say- "" This Federation is a fraud; we have been led into it by false pretences, and the sooner we get out of it the better.""",16
28,Mr WILKS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,What about the Federal Capital? We must have that first.,17
29,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I am quite as strong as is the honourable member in the desire to see the capital question settled. If any one imagines that we are not going to have railway communication between the east and west of Australia, I say to him that he is a little Australian, and has no faith in the future of his country. Federation, without means of communication between the great west and the great east of the continent would be meaningless. It would have absolutely no significance whatever.",17
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,What does the Treasurer say upon the subject?,17
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I am not committing the Treasurer. We only want the railway when Parliament is prepared to grant it. Now I shall have to say some things which are not so pleasant as I might desire, but I am determined to give utterance to them, because I have a duty to perform, not only to myself, but to the people of the State I represent. Among the foremost men in Australia who promised-indirectl y if not directly-that Federation would be the forerunner of railway communication between the east and west of Australia was the then Premier of South Australia, the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide. On the 9th April, 1899, when I was Premier of Western Australia, he wrote to me as follows:Our near constitutional connection, resulting from Federation, is in itself a boon of great worth to all included within its sphere. I cannot help thinking, also, that it must, at no very distant date, result in the connection of east and west by rail through the medium, say. of a line between Port Augusta and your gold-fields. There is no mention there about Esperance Bay. This would, indeed, be an Australian work worthy of undertaking by a Federal authority on behalf of the nation, in pursuance of the authorities contained in the Commonwealth, Bill . It is, of course, a work of special interest to Western Australia and South Australia, and I devoutly hope that the day is not far distant when the representatives of Western Australia and South Australia may, in their places in a Federal Parliament, be found working side by side for the advancement of Australian interests in this and other matters of national concern. On the 4th September of the same year my right honourable friend wrote to me as follows. I may say that this was before the referendum in Western AustraliaWith Federation assured, the Federal construction of the railway is in our opinion undoubtedly the best means for carrying out this great Australian underaking. We hope that it will not be long before Western Australians and South Australians are co-operating in the Parliament of the Commonwealth to bring this about, and we repeat that you can rely on South Australia's sympathy and support.",17
32,Mr OMALLEY,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The right honourable gentleman will obtain sympathy from South Australia, but no support.",17
33,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,So far we have not been favoured with much of either.,17
34,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The right honourable gentleman has had both. Western Australia is offered two railwavs instead of one.,17
35,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I would point out to the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide that in the communication which I have quoted no mention is made of a railway from Esperance Bay to the goldfields. It refers only to the projected transcontinental line from Western Australia to South Australia. I repeat that we have had neither sympathy nor support from the latter State. For three years the Commonwealth Government have persistently endeavoured to secure permission from that State for the railway to pass through its territory. So far, we have been unsuccessful. The authorities have neglected to give proper consideration to the requests which have been made by the Commonwealth Government.",17
36,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Why , the very first speech which the Minister made in this House contained a threat of disruption and nonsense of that sort.",17
37,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I am discussing the question of the railway.,17
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,We also complain of neglect of the Federal Capital question ,17
39,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The honourable member will be quite satisfied with my attitude upon that subject. But in connection with the transcontinental railway, I should like to ask what 'the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide has done during all this time. He has done absolutely nothing. He has never asked the people of South Australia to respect the promises which he made. His action strongly recalls to mv mind the old fable of the spider and the fly. ""Will you walk into my parlour?"" said the spider to the fly-and Western Australia walked in. The right honourable and learned member, who in a public capacity made all these promises-whic h were very acceptable to Western Australia-occupy ing as he did a most responsible position, has never yet come out into the open and said, "" I made these promises, and I ask South Australia to respect them."" He has never asked the people of what he terms "" My own dear State"" not to dishonour themselves or their country by repudiating the pledges which he made on their behalf. But instead, what has he done? He has done even worse, than nothing. He has sought to impose a new condition; he declares that whilst he favours the construction of a railway from A to B, it is conditional upon a line being built from B to C.",17
40,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Thu s giving both sides double the convenience which they would otherwise obtain.,18
41,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"To what ""both sides "" does the right honourable and learned member refer?",18
42,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,To the east and west.,18
43,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The new condition which the right honourable and learned member seeks to impose is notoriously one which at the present time is not acceptable to the people of Western Australia. If an individual pledges himself to do a certain thing, in certain eventualities, and when the time comes for redeeming his promise seeks to qualify it by adding to it a new and objectionable condition, which he knows will not be acceptable to the other party, what can be said of his conduct? Yet that is precisely the position which is taken up by the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide. For ten years the construction of a line of railway from Esperance Bay to Coolgardie has been a subject of controversy in the western State. prepared to construct a line from Coolgardie to Norseman, and upon two occasions I endeavoured to obtain the necessary legal authority for the work, but was not able to pass the Bill through both Houses of Parliament. That, however, is no reason why those who made promises in the eastern' States of Australia should now .seek to attach to such promises another condition of a controversial character. If any honourable member can urge that that is fair treatment, I have no more to say. I hold, however, that the new condition which the right honourable member for Adelaide - seeks to impose was quite outside the contract. While I was grateful to him for the letters which he wrote me in connection with the transcontinental railway, I should be much more grateful to him if he would keep the promises he made in their entirety and not seek to get out of his promise by' adding to it an impossible condition; otherwise he might just as well openly avow that he is not prepared to fulfil the promises which he made.",18
44,Mr FOWLER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,That is the object of tacking on the new condition.,18
45,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Does the Minister know that the estimates of the probable revenue that will be derived from the overland line which he is putting forward will be reduced by more than half if the Esperance line be constructed ?,18
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The right honourable and learned member, having made a promise, which we acted upon as a bond fide one, is now seeking to impose new conditions.",18
47,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Will the Minister deny that the estimates which he is putting forward will be falsified by 50 per cent, if there is a line to Esperance?",18
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I do not think that they will.,18
49,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Will they not be affected ?,18
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"They will not be affected at all. The right honourable and learned member labouis under a disadvantage as compared with myself, inasmuch as he does not know the country.",18
51,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I know what the official estimate is, and the Minister ought to, but does not.",18
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"If a person at Kalgoorlie desired to visit the fair city of Adelaide, I ask honourable members by which route he would prefer to travel? Would I was he go by rail direct, and thus arrive at his destination within 36 hours, or would he travel 247 miles by railway to Esperance, and there await a steamer by which to complete his journey- a distance of nearly 1,000 miles by sea?",18
53,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The officials who made the original estimate say that the estimated revenue from the transcontinental line will be diminished 50 per cent, if Western Australia constructs the Esperance line.",18
54,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,That would be a very good reason for not carrying out the proposal.,18
55,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,We should reserve the right to the Federation to construct the Esperance line.,18
56,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Our simple proposition is that Western Australia should be connected with the eastern States. With the exception of the Norseman gold-fields, some 105 miles from Coolgardie, there is nothing calling for a railway between Esperance and Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie. There is nothing at Esperance Bay itself which would warrant the construction of such a line. The people of Western Australia simply desire to have railway communication with the eastern States.",19
57,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Does the right honourable member think that in the matter of ordinary freights land carriage can compete with water carriage ?,19
58,Sir JOHNFORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I am not prepared at this stage to enter into the con-sideration of that question.,19
59,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I am in possession cf the facts, which show that the old estimate of revenue would be reduced by 50 per cent, by the Esperance line.",19
60,Sir JOHNFORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I wish that the right honourable member would allow me to proceed. It is useless for him to attempt to interrupt me, because I have been too long in the field of politics to be drawn off the track by his interjections. Even - if a railway were built to Esperance, I feel satisfied that the major portion, of the traffic between the eastern States and Western Australia would be chiefly by way of Fremantle. The volume of trade is with the last-named port, and it always will be. I am of opinion that to build the railway - to Esperance Bay, erect light-houses, and carry out other works necessary to make it a safe"" and commodious harbour, would cost j£:r,ooo,ooo. Seeing that Western Australia has gold-fields all over her territory to develop, she is not, I should say, prepared at present to spend so large a sum in opening up a new port, when she has already spent ,£1,250,000 on the port of Fremantle. I do not intend to say anything further at this stage in reference to this matter. I come now to the question . which agitates the mind of my honourable friends from New South Wales.",19
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Would well for the Minister to take honourable members over to Western Australia?,19
62,Sir JOHNFORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I should be very glad to do so, and to act as their cicerone. So far as there may be any reason for the belief that the Government of Australia, or the people of the other States, are unwilling to carry out the constitutional obligation relative to the construction of the Federal Capital, I am quite in accord with the position taken up by the people of New South Wales. But I think that they are nursing a grievance which really does not exist. I have never heard a suggestion at the councils of the Cabinet that that obligation should not be fulfilled, nor have I ever heard any member of the Government give expression to such an opinion even in private.",19
63,Mr FULLER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,We trust that the Minister will do better than his predecessor.,19
64,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"There were many matters which required attention at the inauguration of Federation, and which stood in the way of the immediate fulfil ment of this obligation. It is well that in regard to a question of this kind there should be no undue haste.",19
65,Mr LONSDALE,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The Government will settle the matter this session?,19
66,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,No doubt we shall do so. I believe that the Prime Minister intends that the question shall be determined as soon as we are in possession of the necessary information to place before the House.  cept the responsibility of recommending one particular site?,19
67,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"It would be unreasonable to expect the Government to do so. What would be the position of those honourable members of the Government who have pledged themselves to the selection of certain sites ? It would be unfair and unreasonable to expect them to be tied down to l party vote. If , for instance, the Government proposed that the Federal Capital should be established at Tumut, one of their members would almost be forced to resign, while if we were to ask the House to select Bombala another honourable member, of the Government would have to consider his position.",19
68,Mr LONSDALE,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Then the Government will not choose either site?,19
69,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The position which we take up is, in my opinion, the it not be' correct one. As a representative of the people of Australia, I desire to exercise a free choice; I desire to be free to vote as I think fit in the matter of the selection of the site of the capital of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister would be charged with unfairness if he tried to bind his colleagues and his supporters to one particular site. This is a national matter, quite beyond the scope of parties, and it is far better that honourable members should be factor allowed to cast their votes free from all banishing^ party ties.",19
70,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,And after we must have voted on the question how long will ral it be before the Capital is established ?,20
71,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I take it that its as soon as the question has been determined by Parliament it will be the duty of the Government to proceed with the work.,20
72,Mr LONSDALE,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Will the Ministry stand by the decision of this House?,20
73,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I think that how questions of this kind should be addressed respected to the Prime Minister. Among the members of the Government is the honourable member for Hume, who certainly does not wish to see New South Wales deprived of its right to the Federal Capital, it be said that the Minister of Defence, another representative of New South Wales, desires that the capital should not be to such an opinion. established in that State In his speech at Ballarat the Prime Minister declared that the obligation must be faithfully carried out, and it seems to me that that was definite statement. I shall now put before the House the statement which I made to electors of Western Australia at the last elections. I was not led to give expression to the opinion which I am about to quote by any desire to obtain votes, because, as matter of fact, the people of Western Ausaddress tralia have not as yet taken any great insire terest in the question. If they have any interest at all in the matter it is simply they do not desire to see expenditure on any undertaking that is not urgently reof quired.",20

77,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The .people of two Western Australia are far removed from the many eastern States. They are not in touch with the principle the people of New South Wales. We are really, a small and isolated community, it is no matter for surprise that we should give attention jto questions, which more directly affect us than does the matter the erection of the Federal Capital. In my address to the people of Western AusI tralia, I said I am in favour of the Federal Capital being established, as I believe it will be a great in increasing the Federal spirit, and of unnecessary parochialism. The great cities of Sydney and Melbourne, containing almost one-third of the whole population of Australia, always have immense influence on the FedeParliament; but that influnce will , I think, be less potent, and less liable to be specially in evidence, when the Federal Legislature sits in own State. The fixing of the Federal Capital in New South Wales was a special provision of the Constitution, and the undertaking must be honourably fulfilled. We must, 'in these and in all other similar matters, do unto others as we would they should do unto us. Unless we are willing and anxious to fulfil our promise can we expect Australia to be honoured and",20
78,Mr FRAZER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The right honourable member did not think that by giving expression to such sentiments he would lose votes?,20
79,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,No ; but I did nor can not expect to gain any.,20
80,Mr FRAZER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The right honourable gen- tleman would gain votes by giving utterance,20
81,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I am glad to hear the honourable member say so. I am sure, however, that most of my own constia tuents were not very deeply interested in this project. It had not been brought the home to them in its full significance. .",20
82,Mr FRAZER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,But they consider that we should adhere to the Constitution?,20
83,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Of course they a do. I am led' to make this extract from my to the electors, because of my deto show that so far as I , and, indeed, my colleagues, are concerned, there is absothat lutely no wish to depart from the constitutional requirements as to the establishment the capital. I should be ashamed if , after the people of New South Wales had been influenced to enter Federation because of this promise-and I believe that they were considerably influenced' by the State determination that the capital should be be in New South Wales-w e declined to carry out the obligation. To do such a thing would be most dishonourable. I wish now to say a word or about the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill which is before the House. I,have for years believed in the application of of conciliation and arbitration rather than that of force for the settlement and of industrial disputes, and an Act based upon the New Zealand Conciliation and Arbitration Act was introduced and carried of by me in the Western Australian Parliament, and is the law of that State today. am not prepared to say that that measure has always worked well, because it has not. It is not likely that the administration of new laws will be entirely successful at the start. Everynew scheme requires working to discover its defects, and to bring about a thorough understanding of its principles, before good results can be obtained. It is so with the conciliation and arbitration laws. I believe, however, that the longer they are in force the better they will be administered. If it is seen in the future that evil, and' not good, results from them, no doubt we shall retrace our steps, or substitute something better. We of the British race make many mistakes, but when Ave discover that we have made one, we generally find a way in which to retrieve our error, and eventually come to a position in which we are as well, if not better off, than we were before.",20
84,Mr LONSDALE,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,That process takes a long time.,21
85,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Yes , but I have such faith in the good sense of my fellow Australians that I am not afraid. The right honourable member for Adelaide is my good friend, though he sometimes seems to speak as though he had not that sympathy with me which I desire that he should have: Last session he told the people of Australia that I have no sympathy with the workers of this country. I consider that a gratuitous misrepresentation. I ask any one who wishes to test it to examine the statute-book of Western Australia for the ten years between 1890 and 1900, during which I was said to be an autocrat in that State. If any one does so, he will find there to my credit much more progressive and beneficent legislation than emanated from the Legislature of South Australia while the right honourable member for Adelaide was Premier of that State. In no decade in the history of Australia has more legislation been passed for the benefit and amelioration of the people than was passed in Western Australia in the period I refer to. Facts speak more loudly than words. I could go about making ing speeches here and there, and be a blatant democrat and radical, but. I wish rather to be judged by the work I do. What has been done by many of the men who for years have been in the public life of this country? What measures can they point to and say-""Thes e are my handiwork; I am responsible for them""? When a public man has beneficent and useful legislation to his credit - I dislike the term ""democratic,"" because it has been so hackneyed-h e has done good for his country. But those who haveonly made a noise, set class against class, and quarrelled with others until the placehas become unfit to live in, have done more harm than they could undo if they lived for 100 years.",21
86,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The right honourable gentleman's democracy is ever in evidence when he has to bend.,21
87,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I do not wish to speak in such a way that my hearers shall not understand exactly what I think about the matters with which I deal. When I am in doubt upon a question I may say nothing in regard to it, but once I have made up my mind, I do not hesitate to express my news plainly. Therefore I wish to say that I am entirely in accord with the Prime Minister in the remarks which he made at Ballarat. I shall support again this session the position taken by the Government last session against the application of the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to the public servants of the States. My reasons for doing so are these: In the first place, I think that it is not necessary to extend the provisions of the measure to public servants. In the second place, it is mischievous to unduly and unnecessarily interfere with the Governments of the States in the control of their own servants. Furthermore, it was not intended by those who inserted in the Constitution Bill the provision allowing the Commonwealth to legislate in regard to industrial disputes affecting more than one State, that it should be applied as it is now sought by some to apply it. I am largely responsible for the adoption of that provision, because if I had not voted for it, and used influence which I possessed at the time to get it carried, it would have been rejected by a majority of the members of the Convention.",21
88,Mr CAMERON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The right honourable gentleman has no reason to be proud of that fact.,21
89,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I shall not be proud of it if the provision is made use of in the way desired by some. The clause to which I refer was proposed by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and, in supporting it, I said that I had grave doubts as to whether I was doing the right thing. At that time. I did not know the honourable and learned member as well as I know him now. His views seemed to be greatly in advance of those in my mind, and I looked upon him as a dangerous sort of politician, who was ready to go far beyond what I should conbelieving sider safe. Since then I have come to know him better, and have learned to esteem though he is still in his opinions far ahead of me. However, at the time. I gave my reasons for supporting him, and six other members of the Convention from Western Australia voted with me.",21
90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Were they not, as matter of fact, the nominees of the right honourable gentleman ?",22
91,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I do not say that j but we voted together a good deal. The any prominence. clause was carried on division by twenty-two to nineteen, a majority of three, so if six friends from VVestern Australia and self had not voted for it, it would have been rejected. If I had known, or if nine-tenths of the members of the background. Convention had known, that this subsection, which we inserted for a difnearly ferent purpose altogether, was to be used in the way now proposed, we should not have supported it. We were thinking of the shipping strike, which had done so much harm to our trade and commerce. We had only disputes of that kind in our minds. But if I , for one, had had any idea that there would have been an attempt to exercise the provision in way that is now proposed, I should never have voted for it. Not one of 'those who spoke in the Convention-and some long speeches were made-eve its being applied in the way that it is now sought to apply it. That is another reason why I am totally opposed to what is now dressed. suggested. I contend that it is unnecessary, that it is an interference with the States for no sufficient reason, that the proposed application of the section was never intended by any member of the Convention.",22
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Is that the opinion of the Minister for Trade and Customs?,22

I say again that, if we had known of the purposes to which it would be him, sought to apply it, we should soon have made short work of it. I intended to say what I thought about the matter, and I have said it as clearly as possible, so that there can be no mistake about my views. When this subject came forward in Western Australia a - I say this in the presence of my honourable friends from that State, who belong to the Labour Party-no t one of the candidates, so far as I know, gave the matter Neither my honourable friend the member for Perth, nor my honormy able friend the member for F'remantle, said mymuch about it.

98,Mr CARPENTER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I referred to it at every meeting that I addressed.,22
99,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,But I think that the honourable member said that it would not affect Western Australia.,22
100,Mr CARPENTER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,No .,22
101,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I think I may say, without fear of contradiction, that if any strong opinions in opposition to the the proposed application of the sub-section in question had been hammered home, as some people might have hammered them home, it would have had some effect upon the elecn hinted at tions in that State.",22

I have no right-and I do not wish to take upon myself the duty-to offer gratuitous advice. Advice of that kind is being not generally very welcome.

104,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"There is no harm in my saying it againto my honourable friends. There is a celebrated fable of iEsop, about the dog and the shadow. The dog, seeing the meat that it was carrying in its mouth reflected in the stream below, jumped in, and by reaching after the shadow, lost what it had. I think a very good motto in all matters of this kind, as it is in many other matters, is "" hasten slowly."" It is always better to get almost all that you require, than by trying to get all you want at once, to lose the whole.",23
105,Mr SPENCE,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,We have been going rather slowly in regard to the transcontinental railwav !,23
106,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"We have been going too slowly in that matter. I trust that my honourable friend will assist in increasing the pace. It gave me very great pleasure last evening to listen to the remarks of my honourable friend the Minister for Trade and Customs, when he made a generous defence of the Chief Electoral Officer. I am always pleased to be in the position of being able to defend a public officer. I think that it is the right thing to do, if one can do it, because the whole stock-in-trade of a public servant is his good name and character. Members of Parliament who can say what they like about a public servant, can libel him up-hill, and kick him down, can say things to which he cannot reply in any way, should see that the power is carefully and wisely used. If advantage is taken of the privilege of Parliament to attack a public officer in general terms and not specifically, a very wrong thing is done. When a public officer does wrong, he should be called upon to meet a definite charge. He should not be attacked in generalities. I have had only a short experience of the Chief Electoral Officer. He was absolutely unknown to me personally until recently. But I can say this-that I have found him zealous in the discharge of his duties, and, as far as I am able to judge, upright in his desire to do justice. I have never seen him in the slightest degree leaning to the right hand or to the left. I have formed the opinion that he is a competent man, and he seems to have had experience of such duties as he is now discharging. I do not like to see such an officer attacked in general terms. If there is anything to be alleged against him, let it be plainly statedLet it be put in black and white, and let us have the matter investigated. I Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Le t us have an inquirv.",23
107,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Is it a reasonable thing to have an inquiry when no specific charges are made? The honourable member for North Sydney is, I know, a reasonable man, who is anxious to do what is right. Does he think that it would be a fair thing to have a general inquiry without any specific charge being made? A prisoner at the bar knows what is alleged against him. We do not charge a prisoner with general offences, and there is no power to bring up fresh charges against him in the course of his trial.",23
108,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I was not speaking of the man, but of the work of the Department.",23
109,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"It is unfair to demand that there should be a general inquiry, but I can understand an inquiry into the system.",23
110,Mr FISHER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Was not the Parnell Commission an inquiry into general charges?,23
111,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"There were definite charges in that case, I believe. My own opinion is that we cannot be too caref u l in guarding public officers from attacks in general terms. If anything is wrong, there should be specific charges made, which should be thoroughly well inquired into. We should not appoint commissions of inquiry merely to find out something against a public officer. Now I come to another matter about which I wish to say a few words. I allude to the Navigation Bill. The measure has not yet been laid upon the table, but it is mentioned in the Governor-Geneial's Speech. As that Bill will affect communication round the coasts of Australia, it is necessarily a measure of very far-reaching importance. I only wish to say this-that the fact that a thing is good in itself affords no reason for immediately embracing it ; it is no reason for upsetting everything to bring it at once into existence. We sometimes remit duties by statute. But we generally give some notice before such an Act comes into force, in order that people shall not be injured by reason of their payment of heavy duties, and having insufficient opportunity to get rid of their stock.",23
112,Mr JOHNSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I thought it was the foreigner who paid the duty?,23
113,Sir JOHNFORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I am not going to argue that question with the honourable member. Take, for instance, the measure which some people think very beneficient-the Pacific Island Labourers Act. It might be argued that if it were a good thing to prohibit the employment of Kanakas upon the sugar plantations, absolute and immediate action should have been taken in that regard. But the Legislature, being reasonable, has said- "" No; we think that it is a good thing, but we are not going like a bull at a gate; we are going to ally stop the practice."" The same remarks might apply to other measures, especially to the Navigation Bill. Although the Bill is not circulated yet, I might say that it appears to me that if we were to bring some of its provisions into immediate operation we should inflict injury. But if reasonhonorable able time is allowed to meet the altered ditions, the inconvenience or hardship to individual communities may be minimized. In connection with all such measures, especially those which interfere with vested interests, some, time should be allowed to enable those who might be injuriously affected to prepare for the change. Some reference has been made to the question of old-age pensions. I was one of those who supported the proposal at the Convention that old-age pensions should be included among the subjects for Federal legislation. The reason I then gave- I have not looked up the matter since-was , that I believed that the Federal Parliament would be able to deal with the matter better than would any local Legislature. I thought that it would be able to take a wider view of the operation of such a law, and,' although there was a good deal of difference of opinion, I voted in favour of Federal control being exercised in that matter. Whilst the Braddon section continues it will be very difficult, without imposing special taxation, apart from the Customs, to bring an old-age pension law into operation. Some persons talk very glibly about imposing extra taxation; but I think that those who look into the matter and attach proper weight to the great distaste of the people to any new taxation will see that the subject is not such an easy one to deal with as might at first appear. No doubt the bookkeeping sections and the Braddon sections of the Constitution suit the State which I represent. We are very pleased that those sections are embodied in the Constitution, and I am very glad that I voted for them. I venture to say that even the Labour Party in Western Australia could not successfully urge the abolition of the bookkeeping sections, or even advocate that their operation should be brought to an end. The reason is this. 'When the five years' term expires there is little doubt that a demand will be made for an extension of the period over which the bookkeeping clauses shall operate. Parliament has the right to extend the time if it thinks fit, because the Constitution provides that the sections shall operate for five years, or until such gradu- other time as Parliament may direct.",23
114,Mr CARPENTER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The bookkeeping sections do not affect the old-age pensions; the Braddon section is the obstacle.,24
115,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I am quire aware of that; but at present I am dealing with the bookkeeping sections. I may tell members that last year if there con- had been no bookkeeping sections in the Constitution, and the revenues and expenditure of the States had been distributed - per capita, Western Australia would have lost ^600,000.",24
116,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"There would be no need to distribute the revenues per capita, even though there were no bookkeeping sections.",24
117,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,No ; but there might be an inclination in that direction.,24
118,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Specia l provision could be made for special cases.,24
119,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I wish it to be very well understood by my friends from Western Australia and elsewhere that but for the bookkeeping sections it would have been possible to take £600,000 out of the pockets of the people of Western Australia last year, and to have distributed it among the other States. I do not think that any one would care to go upon the hustings and advocate a change that would involve any such distribution. I should not like to take the responsibility of doing so.",24
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,In the meantime Western Australia is gathering in the money from the other States.,24
121,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Any advantage that Western Australia may receive is paid for by the people of that State. With' regard to this matter, I stated at the last general electionThe distribution of the surplus Customs revenue among the States, after the expiration of the five years bookkeeping period, is a very important question, and especially so for Western Australia, and our endeavours should be to have the bookkeeping period further extended. I certainly think the bookkeeping sections ought to be extended, at any rate, for the term fixed for the Braddon section, viz., for ten years.",24
122,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Does the Minister favour an extension of the term of the Braddon section for ten years?,24
123,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I have not expressed any opinion upon that.,25
124,Mr WEBSTER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The Minister apparently desires to extend the Braddon section, and then to further extend the bookkeeping section for another ten years.",25
125,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The bookkeeping system is not unfair. It is provided that the revenue collected in each State, one-fourth, which is made available for the purposes of the Federal Government, shall be returned to the State from which it is derived, and that all expenditure shall be charged against the State in which it is incurred. No doubt this places a restriction upon the application of the common purse principal, under which the whole of the revenues in the States would be at the disposal of the Federal Government; but it is not unfair.",25
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,We are made to occupy the position of receivers for other people.,25
127,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Perhaps so; but I need notgo into that matter now. The Braddon section will stand in the way of adopting an old-age pension scheme for a period of ten years. I think that I have dealt with those matters referred to in the Governor General's Speech, to which I particularly wished to refer.",25
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"And , strange to say, the Minister has adversely criticised most of the proposals.",25
129,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I do not think so.,25
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The Minister does not believe in old-age pensions, or the Arbitration Bill",25
131,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The honourable member is romancing. I now have to discharge a disagreeable duty. I feel compelled, very much against my wishes, to refer to some remarks made by my friend, the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide, on Friday last - His observations were, I think, ungenerous and unfair. His very long speech, to which we all listened attentively, and to a great deal of which we were glad to listen, was spoiled by the attack he made upon the Governments of Western Australia-bot h past Governments and the present Government. I am particularly interested in his remarks with regard to the Government with which I was for ten years connected, but I am willing to also take up the cudgels in defence of those who succeeded me. The right honourable gentleman seemed to me so unreasonably hostile, that it might have been even assumed that some personal injury had been done to him by myself, or by the representatives of Western Australia, or by the people of that State. I may say that I have no knowledge of anything of the kind.",25
132,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"No , nor anybody else.",25
133,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I assure the less right honourable and learned member that, when he hears me repeat what he said, he will be really astonished that he should have made any such statements. It cannot be said that his speech was not full of goodwill towards the people of Australia, because he seemed to be very much concerned for their welfare. He spoke of his admiration and love for his fellow-Australians almost with emotion. Indeed, he presented quite a lugubrious spectacle. I could not help thinking he must have been reading the Lamentations of Jeremiah-so much emotion did he display towards the people of "" his own dear State."" But I regret to say that the same generous spirit did not animate him when he spoke of the people of Western Australia. He first attacked that State because the Constitution confers, upon its Parliament the power to tax Inter-State goods for a period of five years,, and then he went So far as to declare that I and those who represented Western Australia at the Federal Convention had intentionally misled the delegates at that gathering.",25
134,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Is the Minister quoting from the report of my speech?,25
135,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I do not know what the report of the right honourable member's speech says, but I heard him affirm that the Convention had been absolutely misled.",25
136,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Certainly .,25
137,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,By misrepresentation.,25
138,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Yes ; Western Australia received consideration which properly belonged to Queensland and Tasmania.,25
139,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"If I had the time at my disposal I could quote the opinions of a dozen, or, perhaps, twenty, of the most prominent men in the Commonwealth, who, at the Convention, urged that the special circumstances of Western Australia required special treatment.",25
140,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,That was opposed to the actual facts.,25
141,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I have in my possession, and can produce, if necessary, a letter from the Government Statist in New South Wales assuring me that whilst the Constitution provided for the needs of Western Australia for today and tomorrow, it would afterwards mean ruin to her. For the right honourable member for Adelaide to urge that we wilfully misrepresented the State of affairs which existed is altogether too silly.",25
142,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Was not Western Australia a gainer by the substitution of the Federal Tariff for its own Tariff ?,26
143,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"But we did not know what the effect would be at the time. No one could possibly foresee that. For the honourable member to accuse us of having played a game and done something discreditable by means of misrepresentation is positively too silly. As a matter of fact, those who Were associated with me as delegates from Western Australia were not very eager to enter the Federation under the Constitution, as it did not appear to suit us.",26
144,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The delegates from Western Australia represented that that State would be a special loser as the result of union, when as. a matter of fact other States were the losers.",26

148,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Le t the Minister disprove my statements if he can.,26
149,Sir JOHNFORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I again desire to emphasize the fact that the sliding scale under which Western Australia joined the Federation merely means that its people have to pay the extra duty themselves. Of course some of my honourable friends opposite may urge that it is the people of the eastern States who pay it, but I cannot agree with that view. Western Australia receives that which its. people have previously contributed through the Customshouse. Can it be- I hope it is not-that the right honourable member's statement was prompted by the fact that Western Australia has progressed more rapidly than ""his own dear State."" Is he jealous",26

161,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Is it true that the Minister does not know by whom they were made?,27
162,Sir JOHNFORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I have heard it from the right honourable member.,27
163,Mr FOWLER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I rise to a point of order. I desire to know if the right honourable member for Adelaide is in order in interrogating the Minister, who is in possession of the floor of the House?",27
164,Mr SPEAKER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The right honourable member for Adelaide is not in order in constantly interjecting, nor is the Minister in order in directly addressing the right honourable member instead of the Chair, and so provoking further interjections from him. I hope that both right honourable members will respect the Standing Orders.",27
165,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The right honourable member for Adelaide has based his attack upon the Government and people of Western Australia on statements which he declares were made in this House, and which he makes his own. I was away in England at the time when it is said these statements were made, and I have never read them. I know of them only because of the reference which the right honourable member has made to them on two occasions, and as they contain serious imputations against the Government and people of Western Australia. I would ask him whether he has made any attempt to verify them. No one is justified in accepting a libellous statement as a fact, and to refer to it and confirm it, unless he takes some trouble to determine whether it is true. the right honourable and learned member made any effort to ascertain the accuracy - or otherwise of the statements to which I refer? If it were a trifling matter, it would be unworthy of the notice of the House; but it is because of its seriousness that am led to address myself to it. What are these charges which have twice been hurled against my past Administration, as well as them. .say the present Government of Western Australia? They are, in effect, that because the Government and Parliament of Western Australia have not built a railway from Coolgardie or Kalgoorlie to Esperance Bay - an undertaking which, inclusive of harbour accommodation, would involve an outlay of about 000,000-a n iniquitous state of affairs exists. It is asserted that the policy of the past and present Government of the State is worthy of the Emperor Caligula; that in consequence of it old men and young children are dying on the gold-fields, and that the failure to construct the line in question has been due solely to a desire to benefit the land-holders of Perth. The further statement is made that children are to be sacrificed, and that hard-working men have not only been inconvenienced, but exposed to risks, difficulties, and even danger to life, in order that the land-holders of Perth may make a profit on their investments. These are the statements, said to have been made in this House., which the right honourable member for Adelaide has taken upon himself to reiterate and confirm, and which he repeated for the second time on Friday last. Could a more monstrous charge be levelled against the Government, Parliament, and people of any State? If it were made by some one having no place in the public life of Australia, it might well be left alone; but inasmuch as these statements have been accepted and reiterated by the right honourable member for Adelaide, I call upon him either to substantiate or to withdraw them. I wholly deny and repudiate them. I challenge .and defy the right honourable member, or any one else, to prove one tittle in support of them. When I indignantly contradicted them the other day, the right honourable member for Adelaide rejoined-""What avails the contradiction? The fact remains, and there is no getting away from it . "" To this remark, one or two honourable members of the Opposition said, "" Hear, hear""; but I feel satisfied that they could not have understood the true import of these assertions. Such statements could not proceed Has from any save the most ungenerous and prejudiced mind. If this sort of irresponsible slander",27
166,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"It is ""irresponsible slander."" spoken by the members for the T district in question in this House. The right honourable gentleman heard those statements made, but never dared to contradict",27
167,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"When I contradicted them, the right honourable member asked- "" What avails the contradiction?"" The fact remains, and there is no getting away from it.",28
168,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,No attempt was made to contradict them.,28
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,This personal difference of opinion should be settled outside; we do not want to hear of it in this House.,28
170,Sir JOHNFORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I again ask ficent the House whether these are the kind of irresponsible charges that should be made against the people of a State by a would be leader? Is this the kind of talk that will bind the people of the States together in mutual respect and confidence?,28
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Are the made by the Minister himself likely to do so?,28
172,Sir JOHNFORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I am acting only on the defensive. And what are the facts? I shall place them before honourable members. It is all very well for honourable member for Parramatta to ask"" Why refer to these matters ?"" tened for hours to assertions of the kind on the part of the right honourable member for Adelaide, and if the honourable member for Parramatta had endeavoured to induce him to refrain from making them, there would have been no occasion for me to refute them.",28
173,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Why does not the right honourable gentleman refute then, if he can ?",28
174,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The whole gravamen of the charge is that the Government and people of Western Australia have failed to build two railways from the coast to Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie. The reason for that failure was, in the case of my own Government-and no doubt the same remark will apply to the present Government of Western Australia - that there was already a splendid railway running from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie, and indeed 200 miles further inland. That service has existed for several years; while the State Government have also expended £1,250,000 in making the Fremantle Harbor fit to accommodate the largest steamers. No other inland town in Australia possesses better railway facilities than those enjoyed by Kalgoorlie. It has not only railway communication with the coast, but also a suburban railway service. Electric trams traverse its streets, and altogether the town is a most flourishing one. It is the great railway centre of the eastern gold-fields. The main line extends for about 200 miles beyond Kalgoorlie to the northward, as I have already mentioned. Then, again, the State has expended ,£2,750,000 in giving it a permanent water supply, which is at present even more than sufficient to meet its wants. That was a very great undertaking, and I think it will be admitted that it is a most beneone. We have in Kalgoorlie a satisfied and a prosperous people. I ask honourable members to glance at the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, and to say whether he looks like a man representing an electorate in which the people are being treated inhumanely by a cruel and tyranniremarks cal Government ?",28
175,Mr FRAZER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I do not admit that we are satisfied.,28
176,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The people of Kalgoorlie are satisfied, so far as any people the in a remote part of the country could be expected to be satisfied. The right honorWe lis- able member for Adelaide appears to be under the impression that if any district is not connected with the coast by a railway line running in a straight course, a more direct railway should be constructed. From Deniliquin to Sydney the direct distance is 390 miles, whereas by rail the distance is 632 miles, or 242 miles more. If a railway were constructed from Deniliquin to Finley, a distance of only 40 miles, Deniliquin would be only 488 miles from Sydney. From Kalgoorlie to Fremantle the distance by rail is 387 miles, while the distance to Esperance Bay is about 247 miles, or about 140 miles less. From Sydney to Brisbane the direct distance is 450 miles, but the distance by rail is 723 miles, or 273 miles more. From Melbourne to Sydney the direct distance is 450 miles, and the distance by rail 576 miles. From Adelaide to Broken Hill the direct distance is 270 miles-, and the distance by rail 334 miles. From Albury to Sydney the direct distance is 286 miles, and the distance by rail 386 miles. From Sydney to Cobar the direct distance is 354 miles, and the distance by rail 459 miles. From Mount Gambier the distance to Adelaide is about 300 miles, whereas, if a railway were built to Portland, the distance would be only 65 miles. From Perth to Albany the direct distance is 240 miles, whereas the distance by rail is 340 miles.",28
177,Mr BATCHELOR,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,But Mount has connection with the coast.,29
178,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Not with a good port. I think that the argument of the right honourable member for Adelaide ,is an absurd one. He contends that because Esperance Bay is only 247 miles from Kalgoorlie, the Government of Western Australia should make a railway to that port, although the gold-fields have already a good railway connecting them with a magnificent harbour at Fremantle. Surely, however, the matter is one for the State Government, to deal with, and they can be trusted to manage their own business. Why should the people of Perth and Fremantle be represented by any one without the remotest foundation of truth or justice, as inhuman persons who have tried to make money for themselves at the expense of, and by neglecting the interests of, their fellowAustralians living on the gold-fields.",29
179,Mr FOWLER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The people of Western Australia have followed a policy common to all the States.,29
180,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The right honourable and learned member for Adelaide has spoken of the people of Fremantle as though they were bloodsuckers, who have tried to squeeze money out of the people on the gold-fields without providing them with conveniences in return. I would remind the right honourable member, however, that the early inhabitants of Western Australia mortgaged all that they had to borrow money to construct the railway to the gold-fields and to provide^ the people there with a water supply. Furthermore, persons from his ""own dear State "" of South Australia are as plent if u l as blackberries in Fremantle and in Perth. For every old inhabitant in Western Australia there are at least three newcomers. Does the right honourable member refer to them as inhuman and cruel? Then, again, if the people of Kalgoorlie desire a change for the sake of health and recreation, do they prefer to go to Esperance Bay when they, have Perth, Fremantle, Bunbury, Busselton, Albany, and the older towns of the State to visit? What would be said of the contention that the people of Broken Hill would rather go to Port Pirie for recreation than to the fair city of Adelaide, or to the other beautiful towns of South Australia? Both contentions are absurd. But we have had enough of these local matters in this House.",29
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"To o much. Gambier Sir JOHN FORREST - We have.had two long speeches from the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide, both of them in the same style, and both dealing with a matter of purely local concern. Surely these matters should be left to those who are responsible for them, the people of Western Australia! I cannot expect that honourable members should enter into my feelings in regard to the ungenerous statements that have been reiterated, because they have not realized their gravity; but I can assure them that the charges which have been levelled against me, and the Administration of which I was the head, have cut me to the very quick. I know what the people of Western Australia have done- I do not distinguish one class from another-to try to make that State prosperous. We were originally a very small community, and we mortgaged practically everything we had to float large loans for the construction of railways to the goldfields, to give the people there a water supply, to make roads, to erect telegraphs, to establish hospitals, and to provide for public batteries for the convenience of poor miners. When I think of all that was done, and know that it never for a moment entered the mind of any person in Fremantle or Perth to be unjust or cruel to, or to do other than to try to help, the population of the gold-fields, I cannot but regret-that the right honourable member for Adelaide has lent himself to the reiteration of statements which, no matter by whom made, are absolutely untrue. Surely I have just cause for complaint, that one with his great reputation should lend his aid to disseminating throughout the length and breadth of this country, such scandalous inuendoes and gross misrepresentations. I have had an unpleasant duty; but I have been compelled to perform it in the interests of myself and of those with whom I have been associated in the Government and Parliament of Western Australia. I thank honourable members for their kindness in so attentively listening to my remarks.  the able discourse of the Minister for Home Affairs, I cannot but think that this is not the right place in which to wash dirty linen.",29
182,Mr FRAZER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Why did not the honourable member say that after the speech of the right honourable member for Adelaide?  In any case, this is no place for personal quarrels. The only two persons interested in the matters dealt with by the Minister just now are himself and the right honourable member for Adelaide.",29
183,Mr FRAZER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The right honourable member for Adelaide should not have started the discussion. '  in reference to the remarks of the Minister for Trade and Customs last night. stated that he had proved himself to be not an extravagant Minister, though he had been attacked by the press for extravagance; and he told us that false economy is often extravagant. I have been afraid of extravagant administration ever since I have been in Federal politics. Whenever the creation of a new Department is spoken of, I get into a blue funk. It is not the first cost of a Department that I fear so much as the expenditure which I know will follow. Every Commonwealth Gazette nounces new appointments office and to that. The last nouncements of the kind I saw referred to several appointments to the Patent Office, to several others to the office of the Crown Solicitor, and so on. The States are not saving one penny by reason of the Commonwealth administration. This Government keep on increasing expenditure in every direction. We were told by Sir Edmund Barton, when he was advocating the adoption of the Enabling Bill , that if Federation were accomplished there would be so much saved to the States.",30
184,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The States should reduce their expenditure.  member spend as much as he likes ! That is what he would wish.,30
185,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Certainl y not. The new appointees to the Patent Department will, I think, all be transferred from the service of the States.  Hitherto the public servants of the States have been elbowed out of their positions by others, though men who have been in the Public Service ever since they were boys must know more of the work of the Departments in which they have been employed than new men can know. We have now an Inspector-General of Works, saw it stated in the press a few days ago that, as there are no offices for him. the Commonwealth will have to provide some. The Government wish the Victorian Government to add another story to the Commonwealth offices in your Spring-street; but the Victorian Governletter ment do not see their way to do so. I do Kershaw not blame them, because we are in Melbourne only on sufferance, and the sooner we get away the better. The Minister for Trade and Customs told us that the Opposition were largely to blame for the delay that has taken place in connection with the settlement of the Capital site question. I He ask him to make a definite charge against the Opposition in regard to that matter. The question would have been settled long ago if the Cabinet had been agreed upon it. Of course, the honourable member is only playing the political game for all that it is worth when he makes a statement of that kind. I should be glad to vote tomorrow to have a site chosen in New South Wales in the manner provided by the Constitution. The Minister also accuses the Opposition of having delayed business by speaking for a period of eight months; but by our an- action in connection with the Tariff we have to this saved the producers and consumers of the an- country over jQi,000,000 of taxation. It is all very well for the Minister to say that the Government went to the polls to secure fiscal peace and preferential trade; but that was not the whole of the issue. I do not wish for fiscal peace. I wish to take off as many burdens as possible from the shoulders of our consumers and primary producers. I will give the honourable member an instance of how he is taxing the exports as well as the imports of the Commonwealth. He mows that the Opposition secured reductions in the Tariff only at the point of the bayonet; the Government did nbt concede anything unless they knew that the numbers were against them. I desire to bring before honourable members the circumstances under which certain exports from Queensland have been taxed. The Government were not satisfied with taxing the whole of the machinery used in the industries of that State, and the eatables and drinkables required by the people, but they imposed a duty upon the meat wrappers used in packing meat for export. These wrappers are not required for home consumption, but are used entirely for ex port purposes, and yet the beneficent Government, which is always talking about protecting national and natural industries, imposed a burden upon one of the most and I important enterprises in Queensland. On the 3rd February I received the following letter: We, the Queensland Meat Export and Agency Co. Limited, take the liberty of enclosing information, copy of an extract from a which we have received from Messrs. B. and Co. L t d . , 68 Aldersgate-street, London, E.C., dated iSth December last, with reference to the Australian import duty on meat wrappers. The remarks are self-explanatory, and we need only add that the removal of the duty would have our hearty approval. Extract from letter from Messrs. B. Kershaw and Co. L t d . , dated London, 18th December, 1903 :The Argentine Government charge no import duty on Irozen meat wrappers. Consequently we send our clients in that country stockinette made into mutton, hinds of mutton, legs of mutton, lamb, beef (for liners under hessian) bags, and hessian made into beef; and mutton (for Cape trade) bags. All these bags are branded here, and complete in every way for placing on the meat. Considering the keen competition in the frozen meat trade, we are strongly of the opinion that it is high time the import duty charged in your Colony on meat wrappers should be abolished, *SD as to place you on an equal footing in this respect with your Argentine rivals. There is no calico used in the Argentine trade; but for the colonial trade we supply large quantities, chiefly in the piece owing to import duty. That describes the position of the meat export trade, which is one of the primary industries, I might even say the backbone, of the Commonwealth. Instead of encouraging - such industries, the Government are doing all they possibly can to stifle them. Upon the subject of Customs administration, I have a letter written by a friend at Rockhampton, who saysI most sincerely hope that before long the powerful voices of your party will be heard with reference to the still lamentable state of affairs with regard to Customs work. Not only is no assistance whatever given by the officers of this Department, but every effort seems to be madeto induce the unfortunate importer to make mistakes, and then down him. The great tariff bodk is now of very little use ; so many alterations having been and still are being made in it that unless some assistance is given to the public by the Customs clerks, it is as much as a man's life is worth to attempt to pass an entry. As one of the oldest Custom House agents here a good portion of my income was derived from passing entries: but it has become so irritating and vexatious and so much lime is lost that I have practically had to refuse to do any Customs work, unless where our business compels. I could fill pages of foolscap showing how the unfortunate importer suffers from the hateful system. The Department has almost despotic power, and where it is found that any fraud is intended, the delinquent should be punished with the utmost rigour of the law; b»r at present all the punishment is directed at the innocent. The idea seems to be, when an entrv is presented, not of receiving the duty, but ""Can we have him in any way?"" To put it plainlv. it is just as bad as if you went to the railwav station at Longreach, and asked the fare to Emerald, and the clerk were to say, ""Find out from the time-table,"" and if you dare to presem one halfpenny less than the exact fare, you are likely to get seven years' hard labour. Why tV>Customs more than any other Department should have the power to act as they do is a puzzle. They won't even give .change-the exact amount musl be tendered; and it often happens that for want of a few pence change a day is lost, and the unlucky individual put to serious trouble and expense. Kindly note that I am not referring to the Rockhampton Customs; the game goes on at every port the same, and it is about time that something was done to put an end to it. Surely every man should have the right to present his papers at the Customs, inquire what duty he has to pay, and pass his own entry without being put to the expense of employing any agent. Even in the case of the Inter-State .certificates the trouble is almost as great as and sometimes greater than in the old days before Federation. I shall be very pleased indeed to give you any information on the subject you may wish, and if you are the means of making an alteration you will have the blessings of thousands of miserable people, whose lives now are made wretched by this exasperating system. I know that every word contained in the letter is true, and that the writer, who is a Customs agent, has had to give up his business; he is afraid to go to the Customs-house lest an endeavour be made to involve him in law proceedings. It was very amusing to hear the Minister for Trade and Customs complaining about the treatment he had received at the hands of the Oppos'itio:. Does not the Minister play the game of party politics for all it is worth? He shed crocodile tears over the way in which the Opposition had attacked him, when he knew quite well that every one of their guns were spiked. That is why he came down upon them like a cart-load of bricks. There is a nice little bit of padding in the Governor General's Speech upon the subject of old-age pensions. Paragraph 4 reads, as follows :The re-adjustment of Federal and State finances contemplated in such an arrangement will, it is hoped, present an opportunity for the adoption of a uniform system of old-age pensions throughout the Commonwealth. No one knows better than the Minister for Trade and Customs that that is nothing, more than padding. The leader of the Opposition denounced the Government for having included that paragraph in the speech, but he did not speak half strongly enough to please me. I shall refer honourable members to what was said by the Minister, two years ago, when we were discussing the .question of old-age pensions, on the motion of the honourable member for Darwin.",30
186,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I hope the honourable member will quote the portion of my speech which I have underlined for him.  me. The question of old-age pensions was referred to in the Governor General's Speech, at the opening of the first Parliament, and the Prime Minister at every place at which he appeared spoke of the advantages of a universal system of old-age pensions. When, however, the Government were put to the practical test, this was the feeling expressed by the Minister for Trade and Customs. Speaking on 2nd August, 1091, he saidThe honourable member for Tasmania said that we should be generous to that State, and that if Tasmania had not enough money to pay old-age pensions we ought to provide it for her. In view of all these statements, I think it would be wise to wait and see how our finances, pan Out before making any declaration as to what we. should do in regard to any particular State. That is one of the reasons which almost preclude the Government from doing anything at the present time. The Minister told us that we could not do anything in 1901, and I should like to know in what respect the financial position of the Commonwealth has changed, to render it possible for us to do anything now. Yet the Minister told us last night that the Government intended to do something.",31
187,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I did not say anything that was inconsistent with my utterance on the former occasion.,32
188,Mr KINGSTON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Where is the Ministerial nest-egg ?  may be very appropriately asked. The Minister went on to say, upon the occasion previously referred toAs far as I can judge, taking as a basis the expenditure which has been incurred op to the present, it would require between ^1,000,000 and 100,000 per year to pay the whole "" f ihe pensioners throughout the various States, excluding New Zealand. That is a very large sum to be called upon to pay out of the Commonwealth funds, shackled as they are by the clause to reference has been made. The clause referred to is the Braddon section, which is still in existence, and yet the Government think that the padding which they have introduced into the Governor General's Speech will catch the eye of the Labour Party. So far as I am concerned, nothing will catch my eye upon this subject until a Bill is introduced. Let the - Government show their sincerity by bringing down a Bill. The Minister knows full well that if the Government took over the tobacco industry and made it a national monopoly, they would be able ""to find all the money necessary to provide for a scheme of old-age pensions. In fact, there are a hundred and one ways of accomplishing the purpose. Paragraph 6 of the Governor General's Speech reads as follows: With a"" view to giving assistance wherever possible to those engaged in the cultivation of the soil, and as a preliminary to the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau, you will be invited to consider the best means of ' assisting the farmer, by bounties and otherwise, to grow new crops and find new markets. Speedier and cheaper transportation to the large centres of population of meat, butter, and fruit, under improved conditions, is much to be desired. Now, what did the Government do when the pastoralists of western New South Wales and of Queensland were in difficulties through the drought? They did not offer them the slightest assistance, and now the Minister of Trade and Customs has the barefaced cheek to shield himself behind the action of the States Governments in regard to the reduction of railway freights. What has that to do with the Commonwealth? If the States Governments like to carry passengers or produce for nothing, that is not our concern ? The drought was a national calamity, through which we all suffered, and the least the Government could have done when the people were on the verge of starvation was to come to their rescue. The Ministers were protectionists, but they were intent upon protecting themselves, rather than the national industries of the Commonwealth. I suppose that the paragraph, to which I have just referred, is intended to afford comfort to the pastoralists, but they do not want any aid from the Government. God has been good to them in giving them plenty of grass and water for their stock, and they want no assistance from the Government. All they desire is that they may be left alone, but the Government will not do that. Reference is made in the speech to the carriaee which of mails and perishable produce from Australia. I cannot believe that the Government were serious when they called for tenders for the mail service. If they were, why should they differentiate between Queensland and other States? They have yet to explain away their action in inviting the mail companies to say how much more they would want if they were required to make Brisbane a port of call. That was tantamount to encouraging them to name such a figure that the Government would have good reason for declining to accede to the wishes of the people of Queensland. If there is to be a Commonwealth mail service, every State should have a share in the benefits, and Queensland should receive the same treatment as other States. The Government further state that they intend to profit by the experience which was gained in the recent elections by amending our Electoral Act. But I wish to ask the Minister for Home Affairs how he intends to treat the electoral officers who were responsible for the numbering of ballot-papers, thereby rendering them informal ? I know of one instance in which eighty ballot-papers were thus invalidated. Surely some action should be taken; otherwise in the future any unscrupulous person will be able to turn the balance of an election. Let us assume, for example, that at the approaching Melbourne election numbers are placed by the electoral officials in the corners of the ballot-papers, and the latter are thereby rendered informal. The result may be to disturb the whole of the arrangements, and possibly to cause the return of the wrong candidate. I come now to the action of the Government during the late elections. In this connection I desire to give one in stance which goes to show how much brain is centred upon the Treasury benches. They despatched a Drake to Queensland and he obtained a "" duck. ' cornia a labour candidate who is a strong protectionist, and a straight-out free trader, were rival candidates for the seat. Instead of leaving the contest to them, the Government put forward a protectionist candidate, who received 2,000 votes. The labour candidate was returned, and the free-trader was second upon the poll. Yet the Government after having done all In their power to prevent his election have the temerity to ask that labour representative for his vote. Then the Attorney-General visited Brisbane to advance the candidature of Mr Macdonald-Paterson. a result that gentleman's chances were promptly squelched. The same thing happened in the case of Mr Glassey. Indeed, wherever the Attorney-General spoke on behalf of candidates, he effectively settled their chances of election.",32
189,Mr RONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Nonsens e !  undeniable facts. These instances show the character of the electioneering tactics which were adopted by the Government. H a d they served me as they did the honourable member for Capricornia, I should leave them some time in the field when they ought to be in the lane. I pass now to the statement in the Governor General's Speech, that the Ministry have no desire to re-open the fiscal question. Nevertheless they propose to submit a Bill which' is designed to encourage the iron industry ' by means of bounties. Does not the Minister for Trade and Customs think that such a measure will re-open the fiscal question? Personally I am quite prepared to remain here a week for the purpose of preventing any bounties from being granted in that direction.' A more barefaced robbery of the people was never attempted. When Ministers submit a proposal of that sort, they will find that the free-trade members of the House are just as strong in their fiscal faith as they ever were. The Minister for Trade and Customs referred to the question of preferential trade. How do the Government suggest that a preference should be given to British goods? They propose to retain the existing duties, and to raise those which are operative against the foreigner. In other words, they will take all they can get from the mother country, and give nothing in return. In speaking upon the Address in Reply, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports made a very amusing reference to this question. He assured us that the In Capri- agricultural industry in the old country had declined. "" Why,"" he exclaimed, "" we cannot do more than make a man insolvent."" Yet the Government are prepared to offer nt> real preference to the mother country. But our party, I am pleased to say-'-r",33

I desire to justify the action of the Labour Party in connection with the naval and military estimates. The honourable member for Wentworth has accused us of running the show. We have done nothing of the sort-w e have merely assisted others to run it. The members of the Labour Party wish to obtain nothing but the best talent so far as Defence Forces are concerned; but we do not want drawing-room soldiers. When. the Estimates were under consideration we system. were perfectly prepared to vote the Go Mr KELLY vernment ..any money which they might  jected to spending it upon frills, gold and spurs.

Why, whenever of Major-General Hutton is about to visit .any portion of the Commonwealth one would imagine that a host of Indian princes were on their way to a durbar :such as was recently witnessed at Delhi. I desire to bring under the notice of honourable member for Wentworth one stance of extravagance in military expendirecruited ture. I refer to the occasion on which Major-General Hutton and his staff visited Bathurst by a special train, and remained there for only twenty minutes.

I may have interlace, jected whilst the honourable member was that if it were intended to conduct our Defence Force upon the same lines as those upon which it has hitherto been run, estabit would be better to starve it out of existence. Personally, I am of the opinion that it would have paid the in Commonwealth, upon the inauguration the Federation, to dismiss the whole of the members of that force and to have made an entirely fresh start. The honourable member for Wentworth must not run away with the idea that the Labour Party are opposed to all military systems. the In time of national emergency the very inmen who would carry our rifles would be from the ranks of the labouring classes. Who were those that volunteered for service in South Africa? They were chiefly members of the labouring classes.",34

It is easy enough to guess that that. there are chickens in eggs when one can see I still hope to that better counsels will prevail, and that the yellow agony will not be may introduced into South Africa to displace white labour. I have no intention of dethe House at greater length. Having listened to the remarks of the Minister the for Trade and Customs, I am of opinion octhat he might have been more generous towards the free-trade party, in view of the session very able speech which was delivered ill at the close of the Tariff debates by the right honourable member for Adelaide. the On that occasion the right honourable memwe ber said, in effect- "" The Tariff is done with ; we have had a hard task to perform, and both the Government and the Opposition have sought, according to their lights, to do what is right. Now that the trouble is all over, let us shake hands and be friends."" get It seems to me, however, that the Minister for Trade and Customs will never be out friendly towards the free-trade party. one speaks of free-trade to him, the effect is very like that which follows the waving of a red flag in the face of a bull. The honourable gentleman roars and bounds about like a bull in a china shop. He certainly possesses some good characteristics, and I feel satisfied that he does not always mean all that he says. I suppose that there is no honourable member in this House who has a more generous disposition, and if he'would only be a little more generous in his criticism of members of the free trade party the whole House would be better pleased with him. »",34

Politics is a game, and I suppose that the best must win. The remarks made by the MinisStates. ter for Trade and Customs on 2nd August, 1901, in reference to the question of Commonwealth system of old-age pensions are already on record, and Hansard has recorded the remarks made by him last night in regard to the question. I trust that the next occasion upon which he is called to deal with the subject will be he introduces a Bill to give effect to system. ' Mr WILKINSON (Moreton) - It is my intention to detain the House at any length; but I am not one of those who lieve that time is wasted in discussing Address in Reply. It is the one opportunity afforded honourable members to ventilate their grievances generally, and to bring the northern parts of Queensland. under the notice of the Ministry and ParCharles liament matters which otherwise could be to these demands. brought forward only by special motion. had, for example, to move the adjournment of the House on one occasion last session in order to draw attention to a subject which carrying trade. has been discussed once more during the present debate, and which materially affects Queensland. I refer to the question of oversea mail contracts. Honourable members will recollect that on the occasion to which I refer, nearly the whole of one sitting occupied in discussing this matter. But when it is possible to deal with that and other matters in one speech-as is the case in a speech on an Address in Reply-w save rather than waste time in availing selves of the opportunity. I should like vernment. to endorse all that has fallen from the lips of other representatives of Queensland upon the question of the oversea mail contracts. We contend that, in this respect, Queensland should be placed on a footing of equality with the other' States. It is not the question of the carriage of mails in which we are most vitally interested.' We have to remember that in addition to the carriage of our mails it is proposed that these steamers shall be fitted with cold-storage, chambers, so that they may be really up-todate ocean carriers, and as Queensland will be called upon to contribute her share of the subsidy, we naturally and justly claim that she has a right to share in the service. That very has been our contention from the first, and it will continue to be so. If we are to have purely a mail service, I contend that where the State railways begin the oversea service not should terminate, and that the Commonwealth should pay accordingly; but if it is to be a commercial service let it be side one that will serve the whole of the I am sorry that the overtures made to the Postmaster-General a in regard to this matter have been such that he is unable to accept them; but I also see no reason why we should despair. Competition exists in the oversea carrying trade, as it does in relation to most other matters, and I believe that this competition when. will operate rather to our advantage than the to our disadvantage. I only wish that it were in our power to do as Sir Charles not Lilley, one-time Premier of Queensland, great did with the shipping companies. At the betime in question there was one huge monothe poly running vessels along the Australian coast, and an exhorbitant price was demanded for the carriage of our mails to Sir Lilley refused, however, to accede He chartered one vesWe sel, and ordered the construction of another, to carry the mails, and also to enter into competition for the general When the monopolists saw that they were likely to lose the general carrying trade, as well as the mail serthe vice, they gave in. If the Commonwealth could treat the shipping companies in a similar way, and charter vessels for our was oversea mail service, good results would follow. It seems rather a large proposal to make, but the effect of the action taken in Queensland was to bring the steam-ship e owners to their knees, and to cause them ourto agree to the terms, proposed by the Go",35
200,Mr GROOM,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The late Honourable T. J . Bvrnes threatened to take similar action. ' Mr WILKINSON - Quite so.,35
201,Mr FOWLER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"It is not a larger undertaking than is the,running of railways by the States.",36
202,Mr WILKINSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Quite so. The States are common carriers, so far as the railways are concerned, and if this proposal were carried out the Commonwealth would be a common carrier over the ocean. Not only did the shipping companies accept the terms imposed by Sir Charles L i l ley, but they took over the chartered vessel, and purchased the Governor Blackall, the construction of which had been ordered.",36
203,Mr FOWLER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,That is a good example for the Commonwealth Government.,36
204,Mr WILKINSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I think it is. I do not know whether it would be too large an undertaking for the Commonwealth at the present time; but I am certainly hot one who would submit to the dictation of either the P. and O. Company or any other body of steamship owners.,36
205,Mr KELLY,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"It is a question of bargaining, not of dictation.",36
206,Mr WILKINSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"E x a c t l y ; but steam-ship companies appear to think that they have the Commonwealth at their mercy. If we can show them that they are mistaken their bargaining will be very much more reasonable than it has been. The honourable member for Darling Downs last night dealt very effectively with this matter, and I shall therefore not enlarge upon it. There is little to fear with regard to the carriage of Australian produce to the markets of the world. As the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has pointed out, Queensland has arranged for a new line of steamers,. fitted with the latest appliances for the carriage of her produce to the markets of the old 'world, and within the last three or four months butter to the value of ,£76,000 or thereabouts has been shipped by this line. This is only one of many items. The butter industry in Queensland is assuming very large dimensions, and, great as are the proportions which that industry has assumed in Victoria, I believe that in Queensland its possibilities are even greater. As this industry, as well as the frozenmeat and other industries expand, we shall. . not have to fear any lack of transport facilities for our goods, for only those vessels that are most effectively fitted up will secure our trade. Reference has been made during the course of the debate to the conduct of the recent elections. I myself observed a good many faults in the course of the campaign; but on u the whole, considering that we had a new system to work, and that, with a view to minimizing the expense, we placed that system as far as possible in the hands of members of the Public Service-me n to whom the work was practically new-w e have very little of which to complain. It is a matter of comparative ease to point to faults, but' when we consider the disadvantages under which the officials had to labour, it seems to me that the mistakes of which we have to complain are remarkably few. So far as the conduct of the elections in my own division was concerned, I had not the slightest fault to find with any of the officials. There is one particular passage in the Governor General's Speech with which I am very much pleased. It indicates the intention of the Government to endeavour to stimulate ' our__ native, industries, to encourage the starting of new industries, and to find more markets in the more thickly populated centres of the world. In the course of his able speech at the Conference the of States Treasurers, recently held in Melbourne, reference was made by the Prime Minister to the Queensland exhibit at the Royal Agricultural Society's show, held at Melbourne last year. The honourable and learned gentleman mentioned the attention paid to the exhibit as an illustration of the good effects which would follow the advertising of the Commonwealth in Great Britain. Having inspected that exhibit, and having heard many comments made by visitors to the show from all parts of Australia, I feel satisfied that the action taken by Queensland had a most beneficial effect. I am at one with the Prime Minister, and I believe with, every other honourable member, in the opinion that Australia's chief need at the present time is more population, but I do not agree that assisted immigration is desirable. If we reverted to a system of assisted immigration, we should ""elikely to attract to our shores men who wo ld ,J be a tax on the community, rather than those who would assist the people already here in bearing the burdens which we have under-: taken in order to develop the continent. We have placed ourselves under a great responsibility by expending large sums of money, on public works. They are far ahead of our present requirements, but are designed to give access to our mineral and pastoral wealth, and the few who are here are bearing the burden. If we bring persons to our shores who have not the means to at once become, producers we shall only add to, rather than decrease our burdens. Advertise Australia by all means; advertise her products. Let the world know what Australia can produce, what her climate really is, and let us send samples of our products, not only to the British Isles, but to the Continent of Europe. Some of our best settlers have come from Germany, Denmark, and other Continental countries, and we should not confine our efforts to the British Isles. The stream of immigration which is flowing to America is not an all-British one; a very large portion of it comprises persons from continental countries, who make most desirable citizens.",36
207,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Including ' Italians.,37
208,Mr WILKINSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"There are Italians who are very desirable citizens, while there are others who are not. I believe that Italians who engage in agricultural and vitir cultural pursuits are a most desirable class; whereas those who grind organs and carry monkeys round the streets of our cities are undesirable. It has been said, of the land laws of Australia, that nearly every member of Parliament has a. land bill in his pocket, and it is no doubt true that nearly everv member of Parliament holds a different opinion as to the way in which to increase our population from abroad. I have said in the Pailiament of Queensland, and also. I believe, in this House, that we have only to make the conditions of life attractive in Australia-to make it known in the older parts of the world that the conditions of life here are more attractive than are those elsewhere-whe n the tide of emigration will flow to, instead of from, Australia. How this is to be done is a matter of opinion, and I should occupy too much time in placing my views on this subject before the House. ",37
209,Mr WILKINSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"When the matter comes to be discussed upon a separate motion, I shall have something to say in regard to it. As to advertising Austialian products by the sending of exhibits to the old country, the Prime Minister said' very truly that the exhibits sent by Queensland to Melbourne were regarded with rather unfriendly eyes by some Victorians, who thought that it was not right for one State to take action which might tend to attract the population of another State. I do not think that there were half-a-dozen items in the exhibit ieferred to which could not have been produced within the Moreton electoral division, so that honourable members can imagine what an exhibition could be made of the products of the whole of Australia, from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Wilson's Promontory, and from Point Danger ,to the Leuwin. Haidly anything can be pioduced anywhere which could not be produced in Australia. I should like now to say a word or two in reply to what was said by the honourable member for Maranoa about the duty on meat wraps. I have received from the Meat' Export Company a letter similar to that which he has read, and I agiee with him that until we begin to manufacture these things for ourselves, they should be exempt from duty.",37
210,Mr WATKINS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Of course, everything required by Queensland' producers should be admitted, free, while things required' by the producers of other States are subjected to duty. Mr WILKINSON. - The honourable member has never known me to take that position. I have consistently voted for the imposition of duties upon articles which we manufacture, or are likely to manufacture, and for the free admission of articles which we cannot, or are not likely to, manufacture or produce. I am just as proud to declare myself a piotectionist as the honourable member for. Maranoa is to declare himself a free-trader.",37
211,Mr TUDOR,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The honourable member for Maranoa: is not a free-trader in respect to ID £1X1 £LX1 cLS,37
212,Mr WILKINSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The honourable member for Maranoa should know, that if large manufacturing populations spring up in our larger centres, meat wraps will hardly be requiied, because most of our meat will be consumed, within the Commonwealth. He seemed to imply that the honourable member' for Wide Bay is a protectionist because Maryborough, Bundae berg, and Gympie are protectionist, in their fiscal opinions. That remark was ungenerous. The honourable member, for Wide Bay would not sink his principles to please the electors in that way. He is a protectionist as the honourable member for Maranoa, is' a free-trader,, by conviction ; though it - might be retorted upon the honourable member for Maranoa that he is a free-trader because cattle and. sheep are the chief products of his electorate. I hope that the day is not distant, when we shall not only manufacture meat wraps and other, cotton goods, but shall grow the cotton from which they are made. There is now a movement for the re-starting of the cotton industry in Queensland and in other, parts of the Commonwealth. In my opinion, cotton growing could be made remunerative even without the employment of coloured or other cheap labour. I was connected with the industry years ago, when only the cotton fibre was used, and the by-products were allowed to go to waste, and from the knowledge I possess I am firmly convinced that profitable crops could now be obtained by the employment of white labour. If we can. grow our own cotton and weave it into cloth for the use of producers in .other industries, why should we not do so? The work of growing and manufacturing the cotton - would provide means of subsistence for a large population, who, in turn, would consume the products of others, and would help the community to bear the burden which we have undertaken to carry in order to open - up our waste lands and make them available for settlement - The honourable member for Maranoa deprecates the giving of bonuses for the production of cotton, as he deprecates the giving of any : - bonus; but I do not agree with him that to open the subject is to disturb the fiscal question. Even some free-traders advocate the giving of bonuses.",37
213,Mr THOMAS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Onl y very peculiar free traders do so.,38
214,Mr WILKINSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The honourable and learned member for Corio reminds me that the late Sir Edward Braddon, as a member of the Iron Bonus Commission, recommended the giving of a bonus for the production of iron. He was one of the most ardent free-traders in this Chamber, and I have heard other free-traders say that, while they object to protection .because the duties are imposed for all time, they do not object to bonuses, because the payment of them can be made terminable at the end of a certain period.",38
215,Mr THOMAS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,-We admit that bonuses are not quite so bad as duties.  give us his experience of bonuses?,38
216,Mr WILKINSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I have had experience of bonuses only in connection with the growing of cotton in Queensland, years ago, at the time of, and shortly after, the American war, when the price was high because of the shortage in Lancashire. The Queensland Government then offered a bonus of £ i o for every 300 lbs. of clean cotton, that is, cotton without the seed. A few engaged in the industry, and many middlemen, made their fortunes out of it because the farmers were not able to provide machinery for ginning and had therefore to sell for any price they could get to a few large u 2 storekeepers and others who brought machinery into the State and obtained the bonus given by the Government. The farmers who paid to have their cotton ginned had to wait for their money until the return came from the old country, which took nearly twelve months. In those days there was no cable service, and no ocean greyhounds, and the sailing vessels used to take from seventy to 112 and 120 days on the voyage from here to England. Then the insurance charges were high, because of the length of the voyage and the liability of the cotton to sweat, and heat, and catch fire, and the freight charges were high for similar reasons. Lastly, there were no branch railways running into the country to convey the cotton from the fields to the ports of shipment, so that local carriage was much higher than it would be today.  of the other bonus.",38
217,Mr WILKINSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"No doubt the honourable member refers to the bonus on manufactured cotton, which, I admit, was an absolute failure, because the control of it was given into wrong hands. Similarly, if the sugar bonus were wrongly administered, it would be a failure, though I am sure that the honourable member believes too strongly in a 'White Australia to advocate its removal because of that possibility. It is not because there was"" mal-administration in the past that we need submit to it in the future. It must be remembered, too, that in those days only the staple of the rotton was used, 'the more valuable products going to waste. Now, instead of thousands of tons of seed being thrown away, the hull would be made into 'potash and the pulp pressed into oil cake. Cotton oil is now an article of commerce as valuable as the staple itself.",38
218,Mr MCDONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,They were recently preserving cotton seed at Ipswich.,38
219,Mr WILKINSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The seed was sold to the farmers as food for cattle, in its raw state, without having the oil pressed out of it. No doubt, however, there will be an opportunity to discuss the whole matter in detail when the Minister gives effect to his - intention to propose a bonus for cotton grown by white labour. There must, of course, be the stipulation that white labour only shall be employed, because otherwise Chinese will rush into the industry. While on this subject, I wish to draw the attention of the Ministry to a phase of the alien question which has not yet been referred to. Our legislation has driven a large number of Asiatics, mainly Chinamen, put of the sugar industry, and they are now taking up land on lease, in the northern parts of Queensland particularly, and growing fruit, chiefly bananas and pine apples. Their competition with the white growers is so severe that it seems to me that measures must soon be taken for the .protection of the latter. Not only does the .production of bananas and pine apples at cheaper rates than those for which they can be produced by white labour make the'competition of white men in that branch of .industry impossible, but by decreasing the value of other fruit it interferes with the profits of other white fruit-growers. I desire to direct the attention of Ministers to one or two .little.matters regarding which I have asked for information. One of these has relation to the administration of the Patents Act. Last week I asked the. Prime Minister, on notice Whether a working man, say in Queensland, .who desires to obtain a patent under the Commonwealth law, will be in as good a position as one who resides in Melbourne, or wherever the seat of government'may be? To that question I received this replyYes. All persons in the Commonwealth desir,ous of obtaining letters patent are on the same fooling. All can make application through the post, personally, or by a patent attorney, or agent. The majority of mechanical inventors poor working men, and they prefer to attend to their business personally, .without the intervention of too many attorneys or patent agents. Honourable members will see at a militarythe expenditure glance that under present conditions an indown ventor in Western Australia or Queensland would be placed at a great disadvantage as current year? compared with one located at the seat .Government. When the Bill was under inclined .consideration, it was suggested that patents offices should be established at all the cipal cities of the States, so that applicants for patent rights might lodge their appliwhose cations, meet any objections that might raised, and have an opportunity to inspect all plans and specifications of past patents. The second question addressed to the Minister wasI f a dispute arose regarding his patent rights .would it be necessary for a Queenslander to journey to the seat of government to fight his cause ? .To that I received this answerNot necessarily. Matters of small importance could be settled by post, but in the event of any serious dispute arising, say, for instance, opposition, it would be necessary for the parties to be represented by a patent attorney or agent, or to attend personally. Mr Wilkinson. If a man is to be represented by a patent agent or an attorney, he must, consult him, and although it might not be necessary for an inventor to .travel from the State in which he was residing to the seat of government, the attorney would have to come to him, because it would be impossible to make satisfactory communications by post. The other question I addressed to the Prime Minister wasIs it intended, in the working of the Patents Act, to provide for the distribution of all necessary information relating to patents granted in all the more important centres within the Commonwealth, so that persons desiring to inspect the same may be able to do so without journeying to the seat of government? The answer to that I regard as eminently satisfactory, because the Minister was good enough to reply in the affirmative. I do not propose to enter upon a lengthy discussion of our defences at this stage, because I recognise that the proper time to do that is when the defence estimates are before us. Last week I asked the Minister for DefenceWhether it is true, as reported in the Queensland press, that recruits for the Defence Force in that State would not receive uniforms in time to enable them to go into their annual encampment? The reply wasEvery effort is being made to supply uniforms prior to the annual camps of training. are The second question was-rWil l the Minister sav whether or not the ^25,000 which the Right 'Honourable the Treasurer anticipates will be saved this year on ordinary is being saved by keeping strength of the regiments, and by delaying the supply of uniforms to such recruits as have joined the Defence Force during the of The answer to that was "" No."" I am rather to think that the Minister has been misinformed, for I have here an extract prinfrom the Brisbane Courier of 29th February, in which an officer of the Department, name I do not wish to give, is reprebe sented as having, upon arriving at a town in my electorate, congratulated the commanding officer upon the manner in which Prime his men had turned out. The officer is stated to have addedThe recruits would not have their uniforms in time for camp, but he asked them to show the Commonwealth their zeal by joining the movement to supply uniform at their own expense. There have been complaints of the great difficulty experienced in bringing some of the regiments up to their full strength. Can this be wondered at, when not only is pay deferred, but recruits are asked to go into camp either without uniforms, or with uniform's provided at their own expense. The officer in question was good enough to add' He was determined to take the whole regiment into camp, and in uniform of some sort, and he asked the officers and men to throw their hearts into the movement. An extract from the Brisbane Courier of an earlier date reads as follows: . Sir George Turner anticipates that full y ^25,000 will be saved this year on ordinary military expenditure, and adds that this will enable the military authorities to exceed the vote of ,£75,000 for munitions of war. How this money is being saved the Treasurer could not explain, but the conclusion come to is that the forces have not been recruited up to the strength provided for in the Appropriation Act. In next year's Estimates provision will be found .for a greatly increased supply of military stores. It would not be at all difficult to provide for an increased supply of military stores if the rank and file of the forces were starved. I am entirely at one with the honourable member for Maranoa in the remarks he has made, and I do not think that the most democratic honourable member is averse to a reasonable expenditure upon proper defences. It has been pointed out time after time, and Ministers themselves have agreed, that there should be no expenditure on frippery-upo n scarlet and gingerbread-bu t that the defence vote should be spent exclusively upon what would be of service in time of war. The money referred to has been saved at the expense of the real fighting forces. Some of it has, perhaps, been spent in the purchase of rifles and other munitions of war, but a good deal more than 'ought to have been so expended has been devoted to keeping up the parade of pomp amongst the staff officers. I do not propose to touch upon the Conciliation and - Arbitration Bill, beyond stating that my attitude is well known, because I made my position very clearduring last session. When the Bill comes before us I shall not deviate from the course I then laid down. I desire to direct the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs to a small matter that has arisen out of our Excise legislation. I had occasion to approach the Department a short time ago on behalf of a cigar-maker in my constituency, whose small factory turned out only about 90,000 or 100,000 cigars in the course of the year. This factory was the man's means of living, and was, in fact, his all. When the Custom-house at Ipswich was closed, no inspection of this factory could be made unless an officer travelled from Brisbane. I asked the authorities at the,latter place whether it would be possible for them to send a man to make regular inspections, but they represented that they could not do so, and led me to understand that a licence would not be granted, because the cost of inspection would be too great. There was no desire on the part of honourable members to crush out small men, and thus strengthen the big monopolies. I had intended to refer to certain matters relating to the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department, but I shall leave these to be dealt with on a future occasion, and endeavour in the meantime to arrive at some understanding with the Minister regarding them. I need not further detain the House. I came here as a supporter of the Government, and intend to accord them warm general support, subject to the con* ditions I laid down when I was before the electors in regard to the Navigation and Conciliation and Arbitration Bills. From those conditions I cannot depart, even though the fate of the Government may be involved. In all other matters I shall give them mv cordial support.",38
220,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY," The truth of the statement of the Prime Minister during the early days of the first Parliament, that the Commonwealth was a living organization, and that as such it would grow and extend its powers is well demonstrated in the speech now before us. Certainly, if we were to attempt to deal with half the measures therein mentioned, this session would extend so far that we should have to make arrangements for a Christmas' ad^ journmertt. It would have been far better if the Government had confined themselves to two or three main measures, important for their national character or urgency, without bothering about other proposals which are mentioned in the speech, I take it, merely in order that they may play the part of ""window, dressing."" I desire to address myself specially to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. That is the only proposed legislation to which I shall refer; my other remarks will' be confined to matters of administration. I am almost compelled to declare my position in regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, because my name was included in a list published in one of the daily newspapers which purported to indicate those honourable members who were prepared to vote against railway servants being brought' within the scope of the measure. I propose to take up the same position that I adopted when the measure was before us last year. I then said that I was in favour of bringing railway servants within the scope of the Bill, because I held that if a Government entered into trading enterprises, it should be subject to the same limitations as other employers, and that it would be most unfair for a Government to expect to trade if it were unwilling to submit to the same legislation that applied to rival employers. During the last electoral campaign I stated that if my opposition to the Government upon this matter would have the effect of bringing the free-trade party into power, I should have to choose the lesser of two evils, and that, in order the Government, I should not, so far as I was concerned, insist upon bringing railway servants within the scope of the BilL In view, however, of the declarations made by the leader of the Opposition and a number of his followers that they intend to support the Government, the question loses its party complexion, and I 'feel that I shall be free to vote according to the dictates of my conscience.",40
221,Mr GB EDWARDS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Why should not the members of the Opposition choose the lesser-of two evils?,41
222,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"J have no doubt they will choose what they regard as the lesser of two evils. This question is entirely robbed of its party aspect when we find the leader of the Opposition and members of what may be called the Conservative corner on the 'Opposition side coming to the support of the 'Government. During this debate another announcement has been made, - which is of very .great importance, because, in my opinion, it means a definite re-arrangement of parties in this House. Hitherto' the chief subject of difference between members of the Opposition and Ministerial supporters has been the fiscal. question. Now, however, that issue is to be sunk. Honourable members will recollect that, before the CobdenBright crusade in England, a similar condition of affairs obtained. There protectionists had a majority for many years, though there was a decreasing minority of free-traders. In the Victorian Parliament the fiscal question was never raised, because nearly all its members were protectionists. Further, that has been the position of parties in England from 1856 onwards, as most of the members of the Imperial Parliament were free-traders. Neither in the Victorian nor the English Parliaments, therefore, has the fiscal question been one which determined upon which side of the House a member 'should sit. The declaration of the leader of the Opposition, that he is prepared to accept the verdict of the people of the Commonwealth upon - this question, necessarily involves the formation of new parties. These will be based, not upon the fiscal issue, but upon other considerations and new principles. The other day I was looking up a biography of Lord Beaconsfield, which shows very clearly how, in 1847, a similar state of flux existed in England as. now obtains in Australia, and I may be parto save doned for reading from it a very short extract. The position was that Disraeli had severed himself from his party, and with Lord George Bentinck had formed a protectionist party. He had refused to follow Sir Robert Peel, who was a free trader, with the result that the latter was defeated. The extract to which I have referred, which fairly accurately describes the present position of freer-traders in Australia, is as follows:But the really important point in this election is the attitude of Mr Disraeli to protection. Whether he ever really believed in that doctrine or not, he may be credited with sufficient sense to see that, if once abolished, it could never be restored. He knew, of course, that the people having once got the taste :of cheap bread, would rise in rebellion .rather than again allow its price to be artifically raised by protective laws. The difficult problem which Mr Disraeli had, therefore, to solve was, to keep up his appearance of a belief 'in the possibility of a - return to protection, and at the same time gradually pave the way for abandoning protection. This is the game which he plays for the next few years, and I think the reader will not be wholly unamused in watching the skill, the audacity, and the unscrupulousness with which he played it. . . . This thesis, that an immediate return to protection was impossible, he enlarged on during his many election addresses,- taking care, however, be it remarked, to hold out at the same time the hope that what .was impossible .for the moment would be possible by-and-by. It is this that constitutes the dishonesty of Mr Disraeli's action. The harm he did by keeping alive these hopes, which he knew to be false, is incalculable. It induced lethargy in both the landlord and the tenant, and throughout the entire community it kept up a dangerous feeling of uncertainty. I venture to say that, if the free-trade members of this House-wh o appear to be in a state of revolt against their leader upon the"" fiscal question-attemp t to raise that issue, after the pronounced way in which the people have declared in favour of protection, their action will be prompted by a desire to induce hopes which they know to be impospeace sible of realization. I need scarcely point out that Western Australia returned to first Parliament only two protectionists. The leader of the Opposition subsequently carried out. visited that State, and conducted a freeknow trade crusade there, with the result that five protectionists have been elected to Parliament. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Were they returned ment inthose States. as protectionists? I am sure that not one of them will say so.",41
223,Mr FRAZER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,But they all defeated free-traders.,42
224,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Similarly , in the first Parliament, four protectionists were (recopy turned by Tasmania. Then the leader of the Opposition visited that State, and barked upon another free-trade campaign, as the result of which it has since returned six protectionists. Indeed, every State of the Union, save New South Wales, has returned a majority of protectionists . I venture to say that the free-trade policy is maintained in New South Wales only because theSydney newspapers suppress proper information. I am glad the attitude which has been adopted by the Ministry in connection with the pro posed introduction of Chinese into South Africa. I would remind the House that on the 2.6th September, 1902, I brought mentsdid. not completely collapse. this matter forward, and urged' the vernment to make representations to the Imperial authorities against the proposed admission of Chinese into the Transvaal and other South AfricanStates. I was partment. exceedingly pleased to hear the criticism in which the leader of the Opposition dulged, because the Government have been content to follow the lead of Mr Seddon upon this question, when the opportunity was clearly offered, and the occasion warded certainly demanded, that the Australian Ministry should take definite action. member that on the occasion to which refer the present Prime Minister, the reply. honourable member for Bland, the honcated with me. orable member for Parramatta, the honourable member for Darwin obthe matter. jected to any such representations being made.

Therefore, I claim that we have a right to exercise a voice in the terms of which were agreed upon.

In my opinion the Minister has acted in a very proper manner by offering to forward to every honourable member who desires it, a of the new defence regulations, and by inserting in the Government Gazette an intiemmation that any suggested amendments in them shall receive fair consideration. Consequently, if , in the future, honourable members complain of feathers and gold lace, unlessthey make proper representations to the Minister, they will have only themselves 1 to blame. I understand that the Minister for Home Affairs has asked for a specific instance of incompetence on-the part of the to note Chief Electoral Officer. : From my own experience I am able, to supply him with one of several, because there is no honor1 able member in this House who does not thank his stars that the electoral arrangeThe Gostatement of the Prime Minister that he feared there would have been an entire breakdown in those arrangements is a sufficient indication of the weakness of the DeI wish, however, to state one case, in which incompetence was displayed, so in that it may be placed upon record in Hansard. At Queenscliff, eighty-one soldiers discovered that their names were not upon the electoral roll. Accordingly they fora list to the Chief Returning Officer, but received no reply to their communication. I reTheir commanding officer then wrote on their I behalf, and he. also failed to elicit any Subsequently the men communiI interviewed Mr Lewis, and who rang up Mr Newman to inquire into The latter admitted that he had received the list in question, that he had not replied to the letters, and had proto mised that, all the names of the men exwould be placed upon the rolls, adding I that they had already been forwarded to I need scarcely inform honourable members that none of these men's names appeared upon the roll. I think that is a specific instance of incompetence ; on the part of some officer, into which the Minister will deem it to be his duty to I am very glad that the right honourable member for Adelaide has referred to the recent Conference of Treasurers upon the question of the-transfer of the States debts, because it gives an opportunity for"" that matter to be discussed in the House, and so gives the Treasurer indications of the opinions of members. I must confess that I do not like the Federal Treasurer's proposal to accept part of the gross revenue of the States railways without taking over the administration of those railways. The Federal Convention was very careful to guard against the Commonwealth being made dependent upon the States for any portion of its revenue. That gathering distinctly declared that there should not be a direct contribution by the States towards the expenses of the Commonwealth, as it would makethe. Federation depend on the States. Therefore, I do not like the proposal of the' Federal Treasurer.",42
225,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,We should not be dependent upon the States; because we should receive the money direct.,43
226,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The Commonwealth would receive, the money, if it were available. But we should be dependent upon the disposition of the States to act generously to the Commonwealth by - providing certain revenue. The Minister would also be employing States' officers for his own services, because all the railway men would be States officers in the employ of the Commonwealth. That is really the meaning of the Treasurer's interjection.",43
227,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,No .,43
228,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The Treasurer would have States officers whom he would not pay,43
229,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,They Commonwealth officers.,43
230,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"In relation to only one of their functions: In all other respects they would be States officers. Treasurer contends that they would be Commonwealth officers, I desire to know whether the Government would extend to them the provision in the Commonwealth Public Service Act that officers who have been three years in the service shall receive not less than ,£110 per annum?",43
231,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I should have nothing to do with them except through, the Commissioner.",43
232,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Then the Government wpuld simply take over one State officer, whilst many States officers would receive Federal moneys. I certainly agree inquire. with the Treasurer that the States loans should not be taken over for some time to come. In view of the fact that at present the average price of States' bonds is £ 8 5 for every ,£100 that has been borrowed, I consider that the Treasurer is very wise in holding aloof from the London. money market in anticipation of a good time to come. He has to remember that in spite of the difficulties at present associated with the London money market, with its glut of undigested securities, the Russo-Japanese . war will mean, perhaps, that another ,£300,000,000 will have to be raised by lihose countries. If the Commonwealth goes into the English money market within the next five or six years, it will not be able to obtain anything but poor prices, I am glad to know that the Treasurer does not propose that the Commonwealth shall go into the London money market at the present time, and that he objects to take over any States bonds until he can obtain £ 1 0 0 for every £ 1 0 0 which we have to pay. It is impossible for him to know what will be the conditions that will obtain when the whole of these conversion loans are required. In the proposal submitted by him to the Conference of Treasurers, he shows that if he simply took over the three-fourths of the total Customs revenue now payable to the States, and did not touch the gross railway revenue of the States, the Customs revenue now going to New South Wales and Western Australia would meet the whole of their interest charges, while Tasmania, Victoriaj Queensland, and South Australia would be at most only about ,£100,000 behind. The proper course for the Government to pursue would be to take would be ovei these loans as they become due. That, indeed, is the only course which is open to the Treasurer. Even if it were necessary for him to take over more bonds of one As the State than of another, he should take them over as they f all due, and he would find by the time that the last loans became payable that our population, and consequently our prosperity, had increased to such an extent that the three-fourths of the Customs revenue, now payable to the States, would be sufficient to meet interest on the loans, and that it would be unnecessary for him to touch the gross railway revenue of the States. In my opinion, it would be disastrous for the Commonwealth to trench upon the railway revenue of the States until we can take over the railways completely. Although the .Treasurer cannot at present take over these loans-and it is my desire that he should not approach the London money market until he can obtain ,£ioo for .£100- I think he might very well set to work, immediately to establish a sinking fund. When the Tariff was before this House the leader of the Labour Party submitted a motion for the abolition of the tea duty, but stated that he would not object to such a duty if the money so raised were applied to a sinking fund for the extinction of our enormous indebtedness. By means of tea duties we should be able to raise ,£300,000 or ,£400,000 per annum. I do not think it would be wise for the Government to take over all the functions of a State bank; matters relating to private borrowing are much better left in the hands of private institutions. But one of the functions of banking that we might properly take over would be the issue of notes equal to the bank notes now in circulation in the Commonwealth, and which represent about ,£10,000,000. The money so derived, together with the amount raised by means of a duty on tea, could be devoted to a sinking fund for the purchase of State securitiesregardless of the State which had issued them-at the lowest price at which they were available. In that way we should improve the credit of the State, and be able to buy at times when it would be most profitable for the Commonwealth to do so.",43
233,Mr CARPENTER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,How would such a system improve the credit of the States?,44
234,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"If the Commonwealth were able to constantly buy up States bonds at £ 8 3 or £ 8 5 , it would thus force up the value of the stocks in the London market. It was a system of this kind that was really responsible for the fact that, until the South African war, English Consols were always above ,£100. The National Debt Commissioners were always in the market buying up English Consols, as opportunity offered. In the same way, if the Commonwealth purchased, from time to time, States bonds which were the lowest in the market, we should increase the price of the debentures, while at the same time our credit would be improved when we as a Commonwealth come into the market. We should, likewise, pave the way for a more profitable flotation of Commonwealth loans. This is a matter which should be carefully considered, because it would be most unwise for the Commonwealth to go into the market, even for conversion purposes purely, unless it could obtain a full price for its bonds. Proposals were put before the Conference that .the Commonwealth should pay .£96 or ,£98 to convert State loans, but I do not believe in such conversions; they would mean a loss either to ourselves, or to the State. I think that, in each case, we should wait until the next State loan becomes due, leaving the State to float its own loan if the time is still inopportune for Australia to borrow, and then take over",44
235,Mr CONROY,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Does the honourable and learned member think that the Commonwealth should borrow money to enable it to take over States bonds?,44
236,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The Constitution permits it, and I have already proposed that a sinking fund should be established for the purposes of States bonds, and if myj suggestion were adopted, it would only be necessary for the Commonwealth to obtain the consent of the States to the diversion of their three-fourths of the tea duty to the object I have named. There is one other matter which I think should be brought under the notice of this House. I refer to the great falling off in our Customs revenue. I largely account for this decrease by the fact that the change of Ministers has led - to the removal of that strict and honest administration which was carried on by the right honourable member for Adelaide when he was in office, and to the substitution of a system of interviews such as those which are now occurring in the Customs Department. The Customs revenue for the year 1901-2 was .£8,692,750, while that for 1902-3 was £9,451,686. I find that the figures relating to the Customs returns from June to December, 1902-3, and June to December, 1903-4, show that an absolute loss has occurred-that the collections for the last named period decreased by £200,096.",44
237,Mr JOHNSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,That is a reflection on the Minister for Trade and Customs.,44
238,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I brought this matter forward shortly after the present Minister for Trade and Customs took office. At that time he made a statement in the press that he was going to change what he regarded as the offensive methods adopted by his predecessor in bringing persons before the courts, and requiring them to be dealt with openly and fearlessly by . properly-constituted tribunals consisting of persons trained to undertake such duties. What is the system that. the present Minister has substituted ? It is one that' is absolutely illegal: The Act provides that . Minister shall hear cases of the of kind to which I refer and shall description himself decide them. Instead of comply1902, ing with that provision, the Minister these cases to be heard before officers pointed for the purpose in the various States. He does not see the witnesses, and save for the written statements put before him does not know the nature of the offences committed by the defendants. He does not know how the witnesses have conducted themselves, or whether they truly or not, and he does not always accept the recommendations of the officers who have examined these persons. I wish to put before the House some extraordinary decisions given by the Minister. I can point to various cases in which persons residnot ing apparently in Sydney have been treated differently from those charged with similar offences but living in other parts of the Commonwealth. Several cases are forth in the Government Gazette of the December, 1903. I find, for instance, Ruttys Limited, of Sydney, for an offenpe alleged to have been committed on the 11th August, 1903, and consisting of misdescripfine tion of goods, were subjected to a penalty of £1; and that Joseph Pickles and Son, also of Sydney, for misdescription of on 4th August, 1903, had no penalty . 'imposed on them, their post entry being accepted. Then, again, F. H. Allison, of Svdney, for misdescription of .goods was treated in the same way ; but W. L. 'Daniel, of Maffra, Victoria, for the same offence, committed on 4th December, 1902, was fined £3. Awain I find that in the GovernMinister ment Gazette of 6th February, 1904, it is set forth that Messrs. 'Davis and Fehon, of Svdney, were dealt with for an offence which, if heard in the Criminal Court, would be described as obtaining money by false pretences. They were found guilty claiming drawback which was not properly payable, and were fined £5. According to the same issue a Melbourne firm have who, I am told, were brought before the Minister on two previous occasions, were dealt with for a similar offence on the 16th January, 1904, and the Minister decided that their post entry should be accepted. a previous case this firm had made a mistake of J£I,OOO. That mistake occurred when the right honourable member for Adelaide held office as Minister for Trade and Customs, and they were then brought before a Court of Justice and fined. Let me now point another case. The Gazette shows Mr Crouch. the that Messrs. Colebrook and Knight,' Melbourne, were :dealt with for a misof goods on the 4th December, and that it was decided that a post allows entry should be accepted, but W. L. apDaniel, of Maffra, for a like offence, on 4th December, 1902, was fined £3.",44
239,Mr CONROY,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"In the one case the action of the defendant might have been wilful, while in the other a mere mistake may have occurred. It is very unfair for the honourable and ;learned member to deal with these have spoken cases in this way.",45
240,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I am ready to accept all that has been said in regard to innocent mistakes, but the suspicion which is rife in commercial circles as to these decisions would not arise were the cases heard, and only heard, but decided, in open court. I wish, now, to refer to two cases which may be regarded as relating to other States. I find in the - Government Gazette set of 16th January, 1904, a statement 30th showing that Messrs. Warren and Strong, that of Sydney, on 31st January, 1903, were charged with undervaluation of boots and shoes, but that the Minister decided that no should be inflicted, and that the post entry should be accepted. In the same issue of the Gazette appears a -.statement goods showing that J. Howard and Co., of Rockhampton, for omitting goods from entry on 1st October, 1903, were fined £5.",45
241,Mr MAUGER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Does .the honourable and learned member mean to say that there has been any collusion or favouritism ?,45
242,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I contend that the should either accept the recommendations of his responsible officers or send these offenders before the court. There is a straightforward way of dealing with these matters, but, as I pointed out shortly after the present Minister took office, the system of adopted by him leaves an opening for backdoor influences. But for the fact that the fines inflicted were very small there would been a great agitation. A man who is fined only £ 3 or £ 5 has no wish to have his case brought prominently before the public. When we look at the evidence, and find that the Minister in his private room In arrives at a decision without the slightest knowledge of the influences which have led up to the recommendation of the officer, and that, these decisions are absolutely inconsistent and contradictory, it is time to-direct attention to the provisions of the Customs to Act, .and to see that a return is made to the .system adopted by the first Minister of ""Trade and Customs. Every man is treated - fairly by being sent before the court, and having his case dealt with by a justice of the peace Or a police magistrate. That is the course of action which I commended. What was the consequence ?. I prefaced my remarks by stating that the Customs revenue would fall, and in the first month of the administration of the present Minister it did f all. This is a matter of great importance, not merely to the Commonwealth, but to each of the States. I find that the Customs revenue for the period between June and December, 1903, was less by .£200,096 than that for the same period of the preceding year.",45
243,Mr CONROY,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,What about the fodder duties ?.,46
244,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The last Budget contains an estimate of the difference there would be in the fodder duties, and that difference does not account for the f all I speak of.",46
245,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,What about the falling off of revenue in certain periods during the adniinisiration of the right honourable member for Adelaide?,46
246,Mr CROUCH,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I am not able to compare the figures for the period between January and June, because the present Minister has not been in charge of the Cus-toms Department for the whole of such a period. But I have been able to compare the first six months of his administration with that of the right honourable member for Adelaide during the corresponding period of the previous year.",46
247,Mr MAUGER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"A very unfair comparison. ' Mr CROUCH - That interjection is unsupported by facts. ,1 think the comparison I have made is the fairest possible. I - am glad to have had an - opportunity to ""bring the matter before the House. I have not touched upon the measures of legislation referred to in the speech, and have confined myself, with the exception. of a few remarks upon the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, to matters of administration. T trust that when the various measures referred to in the speech are brought forward, I shall have good reasons to give for the votes I shall cast in regard to them.",46
248,Mr KNOX,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY," I mustat once confess that all through I have refrained from speaking, and I am unwilling to speak even now, because it seemed, however paradoxical the position may appear, that the longer the debate continues the more members there are to speak. The discussion commenced with two conciliatory addresses by the leaders of the - Government and the Opposition. They were followed by a speech of the leader of the Labour Party, which contained a peean of satisfaction with the results of the elections, with which that party, I think, are entitled to be gratified. That seems a recollection of a very long time ago; and now that we are in the third week of the session we find new debatable matter being brought forward, which seems likely to prolong the discussion still further. This afternoon we have had practically a grievance! day debate, 1 various details of administration rather than general questions of policy having been discussed - I do not propose to f o l low the last speaker in the suggestionswhich he has made for dealing with that great question of the conversion of the debts of the States. I hope, however, that no one will listen to his dreamy proposal to take over. ,£10,000,000 worth of bonds for. the purpose he mentioned. I shall refer to one or two of his observa1 tions, because he. dealt with a subject, upon which I wish to make a suggestion for the consideration of the Treasurer. I hope that the whole question will be dealt with by the House in the: manner which, its magnitude, andits seriousness demand. As the result of the elections, we find ourselves, as nearly every member has admitted, in an almost, unworkable position. The only party which benefits by the situation, and will benefit by its continuance, is that which is so ably led by the honourable member for Bland. Last session, it will be admitted, many of the members of the Opposition afforded assistance to the Government when help was required. But that state of things cannot continue. The Government cannot expect to have the help of the Labour Party in regard to labour legislation, and then to depend upon the assistance of the moderate members of the Opposition in passing legislation which the Labour Party consider undesirable. It seems to me, and I am sure to many other honourable members, that the time has arrived when there should be some clear definition of parties in this House, and that the Government should be prepared with a policy uoon which it is ready to stand or f all. The Prime Minister has declared that he will go right on, and will countenance no underhand combination. . All of us who have had the privilege of knowing him in the past areperfectly sure: that there w i ll be no underhand work, and that whatever combination he enters into will be a straightforward and above-board In pursuing his policy of going right on he has embodied in the Governor General's Speech a very comprehensive bill of fare. The measures therein referred to divide themselves, in my. mind, into those which are practicableand possible, and those which are purely experimental, unnecessary, and impracticable. I think no honourable member believes that the Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme will be carried into effect during the life of this Parliament, however much he would like to see it come about. The Government, indeed, indicate that they regard the giving of old-age pensions by the Commonwealth as consequential upon the readjustment of the public debt of the States. Their action in referring to the matter in the Governor General's Speech has been criticised as tending to mislead the infirm and destitute. I do not think that that was the intention, but in any case the introduction of a measure to provide for Commonwealth old-age - pensions is not practicable during the life-time of this Parliament. with regard to the preferential trade proposals, even those who in' Great Britain - advocate preferential trade, and believe, as I do, that something should be done to consolidate the Empire,- and to secure its trade to its own people, admit that the time is not .yet ripe for definite action Therefore, it is only to delude Parliament to suggest in the Governor General's Speech that we may be able to deal with it. It certainly cannot be dealt with this session. No doubt the Conciliation and - Arbitration Bill is of great importance to the members Labour Party, but, in my opinion, the passing of that measure will not make the Commonwealth more prosperous. theoretical and experimental piece of legislation, which, in my judgment, will not improve the industrial conditions of the States. Then I believe the proposed Navigation Bill to be an unnecessary restriction upon the trade and commerce of this country, 'which ought to be as free as possible. Instead of keeping merchant vessels away from our coast, we should try to encourage them to come here. regard the proposed appointment of the Inter-State Commission as impracticable. Surely we ought - to be at the end of this process of manufacturing departments, involving the creation of so many new Mr Knox. officers, and the payment of so many ad-"" ditional salaries to burden the taxpayers affair. of the Commonwealth. We have not' yet seen the Bill, but I earnestly hope that the High Court, which has not yet been overburdened with . work, will' be intrusted with the duties attaching to the Interstate Commissions. Wath the special knowledge which the Justices of that Court possess, they should make an admirable body for dealing with disputes between States. There ' are two other' subjects of which I feel that I must speak with bated breath. One of these is the proposal to construct a railway to connect Western Australia with the eastern States. Upon that matter I am sorry to say that I cannot agree with my right honourable friend the Minister for Home Affairs. It is true that Federation will '- never be completely and satisfactorily consummated until railway communication is established between Western Australia' and the eastern part of the continent; but I hold that there are many desirable enterprises upon which the Commonwealth should embark before that work is taken, in hand. ' I can perfectly appreciate the desire of the Minister and of the Then, people of Western Australia to see the railway constructed; but I do not think that they have any sound ground for the belief that it can be carried out for some time to come, even though it may have formed the subject of a compact entered into prior to Federation. There seems to be a strong disposition on the part of some honourable members to give effect to every provision of the Constitution, irrespective of the financial position or the natural development of the Commonwealth. According to these honourable members, we are bound to give immediate effect to every line of the Conof .the stitution, without regard to the necessities of the Commonwealth as a whole. So far as the transcontinental railway is conIt is a cerned, it seems to me that it would be far preferable to devote attention to the completion of the railway in Queensland that is intended to reach as far as Point Parker. The line would extend from Longreach to Winton and Cloncurry, thence on to Point Parker, and would pass through a magnificent - stretch of country, which would be capable, of supporting an enormous population, which is full of minerals, and com? I also prises splendid .agricultural and pastoral' blocks. It was this country which largely assisted the pastoralists of Queensland to overcome their difficulties during the great drought ;",46
249,Mr WATSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The line would be coniron structed wholly within Queensland territory.,48
250,Mr KNOX,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Yes .,48
251,Mr WATSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Then that would not affect the Federation.,48
252,Mr KNOX,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The railway would.affect the whole Commonwealth, and would tend to bring us into closer communication with Other parts of the world; therefore I think that it should receive the most careful sideration at our hands. Another subject which I refer with bated breath is the posal to establish the Federal Capital. not think that this work need be undertaken by the Commonwealth for a long time to come. Undoubtedly, it is provided for in the Constitution; but we have to consider whether it would be expedient to incur the expenditure that would be involved in the by establishment of the Federal Capital until the Commonwealth recovers from that period of depression through which it has just passed. The Governor General's Speech mentions a number of matters which, unlike those to which I have referred, are of eminently practical character, and worthy serious consideration. One of these is question of the transfer of the States and the method to be adopted in paylearned ing the States for the properties transferred to the Commonwealth. It must also be admitted by honourable memrate bers that it is desirable that steps should be taken to increase our population, which has been reduced to a state of stagnation owing to the absence of immigration and lamentable falling off in the birth rate, am glad to see also that it is proposed to own grant assistance to farmers and ducers, because I regard that as the right direction, and as one which will also receiving financial assistance. benefit the whole community. I think the mining industry, which has done so much for the Commonwealth, might also receive a little kindly consideration. Irriga tion also is one of those practical matters to which the Parliament might very.well direct its attention. The proposal for encouragement of the iron and steel industry is a good one. We shall never take proper position as a great nation until have iron and steel works established our midst under proper control. It is that the consumption of iron and steel the Commonwealth is limited, as compared with that in other countries. It is known that pig-iron is brought here part, in the form of ballast, and that fore the freight'charges are very small. the same time we should have in our and steel works capable of turning out rails, and other articles of that description. Reverting to the subject of the States debts,' I have already discussed the question with' the Treasurer, who is familiar with the suggestion which I shall now venture to submit to the House. The memorandum which, the right honourable gentleman submitted to the recent Conference of States Treasurers conshowed a just appreciation of the many difto ficulties which surround the subject. As prowas pointed out in that document, and as I do is well known to honourable members, only the debts contracted prior to Federation can be taken over by the Commonwealth. It would be necessary to amend the Constitu-' tion, if it were desired that the Commonwealth should take over liabilities incurred^ the States since the establishment of Federation. The public debts of long the States amount to .£228,000,000. Honourable members will recognise that this is a task of enormous magnitude, and one which - demands very careful considerationan It is impossible to deal satisfactorily and of finally with the question simply by the wave the of a magician's wand. I ' entirely agree debts, with the remarks of the honourable and member for Corio, that it will be a very long time before the Commonwealth will be able to borrow in London at a lower of interest than the States can do so at the present moment. As he very properly pointed out, most of the surplus capital available in England is now being absorbed the for various purposes. Not only is the Government borrowing largely for its purposes, but various corporaother pro tions are doing the same thing, a step in and the South African States are It is. that estimated that there are somewhere about .£200,000,000 of surplus profits available ir* Great Britain each year for investment. It: is true that if that accumulation continues it should materially ease the congested state of the money market if confidence in the the Commonwealth and in the States finances . can be restored. To me it seems perfectly our clear that the States of the Union which we have the lesser indebtedness will never consent to burden their people with a general true - per capita charge, in order to adjust their in circumstances to those of the other States. No satisfactory solution of this question will also well be arrived at until the whole of the in great States debts are taken over by some therecentral authority-eithe r by the CommonAt wealth, or some body which may be constimidst tuted a trustee. Such a body might well be composed of representatives of the and of the Commonwealth, and be vested with power to handle all loans, and to deal with all future, flotations. might very appropriately be called "" Commonwealth of Australia Council of Finance."" It should consist of two bers of the Federal Government, and presentative from each of the States vernments. It should possess.a permanent head in order to ensure a continuity of policy and efficient control. Of course could not be brought about without first securing an amendment of the Constitution. As I have previously pointed, out, some change in the Constitution must be made the Commonwealth is to assume control of the debts which have been incurred by States since the inauguration of Federation. If necessary the States, by means abling Acts, could take the necessary for creating such a body as that which. now suggest. I am one of those who lieve that the Braddon section in our stitution will require to be continued many years. I am satisfied also that when the book-keeping section expires the States will insist upon its renewal. I repeat that, for years to come, none of. the States will prepared to surrender their control of the. railways, or to submit to any interand ference by the. Commonwealth with their railway development. Such a. council as I have suggested would conduct all future flotations, and constitute a governing and informed body posa sessed of a continuous and definite policy. Of course, I am quite aware that the objecsuch tion which will be urged against such proposal is that it would result in the loss of direct parliamentary control. But I would point out that all the States of Commonwealth would have direct represenmonwealth tation, and that such representation would always be subject to review by the Federal and the States Legislatures. We all know the magnificent success which has followed the creation of a somewhat similar body in Egypt under the presidency of Lord Cromer. MT. DEAKIN - But in Egypt, it has not to deal with different States.",48
253,Mr KNOX,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I am perfectly aware the conditions are not analagous. Neversiastic, the less it affords us an example of a which deals with large sums in a way is in the'best interest of all concerned. urge my suggestion upon the grounds public economy and efficient, control. I believe that it deserves the consideration States the Treasurer, quite apart from the fact that it would, prove a means of uniting the interests of the Commonwealth and of the It States. As I have previously intimated, I The think it is necessary for us to adopt some means to increase our population. It canmemnot be denied that even in Victoria there a reare vast areas of land which ought to be Gooccupied by small tenants. That can be secured, only by first laying down the lines of a scheme which is calculated to this attract desirable immigrants to our shores. Honourable members who have recently been to London must be cognizant of the gigantic efforts that are being made in a similar it direction by Canada. .The Government of that country has opened extensive offices for the the purpose in Whitehall, and these are daily crowded by persons who desire to take of enup land inCanada. The Canadian Compowers missioner was good enough to supply I me with a mass of information rebegarding the methods which are adopted Conby the Immigration Officei Needless to for very add, these are far. superior to those which are adopted, by our States offices. Many laws have been passed.by this Parliament that have tended to bring-the Commonbe wealth into disrepute. We are being subjected, to a great deal, of misrepresentation, the people, of. England have not a true conception, of the true position of affairs. I hold the. view that one of the most practical steps which the Government could take to counteract this evil would be to appoint High Commissioner. That view may not be shared by some honourable members; but an appointment is really essential. a We have no proper representation in London,, and .it is desirable that this fault should be remedied without delay, in order the that the position taken up by the Commay be clearly understood. It would not be a difficult matter to send home a representative of the Commonwealth qualified to find markets for our produce; but it is necessary that the High Commissioner should also be a man who has held high office, who is able to speak with authority, and whose words will receive the consideration of the public. Everything, of course, will depend upon the selection made by the that Government. The most eloquent, enthuand practical man, so far as the body development of Australia is concerned, that should be appointed to the position. II earnestly hope that the Government will of not view the appointment as one which should be made without grave consideration, of for to selectany one who is not enthusiastic in his desire to promote the best interests of the Commonwealth would be simply to waste our money. A responsible duty lies in front of this officer, for at present the Commonwealth does not stand well in the eyes of the British public.",49
254,Mr MCDONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Why ?,50
255,Mr KNOX,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"No one should be better qualified to answer that question than is honourable member. I repeat, without of contradiction, the statement that certain legislation which we have passed has brought the Commonwealth into disrepute.",50
256,Mr MCDONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,A few of the wild-cat schemes floated in the London market are responsible for this state of affairs.,50
257,Mr KNOX,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I consider that,50

259,Mr KNOX,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I do not hear to what the honourable and learned member is referring; but I consider that the High Commissioner will have a tesponsible task before explaining some of our past actions. It is perfectly idle for honourable bers to imagine that they can gainsay the facts. Let them peruse a few of the journals which exercise an important influence on investors in Great Britian, they will .find that some of our legislation has brought the Commonwealth into disreLabour pute. Had there been a High Commistheir sioner in London, he would have been able to explain away much of the misrepresentaportant tion that has occurred. There has been much exaggeration abroad in reference to numbers our actions, and we have not in England able to speak with authority in a splendid example. regard to what our actual intentions If the Commonwealth is. to succeed, we must follow the lines upon which the prosthey perity of older countries has been built; we must have regard for ordinary business conditions of life.

262,Mr KNOX,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The most eloquent member of this House would be the most fitting representative of the Commonwealth in Great Britain. Every honourable member knows to whom I refer. In the earlier portion of my address, I referred to the existence of three co-ordinate parties in this House, and indicated that the present position was unthe tenable. We all admit that the fiscal quesfear tion is practically dead. Air. JOHNSON - No .",50
263,Mr KNOX,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I , for one, think that it is. Had that fact been recognised at the last election-ha d the fiscal issue been subordinated to a consideration of the general interests of the Commonwealth, I feel satisfied that we should have had a more definite has not division of parties than we have.",50
264,Mr JOHNSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The fiscal issue was very much in evidence in New South Wales. ' Mr KNOX - Whil e it continues in evidence we are unable to come down to reasonable conditions. The Labour him in Party have shown us what can be done by organization, and by differenmemtiating between what is important and unimportant, and in that respect deserve every commendation. It is a standing rebuke to the other parties in this House and that, by means of united action, and by putting forward a distinct programme, the Party have been able to improve position, whilst other parties who did not discriminate, as they did, between imand unimportant details of policy, have come back to the House reduced in and divided in strength. In suborhad any one tions the the Labour dinating fiscal issue to other consideraParty has set us They consider are. that their socialistic platform is of infinitely greater importance to those whom represent than is the fiscal issue. They allow their members to vote independently of party consideration so far as that issue is us concerned, but, with that exception, they are of a united body. It is highly desirable that should rehabilitate the Commonwealth in the eyes of the public, for I feel satisfied that if a vote were now taken throughout Australia, the decision of the people would The feeling against the Commonwealth is most intense. The Minister for Home Affairs: if we to-night once more threw down the gauge of battle, and indicated that a feeling of 7 unrest exists - even in Western Australia.. and We know, also, that New South Wales is dissatisfied with her position, and surely it is manifest that this state of affairs is due to the fact that the Commonwealth Parliament, instead of taking up that high position which it was expected to assume, has failed in many respects to have regard to practical and business-like lines of legislation, and has, therefore, disappointed every one. Another reason for this dissatisfaction is that the States, as States, with certain responsibilities which they must bear, are beginning to believe that the Federal Parliament is endeavouring to supplant their Legislatures-that legislation which cannot be passed in their Parliaments is to be imposed upon them by the action of the Federal Parliament.",50

270,Mr KNOX,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The vote cast for Senator Trenwith was a very pronounced one. He .has always been a moderate man in Victorian politics, and the public regarded him as one who had been subjected to great persecution. The high position which he occupied on the poll is an indication that the people have a feeling of sympathy for one who has always been moderate, and has been guided in all that he has done by a regard for what he believes to be right.",51

I think that there should be a combination amongst honourable members for the purpose of carrying on the government of the country in a constitutional and business-like way, and that might be brought about by negotiations. I know nothing of any combination; but I think it would be better to bring about a union, under present conditions, than to wait for chaos, and then to effect a coalition under stress of weather. I trust that a sufficient number of members will be found to adopt a national policy, and work for the good of the whole of the Commonwealth, under an Australian banner bearing the motto- "" For all the people of the Commonwealth, and not for any section.""",52
304,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY," So much has been said during this debate, and I might add, so well said, that it is very difficult for any one speaking at this stage to say anything of a novel character. It appears to me, however, that some of the questions to which honourable members have addressed themselves may be presented in an aspect different from that in which they have hitherto been exhibited. Before discussing the matters referred to in the Governor General's Speech, I desire to refer to the Kanaka question. To a North Queenslander the Kanaka question is very much in the position of King Charles' head to the late lamented Mr Dick. A few days ago, I asked the Prime Minister a series of questions with regard to the arrangements for the conveyance of time-expired islanders to their homes. He said that the matter was one for the Queensland. Government to attend to, and that, so far, he had heard no complaints as to any of the islanders having been unable to leave. I may tell the Prime Minister that he is notlikely to hear any complaints. I admit that upon this question the present Government in Queensland is much more sympathetic than its immediate 'predecessor, and that it may adopt an attitude different from that previously assumed by the authorities. At the same time, I am afraid'that the matter does not altogether rest with the Government, because there are officers who are specially appointed to attend to the requirements of those islanders who desire to return to their homes. I am very sorry to say that many people, who Ought to be ashamed of themselves for doing so, have been in the habit of trying to beguile the simple islanders by misrepresentations. When an islander's first term of service has expired, at the end of three years, every effort is made to persuade him to sign an agreement for another six months, or for a longer period, if possible, and, among other things, he is told that there is no ship ready to take him back to his home. Of course, in these cases, the islanders are not able to speak very good English, and' are practically at the mercy of those who desire to keep them in the State. I am - credibly informed 'that in many cases the Government agent, who, above all others,"" should protect the interests of the islanders, helps to delude them, by representing that there is no boat ready to return them to .their homes. When I was last in Northern Queensland I met an islander who had been .fifteen years in the State. He had with him his daughter, twelve years of age, who had been born in Queensland, and he told me that he was most anxious to go back to his own people and take with him his daughter, so that she might he made acquainted with her relatives. He had then been trying for three months to obtain a permit to enable him to go to some other port, and there wait for a ship ""to take him' away.' Several other boys were with him, arid I Mr Bam fori. was informed that they had completed their agreements, and were at that very time being induced to sign another agreement to work on the plantations for a further six months, or a longer term. Whilst indentured boys are waiting for a ship to take them back, they have to be kept by their late employers, who have to find them in rations and house room. Those who accept re-engagements, however, have, upon the expiration of their service, to keep themselves. In either case the money - which is paid over to the islander at the expiration, of his term dwindles away during the period of waiting. It is the ambition of every islander to take back' with him a certain amount of trade, and if, through the depletion of his resources, he finds himself unable to do this, he generally signs a further agreement. If what I have - described occurred when ships were leaving, with tolerable frequency, during at least nine months of the year, how much more is it likely - to happen now that no ships are leaving for the Islands to bring back recruits? The Prime Minister said that the matter was one for the consideration of the State Government, but I contend that a great responsibility rests upon' this Parliament. We have stopped recruiting, and have thereby reduced the number of ships available to take these islanders back to their homes. Therefore, it is our duty - to see that those who desire to go back--and the Kanakas do in the great .majority of cases so desire-shal l have the means of doing so placed at their disposal. I hope that the Prime Minister will take this matter into his earnest consideration. If the islanders have been deluded - in the past there is .no reason why they should .not have fair play in the future. I make these representations in their interests. For many years the employers have had the big end of the stick, and have dominated the position and I think it is our duty to see that the islanders have fair play, so far as we can assure it. This is a question which, as a member of the Labour Party, and as a representative of Queensland, I should not desire to bring forward, if it could be avoided. We regard the* whole of the legislation passed by the State Legislature in regard to the introduction of islanders to work on sugar plantations with regret, - and we should be only too pleased to wash our hands of the whole business. The matter to which I have referred is, however, a very important one, and deserves our earnest attention. In isolated instances the Government agents may have done their duty, but in a great many cases they have played into the hands of the planters. had intended to refer to the interjection made by the honourable member for Parramatta, with regard to the assistance given to the members of the Labour Party by the Government at the last election, but I think that the matter has already been sufficiently dealt with. There was no help given to me, or to any other member of our party, so far as I am aware. The Prime Minister himself appeared upon the public platform in. Victoria tohelp one candidate who was opposing a member, of the Labour Party. I do not find any fault with, hisaction upon that occasion,.because Ministers were at per-feet liberty to help their own supporters. I object, however, to thestatements that, they have, given any assistance to members of the Labour Party. I am one of those who have serious complaints to make, regarding the administration of. the Electoral Act. Speaking from, my experience in my own electorate, I can confidently assert that the Act was maladministered in thegrossest possible, way: I reported, several glaring breaches of the Act to the returning officer, butupon. my. arrival in Melbourne I found that the Chief Electoral Officer knew nothing about any such reports; It.has been, stated that in Victoria and New South Wales numbers corresponding with those on the roll were written upon the face of the ballot-papers, and that, the corners of the papers were then turned down. In one place in my electorate I lost a. large number of votes owing to this, practice. In that particular instance, the presiding officer did not even have the decency to turn down the corner of the paper. He wrote the number ""on the face of the ballot-paper, and thereby robbed the ballot of its secrecy. In the State electorate of Herbert, the presiding officer, in. violation of the Act, declared at each polling place the number of votes recorded there. At one place, owing to influences which I deplore, only nine votes were recorded, and they were all given against me. That, of course, showed that the electors who voted had no judgment. I took the precaution to go to that place beforehand and tell every one who had a vote that the ballot was absolutely secret. During the passage of the Electoral Bill through the House, references were made to the practices indulged in in various States, with a view to ascertain how tLs votes of the electors were cast, and. my electorate was no exception to the rule in that regard. I told the electors at the place referred to that they need not fear I that their votes would be disclosed, because the voting papers would be taken to the principal polling place and there mixed with others before the count in such a way that they would become unidentifiable. What will those people now think of me? The previous practice was so contrary to that which I . described that possibly they thought I was lying to them, and results would appear to justify their belief. I ask the Minister for Home Affairs what is to be done in' reference to these matters. Are the electoral officials to be permitted to flout the Act as they please? When the Bill was under discussion every precaution possible was taken by honourable members to make the ballot absolutely secret. Now we find that, owing to the stupidity, or something worse,- of the presiding officers, cr of some one else; the secrecy of the ballot - has been violated. I think that some action ought to be taken in reference to this matter. I do not blame the Chief. Electoral Officer. Nevertheless, this action is all. of a piece with the maladministration of which so much complaint has. been made during the course of this debate. I - should like to say a few words'upon the subject of the Federal Capital. Members of the Opposition have discussed this question at great length, but I have no hesitationin affirming that if the Sydney newspapers wouldabstain from saying anything about it for one month, it would be absolutely dead.",52
305,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,No .,54
306,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I live in Sydney, and I am aware that the question is destitute of all life beyond that which is put into it by the Sydney press. The great majority of the people do not care anything about it. Some, of course, would like it to be speedily settled, because they imagine that it would provide plenty of work. I would remind honourable members that, upon the 30th September, 1902, a. vote was recorded in this House upon a proposal by the Treasurer to borrow '£500,000. The leading members of the Opposition voted against that proposal upon principle, and I commend them for it.",54
307,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"There is another principle to which regard should be paid, namely, that undertakings should be fulfilled.",54
308,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I quite agree with the honourable member that obligations should be fulfilled. But where, I ask, is the need for hurry in the settlement of this question. I will undertake to say that if the Federal Capital site were selected tomorrow the Treasurer has not a ten-pound note to spend upon it. Where is the money to come from with which to build the capital?",55
309,Mr JOHNSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Does the honourable member desire the Parliament to meet in Melbourne for ever?,55
310,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I do not. I am merely putting the practical difficulties the situation before the House. If the Treasurer had the temerity to submit a Loan Bill, which was certainly not designed to raise money to carry out a reproductive work, would any honourable, member support him, especially at a time when our securities are lower than they have ever been in the history of Australia.",55
311,Mr WATKINS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"We have handed back to the States ^1,500,000 more than we had a right to return them under the Constitution;",55
312,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"There is no State which stands more in need of the money which has been returned to her in excess of the three-fourths of her Customs revenue to which she is entitled, than New South Wales. With the exception of Western Australia, all the States are in necessitous circumstances. I am satisfied that great friction would be caused if the Treasurer attempted to retain the whole of the 75 20,000,000 odd. per cent, of the Customs revenue to which the States are entitled, and to devote the to Mr. balance to the building of a Federal ber's Capital.",55
313,Mr LIDDELL,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Shoul d we not get tangible asset in the shape of the territory which we acquired?,55
314,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,To a certain extent we should j but it would be a long time before we could realise upon that asset.,55
315,Mr OMALLEY,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Coul d we not go to Uncle Moses?,55
316,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"We have no desire to go to Uncle Moses, unless for absolutely Argentine. reproductive works. Nobody can contend that the building of a Federal Capital would come within that category. The question of the conditions which have been embodied. in the contracts for our' mail service has been discussed at some Wales length. Personally I agree with the honourable and learned member for Corio that the questions of the carriage of mails and the conveyance of frozen rabbits to England should ' have been kept entirely separate. The honourable member for Kooyong has accused members of the-Labour Party of being socialists. We consider it an honour to be regarded as such. But I would ask that honourable member, who finds fault with us on the ground that we are socialists,' why he recommends what is purely a socialistic doctrine? He asks that our mail boats should carry butter, fruit, and rabbits in refrigerating chambers, and that they should be subsidized by the Government. I hold that the two questions should be kept quite separate. If ever of there was scope for private enterprise, surely it is in connection with the carriage of perishable produce. The trouble which has fallen upon the Postmaster-General in failing to secure satisfactory tenders for the conveyance of our mails is not due to section 16 of the Post and Telegraph Act, but is entirely the result of the other conditions which have been inserted in the contracts. I was very sorry to find another matter that I regarded as dead galvanized into life during the course of this debate. I refer to the matter of the fodder duties. During some portion of 1902 the statement was made in this House that there were 20,000,000 of starving sheep in New South Wales. I leave out of consideration the number of cattle and horses, and propose to divide the number in question by two. Mir. FULLER.^-Our flocks in New South Wales were reduced from 60,000,000 to BAMFORD - I am quite prepared accept the honourable and learned memstatement, but for purposes of calculation I wish to put the number down at a 10,000,000. Assuming that each of these required 10 lbs. of fodder per week, that would ' represent a consumption of 100,000,000 lbs., or a little less than 50,000 tons. To bring that quantity of fodder from New Zealand, which was the only place from which it could be obtained at the time",55
317,Mr FULLER,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Muc h of it came from the,55
318,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"It would require ten ships of the tonnage of the Orontes to bring that fodder to New South Wales, assuming that the vessels could complete the new trip once a fortnight. Could New South have afforded that? I say that she could not. It would have been utterly imof possible, even had the fodder duties been suspended, to alleviate the existent distress. That - 50,000 tons of fodder at £ 4 per ton-and I believe that a great quantity of it realized more than double that price in Sydney-woul d mean an expenditure of £200,00 0 a week, or over ,£1.0,000,000 within twelve months. How could the people of New South Wales have provided that money ? Honourable members should also bear in mind that in my calculation I have simply allowed for the fodder being landed upon the wharfs at Sydney. I wish now to address myself for a few moments to the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Parkes, who never appears to such advantage as when he is delivering a homily to members of the Labour Party. We all - acknowledge his lucidity, his ability, his courtesy, and the manner in which he treats his subject; but we differ from"" him in his deductions from facts. In speaking of the Labour Party, he declared that its members are socialists, and that they are ruining the Commonwealth-that the policy which we are striving to thrust upon the community is destroying the public credit. He also remarked that we had not read history, otherwise we should not take up the position that we do. I say that we are students of history, and that it is the events of the past which have forced us, willy-nilly, to adopt the 'policy we have. Individualism has been the curse of the world, and - it is time that the system was altered; The honourable member for Kooyong says that we desire to bring, down every one to a dead level. But, in this connection, I would invite honourable members for a few moments to look at the position of Tasmania. That is a country where individualism has always been rampant, and I am perfectly certain that if the honourable member had his way, that state of things would continue. Until within aj few months ago, no labour member had ever entered a Parliament as a representative of Tasmania. What is the position of that State today? It possesses a good deal of cultivable land, and enjoys a magnificent climate and fertile soil, but we find that, to use a colloquialism, it is as much "" up to its neck in debt"" as is any of the other States. I am informed that the State Government of Tasmania closed the last financial year with a deficit of. ,£30)000, while the financial operations of the previous year showed a deficiency of £176,000 .",55
319,Mr CAMERON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,What about Queensland ?,56
320,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,We have had an individualistic policy there.,56
321,Mr WATSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Tempere d by banking legislation.,56
322,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Quite so. In Queensland, as elsewhere, we suffered from the banking crisis of I8Q3» I wish honourable members to now turn their attention to another country in the same latitude, but possessing certainly a much larger area than that of Tasmania. In the matter of soil and climate, however, it enjoys no advantage over that State. I refer to New Zealand. In the one case the rule of the individualists is supreme, while in the other there is more socialism to the square yard than is to be found in any other country.",56
323,Mr OMALLEY,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,In the days of individualism New Zealand was nearly bankrupt.,56
324,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Quite so. In 1892 its position was as bad as is the position of Tasmania today. If the honourable and learned member for Parkes were to read the history of the lands of the Southern Hemisphere as he does that of other lands, I am satisfied that he would arrive at the conclusion that the socialistic regime in New Zealand is vastly superior to the system which - exists in Tasmania, and of which he approves.",56
325,Mr JOHNSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Tasmani a is doing splendidly just now. ',56
326,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Yes ; there are now three labour representatives in the Farliament of that State. I have a few figures here from the "" Politician's - Bible """,56
327,Mr OMALLEY,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The honourable member refers to the Bulletin.,56
328,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"No ; that is the ""Democrats' Bible."" I refer to Coghlan. I desire to bring under the notice of honourable members some figures relative to the rate of interest earned by the railway systems of Tasmania and New Zealand. On page 344 of Coghlan, a table is given showing the interest returned on capital expenditure for a period of five years, and. an examination of that table will show that the highest rate of interest paid by the Tasmanian railways during the period in question was 1.56 per cent.; whilst the lowest paid by the New Zealand railway .system during the same period was 3*29 per cent. A similar state of affairs exists in relation to other matters. The people of Tasmania have no old-age pension system, such as exists in New Zea land, but they pay 5s. 9d. per head towards the alleviation of distress; whereas in New Zealand, in addition to a system of old-age pensions, the people pay 9s. iod. per head towards this object.",56
329,Mr LONSDALE,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,That shows: that very little distress exists in Tasmania.,57
330,Mr OMALLEY,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,^There are thousands of persons destitute there.,57
331,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"In answer to the honourable member for New England, I would say that if Tasmania is so prosperous as he would have us believe, why is it that her population is continually decreasing ?",57
332,Mr LONSDALE,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,It has been increasing in population.,57
333,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Coghla n deals with the population statistics for a period of seventeen years, and shows that, while there was a small excess of arrivals over departures during a period of eight years, there was . an excess of departures over arrivals during the remaining period of nine years. In 1902 there was an excess of. departures over arricialism vals in Tasmania, whereas in New Zealand the excess of arrivals over departures was nearly 8,000. Mr..LONSDALE - Are the two States to be compared physically?",57
334,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The physical conditions of both countries are almost identical.,57
335,Mr CAMERON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,What about thearea?,57
336,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I allowed for the difference in the area of the respective States. Tasmania has about 16,000 square miles, while the areaof New Zealand is 64,000 square miles, and in thefigureswith which I had intended to delight the House I had worked out the difference. But where ever the statistics given are'per head of the population the question of area is not affected, and these figures show that New Zealand is far ahead of Tasmania. Let me take, for example, the dairying industry. Coghlan gives us some interesting figures relating to the output of butter, milk, and - cheese.' He shows that the Tasmanian output of these commodities for 1902 was of the estimated value of ,£446,000, whereas that of New - Zealand was of the value of ,£2,608,000. Allowing for the difference in area, and therefore dividing the £2,608,000 by four, we find how far Tasmania lags behind New Zealand. - Mr CAMERON - The honourable member knows perfectly .well that Tasmania has but a very limited extent of good land. . .",57
337,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The same remark applies to New Zealand, a great deal of whose territory is periodically disturbed by an earthquake. Nothing could be more indicative of the relative position of the two countries than are the figures relating to education, and I find that whilst Tasmania expends ,£58,318 on the administration and maintenance of its education system, New Zealand expends £494,6211",57
338,Mr CAMERON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,What are their respective revenues?,57
339,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"That is the question. I am endeavouring to show that if Tasmania were governed under laws similar to those, which prevail in New Zealand, it would be more prosperous. If the honourable member looks at the figures he will arrive at the conclusion to which I have come, that under the two differing systems of legislation",57
340,Mr CAMERON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The honourable member should compare Tasmania with Queensland, where there are socialistic principles in force.",57
341,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"We have not the so that I should like to see there; but it is comingfast, and' I am glad' to know that this-remark applies also to Tasmania, which has returned a rabid socialist to this - Parliament. Mr CAMERON:-B y forty-eight votes.",57
342,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I am sure that the honourable member was very pleased to obtainthat majority. Nothing can be said in favour of individualism as against socialism. The honourable and learned member for Parkes is certainly a student of history. He speaks of the astigmatic vision of the Labour Party, a remark that I think should be applied to his own, and I would commend these matters to his consideration. Another question to which the honourable and learned member referred was that of conciliation and arbitration. He spoke of the Moseley Commission, consisting of twenty-six working men, which left Great Britain for the United States in order to compare the industrial life of the two countries. The honourable and learned member said that the members of that Commission returned from the United States of America firm in the resolve to have nothing to do with the principle of conciliation. As a matter of fact, there is no system of conciliation and arbitration in operation in the United States of America. Why, therefore, should the honourable and learned member, in his effort to make the best of a bad case, introduce such a suggestion? There was no principle' of conciliation and arbitration in the United States of America; consequently the Moseley' Commission could not have been impressed by anything that they saw there which had a bearing upon the subject. Reference was also made by the honourable and learned member to the withdrawal of money from Australia. Some persons are always complaining that capital is being withdrawn from the States, but they rarely, if ever, get down to actual facts. The honourable and learned member for Parkes, however, gave us one concrete case, and asserted that one institution-the Scottish Widows - had instructed its manager to withdraw, within a period of twelve months, some ^£2,000,000 which it had invested in Australia, and to send it to some other place in which 4 per cent, could be obtained. Coghlan shows, however, that all the money invested in Australia has paid an average of 4 per cent.",57
343,Mr CAMERON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The Scottish Widows were not* so sure of their securitv here.,58
344,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,But the'money in question was not directly invested by this institution in any industry. The manager was simply making a profit by lending the money to some one else to invest. Statements such as .these with regard to the withdrawal of capital from Australia require something in the way of detail to establish their credibility^ I suppose I may be permitted to say a few' words upon the subject of preferential trade.,58
345,Mr MCDONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Is that a new subject ?,58
346,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"It is with me. During the electoral campaign I was asked now and again, usually by some person the worse for liquor, what I thought of preferential trade, and I replied that later on I would give an opinion about it. I am sorry that the subject has been referred to in the Governor General's Speech. At the present stage it is an academic question rather than one of practical interest. It is in the There is no need to discuss it during the lifetime of this Parliament, at any rate. When the English people have made up their .minds as to what they require, and ask us .to come to terms, it will be time enough to consider the matter. Until then it will be only a waste of time to discuss it. Connected with it is, .of course, the"" question of free-trade or protection. During the very able address delivered by the honourable member for Richmond a few nights ago, some one interjected that we have no such .thing - as free-trade. I auite admit the truth of that remark. It was also stated that we have no such thing as protection. That is also true. The Commonwealth Tariff is the result of the conflict between two parties holding opposite fiscal views. But while the protectionist is not afraid of his policy, the free-trader is afraid of free-trade. I am not speaking now as a protectionist.",58
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Is the honourable member still a fiscal atheist?,58
348,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Yes . Protectionists will ask for all the protection they can get, and still hold out their hands for more; but free-traders will not accept free-trade at any price; they would not touch it with a long stick. I could count upon the fingers of one hand the members of the Opposition who are willing to adopt the policy of free trade. I am not rabid upon the fiscal question. If honourable members opposite will give us a free-trade policy-if they will: say, ""We will abolish customs houses altogether,"" I will go with them. If they, sav, "" We will give you the English Tariff,"" I will go with them. But I will have nothing to do with the fiscal faking which takes 5 per cent, off one article, puts 6 per cent, upon another, and calls itself free-trade. We all admit that the Commonwealth must raise a large amount of revenue, and if honourable members opposite will show that they have the courage of their convictions, by proposing a policy of taxation similar to that of Great Britain, I will join their ranks. But if their leaders proposed such a policy, how soon their ranks would - be decimated ! Where should we find the honourable members for Kooyong, Grampians, and Wentworth?",58
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Locke d in the honourable member's arms.,58
350,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Not at all. They would have nothing to do with the direct taxation which would be necessary if the clouds. English Tariff were adopted. Then, as they are afraid to adopt a free-trade policy, what is the use of coming here and talking about it ad nauseam.",58
351,Mr MCDONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,How much direct taxation will the Government give us ?,58
352,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The Government have not the courage of their convictions any more than the free-traders have. I am a candid friend upon this occasion. A great deal has been said during the debate about the third party. The honourable member, for Maranoa has taken exception to the term, becuse he says we should be called the first party, a sentiment I thoroughly endorse. The position of parties, in this Chamber might be represented by an equilateral triangle, or, to be nice, by an isosceles triangle, the two sides being equal, and each a little longer than the base. But what the third party lacks in numbers it gains in coherence.",58
353,Mr OMALLEY,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,And in intelligence.,59
354,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"If the honourable members of the Ministerial and Opposition parties think that the present position should not continue, why do they allow it to do so? If the members of the Labour Party were using influence to prevent a coalition between the two other parties, they might have reason for complaint, but we are standing severely aloof.",59
355,Mr CAMERON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The - Labour Party is shoving the other side with all its force. - Mr BAMFORD - We are not using any force at all yet.,59
356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The members the Labour Party are like the Innocents Abroad. :,59
357,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Thoug h we may be innocents, we are not very much abroad. If the two other parties wish to have two parallel lines instead of a triangle,. the members of the Labour Party are quite willing to make one line, and to take their seats upon the Opposition benches. I am afraid that the time has not yet arrived when we can keep the Ministerial benches warm. Reference has been made in the debate to the administration of the Defence Department. The honourable , member for Maranoa, in his usual terse and bellicose style, and the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, have addressed themselves to the regulations which have been published. One can only wonder that a gentleman in the position of the General Officer Commanding, and so able a statesman as the Minister for Defence, should waste their time in framing such regulations. Some of those who have spoken during the debate have severely criticised the action of the Labour Party in voting for the reduction of the Defence expenditure - In my opinion, it is a good thing that the Estimates were cut down. I agree with those who think that a change should be made in the administration of that Department to meet the undoubted wish of this House. No honourable member likes to see money, wasted upon frill and tomfoolery, upon which a great deal has been expended in the past. I believe that the Minister for Defence has the welfare of our citizen forces, and of our rifle clubs, at heart, and that he is as good a Minister as we have so far had; at any rate, he devotes himself to his duties most attentively. I deprecate, however, the manner in which the citizen forces and the rifle clubs have been treated. In my electorate the members of rifle clubs are expected, not only to buy their own rifles, but even to furnish their own ranges. Such a thing is monstrous, and must lead to the disbandment of many clubs which have been a long time in existence, and have done good service. With regard to the treatment given to officers, I should like to read the following paragraph which appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph some time ago:ONE MA N ONE COOK. The importance of the commissariat branch in the military service is well recognised, but the Arbitration Court yesterday was struck with surprise when a cook related how on the occasion of a recent encampment a mess of five officers had of a culinary staff of five to attend to their inner wants. Asked by way of preliminary what remuneration he had received while in camp, the witness blandly replied, ""Seven bob a day."" ""But you had assistance,"" continued counsel. ""Oh, yes,"" was the answer, ""four artillerymen helped me."" ""What?"" gasped the astonished barrister, ""five persons to cook for five other persons ! Do I understand you to say that?"" ""That's right,"" was the reply, ""but they were officers, and they often entertain their lady friends with afternoon tea."" That sort of thing brings ridicule upon the Defence Forces.",59
358,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,No .,59
359,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Perhaps when, the right honourable gentleman occupied the high and honourable position of Minister for Defence he indulged in these little luxuries, and therefore sympathizes with others. The general public, however, do not. like it.",59
360,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,They do not mind it. They go to these camps.,59
361,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"They mind, it very much. This sort of thing brings.the Defence Forces into ridicule and contempt.",59
362,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Not into contempt.,59
363,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"No doubt the matter is to the right honourable gentleman second in importance only to the Western Australian railway. The Daily Telegraph has a very wide circulation, as the members of the .Opposition will testify.",59
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,It is a very accurate newspaper.,59
365,Mr BAMFORD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I do not vouch for its accuracy. When addressing himself to the question offinanctejthe honourable member for Kooyong ridiculed the proposition of the honourable and learned member for Corio. Now, the honourable member for Kooyong, though a financial magnate, may not be a financial expert. Gentlemen who have the handling of a great deal of money are not always the very highest authorities upon finance; and it appears to me that the scheme propounded by the honourable and learned member for Corio is a very sensible one, and worthy of careful consideration. The Labour Party will discuss the subject in extenso before the sion is brought' to an end, and we shall take the earliest opportunity of presenting our views to the House. only hope for the representatives of New South Wales who desire to see the Federal Capital established is to place the Labour Party upon the Ministerial benches. We shall then be able to demonstrate how the - Federal Capital can be established without involving the necessity of burdening the people of the Commonwealth with one shilling of extra taxation. We have a practicable scheme which will commend itself to even the honourable member for Parramatta, who is so hypercritical in these matters. I agree with the honourable member' for Capricornia that short speeches should be the rule upon an occasion, of this kind, and I hope that 1I have not transgressed the limits of endurance. When fully 75 per cent, of the representatives in the House have spoken, one natural!v feels a desire to unburden himself, and hence I was prompted to address the House. In conclusion, I would again express the hope that the Prime Minister will give his serious consideration to the Kanaka question, to which I directed his attention in the early part of mv speech.",59
366,Mr THOMAS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Barrier). - In view of the large number of honourable members who have spoken and the time that has already been occupied by the debate, I shall endeavour to curtail my remarks. I presume that the last general election is a subject of interest to all honourable members, and I am quite with the leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Labour Party in asking that there shall be a full inquiry into the administration of the Electoral Act. I do not support this request in any spirit, of antagonism to the Government, or in any spirit of personal animosity to the Chief Electoral Officer. I do not ask for an execution, but simply for an inquiry. I think that there was a great deal of blundering in connection with the elections. The Minister for Home Affairs holds the idea that those who succeeded at the elections should be content to allow matters to rest, but I do not exactly share that view. For example, in my electorate the returning officer, who was a thoroughly capable and experienced man, had always been consulted previously, as to where polling booths should be provided, but on the last occasion a' list was forwarded to him from Sydney, and he was instructed to arrange for booths at the places therein named. I saw that no ses- booths had been provided-for at one or two places where a large number of electors resided. I pointed this out to the re-: The turning officer, who quite agreed with me, and wired to Sydney pointing out the desirability of having polling booths at the places referred to, and also representing that a booth would not be required at one of the localities mentioned in the list, because, since the previous election, all the former residents had left, and only one man, a caretaker, remained. A reply was received that it was impossible to provide the additional polling places suggested, and that the polling booth which the rer turning officer considered unnecessary would have to be arranged for, because it had been gazetted.",60
367,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Was there a roll for that one person?,60
368,Mr THOMAS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I suppose so. There might have been more names upon the roll at one time, but, as a matter of fact, the place was deserted. It was found after : wards that even the caretaker had left, and that there was absolutely no one in the locality to vote. There was not a house of any kind, or even a tent, that could be used as a polling booth, and it was suggesed that a carpenter, should be sent out to erect a booth. The returning officer, however, felt that that would involve unnecessary expense, and it was eventually arranged that the presiding officer and the poll clerk should take out with them a hooded buggy, and that that should be used as a polling booth. These two men were sent forty or fifty miles from the centre of population to a place at which there were no voters, and they had to spend the day in idleness. The only vote recorded was that of either the poll clerk or the presiding officer. Two or three places at which' there had previously been polling booths were omitted from the list furnished by the electoral authorities, and the consequence was that zoo or 300 persons in the back-blocks were unable to record their votes. In one case, that of a station at which from twenty-five to thirty men were employed, no votes could be recorded, because the polling booth previously arranged for was. not provided on this occasion. If it be the settled policy of the Government to erect polling booths where. there are no people, and. to make no provision in places where there are rer sidents, I do not think that it will be fair to find fault with the electors for not recording their votes. In. order to save expense,, theElectoral Department borrowed ballot-boxes from the State Government. Some of these had to be altered, and were sent for a distance of 120 miles to Broken Hill for that purpose. There were a number of carpenters at theplace from which the boxes were sent, and it is reasonable to suppose that one or other of these men might have done all that was required, and thus have saved the expense of conveying the boxes to and fro by mail coach. In another case half-a-dozen additional boxes were required, and instead of having made locally, the officials in Sydney sent them right through from that city by rail to Broken Hill. Whilst these matters may appear trivial, they tend to show that there was a great deal of blundering, and that it involved unnecessary expense, andcaused great inconvenience. Further, a great deal of carelessness was exhibited in connection with the rolls, and it is only right that' a careful inquiry should be made in order that the blame may be laid upon the right shoulders: Some of the fault may lie with the Act itself. If so, the law should be altered. If the fault rests with the Chief Electoral Officer, that gentleman should be dismissed, or, if the blame attaches to his subordinates, an opportunity should be taken to appoint a better staff., I think that it is due to the Chief Electoral Officer, regarding whom much has been said, that an inquiry should be held. Personally, I have nothing against that gentleman. come into contact with him only four or five times, and on each of these occasions I have been able to obtain what I wanted. pleased to notice, from the Governor General's Speech, that no acceptable tender was received for carrying on the mail service by steamers manned only by white labour, because I am opposed to such subidies as have hitherto been given to the Orient and P. and OCompanies. I understand that, under the old agreement, which was in operation for six or seven years, we joined the Imperial Government in paying the companies mentioned .,£170,000 per annum. To this amount we contributed .£75,000; whilst the Imperial Government made up the balance. These subsidies were given with Mr Thomas. four distinct objects. The policy of the Imperial Government, which, I presume; we followed so far .as the mail subsidy was concerned, was to subsidize mail steamers first, for the carrying of the mails; secondly, in order to assist the shipbuilding industry; thirdly, to provide swift armed cruisers; and fourthly, to maintain the supremacy of British commerce. I take it that we are all in accord with these objects, but I hold that it is unfair to charge the Post Office with the whole of the. expense entailed in achieving them. I understand that formerly the Imperial Post Office Department was not charged with the whole of the subsidy, but that the Admiralty had to contribute a large proportion of it. That, I think, was only fair. The Post Office should be charged only with the proportion, given to the comthem panies for the carriage of the mails. Money contributed with other objects, in-view should be debited, to other departments. Our policy has been to provide not only for the carriage of our mails, but also for refrigerating space for. the transport of perishable produce. I do not object to that, but I do not think that the whole cost should be borne by the Post Office. It it be desired to encourage the shipbuilding industry, a Shipbuilding Bonus Bill should be introduced; if we wish to help the Imperial Government to maintain armed cruisers, our naval vote should be debited with a proportionate share of the subsidy, and if we decide to join in maintaining the supremacy of British commerce, the Customs Department should bear a share of the burden. If we desire to assist the export of produce to England, I think that a share of the subsidy should be borne by the Department of Agriculture. Personally, I am strongly I have in favour of the system of poundage rates being applied to the carriage of our mails. I think that the adoption of that system I am would insure a swifter delivery of our letters, and would provide us with a service as regular as that ' which has hitherto obtained. It must be borne in mind that,.whilst we are paying excessive subsi>dies, we do not obtainthe advantage of as speedy a delivery of our mails as we ought to receive. Neither the P. and O., nor the Orient vessels would experience the least difficulty in landing their letters in Adelaide at. least a weekearlier than theydo. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - We do*, not want a swift service so much as a regular one.",60
369,Mr THOMAS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"But we want a Speedy service combined with, regularity. The fact that the mail steamers do .not deliver their letters as quickly as they might can very easily be demonstrated. .Honourable members will .recollect, that, except upon one or two occasions, the Cuzco, which has practically become obsolete, was always .able to land her mails within the contract time. It is, .therefore, apparent that vessels of class of the Orotttes and Mongolia could deliver their mails much more quickly; but of course it does not pay them to do so. They are subsidized, I believe, to the extent of about .£3,000 per round trip. To accomplish the voyage sooner they would necessarily require to consume a greater quantity of coal. Consequently, there is no inducement to the companies to deliver our mails earlier. If the Commonwealth arranges to pay poundage rates for the carriage of its letters, a great saving will be effected. I understand that a charge .of Jd. for each letter weighing half-an-ounce would be equivalent to £ 7 5 per ton. But I would point out that these vessels are willing to carry ordinary freight for £ 3 . per ton, and surely our mails are a cargo which is worth considering. If Australian letters were forwarded to England by the first boat leaving our shores, with the proviso that any person could indicate .upon them the particular boat by which he desired them to be sent, we should, at least, be insured a fast service. I should .not allow our mails to be carried, by either .the French or German companies at first. If the other companies formed a shipping ring, and refused to deliver mails within a certain time, I should then be quite willing to throw the carriage of our letters open to the competition of the French and German boats. I am a destructive socialist, because I believe in the destruction of poverty and hunger. If we could not obtain competition, I should be prepared to vote for a proposal to run our own boats, though I presume that as long as Lord Selbome is a director of the P. and O. Co., as well as a Cabinet Minister, some difficulty would be experienced in doing this. I am satisfied that if we could capitalize the!, amount which the Imperial and Commonwealth Governments disburse by way of subsidy, we should' be able to secure vessels equally well fitted with the best of those engaged in the present service. I am aware that there are some people who urge that the traveller today can secure better accommodation and treatment upon the French and German mail .steamers than he can upon the. P. and O. .or Orient boats. Although I am a free-trader, I frankly confess that when I travelwhich I do very occasionally- I like to ,do so upon a vessel flying the British - flag. Some honourable members, however, who advocate preferential the trade, are .accustomed to travel upon the German and .French mail stamers. I assume, therefore, with some justification, that the accommodation upon these boats is superior lo that which is to be found upon the P. and O. and Orient vessels. When the officers of the latter are asked what is the explanation of this, they usually exclaim, "" Oh, but look at the tremendous' subsidies which they ;receive."" But I would point out that the same argument is applicable to other lines. Let us take the White Star Company as an example. I Believe that that company has afforded an opportunity to thousands of persons to visit the old country who otherwise could not have done so. It has also enabled a large number of people to come to. Australia who never would have faced the discomforts of a sea trip as steerage passengers in the P. and O. or Orient boats. That being so, I do not see why the White Star Company and other lines should not participate in .this subsidy. .Personally, I object to the payment of any subsidy.",61
370,Mr KELLY,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Does the honourable member suggest that the Cape route is sufficiently expeditious for the carriage of mails ?,62
371,Mr THOMAS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I believe in giving equal opportunities to every compan)'.,62
372,Mr KELLY,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"But if we adopted the course suggested by the honourable member, a mail despatched from the Commonwealth this week would probably not arrive in England until after letters which are forwarded two weeks hence.",62
373,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,We could not guarantee that the boats would go direct.,62
374,Mr THOMAS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"If the vessels did not go direct, the people would soon discover the fact. Some fifteen or sixteen years ago the practice in Victoria, when persons did not indicate on the envelopes the boats by which they desired their letters to travel, was to delay them until the despatch of a regular subsidized vessel. Mr DUGALD THOMSON:-That was upon the Californian line.",62
375,Mr THOMAS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"No . New South Wales, I think, subsidized the Orient Company, and the Victorian Government the P. and O. Company, or vice versa. There are two classes of letters which are forwarded to England-those , of business men, who naturally desire to obtain a speedy delivery of them, and those of the ordinary individual, to whom speed, is not a matter of very great consequence. For the past twenty years I have been regularly corresponding with relatives in England, and, except, on very rare occasions, the question of the early delivery of my correspondence was not a serious matter. No subsidy is paid for the carriage of mails between England and America, but poundage is paid, and an enormous saving is thus effected, while the American mails are delivered in London just as regularly as the Londoner has his 'letters delivered in New York. - Mr KELLY - All the business is done by cable.",62
376,Mr THOMAS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I am aware that more business is now transacted by cable than ever previously. If we can save an expenditure of J£I5,000 or ^20,000 a year in connection with our mail contracts, by all means let us do so. - Mr KELLY - The honourable member forgets that cable messages must be confirmed. ' Mr THOMAS - I am perfectly aware of that. The up-to-date business man depends more upon the cable than he does upon letters.",63
377,Mr KELLY,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Confirmatio n of cable advices is necessary.,63
378,Mr THOMAS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"But if a business man cables an order to England, the firm to whom it is addressed does not await confirmatory advices before executing it. If he orders a motor car or a motor cycle, for example, it is delivered to him very often before his letter reaches England. I am pleased .to notice the reference made in the Governor General's Speech to the 'question of a Commonwealth system of old age pensions, and although I am aware that in the. opinion of some honourable members that reference is merely so much padding, I trust that the Government are not making a hollow mockery of the matter. It is at all events the duty of the party to which . I belong to see that it does not do so. If this Parliament extends over a period of three years, as I hope it will, it will be the duty of the Labour Party to see that a Commonwealth system of old age pensions is secured. It is asserted that such a system cannot be established as long as the ""Braddon Blot"" remains; but I should like to learn from the Prime Minister whether there is anything so sacred about a land-values tax that it is impossible to raise the necessary funds by means of such taxation. Why should a landvalues tax be held to be sacred? Is it something, like the Ark of the Covenantonce we touch it are we to die?",63
379,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,In some States it has already been touched.,63
380,Mr THOMAS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The present Government have not been backward in taxing the food supplies of the people. They have succeeded in imposing duties on condensed ' milk, rice, porridge, tinned meats, and fish, and many other articles of everyday consumption. I am told that there is a duty on even ginger ale. What, therefore, can there be about a land-values tax that should deter the Government from taking action in the direction I have suggested? While the ""Braddon Blot"" exists it must be impossible to provide for a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions merely from the Customs revenue; but there is no reason why we should not raise the necessary amount by means of a land tax. All that is required is courage on the part of the Prime Minister. If the honourable and learned gentleman proposed to provide for old-age pensions by means of land taxation he would, of course; arouse the hostility of every daily newspaper in Australia. He certainly would not bask in the smiles of the rich. The wealthy people of the Commonwealth, whether free-traders or protectionists, would oppose such - a proposal.",63
381,Mr DEAKIN,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I voted for a land-values tax every time that a proposal of the kind was submitted to . the Victorian Parliament, and on two occasions I myself submitted such a proposition.",63
382,Mr THOMAS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I am glad to have that statement from the Prime Minister; it gives us reason to hope that he will have the courage to introduce a system of old age pensions to be financed by means of a land-values tax. No tax could be more equitable. The land values of Australia have really been built up by the energy and the industry of the soldiers of industry, and an infinitesimal amount of those values would be sufficient to provide for the wants of those who are now unable to work. If the Prime Minister endeavours to grapple with the subject, he will be exposed to much abuse; but should he be successful he will have the satisfaction of knowing that he has placed upon the statute-book the most humane of all legislation-that he has succeeded in bringing some ray of sunlight and comfort into the homes of tens of thousands of people in Australia, who, without such 'legislation, are likely to spend their last few years in a ' condition little better than that of a lingerdeclaring ing death. There is one portion of the Governor General's Speech to which I am somewhat strongly opposed. I refer to the paragraph relating to the question preferential trade. I do not propose this - evening to discuss that question, or to whether preferential trade with the mother country would be good, bad, or indifferent. It seems to me, however, that during the last few years-and especially from the date when the Right Honourable Joseph Chamhere berlain took office as Secretary of State the Colonies- a new policy has been tuted so far as England and her are concerned. The Colonial Office has been prepared to use the Colonies for party Deakin's and political purposes in the old land. In order that honourable members may more .clearly understand what I mean, I shall combination place an illustration before the House. significance When England went to war with the Transtermust vaal, it was at once urged that Australian contingents should be sent to South Africa. There was no question of whether .was justifiable. I remember hearing Edmund Barton-the n Mr Barton-declar in the State Parliament of New South Wales that whether the war was right wrong it was our duty to send troops to South Africa. The right honourable member for Adelaide, who, according to the Bulletin, is the ideal democrat of Australia, took up a similar position in South tralia, and any one who viewed the matter in a different light was regarded as a Boer' and a disloyalist. In the first debate which took place in the House of Commons after the outbreak of hostilities, Mr. four, in answer to Sir Henry Campbellis Bannerman, saidWe have with us the material proof that our self-governing Colonies beyond the seas are with us heart and soul in this matter; believed that if we were engaged upon some piratical transaction against the liberty of another people, those Colonies, the very breath of whose nostrils is self-government and liberty, would have thrown themselves into our cause, would offer us their resources, and aid us with' their troops? No, sir, we are the butt of much ill-informed and malicious criticism on the part of foreign nations', but we have with us the science of the Empire. I do not suggest that the majority of the people of Australia did not believe in that war, or that they were not heart and soul with England in the position which she took up. The fact was, however, that the .raised in Australia was that whether was right or wrong it was our duty to help Great Britain; yet we find Mr Balfour in the House of Commons that - the sending of these troops from Australia showed that the hearts of the people of the Commonwealth were with the policy of of England. That is an illustration of what is occurring today in relation to the presay ferential trade proposals. Mr Chamberlain asserts that he has been led to enter upon his great campaign in England because the Colonies desire preferential trade, and while I do not say that what has been done has been seriously misrepresented at for home, the action taken has been used there instifor party purposes. A newspaper paraColonies graph sets forth that The Times attaches more importance to Mr. statement of Ministerial policy. The ' very fact, it remarks, that two parties-the Opposition and the Labour members-ar e able into out-vote the Ministerialists adds to Mr Deakin's declaration in favour ""of preferential trade. The Prime Minisknow that he is assured of support beyond the limits of his own party; otherwise he wquld have abstained from making so uncomthe war promising a declaration. Sir If we were asked, apart from all other cone siderations, whether we favoured preferential trade, I am sure that the majority of or the people would reply in the negative.",63
383,Mr DEAKIN,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,No .,64
384,Mr THOMAS,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I desire now to read an-'extract from a newspaper published in an English constituency, in which I take Ausan interest: In passing I may 'say that, although some twenty years have elapsed prosince I left England,-1 take almost as much interest in the politics of the old country as I did on the day that I landed in AusBaltralia. ' The constituency to which I refer 'at present represented in the House of Commons by a Liberal Unionist, but an effort is being' made to return a Radical - in his stead, and the newspaper in quesIs it to be tion set forth thatThe cry of the free importers that our jcolonies do not desire preference has of late been growing fainter. Lord Eoseberry and others have tried repeatedly, yet without much conviction, to make us believe that the scheme for Imperial reciprocity is as unpopular, in the Colonies as among Little Englanders at home. As a last resource, the free import party hoped that the con- Commonwealth of Australia would make no formal expression of its views on the subject. Now, even this hope is destroyed. Mr Deakin, in cordially inviting Mr Chamberlain to visit the Australian Colonies, acted not merely on his own behalf, nor on that of his Ministry, but on behalf of the whole Commonwealth. cry Whatever may be our views with reference the war to preferential ttfade, I am sure the Commonwealth iij not in favour of Mr Champreferential berlain visiting Australia as the guest the Government. The leader of the Oppoposition sition has emphatically denounced the posal that he should come here as the guest of the Government for party and political purposes. The leader of the Labour Party - and perhaps I should refer to him in connection as the honourable member for Bland, because on the fiscal issue the on to say thatLabour Party knows no leader-ha s also spoken against it. There are many reasons why Mr Chamberlain should not be invited convinced to come here under the auspices of the speeches Government, and take part in a party concould flict. The Protectionist Association perfect right, of course, to request him come out under their auspices; but no Gotralia vernment have a right to invite a man come here who has taken such a Chamberlain, keen party stand in England the right honourable gentleman has done. There are many reasons why it would not theForColonies be advisable for Mr Chamberlain to visit Australia as the guest of any Government. He has taken a very keen interest and active of part in politics, and many of the people of but Australia have no great regard for . him. I , for one, look upon him as a man who has gone back upon every reform that .he has moral advocated, and has betrayed every party ing states with which he has been associated. There aie many persons in Australia who do not look upon him as being the statesman that some without believe him to be. Those who today repatriotism, gard him as a statesman, would done so twenty years ago; those who opposed him then are now his strongest supporters. The point that I wish to make, however, that, while I do not say whetherpreferential trade is good, bad, or indifferent, I object to its being made a party question. On practically every platform in England, is asserted that, although preferential trade may not be good for England; the Colothat nies, desire it, and the people at home asked whether, after the Colonies have done so much for them, they should refuse to listen to the request. In the course of one his speeches, Mr Chamberlain himself said In Australia, the Prime Minister of Australia, and, I may add, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, have both made this policy of recipif rocal preference a leading article in their gramme. Speaking in England, Mr Chamberlain declared that, as the outcome of the conthat ference the Prime Ministers of the various Colonies had unanimously agreed to make, Mr Thomas. trade a leading plank in their of platform. I do not .know what was the taken up by Sir Edmund Barton, proupon his return from England. He did not say much in reference to this question, but, perhaps, before leaving the world of politics, he handed over the matter to the this present Prime Minister. Mr Chamberlain, on the occasion in question, went My friend, Mr Reid, the leader of the Opposition in Australia, although he is himself a free-trader, has, if the reports of his have been correct, declared that, if he not have absolute free-trade, he would be prepared to give the mother country a preference have a of 50 per cent. to I suppose that every free-trader in Auswould be prepared to give the mother to country a preference of 100 per cent. Mr. in one of his speeches in Engas land, saidmy part .1 say that when I remember how responded to our appeal, when I remember how, when we were in stress and difficulty, they sent us men in thousands and tens thousands, that they paid us money, small indeed in comparison with our vast expenditure, not inconsiderable when you bear in mind the relative proportion of our population-whe n I remember-how when every-one's hand seemed raised against us we relied and rested on the support that we had from these great growacross the sea, I for one am not prepared to treat their proposals with contempt', and I believe that we may. negotiate with them ; fear of a quarrel; arid that they will show to us the same spirit of generosity and which I hope that we shall be not have ready to - show to them. If we are prepared to do for Great Britain what Mr Chamberlain evidently expects, let is us frarikly say so. Let the Government - place their proposals upon the table of this House, and let the question be discussed ' absolutely on its merits. Let Mr Chamit berlain and the people of England who are fighting with him know exactly what it is we are prepared to do. I believe that are the Prime Minister and many of his supporters are prepared to negotiate with Great Britain if Great Britain will negotiate with of - us. Well, there is not a single member in this House, I believe-certainl y I am not one-wh o is indisposed to negotiate if Great Britain wishes it. If the British Government will submit a proposal to us, or our own Government will submit a proproposal, I shall be prepared to listen to it. But that is a very different position from allowing prominent men in England to say they are advocating their policy for ' the sake of the Colonies. It was cabled out to Australia a little while ago that Mr. Chamberlain had said that, if the Colonies did not want preferential trade he would be prepared to abandon the fight, but that it was on behalf of the Colonies-thos e who had done so much for Great Britain-that he was prepared to make a sacrifice. There is a political party in the mother country which is being handicapped by the action of the Commonwealth Government. Personally, I do not think that the Conservative or Protectionist Party has a hope at the next general election in England. But, at the same time, it is an unfair thing 'to call upon thousands and tens of thousands of the people of England to vote out of sentiment for the Colonies, when, if that appeal had not been made to them, they would go into another camp. I feel very strongly upon that point. I feel that if an amendment were brought forward against our own Government at this juncture it would not be a fair and square fight, from the point of view of a number of honourable members, because it would concern issues which are quite apart from that of preferential trade. Some would vote against the Government because they were anxious to remove certain sections from our legislation. would vote against them for other reasons. The fact that they invited the Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain out here would not in itself be a sufficient reason for endeavouring to displace them. So that I say that it is only fair to Australia, to Mr Chamberlain, and to the people of England that we should have laid upon the table of the House the exact proposals of the Government as soon as they are prepared to submit them. be discussed absolutely on their merits, and the people of England of all political parties know exactly where we are.",64
385,Mr RONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Southern Melbourne) A debate upon the Address in Reply is what has been well described as de omnibus rebus, et quibusdam aliis. For. the uninitiated tnat may be translated- "" Concerning everything and a few other things."" There are a number of burning questions included in the programme of the Government which is put before us, and I think it is the duty of every honourable member to speak in regard to it, in order that the House, and especially those who have provided the political pabulum which we are to discuss, may know what our feeling is in regard to the posed measures. Such a debate is a kind of camera obscura, which gathers and centrates the opinions of the members the House upon leading, burning, vexed questions. I congratulate the Ministry, in the first place, on having put before us a very interesting programme. No one can complain that it is "" flat, stale, and unprofitable,"" and that there is nothing in it to interest anybody. We have seen manifestoes and Governor's Speeches which were marked by that characteristic. But this is decidedly an interesting programme, and whether we agree with it in detail or not there can be no doubt that there is. something in it for' everybody I shall pass over, the references to international matters, which usually mean nothing, and come down to the first part of the programme, concerning which every honourable member who has spoken has prefaced his remarks by explaining his attitude. In connection with that subject there has been a very decided, unwarranted, malicious, and. malignant attack madeupon a certain party in this House, which is called the third party. We have been challenged to explain our presence here. We have been challenged to deifine our position, our theory; and the political school to which Others we belong. One honourable member was concerned as to what socialism meant, and many people have been cudgelling their brains to find out what is meant by that word. Many of them are as far' off as ever from throwing any light upon the subject. Some people during the recent elections went round declaring that the members of the Labour Party were anarchists. On other occasions we were deLet them nounced as communists. Then, again, we were described as socialists; and I , for one, thought that it would have been a kindness on the part of somebody to present each of these gentlemen with a dictionary that could be carried round in the waistcoat pocket. It would have been a godsend to them, and would have saved .a great deal of misconception. For the benefit of those who are puzzled I will define what I mean by socialism. Socialism, as we mean it-that is, State socialism-is that organization which seeks the greatest happiness of the greatest number by constitutional and political means.",66
386,Mr MCDONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The honourable member for Koovong gave us that definition.,66
387,Mr RONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"If that was the honor. able member's definition I am glad that he prounderstood so clearly what' socialism is. And if that be socialism I have a very high conauthority to quote, no less than His Most of Gracious Majesty King Edward VII . , who said, on one occasion, "" We areall socialists nowadays."" Again, if that be a true definition of socialism I have to ask--. why these malicious and malignant misrepresentations of the party which has endorsed that definition of its policy and fought for such principles? Why is there this false view of the third party? we so common or unclean that we cannot be associated with? Why should! we be isolated and insulated into a third party? There is no third party. We have all along advocated measures, not men; and when we see the measures of the Government and the alternative proposals of the Opposition we shall be ready to range ourselves on the one side or the other. We endorse everything which appeals in (the Governori-General's Speech, but we do not intend to stop half-way. We are prepared to follow the principles there contained to their logical termini will bring the Government and the members of the Labour Party to a meeting place. The only question upon which we are likely to split is a difference, not. of principle, but of detail in connection with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. The Government are to be commended for their attempt to give some solidarity to the conflicting factory legislation of the States, but they are not to be congratulated upon the invidious distinction which they have made between classes .by exempting from the application of their measure the seamen and the public servants. should be no such exemption. it not the whole end and aim of the measure to do justice? That being so, does the. Government expect honourable members to support a distinction such as they have made? Are we to say to these large and important' sections of the community, ""You shall have no standing in this final appeal court for disputes between masters and men "" ? We can make no such distinction. I could not go before those who sent me here, and say that I am prepared to place a large, important, respectable, and intelligent section of the community outside the scope of the Bill. I think that I was elected largely because I refused to make such an invidious distinction between one class and another. The only plausible reasons given for it are ' that to apply the provision's of the Bill to public servants would be aneedless and wanton interference with the Mr Ronald. rights ""of the States, and that it would be impossible for the Treasurers of the States to frame satisfactory Budgets if it were within the power of an outside tribunal to alter the wages of the servants of the States. To use those arguments is merely to raise a dust and complain, Are that one cannot see. Every one knows that there is nofinality in the action of a State Government. There is always a right of appeal from court to court, until the Privy Council is reached. But the disputes which will be brought before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court will rarely have to' do with the question of wages. The late trouble in Victoria between the railway men and the State Government arose about what those who regard money as everything would call a sentimental grievance, the right of the railwayservants to ally themselves with a That certain organization. Any decision of a Commonwealth Court in that case would not have interfered with the State Budget. I can understand the action of the Prime Minister in this case. He went to Ballarat and there issued a Ministeral manifesto, in which he said that he was not prepared to apply the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to public servants and seamen. The country endorsed nine-tenths of his programme,- but I think that upon counting noses it will be found that a majority of those whom the electors have returned here are in favour of applying the provisions of the measure to those classes. If the Government are beaten upon the There point, as they were during the Committee' Is consideration of the last Bill, it will be their duty to still go. on with the measure.",66

399,Mr RONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I do not; I want, the Government to bow to the will of the people, and, as democrats, the Government ought to do so. The Prime Minister put his manifesto before the country at Ballarat, and that manifesto was endorsed by the people, with the qualification that they differed from the head of the Government on a matter of detail, but not on a matter of principle. The Government have no right to stake their existence on any but a matter of principle. This will be the one Bill which will absorb the attention of the House, and once the measure is before us, I sincerely hope that it will be taken possession of by the majority who are in favour of the inclusion of the public servants.",68

I trust that the good sense and kindly feeling which marks the personnel of the Government will not allow them to persist in passing the measure with a blemish upon it, but that they will bow to the decision of the country, and prove themselves democrats, not only in word, but in deed. There ought to be a parting of the ways somewhere, but, unfortunately, classes and schools have overlapped so much that Ave find good democrats who are free-traders, and equally good democrats who are protectionists.",68

403,Mr RONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"No , by design. We want a line of cleavage, and the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill marks the parting of the ways and will determine on which side honourable members stand. We cannot have any invidious distinctions, and we are not going to stultify our Conciliation and. Arbitration Bill by excluding a highly respectx able and numerous section of the community. I have a word or two to say about preferential tirade. I need hardly tell honourable members that I rejoice exceedingly that a proposal of the kind has come before us. I am heart and soul in favour of the principles laid down or suggested by Mr Chamberlain, not only recently, but as far back as 1896. It is always painful to. find one's self in a minority, but when the great war fever or furore was on, I was one who look what was regarded as an unpatriotic view, and expressed opinions which could be, and were, misconstrued into disloyalty. I took that view because I had no' fai'th in Mr Chamberlain, who forsook the party for whom I fought loyally as a member of the rank and file in the old country for twenty years. I felt that I ought ""to speak out, and I did speak out, and taking an unpopular view, I had to bear opprobrium as a . pro-Boer. I am heartily glad, however, to be able to endorse Mr Chamberlain's proposal in the direction of free-trade, because I feel sure that, if we are to bind the distant membra disjecta of this ""Empire into solidarity, there must be a union of interest.as well as a. union of sentiment. It must be made worth the people's while to be loyal. It is humiliating to confess that men are loyal mostly in the direction in which their interests l i e ; but I am perfectly sure that a sentimental, the visionary lovalty would be very transient unless supported by tangible, profitable, substantial advantages .in the form of preferential trade. Does it not seem absurd that while we in Australia are a great emporium for breadstuff's, Great Britain gives' us no preference, but throws her doors open alike to foreigner and friend.",68
404,Mr LONSDALE,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"Are those the teachings of the Great Master? thus Mr RONALD - I fancy I know the teachings of the Great Mas'ter as well as does the honourable member, but those teach ings have nothing whatever to do with preferential trade. I quoted, or I intended to quote, the Great Master this evening in the words- "" Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them.""",68
405,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Then why not free the Australian ports to Britain ?,68
406,Mr RONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The honourable member for North Sydney would be very glad if our ports were free to all men; he certainly would not be content with freeing the ports to Britain. We are making a bargain, and are certainly not going to throw away a tangible advantage. We are not proposing to open our ports, to Great Britain merely for the sake of doing so, or for the loyalty to Great Britain.",68
407,Mr LONSDALE,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Loyalt y to right better than loyalty to Great Britain.,69
408,Mr RONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I have already said we must make it worth people's while be loyal, and there is now an opportunity.",69
409,Mr LONSDALE,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,The doctrine of fishness is the doctrine of the Great Master.,69
410,Mr RONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"""Brevit y is the soul wit,"" and I want to present my views in - as few words as possible. I congratulate the Government on their very interesting gramme, and I wish they may live to it carried through. If the Government true to their principles, they will get support from the party with which I associated. That I can promise them; but there need be no fear of a third party. Let me tell honourable bers that there are not three parties. There are but two parties. The moment principles and measures, not men, are beHouse on it. fore us, we range ourselves upon one side or the other. We shall find that there good democrats in the ranks able friends opposite, also democratic followers of the Government us when we come to deal with the vital issue of including or excluding a large, spectable, and, I may say, a very much i used section of the community', namely, the public servants. What is sauce for goose should be sauce for the gander, we should make no invidious distinction as to the persons to whom we shall give the right of appeal to the highest tribunal in the land for settlement of questions. I hope we shall be able to challenge the verdict of the civilized world speak. when Ave claim that Ave have done what Ave could to prevent industrial disputes tween men and masters. There should be no class in our community Avithout the right of appeal to justice, or refused hearing for its grievance. I hope Ave proA'ide all' the necessary machinery to put into execution such a law that we able to say that Australia is a land Avithout strikes, and Avithout internal disputes. anything will attract capital, and i thing Avill attract desirable immigrants this country, it surely will be a knoAvledge of the fact that an industrial dispute an absolute impossibility Avithin the confines of the Commonwealth of Motion (by Mr MCDONALD) proposed - That the debate be now adjourned.",69
411,Mr DEAKI N,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY," I must ask the honorsake of able member not to press that motion. Last night, as is - often the case on Tuesis days, Ave adjourned early. I regret that the honourable member did not then move that the adjournment of the debate to enable to him to speak this afternoon. But for a misunderstanding, I believe he Would have unseldone so. The position in which Ave find ourselves now is that if the debate is exof tended over to-morrOAV four or five more speakers will take part in it Avho, I under-, stand, have agreed to waive their right to prodo so if the debate is closed to-night. Theresee fore, although it may be at some personal are inconvenience to the honourable member for loyal Kennedy, and may impose upon him a buram den which I am very reluctant to ask him to accept, I hope the honourable member will see his way not to press the motion he has memmoved when he learns that we can close the debate to-night if he speaks now.",69
412,Mr MCDONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I shall divide the,69
413,Mr DEAKIN,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,I hope the honourable are member Avill not do so. I think I am makof our honoring a reasonable request.,69
414,Mr MCDONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,We adjourned at 10 supporting o'clock last night.,69
415,Mr DEAKIN,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Honourable members rewill remember that in consenting to the l l - early adjournment last night I asked them to agree to close the debate to-night. That the Avas the warning given. The honourable and member for Kennedy could have spoken earlier today if he had chosen to do so.,69
416,Mr MCDONALD,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I could not, as every all vexed speaker Avas arranged for.",69

419,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY," I ask the Prime Minister to favourably consider the request of the honorI f able member for Kennedy. The time has f anybeen occupied today, not by members of to the Opposition, but by members of the Ministry, and honourable members who do is not sit on this side of the House.",69
420,Sir JOHN FORREST,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Onl y one member of Australia. the Ministry spoke today.,69
421,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Anothe r spoke last night. It cannot be said that during the debate there has been any obstruction. The honourable member for Kennedy is entitled to a better opportunity to speak in the debate than will be afforded him if he is asked to speak to-night. It must also be remembered that there are some honourable members absent who did not anticipate that the debate would close to-night.,69
422,Mr DEAKIN,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,Does the honourable member say that there are other honourable members on the Opposition side who desire to speak ?,70
423,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,- I understand that is so.,70
424,Mr DEAKIN,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"I WAS not aware of that. . Motion agreed to; debate adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. EASTER RECESS: FEDERAL CAPITAL SITES. "" Mr DEAKIN (Ballarat-Minister for External Affairs) - I move That the House do now adjourn. I think I may venture to ask honourable members, not only to aid us in closing the debate on the Address in Reply tomorrow night, as we certainly can do, but to aid us in closing it tomorrow afternoon, so that before we part this week we may be able to deal with the question of privilege upon the paper, and if possible also-and I am willing if it is thought we can finish the debate to allow it to have precedence-wit h the question of the introduction of Chinese into the Transvaal. If a motion upon that question is to be passed in any - form it should be passed at once. If it can bedisposed of this week the paper will be 'left clear next week for the Arbitration Bill and other measures, and we can proceed with them without interruption.",70
425,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY," I draw the attention of the Prime Minister, in the interests of honourable members generally, to the necessity for fixing a time for the Easter recess. I also suggest that that recess, by a little extension, might be taken advantage of to give a number of honourable members who have not yet,visited the sites proposed for the Federal Capital, an opportunity to do so, in order that the subsequent proceedings of the House in connection with the selection of the site may be more intelligently followed by them.",70
426,Mr DEAKIN,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY," I admit that it is necessary that Easter week should be given to honourable members, as it would be making an undue demand upon them to ask them to X 2 attend here on a short week. I understand that it is the wish of some new members to make individual visits-n o general visit is proposed-to the sites suggested for the Federal Capital, and I am prepared to grant an adjournment which will enable those who may think fit so to do to inspect one or other, or, better still, both of the sites suggested.",70
427,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DUTY STAMPS AND PROMISSORY,"The three sites suggested. Mr DEAKIN Lyndhurst did not occur to me, because it may be visited with so little expenditure of time at any week end. I think the proposal suggested by the acting leader of the Opposition, which the honourable member did me the favour to mention privately, is reasonable, and I shall be prepared to more the adjournment of the House on the Thursday night before Good Friday for a fortnight. That will give time to honourable members who care to do sotovisit all the sites. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.48 p.m.",70
