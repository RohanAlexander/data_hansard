6,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,"I accept nomination. The lime"" for further proposals having expired,",14
7,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Fremantle) [11.12] On behalf of the Opposition, I shall state the reasons why the unusual course has been taken of nominating a member from its own ranks against the nominee of the Government, who was the Speaker in the last Parliament. However, such a course is not without precedent. The Opposition Port has taken this action, not because it has any illusions about the result of the vote for the election of Mr Speaker, but because it wishes to show its disapproval of the manner in which the Government's nominee exorcised his function as Mr Speaker in the Nineteenth Parliament. We believe that the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), who has been nominated by the Government, was deficient in his public discharge of his duty, in his treatment of individual members of this House, and in his interpretation of Standing Order 303 under which, without a vote of the House, he required the withdrawal of honourable members from the chamber. We object strongly to his habit of casting persona] reflections on honourable members on this side of ' the House, especially in respect of their former occupations, as he did to the right honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt) and to the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr. Duthie). Scarcely a day passed in the last Parliament without some completely partisan shaft of sarcasm being directed at individual members of the Opposition. We consider that his interpretation of the Standing Orders, which caused the withdrawal of members from the House, has been the means of saving himself the embarrassment of seeing certain members on his right vote with the Opposition against his arbitrary actions. That actually happened on one occasion. Therefore, we believe that the Government, if it proposes to proceed with the appointment of a man who uses his - I position to air public vendettas against highly placed persons, and private ones against members of the Opposition, as should be shown before the public as one making the appointment of a partisan Speaker, by a partisan vote, without the consent of the Opposition.",14
8,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"Melbourne) [11.17]. - When the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) was nominated for the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives in the Eighteenth Parliament, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Menzies, nominated the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCDonald) and said, among other thingsWe believe, mid imagine that all honourable members will believe, that it is the function of Mr Speaker to be scrupulously impartial in his treatment of both sides of the House. All honourable members who were in the last Parliament will recall that on, at any rate, two occasions, it became necessary for the members of the Opposition to put into formal shape their protest against rulings given by Mr Speaker in that Parliament, and against what they believe to be his partial treatment of members of the House. If there were any grounds for complaint against the manner in which Mr . Speaker Rosevear presided over this House, we believe that the Opposition in the Nineteenth Parliament had much more reason to be dissatisfied with the treatment that was meteel out by his successor, Mr Speaker Cameron. Mr . Speaker Rosevear had the distinction of occupying the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives for a longer period than had any of his predecessors. He made his mistakes, but he at least did try tx> be fair, ancl he at least had the authority of May, and of others to justify his rulings. In the last Parliament, we had the spectacle of the honourable member for Barker, as Mr Speaker, ruling out a notice of motion on one day, yet permitting it to be discussed two days later. When it was pointed out in division to him that he had previously ruled the motion out of order, he said, "" Well, we might as well have a vote on something"". That is the rafferty's rule principle under which the procedure of this House was directed by Mr Speaker Cameron. We believe that, on many occasions, he was harsh, unjust and unfair. We also believe that he was prejudiced, biased and partisan. In that spirit we submit as our nominee for the Chair the name of the best Speaker that this House has had in its history. If the honourable member for Barker wished to find an example upon which he could base his conduct, he need go no further back than Mr Speaker Nairn, who at least had the respect of honourable members on both sides of the House. Unfortunately, Mr Speaker has demonstrated his exhibitionism on many occasions. That is a regrettable trait in his make-up. We do not dislike him on personal grounds, but we think that he has a duty to the whole of the Parliament and that he should be perfectly fair to all honourable members. H is treatment of the honourable member for Wilmo t (Mr Duthie) in the Nineteenth Parliament was a particularly bad example of petty tyranny. We believe that his misuse of Standing Order 303 was deliberate and that the standing order was never intended by the Parliament to be used in that way. It was promulgated for the purpose of authorizing the removal of any member who might be under the influence of liquor. But it was used during the Nineteenth Parliament for the removal of honourable members who, for the moment, happened to have cause for dissatisfaction with Mr . Speaker! No honourable member on the Government side of the House was removed from the chamber, although the conduct of such honourable members on many occasions was more worthy of condemnation than was that of any member of the Opposition. We believe that no honourable member should be removed from the House except by a direct vote of the House. We hope that, should the former Speaker be re-elected, he will improve his ways and will be much fairer than he has been in the past. At any rate, lie is the only Minister in the history of the Parliament of the Commonwealth to be removed from the House for disobeying the Speaker. He was removed from this chamber for the duration of one sitting on the motion of his own Prime Minister. A man with a conviction of that sort recorded against him is not worthy to be-the Speaker of this House.",14
9,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"Kooyong-Prime Minister) [11.22] - This exhibition that is being put on by the Opposition is entirely discreditable and will deceive nobody. The two honourable members who have already addressed themselves to the Ohair have sought to recapitulate all the complaints that they had against the Speaker in the last. Parliament. Their object, no doubt, has been to provoke a lengthy debate in which all those matters w i i l once more be discussed as the result of which, of course, the new Speaker will come to the Chair in an atmosphere made suitably murky by the discussion. I do not propose to introduce the new Speaker to the Chair in such circumstances. Every honourable member who was in this House during the last Parliament will recall that every one of those matters was debated at the time, and every honourable member who is familiar with the practices of this House knows that, after all these matters have once more been discussed-and they have been adjudged upon already by the vote of the House time after time to the entire vindication of Mr Speaker Cameron- I shall rise to congratulate Mr Speaker and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Chifley) will add his congratulations to Mr Speaker upon having attained the office that he once more holds.",15
10,Mr WARD,Unknown,Do not be too sure of that!,16
11,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I hope that I may be sure, because I should never anticipate any breach of parliamentary decorum from the right honourable'gentleman who sits opposite me.

12,The CLERK,Unknown,"I have to announce theresult of the ballot as follows:- Mr . Archie Cameron, 67 votes; Mr Eosevear. 52 votes. As the honourable member for Barker has secured a majority of the votes of the members present, he is elected to the position of Speaker of this House. Members of the House then calling Mr. Archie Cameron to the Chair, he was.. 68 taken out of his place by Mr MCDonald .. 51 and Mr Bowden and conducted to the Chair. .. 17 Mr SPEAKER said-On this theAYES. second occasion of my election as Speaker of this House I thank the House, or those of its members who ""voted for me. for this mark of the confidence that they Kent Hughes, W. S. Lawrence, W. K. have in me. I shall leave in its properplace, which is oblivion, what was said a little while ago. It might have been MCColm. M . L . MCDonald, A.

F . Parliament the Standing Orders will be administered in exactly the same way as they were administered in the 10th Parliament. The only other remark that I wish to make-and this will be the second occaWontworth. W. C. Wheeler. It. C. sion on which I shall have made it-ha? reference to the order of precedence of the presiding officers of the two houseof the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The matter has been put by me, in. Gnllett-. H . B. S. writing, to the Prime Minister (Mr.. Menzies). It bas arisen, on this occasion, out of the visit which I was fortunate enough to be able to make to London last year in connection with the opening of the new British House of Commons. With the new status accorded to the Dominions as a result of the passage of the Statute of Westminster, it seems to me completely wrong that the presiding officers of the two houses of the Parliament of the Commonwealth should rank lower than the junior Ministers of the Executive.",16
13,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,"Hear , hear!",17
14,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I admit that in that regard I find myself on the same side as the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) occupied on a previous occasion. I put it to the House that no man can become a member of the Executive unless he has first become a member of either of the two Houses of the Parliament. In my view the person elected to preside over either of those Houses, however unworthy he may be, or no matter how many toes he may have trodden on in his political career, is in a position that warrants a higher status than that accorded to him in the present order of precedence. Having said that, r take the chair. Mr Speaker having seated himself in Ihe Chair,",17
15,Mr MENZIES,Unknown," I offer to you, sir, our congratulations on your renewed appointment to the high office of Speaker of this House. I speak, of course, having heard vour remarks just now, with all the disability of a man who has heen changing --teadily for the worse during the last six vears. Subject to that disability, I assure you that, whatever differences you may have heard about-and I am sure you have not heard of them today in your - official capacity-everybod y in this place has a warm regard for your honesty and your ability. We are particularly glad - that, comparatively recently, you had opportunity in London, at the time ""the opening of the new House of mons, to meet other presiding officers able members on both sides of the Housfrom other British countries, I have no doubt to your own great advantage as result of the many contacts you made. We look forward to having, from time ""to time, the benefit of that additional experience which you have been able to gain. We congratulate you and wish you well.",17
16,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown," I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) in extending congratulations to you, Mr Speaker, on your election to the very distinguished position that you now hold and on having secured the unanimous backing of the Government and its supporters in thi? House in their nomination of you for that position. I say, as the Prime Minister has said, that whatever difference!, of opinion there may be nobody in thi? House doubts your complete honesty and integrity. But it would be idle for me to say that some of your actions and rulings during the last Parliament gave anything but profound dissatisfaction to - honourable members on this side of the House. In my opinion, some of your rulings were calculated to provoke discord and disharmony and to arouse amon«> Opposition members the feeling that you were not acting in as impartial a manner as the speech which you made on the occasion of your last election to the Speakership of this House would have led honourable members to expect. How- .,. ever, hope springs eternal in the human ' breast, and I had hoped that your conduct of the proceedings might have become better as time passed, but the remarks that you have just made rather dissipate any such hopes. In offering you my congratulations I can only say that I regret that that is' the view which' yon have taken of the way in which the proceedings of this House should be conducted. I trust that you will reconsider what you have just said concerning your intention to administer the standing orders in the manner in which you administered them during the last Parliament. I do not say that in any personal sense. I congratulate you upon having the been chosen to occupy the distinguished of position to which you have been » Comelected and I am sure that honor1 will pay to the Chair the respect to which a it is entitled. I can only hope that in return we shall receive completely unbiased treatment in the conduct of the proceedings of this House.",17
