1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 3 p.m., - and read prayers. PRIVILEGE. NA",19
2,Mr FENTON,CJIAEGES AGAINST PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Maribyrnong) [3.1]' I rise to a question of privilege. wish to refer to statements made in this House in Friday last by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), which reflect on the Chairman and members of the Public Accounts Committee. Dr Maloney, speaking about half-past 4 p.m - on Friday, referred to the recommendation of the Committee in reference to a timber option on Vanikoro Island, which was alleged to have been secured by a Mr. Caldwell. 'The (honourable member said I must say that I found the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee .prepared to throw every obstacle in the way of my obtaining information, even though the evidence to which reference is made was takenpublicly, and in the presence of representatives of the press. Three legal gentlemen desired to obtain certain parts of the evidence, and I , as member for Melbourne, made a request for it on their behalf, but because one of those three gentlemen is not a persona grata with the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, the request was refused.",19
3,Mr FOWLER,CJIAEGES AGAINST PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"I object to that statement. I was acting all through under the instructions of the Public Accounts Committee. I am instructed by - the Public Accounts Committee, of which body I am ViceChairman, to say, in reply to that statement, that in response to requests to be supplied with copies of the evidence for distribution, the honourable member for Melbourne was told, by direction of the Committee, that, as the Committee had notreported to Parliament on this particular matter 'at the time the requests were made, he could not be so supplied; but he was advised that there was no objection to his perusing the evidence at the Committee's-office. This offer, however, was not accepted. A copy of the evidence affecting Mr Caldwell was, however, forwarded to that witness as it was received from the printer. After the Committee had presented its report to Parliament the honourable member for Melbourne was supplied with copies of all .the evidence given in public in connection with this inquiry. 'The honourable member for Melbourne stated further, in regard to a letter written by Mr J. Woolf, that- Although this correspondence was official he (Mr Fowler) has* to say that there was nothing in the letters which he conCOMMITTEE. sidered worth placing on record. This official correspondence ought not to have been suppressed.* I * * # * * To that ithe Committee's reply is that tihe papers referred to were in no sense "" official"" documents, nor were they placed before 'the Ciommittee as evidence by Mr Caldwell. The papers consisted merely of copies of letters written to various persons by Mr Caldwell, who had plenty of opportunity, if he so desired, of producing these letters to the Committee whilst under examination, and of having them incorporated in his evidence. There was no suppression of any documents, nor were any facts concealed'. Mr Caldwell was given every opportunity to state his case in his own way. The correspondence referred' to was subsequently obtained from the honourable member for Corio. Referring to a statement by the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee about Senator E. D. Millen, the honourable member for Melbourne saidHe (Mr Fowler) states "" that the action of the honourable ge'ntlcman (Senator >E. .D. Millen) was correct and honourable in every regard."" This is an* opinion, although stated as a fact, not 'founded on any evidence or any statements made on oath by the individual concerned.* * # # * # He (Mr Fowler) states "" that if he (the Minister) erred at all, it was, in his opinion, in showing undue consideration to the, person * Passages offensive to an honourable member deleted by direction of Mr Speaker. who tried to inveigle the War Service Home3 Commissioner into a transaction in regard to property over which the would be vendor has acquired no rights whatever.* # # * # To that the Committee's reply is that the statement was made by the Chairman by direction of the Committee, and is shown in Hansard, page 13206.* The honourable member for Melbourne said of. a letter that had been writtenI consider that the letter is quite pertinent to this 'debate on the operations of the War Service Homes (Commission. It refers to the case of a man who has been deeply wronged by what I consider a conspiracy, and in connection with whose case iperjury has been committed, and the honourable member for Perth was in the chair when the perjury was committed. To that I am instructed by the Committee to reply 4/hat it has been repeatedly alleged that perjury has been committed by Lieut - Colonel Walker while under examination by the Committee. But the Solicitor-General, to whom the matter wa3 referred by the Committee, is of an entirely different opinion. He states thatThere is, however, in my opinion, nothing in the report to show that the statement was made with the knowledge that it was incorrect. Unless such knowledge can the shown there is no ground for a prosecution for perjury on proceedings under section G of the Committee of Public Accounts Act 1913. The honourable member for Melbourne said furtherI will prove the above facts and conclusions before a High Court Judge,* * #* * * To that the Committee reply that throughout the proceedings of the Committee the Chairman acts as its mouthpiece, and, although the reports bear only the signature of the Chairman, the Committee as a whole takes the responsibility for them.",19
4,Dr MALONEY,CJIAEGES AGAINST PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Melbourne) [3.9] The quotations made by the 'honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) from a speech which I delivered on. Friday are, no doubt, correct, but a letter which I read is not privileged, its state- Passages offensive to an honourable member deleted by direction of Mr Speaker. ments are those of the writer, and the J writer of that letter challenges Parliament, the Government, or any citizen to disprove his statements. I believe that per* jury was committed. I read from a previous examination, and I have to thank, as .the public has to thank, Senator John D. Millen, .of Tasmania, for proving that the man concerned told. untruths. I do not wish to follow that man further, because if it is true, as has been stated here through the lips of the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford), that he had been offered a bribe of £50,000, I will help him so far as I can to discover who the bribers are, and it is the duty of the Government to take the matter up. If a bribe tas been offered we should punish those who offered it. I have attacked Lieut - Colonel Walker, but there are mitigating circumstances, and I prefer to believe the word of Mr Gilbert, formerly Comptroller of the Repatriation Department, who supported the statement by Lieut - Colonel Walker, rather than of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Mullen). The charges I have mentioned (have been repeated .by Mr Ashworth, but they are still unanswered. The public press reeks with this matter. I still maintain that the Public Accounts Committee had no right to suppress letters from Mr Caldwell. Does any honourable member think that if letters were tendered as 'evidence to the Supreme Courl the Judge would be content with the opinion of the Clerk of Courts as to their admissibility. Although many members of the Public Accounts Committee are my personal friends, I do not know # that any one of them is acquainted with the law of evidence. I have made personal inquiries in the Islands where the timber lands in question are situated, and I did not discover .one Government officer or private individual who, knowing Mr Caldwell, did not speak well of him and considered him an ill-used man. Whether he be right or wrong, the fact remains that he asked for an inquiry, not by the Public Accounts Committee, but by a Royal Commission presided over by a Judge.",20
5,Mr CHARLTON,CJIAEGES AGAINST PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"If he has. a claim for . £50,000, why does he not take his case into the Court and prove it ?",20
6,Dr MALONEY,CJIAEGES AGAINST PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,A man of limited means cannot afford to go to the Law Courts.,21
7,Mr CHARLTON,CJIAEGES AGAINST PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,A few of those behind this man are not of limited means.,21
8,Mr RODGERS,CJIAEGES AGAINST PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,The evidence of High Commissioner for the Pacific proves that Caldwell had not a tittle of claim to those lands.,21
9,Dr MALONEY,CJIAEGES AGAINST PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Two, three, and perhaps four times Mr Caldwell's signature to a letter was sworn to before the Public Accounts Committee. But the witness when challenged by Senator John D. Millen, of Tasmania, admitted that the letter had not been signed by Mr Caldwell. The signature must have been a forgery. A witness swore in evidence that the letter was signed in the presence of three individuals, one of whom Mr Caldwell has never seen. I ask the Government if that document which was proved to be false has since been supplied to the officer representing the High Commissioner for the Pacific?",21
10,Mr SPEAKER,CJIAEGES AGAINST PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,I ask the honourable member .to confine his remarks to a personal explanation.,21
11,Mr RODGERS,CJIAEGES AGAINST PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Eve n if all the statements the honourable member is making are correct, Caldwell still had no claim to those Pacific lands, for Fairley, Rigby, and Company had a prior claim.",21
12,Dr MALONEY,CJIAEGES AGAINST PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Of course, the Law Courts iare still open to Mr Caldwell, but, after my experience of the High Court, I would not advise any man of limited means to go before it. In behalf of a man whom I consider has been deeply wronged, I demand the appointment of a Royal Commission presided over by a High Court Judge to inquire into this matter. If that is done we shall have none of those "" fiddling"" methods by which the chairman consults his secretary, and the latter says that the language in a letter tendered as evidence does not please him. I withdraw nothing of what I have said. I believe that the letter quoted contains the absolute truth, and from my place I , as the representative of the city of Melbourne, demand the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry presided over by a High Court Judge to decide who is right and who is wrong. ' Mr BAMFORD (Herbert) [3.16] - As the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) has mentioned my name in connection with this matter, I desire to make a brief personal explanation. I mentioned in the House that Lieut - Colonel Walker had said that he had been offered a bribe of £5 per cottage if he would let the a contract for 10,000 cottages to a certain person. But that has nothing whatever to do with '.the Caldwell case. In reply to something said by the honourable member for Melbourne, I did say, in this House, 'that Caldwell had tried to sell the Commonwealth something that he never possessed, in other words, a gold brick.",21

That, as it takes eight weeks for the tralian mails to reach Germany, German tionals resident in Australia, whose property is or has been expropriated after the 12th of November, will bo too late in lodging claims for compensation? 3. Will the Prime Minister state whether year. it is intended to make any further expropriaan tion of the property of German nationals dent in Australia, and the date on which the last expropriation was made?",22
22,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXPROPRIATED GERMAN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Nothing is known regarding this matter, and so far there is no record of any time limit having been fixed by the German Government for the lodging of such claims. 2. See answer to No. 1. 3. The action provided for by the Treaty of Versailles between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany is ""retention and liquidation."" So far, no properties of German nationals resident in Australia have been retained and liquidated, but several cases are now under consideration. PUBLIC SERVICE. OVERTIME - EXTRAWORKING HOURS. ' Mr MACKAY (for Mr CAMERON) the - asked the Treasurer, upon noticeWill he inform* the House whether it is a fact that if the public servants of the Commonwealth worked an extra half-hour per day there would be a saving in overtime of £340,000? - Mr GROOM - There would be no At present about 18,000 of the Public Service work at least eight hours a day. The extension of Fedehalf-an-hour per day would, therefore, the apply to only about 5,000 officers. In Minmany of the offices in which the 5,000 the public servants are employed, the suga gested extension of the hours would have adminno appreciable effect, either upon overtime or upon temporary assistance. In offices, overtime is seldom resorted to, and temporary assistance little availed of, but wjhere the circumstances necessitate overtime or temporary assistance, the extension of attendance to 5 o'clock would not often obviate it. In the very large branches of the Public 'Service, such as the Taxation Office, where there are about 2,000 employees, some saving might to inbe expected as a result of extending the at Amordinary hours of duty. The saving in naall She Departments would, however, be slight- a small fraction of the £340,000. Even 3 per cent, of that Aus- £340,000 would be an optimistic estimate. naI t is presumed that the sum mentioned (£340,000) is arrived at by working out their the payment at 2s. per hour to 23,000 officers for half-an-hour per day for a It seems to be supposed that, in office in which six officers are emresiployed, the effect of making the six officers work three hours extra per week would be to save 36s., i.e., eighteen hours at 2s. an hour. In practice, however, no saving at all would be effected. business would be such as could be coped with by the officers in the present hours of duty without any overtime or temporary assistance. The extra time worked in such a case would not enable any man's services to be dispensed with, and the effect in many cases would be - merely that the staff would spread, over the longer hours, work that could be done in the present working time. DISMISSAL OF LIFT ATTENDANT.",22
23,Mr SPEAKER,EXPROPRIATED GERMAN,"Wit h reference to questions whidh the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked me ,on 1st December, concerning the dismissal of lift attendant Robert Dcnholm, as I have already intimated, the lift attendant is not on the House of Representatives staff, but on that of the joint Houses, of which the President of the Senate is Chairman. The trouble concerning Robert Denholm occurred during the period of my recent illness, and in my absence the Deputy Speaker (Mr Chanter), in response to references by the honourable member for Melbourne and other honourable members, made statements to the House which will be found on reference to pages 9633 and 963S of Hansard of this session. The Deputy Speaker (the Hon. J. M . Chanter), in his statement on the 1st July, quoted from a report he had obtained from the President of the Senate (the Hon. Thos. Givens), in which it was stated thatDenholm has not been ""dismissed""-hi s services as a temporary employee were terminated in accordance with the requirements of the Public Service Act, to which the pointed attention of the Head of the Joint House Department was called by the Auditor-General. The termination vices was made by the head of the Department, under the authority conferred upon him by the Puhlic Service Act. On 13th July the Auditor-General gave evidence before the Senate Select Committee, in which he questioned the accuracy of certain statements contained in the report concerning his own action as bearing upon the employment of Robert - I moveDenholm. The matter is fully dealt with public in the final report of the Senate Select Committee (No. S.I.F. 181S9) ordered to be printed on 31st August last, to which The I refer the honourable member for more detailed information.

24,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs [3.26] -(B y leave.) That, having regard to the fact, that the welfare demands the early enactment of the Tariff, and pending the adoption of Joint Standing Orders, this House refrains from the determination of its constitutional rights or obligations in respect of Message No. 97 received from the Senate, in reference to the Customs-Tariff Bill 1921, and resolves to consider it forthwith.",23
25,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,This will be the third time that we have shelved this constitutional question.,24
26,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I appreciate the courtesy of the House in granting me leave to submit this motion. Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) has remarked, by way of inter-, jection, if the motion be agreed to, this will be by no means the first occasion that the House has refrained from asserting whatever may be its constitutional rights or obligations in regard to a matter of this kind, but has endeavoured to put aside the question for consideration at a more opportune time. When possibly arrangements have been made for joint standing orders, the House will be able to consider this very important issue, which you, Mr Speaker, have-raised in connection with the Senate's message.",24
27,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The joint standing orders cannot alter the effect of the Constitution in so far as this matter is concerned.,24
28,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"No . But they can pave the way, should the occasion arise, for the proper deliberation of these issues by the two Houses. I do not propose this afternoon to discuss the constitutional question raised under section 53 of the Constitution. That has been done at length on two or three occasions, in this Chamber. The only point I desire at the moment to bring before honourable members is the absolute necessity for finalizing the Tariff.",24
29,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Can we hope to finalize it if the Senate persists in pressing its requests?,24
30,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"That I admit is a difficulty. We may reach a point at which we cannot compromise any further. Should that position arise later on, the House will have to determine it. I do not think, however, that honourable members will have any doubt as to the desirableness of finalizing the Tariff at the first possible moment. The bvisiness community want to know where they are.",24
31,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Does the honourable member think it should be finalized in the way desired by another place or as desired by this branch of the Legislature? Mr MASSYGREENEi-As far as possible the will of this House should prevail in such matters. Honourable members know perfectly well that the Constitution has provided for the Senate making requests, but that it is more or less ambiguous as to whether the Senate may press a request over and over again or merely make a As the request. Those are questions which I do net propose to argue this afternoon. I intend to confine my remarks to the motion, which is, in substance, that, in view of the necessity for finalizing the Tariff this House, for the time being, will determine to put on one side t i e question of its constitutional rights and obligations, for final determination at some more convenient period, aud will proceed to consider the requests of the Senate for the second time. I emphasize that the like procedure has been adopted on two previous occasions.",24
32,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,But each time it was distinctly stated that that course was not to constitute a precedent.,24
33,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I do not propose to establish a precedent now. I am simply setting out the issue before honourable members; which is-, that in view of the early termination of the session, it is essential to finalize the Tariff at the earliest possible moment. That being the objective, it becomes desirable that, a f this moment, we should prevent a constitutional issue from arising between this House and another place. The first of the two occasions on which a' similar situation developed was on the 3rd September, 1902. The Senate returned to the House of Representatives the first Tariff Bill with a message announcing that, in relation to certain of its requests, the Senate again requested the House of Representatives to make the amendments as originally requested by the Senate; and, as regards certain other requests, the message stated that the Senate had made modifications and requested the House of Representatives to make the amendments as modified. The then honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mauger) asked the Speaker's ruling concerning whether the message was in order and could be received by the House. The Speaker, after observing that the words of section 53 of the Constitution were open to at least two interpretations, declined to give a definite ruling which would fetter the House. On the motion of the then Attorney-General (Mr Deakin) a resolution, similar to the motion which I have presented, was agreed to. There have been two or three other occasions on which a somewhat similar issue has been raised. With all but one of those, however, I shall not now deal. On 21st May, 1908, a message was received from the Senate in respect of a Customs Tariff Bill in which, inter alia, it was stated, "" The Senate has resolved to further press certain requests;"" and that Chamber again requested the House of Representatives to make the-amendments at issue. Again, the Speaker was asked to give a definite ruling, which, however, he declined to do. He referred to the course which had been adopted in 1902, and said that it was for the House to decide whether that course should be followed. Consideration of the message was made an Order of the Day for the 26th May. Upon that date, the House resolved, on the motion of the then Attorney General, thatHaving regard to the fact that the public welfare demands the early enactment of the Tariff, and pending the adoption of joint ing Orders, this House refrains from mination of its constitutional rights or obligations in respect of the message received from the Senate, and resolves to consider it forthwith.",24
34,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,But on the present occasion Mr Speaker has given a ruling.,25
35,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"You , Mr Speaker, have not definitely ruled that the Senate cannot take the course under discussion. You suggested, sir, that it was a matter for the consideration of this House whether the Senate could press its requests after the manner which it is seeking to do. I took it, however, that you did not definitely rule that the Senate had no power to press its requests in such a manner; but that, inasmuch as you recognised that there was, in the Senate's message, a constitutional issue between the two Houses, instead of stating the question from the Chair in the ordinary way, namely, that the consideration of the Senate's message be made an Order of the Day for the following day, you left a motion to that effect ito be moved deliberately from the floor of the House.",25
36,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Mr Speaker said I am of the opinion that the Senate, in pressing certain requests for amendments in the Customs Tariff, has exceeded the righto conferred on the Senate by section '53 of the Constitution.",25
37,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Yes, but I understood, Mr Speaker, that you did not definitely rule that the House could not receive the message. - Mr Watt - Mr Speaker did more than raise the question; he gave a definite opinion.",25
38,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Yes , but that is different from giving a deliberate ruling.",25
39,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Of course. . Mr MASSYGREENE - And the action which Mr Speaker suggested that the House should take, namely, that it should be for the Minister in charge to move from the floor of the House that the consideration of the Senate's requests be made an Order of the Day for a certain day was advised with the deliberate intention of giving this House an opportunity to discuss the matter in a way which, otherwise, it could not do. I moved thereforeThat the consideration in Committee of the Senate's message be made an Order of the Day for tomorrow. Thus, it became a substantive motion on Standthe business-paper, as honourable members the deter- now see it before them. I am taking this line of action simply because I feel that if , at this stage, a constitutional conflict is raised-and it would be 'a fairly bitter' one between the two Houses - the probabilities are that the Tariff would not be finished before the House had adjourned over the Christmas holidays. And, in that event, honourable members would be required to return next year to settle the matter.",25
40,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Is that a threat?,25
41,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"No ; I am simply suggesting what would be the possible-or , indeed, the probable-consequence s if this House were to decide .that the Senate had no right to press its requests after Hhe manner which it is seeking to do. I am not asking the House to decide that the Senate has the right to press its requests over and over again. I desire honourable members to put that issue on one side, for the time being, and to agree to consider the requests for the second time. What may be the result of such consideration, in relation to the discussion of the items themselves, it is impossible for me to forecast. In Committee, honourable members may be able'to find some means of effecting a compromise. On the other hand, it may be found necessary to press each one of the individual messages upon which the issue has been raised. most important that the commercial community should know exactly where it stands. Duties are being collected itoday under four separate Tariffs. many respects, where relief has been afforded by the present Tariff, it is i m possible, owing to the operation of tihe law, to grant that relief. May I be permitted to cite one special instance? In the course of the 'Tariff debate it has been agreed that timber for box-making shall be permitted to enter Australia at a reduced rate of duty. Under the old T a r i ff that same timber is subject to a high rate of duty, and my Department cannot give the relief afforded by the lower rates in respect of that material. The Customs officials are bound to collect upon the highest rate ruling under all four of the Tariffs u n t i l the present Bill shall have become law. only one of the disabilities suffered by the commercial community. Of course, it is possible for another place to finally throw out the Customs Tariff Bill .",25
42,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,That is not likely to happen.,26
43,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"It is hardly likely the Senate will take that drastic course, but nevertheless under the Constitution it has the righ t to do it . 1",26
44,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"And that is the only right it has.""",26
45,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I am not going to be drawn into expressing an opinion as to whether the Senate has or has not the right to press its requests to a Tariff Bill. I have read many of the opinions expressed by gentlemen far better versed in constitutional law than I claim to be, and find that the very highest legal authorities hold both views on this particular point with equal certainty, so that in the circumstances I am sure that honourable members will not expect me to express a very definite opinion upon the matter.",26
46,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,If c is wonderful these legal authorities change their views according to the House in which they are sitting.,26
47,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I have not noticed that to the extent the honourable member suggests, but I have noticed that high legal authorities who have occupied seats in this House have taken one view, and that high legal authorities in the Senate It is have taken an opposite view.",26
48,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,What do the Crown Law officers say ?,26
49,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I fchink that they have In declined to express a, definite opinion one way or another, so that one does not expect much help from that source. I hope that this House will agree to follow the course I have suggested. Ifc is not an ideal one, bufc in the circumstances in which we find ourselves afc the present moment it is the best way out of the difficulty, and with all due respect fco Mr Speaker, I feel that, if afc this period we attempted to determine the constitutional issue which has been in abeyance for a number of years, the probabilities are that our action would have results which none of us desire. I submit the motion which I have already read. That is Mr MATHEWS - I rise to a point of order. We considered the Tariff in this House and senfc it to another place, which has returned it to us with certain requests, to some of which we have agreed, and to others of which we have not agreed. The matter having gone so far, is it in order for us now to do whafc the Minister for Trade and Customs desires ?",26
50,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE," The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), in submitting his motion, is acting in accordance with a practice already established . in this House. The last occasionon which the matter was dealt with was on the 21st May, 1908. Sir John Forrest had raised a point of order, "" that the Senate had not power to return any proposed law a second time with requests for tame,ndments,"" and Mr Speaker said I am not prepared to give a ruling on the question, but on being asked so. to do, I ought to give the House such information as I am possessed of. In-the first place, it is impossible to* look elsewhere for precedents, because I know of no other Constitution which so distributes the financial power as does ours between the respective Houses. Wlc must, therehow fore, be guided wholly by our own Constitution, and by the practice which we have set up. Precisely the same point arose on the consideration pf the first Tariff, and it was agreed Customs Twiff by the then House that, whether or message which was sent, as this message been sent, from another place to us should be received, was entirely a matter to be mined by the House itself. There was not then, there are not now, any joint standing orders dealing with the matter, so that this question is again called on on the for which, to-night, it may be set down, it will be for the House either to proceed with consideration of the message, or to deal it as it may think fit, or to refuse to it, precisely as the House at that moment pleases. I may remind the House that, on the last occasion, it was decided to take the into consideration, but the following resolution was adopted: "" That having regard to the fact that public welfare demands the early enactment of a Federal Tariff, and adoption of joint standing orders, this House refrains from the determination its constitutional - rights or obligations in respect to this message, and resolves to receive and consider - it forthwith."" That is the course that was followed on occasion, and that may, or may not, lowed on this occasion, as the House, the Government, decides. The Minister is proceeding on exactly-the same lines.as were followed in 1908.",26
51,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,On a precedent which should never have been established.,27
52,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"As to that, I offer no opinion; but it is to be regretted that the point has not been definitely settled. It cannot, I think, be settled by the Speaker's ruling, which has no binding effect upon proceedings in another place. There is, I think, no doubt as to the right of the House of Representatives to control taxation; but how such control can be co-existent with the right of the Senate to virtually insist on the acceptance of its requests, by persistence in pressing them after this House has refused to accede to them, it is difficult to see. It is true that the Senate has no right to amend-and while a request, in itself, is not an amendment, the pressing of requests already refused is an indirect form of attempted amendment, and in certain circumstances might approximate to attempted coercion of this House, as in cases where urgency would not admit of the delay in reaching a final decision. The whole matter hinges on the interpretation of sub-section 4 of section 53 of the Constitution. ' It will be a matter for the House itself to determine, either now or at some future time, what attitude it is going to take to protect 1 its undoubted right of control in matters of finance and taxation. [5 DECEMBER, 1921.] Bill. 13677 not the , Mr Charlton (Hunter) [3.47] - 1 has agree with the Minister for Trade and deterCustoms (Mr Greene) that we should reach finality with the Tariff, but at the same time. I do not think we are justified when in accepting the position as he has placed day it before the House. This is. the third the occasion on which we have been faced with with the same issue, and it seems to me consider that, notwithstanding the language in which the motion has been couched for message the purpose of preserving the rights of this Chamber, the fact remains that by permitting this to be done every 'time1 the the same trouble crops up we are on each occapending the sion setting up a precedent.",27
53,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The trouble has always of occurred on the same point.,27
54,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"That - is so, and why do we not decide it once >and for that all? This difficulty-cropped up in 1902, be foland again in 190S, and on each occasled by sion a similarly worded motion was carried, attention being at the same time drawn to the necessity for joint standing orders to deal with such an emergency. We have not yet had those standing orders framed.",27
55,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Why do not the Joint Standing Orders Committee frame them?,27
56,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr MCDonald) assures me that the Joint Standing Orders Committee have not the power to do so. - If that is the case, we. have all the more reason for deciding the matter for ourselves, in order to put this House in its proper position in relation to the Senate in regard to such matters. The Minister suggests that he wants to get finality in Tegard to the Tariff. We all do. But how can we get that finality if we permit this game of see-saw to continue? We decided upon a Tariff schedule and sent it to the Senate. The Senate sent us back a message asking us to consider certain requests. We did so, and we returned the schedule to the Senate with a courteous message telling them that we had considered their requests, and taken certain action in regard to them. Then they took it upon themselves to send the schedule back to us again for further consideration. Surely those who framed the Constitution never intended this?",27
57,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Yes , they did.",27
58,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I am doubtful about it . My interpretation of the section of the Constitution Act dealing with this matter evidently differs from that of - the honourable member for Franklin .,28
59,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I do not think framers of. the Constitution did intend it .,28
60,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"N e i the r do I . If that was the intention, how can we hope to reach finality?",28
61,Mr GEEENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The great difficulty is to interpret the words "" at any stage.""",28
62,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The matter ought to be settled now; and if any action we take does result in a double dissolution, let it come. Section 53 of the Constitution providesThe Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws approviewspriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government. The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge burden on the people. The Senate may, at any stage, return to House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications. . - - As a layman, my interpretation of that section is that we shall send the Bill this case a T a r if f Bill - to the Senate, ceive and consider any requested amend-, ing the Bill . ments that Chamber may send down, and then return the measure with a message that we cannot comply with certain of those requests and have complied others. In the present instance, as previously, the Senate has taken it upon itself to send the requests back to this House for reconsideration. that if such action were contemplated by this section, we could never have finality.",28
63,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"It gives the Senate ""power of rejection without responsibility.",28
64,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"That is so. We ister have to remember that the Senate is difefficiency ferently composed from the House of ReI presentatives. We represent the constiferences tuencies, whereas the Senate represents States. There is equal representation i the Senate, which means that the small that States have as much power as have the large States, so that it is possible for the representatives of a minority of the people to hold up the business of this Chamber for as long as they choose.",28
65,Sir ROBEET BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,That is not involved now; it is a mere question of the interpretation of the Constitution. the,28
66,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"E x a c t l y ; but under such an interpretation as is now suggested, the Senate has equal power with the House of Representatives.",28
67,Sir ROBEET BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Exactly ; the Constitution gives that power.,28
68,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"My interpretation of the section is that the Senate has not equal power with us. In 1908, when.this question was before the House, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr . MCDonald) spoke, and I find that what he then said is in accord with m y own That is a very different matter from that with which we are dealing today. I hold that the Senate had a perfect right to make certain or suggestions for the amendment of the Tariff as passed by this House, but this House havthe ing considered those suggestions, and having accepted some, and refused to accept others, the powers of the Senate in the matter are exhausted, and it cannot suggest further amendments, but should take the responsibility of accepting or rejecting the Customs Tariff Bill as sent from this House, after its suggestions had been considered. That is the position of the Senate, and if - in honourable senators are not satisfied they reought to take the responsibility of reject",28
69,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Did the Senate ask for a ruling of the High Court?,28
70,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,No ; the High with Court cannot touch the matter.,28
71,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"As it is, the Senate, and not this House, has the final say.",28
72,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Yes . The then It is plain member for Flinders (Sir Will i a m I r v in e ) , now Chief Justice of Victoria, said- Whatever may be the views taken by honourable members in regard to the constitutional question at issue, the motion of the Prime Minis not calculated to add to the dignity or of the House, or to settle the point. t rather leaves it open, inviting further difwhich may be of more serious consequence than that now existing. But there is another aspect of the matter which has not yet n been put before the House. It seems to me in this, and in all similar cases, in which a message comes from another place which it is doubtful that the Senate has the constitu- > tional right to send, there is thrown upon vou, Mr Speaker, the responsibility of determining whether it is properly before us. Your position as Speaker is not defined in the Constitution, but it is referred to. It carries with it the whole authority and power of the position of Speaker of the House of Commons, with this difference': that the House of Commons is part of a unified Farliament, in connection with which there cannot occur such difficulties as arise under, a written Constitution denning the respective rights of the two Houses of a Legislature. It will be seen that Sir ""William Irvine was of opinion that it is a matter for the Speaker himself.",28
73,Mr G,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,KOOM - Si r Will i am Irvin e refrained from expressing an opinion on the merits of the question.,29
74,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"He said, further onYou, sir, as Speaker, are the only authority that can determine it, and this House can only affect your determination by disagreeing with your ruling if it should desire to do so. l fore ask you to determine whether this is a message that can be sent down from the Senate under section 53 of the Constitution? There is a difference of opinion on the point, but I think that most honourable members consider, with me, that the matter is one for the House to determine. We cannot procrastinate any longer. If the question is not settled now ib will only crop up, probably in another form, when, if we be near the end of' the session, we shall have a proposal similar to that now before us. If we continue to pass such motions our attitude towards the Senate will become a precedent, in spite of all that may be said. There is not the slightest doubt thab we ought to stand by our fights, and insist on the Senate accepting our decision. As I have safd more than once, if the Senate stands on its dignity, and insists on returning these rejected requests to us again, we can hope for no finality.",29
75,Mr HIGGS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Finalit y wil l come with a double dissolution.,29
76,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"That is the only solution, and, though a double dissolution may take some time to accomplish, I see no good in pursuing the course now proposed by the Government. The Minister informs us that he is now collecting under four Tariffs, and that, in consequence, injustice is being done importers. That, however, cannot be helped if the Senate continues "" stand to its guns."" If the Senate does maintain that attitude we shall rise for the Christmas recess with the Tariff still in suspense. We ought to show that we' are prepared to meet the position that has arisen. I submit that we have been very fair and reasonable with the Senate, and treated it with every courtesy. The requests they sent down received full consideration.",29
77,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Especiall y those for increases of duties!,29
78,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"At any rate, the requests were given fair consideration, and bhat ought to close the matter. We are not justified as a Parliament in continuing to pass such motions as that now submitted. .",29
79,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Balaclava) [3.58] - Hon orable members, generally, will agree with the Minister (Mr Greene) in his statement as to the urgency of the there- Tariff j and if that were the only issue, the honourable gentleman would probably find a unanimous House.",29
80,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The same reason has been given each time.,29
81,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Thaf c is so. On this occasion the Tariff has dragged a long and wearisome course through both Houses. It is, I think, of the utmost importance that those who are affected by its incidence should know how and when they will be permitted to trade and manufacture under its provisions. The Minister - has stated the issue quite plainly in that respect, and there is a general desire on the part of the mercantile and manufacturing community to geb finality in regard to the provisions and figures,of the Tariff. But that is nob the only issue, as the Minister implied rather than said. This is the third major occasion on which the issue has arisen between the two Houses, and the more we refrain from putting a stop to this procedure the more we assent taci t l y to the assertions of another place. The Minister read the resolution passed in 1902 by this House, when it decided, on the grounds of public welfare, not. to settle the issue with ithe Senate. I remind the honourable gentleman, however, and - also the Attorney-General (Mr Groom), who is by his side, what the answer of the Senate was on that occasion. This to some House resolved;That, having regard to the fact that the to public welfare demands the early enactment of a Federal Tariff, and, pending the adoption of joint Standing Orders, this House refrains from the determination of its constitutional rights or obligations in respect to this message, and resolves to consider it forthwith. v The answer of the Senate to that message was a challenge of the most emphatic and proclamatory kind which could possibly issue from that House. This is what the Senate said by resolutionThat the action of the House of Representatives in receiving and dealing with the reiterated requests of the Senate 'is in compliance with the undoubted constitutional position and rights of the Senate. The Senate did not accept courteously the attitude of no fight which the House of Representatives put up then andagain in 1908. But in accepting the resolution, of the House of Representatives, the Senate said, "" We have insisted on our undoubted constitutional rights.'' - That was in 1902.",29
82,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The Senate adopted the same course in 1908.,30
83,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I do not think we can decide the motion of postponement proposed by the Minister for Trade and Customs without considering something of the elements' and principles of the dis-1 pute itself. It appears to me that there is no power but the two Houses respectively that can settle this matter as the Constitution at present stands. It would be wrong to put so grave a responsibility either upon the President of another place or the Speaker of this House. A decision, so far as a decision is possible, can only be arrived at by a majority vote of the respective Houses. I believe that we cannot with propriety refer this issue to any other tribunal. The Constitution is widely open. This is the first provision of its kind that ever was framed, within my reading. It is ambiguous, and susceptible of many meanings. The High Court could not decide this issue, because neither this nor any other House would surrender the interpreta>tion of its powers and privileges to a body of jurists created for another purpose. Without traversing full y the merits and history of the question. I might ask honourable members to consider the position for a moment. Before the Commonwealth Constitution was framed, every Upper House within the 'British Empire, and I think it is quite safe to say in any other country adopting parliamentary government of owe kind, was limited with respect to certain Bills. It s powers 1 over finance were not co-equal with those of the lower, or the popular, branch of the Legislature.",30
84,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"That is to say, in connection with money Bills.",30
85,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I speak, of finance. There are various interpretations of that, as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Foley) knows. When the Commonwealth Constitution was framed two reasons apparently impelled the Convention, the Parliaments, and the people to accept the new method for the treatment of finance Bills. The two reasons were, first, that the Senate in the Federation represented the second entity in the Union. The House of Representatives represented the Federation of peoples, and the Senate the Federation of States. It was clear, therefore, that if the States were to exercise any real in fluence in connection with important matters of government and legislation, the Senate must be given some concession in advance of previous practice. Then for the first time in the history of British peoples that I can recall, the franchise of both Houses of the Federal Legislature was the same, and, owing to the broad, Democratic basis on which the Senate was elected, ib was fel t that it ought to be intrusted with some larger discretionary powers in money matters. The Convention invented, or tried to invent,"" a provision midway between no power and equal or full power, and said to the Senate, "" Y o u may accept or reject a money Bill . You may not amend it , but you may request its amendment,'' and there it stopped.",30
86,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I thin k that the Convention followed the South Australian practice in that.,30
87,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I ami not aware that our constitutional provision is exactly the same as the South Australian provision.,30
88,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The only difference is that in South Australia it is called the power of suggestion.,30
89,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I think the power to suggest is not quite the same as the power to request. The honourable member may be inclined to view the question from the point of view of the Senate, as, unfortunately, for him , he committed himself to the Senate's views, as a leader in another place when this question arose on a previous occasion.",30
90,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"What meaning does the right honourable gentleman attach to the words "" a n y stage""?",31
91,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Can the Senate request the same amendments twice 1 That is the real issue.,31
92,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I do not know what was in the minds of the framers of the Constitution regarding what a stage of a Bill is. Many constitutional authorities hold that there are only three stages of any Bill-that is to say, there are three major stages, the second reading, the Committee stage, and the third reading.",31
93,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,There is the first reading.,31
94,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"AH the rest are formal and technical stages There is a motion to introduce a Bill , a motion for the firsb reading, and other practically formal motions, . and these are perfunctory and elementary stages. The really deliberative stages commence when the second reading is attempted, are pursued in detail in the Committee stage, and finally disposed of on the thir d reading. It may be held that the report stage is a stage of a Bill . But whebher there are three or five stages of a Bill-and different schools of thought would decide that point differently-ther e axe certain clear stages of a Bill , and if suggestions or requests may be made by another place afc any Btage of a Bill , there is still a l i m it to the number of stages.",31
95,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"In fihe Convention a motion was submitted to strike out the words "" any stage,"" and insert the word "" once.""",31
96,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"In 1903, a f t - r the nrsfc collision had occurred befcwet_ the Senate and the House of Representatives, a Constitution was framed in this State of Victoria. It adopted practically the principle of the power of request for the Upper House; but in order to make sure that the confusion or ambiguity, obvious in the Federal Constitution, would notoccur in the State Constitution, the number of times upon which requests might be made by the Upper House of the Victorian Legislature to the Lower House, was limited. We are not in a position to make that provision here. At some stage or another, possibly by deliberation of the Standing Orders Committee of the two Houses, a modus vivendi for the settlement of fchis issue will have to be found. The only alternative to that is to deliberately suggest an amendment of the Constitution more specific in its in terpretation of this section, and put it to the people for their acceptance or rejection.",31
97,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,It is the ambiguity of the section that gives rise to the trouble.,31
98,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Quite so. But does the Minister's proposal satisfy the House at the present time? Every time we postpone the settlement of the question we decline the challenge of the Senate. Every time the Senate receives the kind of message proposed, its determination becomes harder. If , every time the difficulty arises, the same precedent is laid down, they may contend that there is no means of interpreting the section other than the practice between the two Houses, and, as MT . Speaker Holder very properly observed, the\ rights of this House become weaker and weaker. There can be no democratic system of government, whether unitary or federal, in my judgment, which permits the Upper House to exercise co-equal powers with the Lower House on two very i m portant matters, the first being finance, and the second the power over the Executive. Those who read constitutional history and endeavour to appreciate the importance of constitutional principles, must realise that for the safety of a democracy of any kind it is necessary to keep these two powers finally in the hands of the Lower House of Legislature. I say now that, unless the Minister for Trade and Customs accompanies his motion with a definite promise that the Government will , during the recess that is to rapidly supervene, produce for the consideration of Parliament next session some solution of this question as to either procedure or principle, the position in which this House will be left today will be worse than it has ever been.",31
99,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,That ought to meet the situation.,31
100,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"It will not satisfy every honourable member, but it will satisfy some of us.",31
101,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Shoul d not the question be referred to managers appointed by the two Houses?,31
102,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I was going to suggest that, quite apart from the merits of the particular Bill which gives rise to the question now, the Minister might promise to recommend a procedure for the consideration of this issue between the two Houses, either in the form of a conference of managers-frequentl y resorted to by State Legislatures-o r in some other way, which will insure a satisfactory ending of the dispute. I gathered the other day from the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), in reply to a question by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), that he does not regard this issue as important. do not know whether I took a wrong meaning from his somewhat cavalier answer to the question, but in my opinion carelessness about a matter involving basic principles of the Constitution may be fraught with danger to the Constitution and to the relations between the two Houses. He said/ in this House the other day, when asked whether an opportunity would be afforded to honourable members to debate the question, that he did not fchink anybody wanted to debate it . He said he could not see any burning desire in Parliament; or oufc of it to settle the question.",31
103,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I do not think the Prime Minister intended to convey that imprescannot sion.,32
104,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"If one reads, as I have, the report of the Prime Minister's rerights marks in Hansard, one feels disappointed fchafc the Leader of this House should that view, because the leader of the forces in the Senate, hearing that statement), would say, "" There is no fight in the Lower House."" This issue, and the confche stitutional provisions relating fco it, been the subject of innumerable trials tween the Upper and Lower Australian Houses of Parliament in both Colonial and Federal days. Every fcime, the Upper House was a nominee or. an elective House,fchevigilant Lower House has asserted its rights, in most smashing effect.",32
105,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The Privy Council has given a considered judgment in a case Queensland. It will be found in Keith's Responsible Government in the DominHouse ions, page 565.",32
106,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"In the State, of Victoria we have had innumerable trials of power between the Upper and the Lower Houses, and most statesmen, Governments, and the future. Parliaments of Victoria have been resolute in their assertion of the rights of people's Chamber.",32
107,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The South Australian Legislative Council went on strike for a fortnight on one occasion.,32
108,Mr WATT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I wish many of the Upper Houses would go on strike. An Upper House, by the way, has been ""struck"" in the northern part offchiscontinent. I ask the Minister to consider with his colleagues, before this motion is finalized, whether he cannot supplement it with a statement that the Government will bring I a proposal down in the next session of Parliament prescribing a procedure for the determination of this constitutional issue between' the two Houses. I would accept that as satisfactory in the present emergency, bufc unless some such action is taken every recurring attempt by the Senate to attack these powers will weaken this House, as we shall find fco our cost in the future.",32
109,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Dampier) [4.13] While I cannot vote for the motion suggested by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), I think that he has adopted by far the wisest course in the interests of those who support the Tariff. I cannot vote for the motion because I see any reason for "" shilly-shallying "" with the question. I 'think the Senate is quite within its constitutional in the action it has taken. Speaking as one who has opposed the high takeTariff passed by this House, I think it would be an extraordinary thing on the part of this House, afcfchislate period in the session, to refuse to recognise what Senate looks upon as its rights, and has upon which it insisted as far back as be1902. If the Senate uphold"" its privileges under the Constitution, the responsibility will belong to this House of having the whether Bill delayed or thrown out.",32
110,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Accordin g to the honourable member the Senate has established cases with a precedent already.,32
111,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I can quite understandfchafcfcheSenate has established a in precedent. It has been necessary in the past to save the face of members of the of Representatives, and the Minister is proposing to do the same again.",32
112,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The House is being asked to consider the Senate's message a second time without prejudice to its rights in,32
113,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I think that the at the titude of the Minister is most desirable, from the point of view of those who wish to see the Tariff enacted. If this House tells the Senate that it will not recognise its claim, and determines to fight it on the question of constitutional practice, the Senate, naturally, will demand rights and privileges that the Constitution gives it. It is not a question of what one itself. desires; it is a question of: What does the Constitution say, and what was in the minds of the framers of the Constitution when they prepared it for submission to the people of this country?",32
114,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,This House can accept the Senate's requests if it thinks fit.,33
115,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Yes , but absolute responsibility with regard to the Bill mains in the Senate. I can see no reason why this House cannot do as it has done before. Under the Constitution the Senate is given equal power with the House of Representatives in all proposed laws, subject to the specified exceptions enumerated in section 53 of tution. Under that section, the Senate is prohibited, inter alia, from amending should proposed laws imposing taxation, but is enabled at any stage to return to the request House of Representatives any such prosentatives posed law requesting by message the that omission or amendment of* any items or provisions therein. In the case under consideration, the Senate, by a message, its requested the House of Representatives to amend certain items in the Customs Tariff Bill. The House of Representalegal tives has not agreed to all the requested amendments, and the Senate has returned certain of its requests to the House of Representatives with a message that Senate ""has resolved to press"" for the said requested amendments. I think that the action is well within the province of the Senate under the Constitution. When this House considered the same question in 1902; it had valuable legal opinions before it by Mr (now Mr Justice) Isaacs, Sir John Quick, the Hon. P. Glynn, Mr (now Mr Justice) Higagree gins), and - the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes). While the opinions of these gentlemen may be of value in considering the matter, they are no more than indiamendment vidual opinions; they do not create a cedent, and must not be confused with a sentatives. judgment of the High Court. The matter is entirely one for the Senate arid the [545] House of Representatives to determine. In the case of trouble, the form for settling the dispute is to submit it to the electors by means of a double dissolution. the This is provided for by the framers of the Constitution in the Constitution - Mr MASSYGREENE - The honourable member does not suggest that the Tariff should be put through this House a second time?",33
116,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I am not asking for that; but if the Government were striving for a double dissolution on the question of the rights of the Senate, and if I thought the Senate would stand to its guns, I would assist the Government to contest the reSenate's powers, so that the fight could come on. I would do so with the greatest possible pleasure in the world. The late Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Samuel Griffith, whose opinions must be looked upon with respect, said, as reported on page 9 of the notes on the draft Pedethe Constiral Convention, 1897:Whether the mode in - which the Senate express its desire for an alteration in money Bills is by an amendment in which they the concurrence of the House of Repreas in other cases, or by a suggestion the desired amendments should be made by this latter House, as of its own motion, seems to be a matter of minor importance. A strong Senate will compel attention to its suggestions; a weak one would not insist upon amendments. As far as one can see, the substantial difference between the power of suggestion and the power of amendment is none other than as regards the actual responsibility of the two Houses in passing the or rejecting the measure as a whole. A simple example will make this clear. In case of a Bill which the Senate may amend, the Senate, equally with the House of Representatives, is responsible for the detail. It incorporates its amendment in the Bill, passes the Bill with an amendment, and returns it to the House of Representatives. If that House does not to the amendment, the Senate can "" insist on its amendment,"" and thus compel the House of Representatives to take the responsibility of accepting the or of sacrificing the Bill, beprecause the Bill is in the House of RepreThe House of Representatives cannot force the Senate to take a direct vote on the Bill in its original form. On the other hand, in the case of a Bill euch as the Customs Tariff Bill, which the Senate may not amend, hut only request amendments, the House of Representatives alone is responsible for the form of the measure. The Senate cannot strike out, alter, or add one word to it, but can only suggest that the House of Representatives should do so. If that House ultimately refuses .to make the suggested amendments, the Senate must either pass the Bill as it stands, reject it as it stands, or shelve it, because the Bill is in the Senate. A House which can make an amendment can insist on the amendment which it has made, but a House which can only request the other House to make amendments, and cannot insist on those amendments, is in a different position; if its request is not complied with, it has the power to reject the Bill or shelve it. The responsibility for sacrificing a Bill is on the House where the measure is at the time. In the case of an ordinary amendment made by the Senate, the Bill is returned with that amendment to the House of Representatives; but in ithe case of a requested amendment, the Bill remains in the Senate. This alone seems to be the important distinction between the right of amendment and the right of request. It would appear, therefore, that this provision in the Constitution is intended to declare nothing more than that: (1) the House of Representatives is solely responsible for the form of the money Bills to which the section relates; (2) that the Senate may request alterations in any money Bill ; and (3) that if such request is not complied with, the Bill, still being in the Senate, that House has to take the full responsibility for accepting, rejecting, or shelving it as it stands, except in so far as it can say its action is caused by the House of Representatives refusing - its request.",33
117,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Who said that?,34
118,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"This is my opinion. Having these powers, surely argued that the Senate must accept the rejection of its request by the House of Representatives, and has no right to press, and, if necessary, again press, before it decides whether or not it will reject the whole measure. It has been done over and over again. The Constiof tution seems to have contemplated very clearly any such situation. The rights of the House of Representatives do not prevail over .those of the Senate in the case of.amendments ""suggested"" by the Senate until after a joint appeal to the people. In order to test a principle, it is advisable sometimes to take an extreme case. Let us, therefore, assume that the Senate kept on repeating its suggestion, and the two Houses kept on playing at battledore and shuttlecock, what would the position be? The Constitution clearly meets the case. The Senate would not have ""passed .the Bill with amendments to which, the House of Representatives will not agree "" within the meaning of section 57; but it would "" fail to pass "" the B i ll within the meaning of that section. The House of Representatives would, af ter the statutory period of three months, even if the Senate was still repeating its request, again pass the proposed law, either with or without the Senate's "" suggested "" amendment. The section for the double dissolution, therefore, specifically recognises the "" suggested"" as well as the ""made"" class of Senate amendments. Af ter the double dissolution, the section again, in providing that the House of Representatives may again pass the proposed law, specifically recognises the Senate's ""suggested"" class of amendments, and provides that the House of Representatives may or may not include these in the Bill. If , however, the Senate still exercises its right of ""failing to pass"" :the Bill because the House of Representatives will not agree to its suggested amendments, then the Governor General may convene a joint sitting, in the convening of which the ""suggested"" class of amendments are again recognised by the Constitution.",34
119,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"But this issue could not be considered at a joint sitting. ' Mr GREGORY - If the Senate refused .to be coerced, and failed to pass a Bill, the House of Representatives could it cannot be pass the proposed law.",34
120,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,That is in reference to amendments to a Bill ; but in this case its request it is requested amendments.,34
121,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"When , however, the joint sitting is held, the ""suggested"" class amendments are for the first time not recognised. The joint sitting must vote only upon the proposed law as last proposed by the House of Representatives, and upon the "" amendments,"" but not "" suggested"" amendments, which are at this stage omitted for the first time. It is true that the word "" suggested "" occurs in this section, and the word ""request"" in section 53, but clearly it is intended to apply to the same class of amendment, for there are only two classes of amendments, namely, the actual amendment as in an ordinary proposed law, and in suggested or requested amendment of proposed money and taxation laws. As the Constitution recognises . the power of request in the double dissolution section, it is not possible to believe that it was ever intended that the Senate should, without even sending a request back a second time, reject a proposed law because the House of Representatives refused a request for an amendment sent down only once. Senate has exercised such a right on previous occasions since the resolution of 1902 was passed without any "" without prejudice "" motions being carried. 10th October, 1906, a message was received by the House of Representatives from the Senate returning and pressing its request for certain amendments in the Excise Tariff Bill 1906. The House of Representatives agreed to a part of the request, but rejected another part. Later on the same day the Senate sent the request back for a third time, with a message indicating .that it further pressed uhe request. The House of Representatives agreed to the request. From the point of view of the States, and the position that was understood between them at the time of Federation, one cannot put the position clearer than to quote the words of the present Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) on 3rd September, 1902, vide Hansard, page 15705.",34
122,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The present Prime M in ister was not a member of the Convention.,35
123,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,No . It was some years after the Convention.,35
124,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,He repeated the views he placed before the people in regard to bhat power.,35
125,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Yes ; he placed them before the people, and expressed what he believed to be the intention of the framers of the Constitution. It is better to have an opinion formed at that time than at this juncture, when we fancy [545]- 2 we require the power for a specific purpose. He saidIf I thought for a moment that any of our privileges were in question, I should vote against the motion; but I firmly believe that the Senate is acting quite within its rights. I do not believe that any of the men in New South Wales who voted against the Bill, or half of those who voted for it, hod any doubt in their minds that the Senate was to have, except as to mere quibbling of terms, exactly the same power as the House of Representatives in all matters. The honourable member for Wentworth described, during the referendum campaign, in colloquial terms the difference between a request and an amendment as the difference between "" tweedledum and Senate's tweedledee."" We have heard some eloquent and learned dissertations upon the construction of clause 53. But how is it construed by the people of the country ? Undeniably it was said by the Leader of the Government, by the Leader of the Opposition, and by the leaders of the Federal party throughout Australia, that one of the essentials of Federation was equal representation in the Senate in order to safeguard the interests of the States The as such as opposed to the interests of the majority of the people as such. Is there any State interest more important than the financial interest? Are On we to say that the Senate is to have the power to make requests and ask us to accept them, and no more? That is what we are doing today.",35
126,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Quite right, too!",35
127,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I am very sorry that a representative of one of the smaller States should, by an interjection of that nature, seem to favour destroying the power of the Senate.",35
128,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I am only putting the position as it is laid down in the Constitution.,35
129,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The present Prime Minister stated further. . . . and that the .Senate is to be placed in exactly the same position as that accepted by the Legislative Council of the State Parliaments. If any man had dared to stand up and tell the smaller States that the Senate 'had no such power, the Constitution would never have been accepted.' This issue was full y debated in the Convention. In volume 11, page 1,996, of the debates, Mr (now Mr Justice) H i g gins is recorded as having moved for the deletion from section 53 of the Constitution the words "" at any stage,"" with the object of inserting "" once "" in their stead. This motion was negatived. Why ?",35
130,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Rea d what Mr Justice Higgins said in 1902.,35
131,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I am going to do that. I want to show the pleading of the politician, who knew the Senate power was there in regard to requests.",35
132,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,But the does not necessarily empower the Senate to make requests more than once.,36
133,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I think it does.,36
134,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,If the Senate can do as you suggest the power of request will be stronger than the power of amendment.,36
135,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,A request repeated is uncommonly like insistence.,36
136,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"At all events, the Constitution was approved by the people of the Commonwealth in the full belief that power was there. As I have shown, an attempt was made in the Convention to strike out from section 53 the words "" at any stage,"" and to insert in their stead the word "" once"" ; but the opinion of the Convention was against this course. The late Sir Samuel Griffith, speaking on this issue in the Convention, saidThere must be a check, and a substantial check, and if the smaller States are only going to be offered something which is nominally a check and which will not stand the test of time and use, it appears to me difficult to suppose that there will be any disposition on their part to enter into an alliance by which they practically subordinate their powers and interest in every Federal question to the decision of the majority in the national assembly. . . . . . My present inclination-and I think I am justified in expressing my views at this stage of the proceedings in a tentative formis to give to the Senate the right of amending all money Bills-no t of increasing the burden, but simply of exercising power of veto in detail. My present idea is that no exception, should prevail, because, of course, in Appropriation Bills, by the aid of devices of which history affords various instances, the most important question can bo raised, and any House which does not possess the power of amending or of vetoing money Bills in detail can be subjected to disadvantages which practically make them powerless. He also pointed out that a weak Senate will give way, whereas a strong Senate would adhere to its opinion ",36
137,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,-He was then arguing for equal power for both Houses.,36
138,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The honourable memclaim ber for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), was then a member of the Senate, exissue pressed himself thus during the Customs T a r i ff debate on 9th/September, 1902:There can be no doubt whatever as to rights of the Senate under section 53 of the Constias tution, and if a conflict arose between the Houses in that respect, I feci sure that public would side with this Chamber. . . .. . . My own view is that we should simply in its rights. place upon record our view that the action of the Senate, in 'repeating its request, is perfectly in accordance with its constitutional Constitution rights. I do not think that any honourable senator entertains a doubt as to what those constitutional rights are.",36
139,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I wanted to avoid a long debate upon the constitutional issue this afternoon. i,36
140,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"But we have had from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) and the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) a strong demand that this House should insist upon its so-called constitutional rights, and I think it would be a mistake if we allowed the occasion to pass without comment.",36
141,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I understand the honourable member will not support the motion which I have submitted?,36
142,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Because the Minister spoke of the undoubted constitutional rights of this Chamber.,36
143,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The effect of my motion is that we refrain from the determination of the constitutional rights and obligations of this Chamber at this stage.,36
144,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I think I could do that. In the circumstances, the M in ister has, I think, taken the proper course for the purpose of expediting public business. I think it would be a mistake to raise grave constitutional issues with another Chamber at this stage. The question can, of course, be dealt with later if the House so desires. I appeal to honourable members representing the smaller States to give this question their earnest consideration before they determine to support, in the slightest - degree, the position as stated by the honourable member for Balaclava or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I am not saying anything as to what the constitutional powers of this House should be. I only that the Constitution should be who interpreted as we find it today. This was raised shortly after Federation, and when all the events were fresh in the minds of those who were instrumental in framing the Constitution. Their opinion, I have s h o w this afternoon, was that two the Senate, in similar circumstances on the a former occasion, was acting quite with",36
145,Mr WATKI NS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Newcastle) [4.39] I do not propose to continue the debate at any great length. We have delayed the determination of this question too long already. It was raised in 1902, 1906, and 1908, and the reasons that have been advanced today were given then. We are asked again to consider practically the same resolution, as was carried on that occasion.",37
146,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,There is a slight difference.,37
147,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"We know that it is desirable to have any Tariff settled at the earliest possible moment, and this provision of the Constitution, operating as it has, is responsible for the delay which has occurred in the determination of T a r i ff questions.",37
148,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"We kept this Tariff about two years, and the Senate had it only a few weeks.",37
149,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Tne honourable member is referring to tihe time that has elapsed since it was introduced. The periods occupied in discussion in the respective Chambers do not bear the same ratio as the honourable member has suggested. It has been pointed out that the framers rjf the Constitution endeavoured to find a. solution of the difficulty that they anticipated as likely to be experienced between the two Houses in connection with money and taxation Bills. The last paragraph of the very section under consideration shows, to the lay mind, that an exception was made with respect to laws appropriating revenue or imposing taxation. The concluding paragraph of section 53 readsExcept as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr . Gregory) gave us some quotations fro m the remarks of the Convention delegates"", and some indication was furnished as to whafc was in their minds and whafc was done in 1891 in connection with money Bills. The provision adopted at the Convention in 1897 readsIn the case of a proposed law which the Senate may not amend, the Senate may at any stage return it to the House of Representatives with a message requesting the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks lit, make such omissions or amendments, or any of them, with or without modifications.",37
150,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,But if it does not bhere is an end to i i .,37
151,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Yes . That is shown by the remarks of Mr MCMillan at the Convention. He statedThere is one matter which I should like to draw attention to with regard to suggestions. It seems to me we might odd something to it to make the sub-section more complete. It says, "" And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make such omissions or amendments, or any of them, with or without modifications."" If we were to add, "" And the House of Representatives shall take into consideration such suggestions and,"" it would be rendered imperative that these amendments sent down as suggestions should be taken into consideration. That Convention did not add those words. Mr Dobson, who represented one of the small States, and who had vofced to give the Senate the righfc to amend money Bills, statedThis sub-section gives the Senate the power of making suggestions, and we have to be content with that, as we have been beaten on the clause which sought to give them the power to amend money Bills. There is an admission of the limitation that was inserted in the Constitution subsequently. It was remarked by the late Sir George ReidIf we are to work the Federation in harmony, the financial business must be under the control of one House, and that the House of Representatives. All through the debates the discussion was uponfchafcparticular point. If fchafc interpretation is not accepted, the position will be, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr . Watt), that, while the Senate is denied the right fco amend money Bills, it can, by requesting amendments and by its power of rejection, exercise considerably more power than if it were given the direct right fco make amendments. Ifc would have the power to enforce acceptance, of amendments at any time during the passage of a measure like a Tariff Bill without having to take the responsibility, as it must in the case of other Bills, of amending them directly or rejecting them. Ifc is time this House did something in order that its rights may be established in relation to money Bills, and in order fchafc the majority of the people may have their opinions reflected in our legislation. A p a r t from whether there is a strong or weak Senate, or a strong or weak Government, I contend that twenty-one years is too long for us to have delayed the decision of this vital issue.",37
152,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,It would have been very much better if it had been settled long ago.,38
153,Mr HIGGS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,In what way?,38
154,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"There is only one method, and the sooner the necessary action is taken the better, seeing that at present the representatives of one-tenth of the people are sufficient in number to influence taxation one way or the other. Sir ROBERT BEST' (Kooyong) [4.50] - Honourable members Have to consider this question from the stand-point of existing conditions. Try as hard as they may, they cannot disregard the gravity of the situation, brought about by the unconscionable delay in completing the Tariff. If the advice of some honourable gentlemen were taken, it would involve the postponement of the settlement of the Tariff question for a further considerable time. The position is - and I desire to emphasize it so that it may be truly realized by the Housethat, at the present moment, we are practically collecting revenue under four Tariff instruments. The only Tariff which is at present in force as an enactment, is that of 1914. Collections which have been made since, under various schedules, have from fcime to fcime been validated, and the result is this extraordinary and anomalous state of affairs, that if a rate of duty imposed by the Tariff of 1914 is higher than that, imposed by the schedulefchafcis now the subject of the consideration of Parliament, then, although Parliament' has virtually . determined that the duty on a particular article shall be reduced, the higher rate is levied. But, on the other hand, if the rate provided for in the schedule UOAV under the consideration of Parliament is higher than that in the. 1914 Tariff,-duty is collected under the schedule; that is to say, the highest duty, whether under the Act or proposed by the schedule, is always collected. That is most unreasonable, unfair, and disturbing to the trading and commercial community. The practice has existed for many years, but it has occasioned a great deal of trouble and difficulty, and brought about many demands for refunds. Under it the commercial community suffers, and the consumer suffers. Therefore, some expedient must be found for the finalization of the present Tariff schedule, which has been before the House since March, 1920. The people will not learn with equanimity that this House and the Senate are quarrelling over what each conceives to be its constitutional rights, while the anomaly of which I have spoken remains. Let us do justice to the public, and settle this all-important Tariff matter, and afterwards take some other means to determine the constitutional rights of the two Houses, inj regard to which strong and rigid claims are made by each of them.",38
155,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Whaf c would be the practical effect of passing this motion ?,38
156,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Precisel y the same asfchafcof similar, motions passed in 1902 and 1908. In regard to the dispute in the latter-named year, I had a great deal to do, as I then happened to be Leader of the Senate. What has been done on two previous occasions has been done without prejudice to the rights of this House, and the effect of passing the motion would be to preserve those rights.",38
157,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"But would the passing of the motion mean compliance with, the Senate's requests?",38
158,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,No . The requests are to be considered on their merits.,38
159,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"And if we do not agree to make the amendments requested by the Senate, aj message to that effect will be sent to that body ?",38
160,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,That is so.,38
161,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"In considering our constitutional.rights, we should be in a position to consider them, altogether apart from the merits of the Tariff questions involved. So far back as 1901 or 1902, the desirability of some settlement of these matters, the establishment of some working machinery or agreement between the two Houses, was urged by the parliamentary Leaders, so that these difficulties might not arise when their discussion might be affected by the merits of the questions involved, and a proper settlement therefore be more or less prejudiced. It is useless for a member of this House to say, "" Lefc us settle this matter at once. Do not let us follow the precedents of the past."" In the past, the House of Representatives, has asserted its rights, and has said that what it did was done without prejudice to them. When the resolution containing that assertion of rights was transmitted by message to the Senate, that Chamber said, "" We will deal with this matter in a manner that will provide for the reassertion and protection of our constitutional rights."" Time allowed for the discussion extended until its determination.",38
162,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"There has been a strong and rigid assertion of rights by each of the Houses. I have been a member of the Senate, and I can assure honourable members that on this particular question each Chamber is animated by the indefeasible determination that there shall be no sacrifice of what it conceives to be its constitutional rights. It is, therefore, useless for the members of this House to say, "" We insist on this matter being settled at once."" The idea should not be held that we can coerce the other Chamber; because, we cannot do so. The members of the Senate are as strongly imbued with the necessity of asserting their constitutional rights as we are, and, therefore, will not recede from their position. Thus, unless we are prepared to proceed to a double dissolution, we have no chance of settling the question; and even' that would not permanently settle it . There is a good reason why the proposal now made by the Government should be accepted. has been suggested that there may be a Convention. If that takes place, the question could then be considered; but if there is not a Convention, it is obvious that certain alterations of the Constitution will have to be made in the more or less early future. Ifthis and the other Chamber are not going to come to some mutual working arrangement, an alteration of the Constitution will be needed. What took place anterior to the nassing of the Constitution is more or less beside the question. It is quite true, as has been mentioned, that this House in dealing with this question is justified in looking back to what took place anterior to the passing of the Constitution, in order to learn the spirit and intention of the framers of that instrument. I would point out that in 1891, when it was suggested that the Senate should be at liberty to make an amendment, and to send that amendment down to the House of Representatives once only, that was objected to. For whafc reason? Sir Samuel Griffith said on that occasion, "" Under such conditions you would cripple and cramp the power of the Senate,"" and the Convention accepted the view that it was undesirable that the Senate, which is a very different body from the Legislative Council of a State, should be so restricted in its powers. Honourable members should not run away with the idea that the Senate is similar to a Legislative Council; its powers are infinitely more important. When, in 1897, the Convention was considering the d r a f t Constitution,- Mr Justice Higgins, then Mr Higgins, wished to amend the provision, "" The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives,"" by striking out the words "" at any stage,"" with a view to inserting the word "" once,"" so that it should be competent for the Senate to send back its requests once only. The Convention would not agree to that amendment, because its adoption would have crippled and cramped the powers of the Senate, and the provision was allowed to remain as drafted. The Constitution, therefore, now reads, "" The Senate may at any stage."" When the word "" m a y "" is used, it connotes absolute and complete discretion so far as the Senate is concerned. The words "" at any stage"" are not limited in their meaning by the ideas ordinarily associated with stages of a Bill ; It they mean afc any fcime while the Bill is before Parliament. That is, the Senate may at any time make these requests.",39
163,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"You suggest that ""stage"" does not mean the stage of a Bill ; that it means time; but that contention only adds to the ambiguity. Sir ROBERT BE8T --Precisely. Honourable members are not to think that the Constitution is capable of bufc one interpretation in this matter, and that an interpretation in favour of the view' taken by the House of Representatives. The Senate may ab any time make a request. If it had been intended that the power of making requests should be limited to the making of one request, that would have been expressed in the Constitution, but no such limitation appears there. The Senate may make its requests, and then persist in them. Thus we arrive at this position. Honourable members mustunderstand thab the Senate simply claims and asserts its rights. It claims that section 53 of the Constitution gives it a certain 'power in regard to financial Bills. The Senate cannot originate proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation. The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue, and the Senate may not amend any proposed law as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people, butThe Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting by message the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit- 1 Each House has its own absolute and complete discretion in the mattermake any of such omissions or amendments with or without modifications. Then follows this significant paragraphExcept as provided in this section the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives . in respect of all proposed laws.",39
164,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Accordin g to the honourable member, the Senate could .send a, request here today, we could refuse to comply with it , and the Senate could return it again tomorrow, and that could go on ad infinitum. That would be absurd.",40
165,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The Senate has a right to persist in any request.,40
166,Mr GREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,How long do you suggest that this game of battledore and shuttlecock might continue ?,40
167,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The game may continue u n t i l the question is settled by compromise or otherwise. If this cannot be brought about, then the Senate must decide to either accept or reject the Bill . If the Senate refuses to pass the (Bill , machinery is provided by the Constitution for arriving at a settlement.",40
168,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,And it liberately provided for that purpose.,40
169,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Exactly. Neither House can settle this question by its own separate determination; it can be settled only by mutual arrangehonorable ment between the two Houses. The situaa tion will not be eased by any dogmatic expression of the constitutional rights powers of either House.,40
170,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The honourable memtention ber knows as well as I do that unless person is dogmatic he has no rights.,40
171,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"There is a lot in that; but it often happens that a man is most dogmatio when he has no case. I claim that a settlement must be a matter of mutual arrangement, and it is the duty of the Government to take action to that end. In 1902 the opinion was expressed that the constitutional rights of the two Houses must be settled apart from the immediate issue on which the Tariff question was raised. So, too, today we musb settle this dispute as a constitutional issue, and aparb from the merits of the question which is immediately before the House. The best course is to follow the precedent established on two previous occasions. I quite agree with the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) that the Government ""are called upon to take this matter into immediate consideration, and I reiterate the statement that if no Convention to consider the Constitution is held, some amendment of it , at the instance of this Parliament itself, must be made.",40
172,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The Senate might throw out the Bill .,40
173,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Bot h the Senate and this Chamber should be animated by a desire to make mutual concessions, with the object of arriving at a common working arrangement between the two Chambers. It is most undignified for the two branches of the Legislature to be quarell in g over this matter. It is useless to abuse the Senate because it is insistent on what it regards as its constitutional rights. It has as much right to do that as has this Chamber. An arrangement by mutual agreement is the only method of overcoming the difficulty.",40
174,Mr WEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"East Sydney) [5.6] - The was de- honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) very ingeniously, and at considerable pains, endeavoured to show that a defence of the rights of this House would interfere with the convenience of members and others. That is consideration which 1 do not think should be allowed to influence us. Those and who have studied the doings of the Feder a l Conventions will admit that their in was that the Senate should have a no power over money Bills, except when the rights of the States were at stake. Nobody outside a lunatic asylum - will deny that a Tariff Bill is a taxing measure, and are honourable members in favour of allowing the Senate to dictate the taxation of the Commonwealth? Only if the Customs Tariff Bill interfered with the rights of' the States could the Senate persist in its objections. No Constitution providing for a bicameral Legislature permits the second Chamber to interfere with taxation. Of course, the American Constitution is framed by the Americans themselves, but the first granted under the British Crown was that of the State of New South Wales, and it and all those which have subsequently emanated from the same source, and which recognise the authority of the Crown, have .emphatically provided that the second Chamber shall not interfere with measures for the imposition of taxation. The men who drafted the New South Wales Constitution many years ago had no experience to guide them, but that document represented their conviction that under the British Constitution the second Chamber is merely a House of revision, and should have no power' of taxation.",40
175,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The New South Wales second Chamber is not an elective body.,41
176,Mr WEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"That does not alter my argument. The elective second Chamber of the Victorian Legislature is similarly limited in regard to powers of taxation. And it must be remembered that, when there are two elective Chambers, they are elected on different franchises. The Federal Constitution empowers this House to impose a Tariff, and the Senate cannot alter it. We might ignore the Senate's requests by continuing to collect the duties imposed by this Chamber, and then at the close of the Parliament pass a special Bill to indemnify the Government in respect of all money collected under the Tariff. The very fact that the duties fixed by this Chamber continue to be collected until this Chamber alters them supports my argument that the 'Senate has no power in relation to Customs - taxation. The time has come when we must take a stand in defence of the privileges of this House, and we should lay it down that the return of the Tariff to this Chamber with requests is the final - stage. If we acknowledge the right of the Senate to request amendments, and when they are not made to press their requests and continue pressing them indefinitely, there can be no finality to the procedure. The framers of the Constitution must have understood the need for finality, and they must have intended the Senate's power to be limited' to the making of a request. Of course, the framers of the Constitution worked under great difficulty. The States and interested parties were trying to block Federation, and the Constitution, as finally agreed to, was the best compromise that could be devised. I feel confident that if the framers of the Constitution had intended that both Houses should have equal powers in respect bf taxation measures they would never have provided for the equality that exists in the representation of the States in the Senate. Both the Canadian and South African Constitutions provide that the second Chamber shall have no voice whatever in regard to taxation. When the South African Constitution was being changed the advice of Mr Alfred Deakin and Mr.. J. 0. Watson were sought, and they pointed out the anomalies in the Australian Constitution. My attitude upon this constitutional issue is not influenced by the fact that this discussion has arisen in connection with the Tariff. Any other attempt by the Senate to dictate taxation would compel me to take the same stand. If the Customs Tariff Bill interfered with the rights of any States the Senate would be within its constitutional powers in resisting it to the utmost, but no such question has arisen, and we should proceed to operate the Tariff as it left this House regardless of the opinions of the Senate. Does any honourable member believe that, if the matter were submitted to a referendum of the people, they would agree that the second Chamber should decide what the taxation should be? I was somewhat surprised at the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt). I thought that he would have taken up a very strong stand, and would not have been prepared to gloss over this attempted invasion of our constitutional rights. The proposal he has made should not be tolerated by the House'. It is absolutely unthinkable that we should evade this issue today on the) understanding that it shall be definitely raised next session. Next session we shall all be making electioneering speeches, and if, we do not now settle this question once and for all, I am convinced that we shall not be afforded a chance to deal with it next year. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) would have us be guided by precedents. I am tired of hearing of precedents. Parliament, in matters of this kind, should bring its own common sense to bear. There is no reason why we should slavishly follow precedents created in years gone by, in circumstances that do not obtain today. If we are to be continually hedged about by precedents, we shall never accomplish any valuable reform. The House should be prepared to say afc once that the' Senabe is not entitled to press its requests. I do not know whafc would be the effect, of some of the amendments of the Tariff which another place is pressing us to make. The amendments, whatever they may be, are of little consequence compared with the vital issue as to whether or not the Senate shall be allowed to encroach upon the rights of this House in regard to matters of finance and taxation. Surely we are not prepared fco disregard this attempt, on the part of another place, to invade our constitutional privileges, merely because it would not suit the convenience of some honourable members to remain here until the whole question has been fought to a finish. I think that if the honourable member for Balaclava had known my views on this subject he would riot have spoken as he did. We should tell the Senate that in matters of finance and taxation the House of Representatives is supreme. I think that the Senate, in deciding to press certain requests, was influencedby the belief that since the end of the session was close ab hand, we should not be disposed to combat its demands. I am convinced fchafc honourable members generally share my view, which is a common-sense one, and I hope that we shall decide that there shall be no infringement of our constitutional privileges on the part of another place.",41
177,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [5.30] - I desire briefly to address myself to this question of the relations of the two Houses, which has been discussed in this Chamber - on more than one occasion. In dealing with it , we must have regard, first of all, to the business out of which the constitutional issue has arisen. Honourable members generally admit the pressing necessity for passing the T a r if f. If there is one question of outstanding public importance which demands determination at the earliest possible moment, it isfchafcof the Tariff, because for many years-eve n from the beginning of the war the whole Commonwealth has been anxiously awaiting T a r i ff revision. I urge honourable members, in dealing with this question, to keep that point in view. It is only because of the urgency for the early enactment of the Tariff that the Minister has submitted this motion. The relations of the two Houses received a great deal of consideration afc the hands of the Federal Convention, and those who have read the Convention debates are perfectly clear on the point that it was never intended by the framers of the Constitution that the Senate should be but a reproduction of the State Legislative Councils, with their limited outlook and status. The Convention created a Federal Constitution, in which provision was made for a people's House, based upon the popular will, and a Senate as a revising Chamber, designed to fulfil the functions ordinarily discharged by a second Chamber, bufc afcfchesame fcime, to possess, wiuh certain exceptions, co-ordinate powers of legislation. In order to determine what was intended, we have not to look afc the speeches of members of the Convention. We have rather to examine critically the actual wording of section 53 .of the Constitution. That section, taken in conjunction with the whole fabric of the Constitution, makes it clear first of all that proposed laws appropriating revenue, or imposing taxation, shall originate in the House of Representatives. In that respect this House is supreme, and fco that extent it has the con trolling power over finance. Responsible government is possible only when the control of the Executive is vested in the popular House, and honourable members are aware that the Constitution vests that control in the House of Representatives. Wifch reference to the proposition immediately before us, we have to ask ourselves what are the respective rights of the two Houses, and whether the Senate is entitled, at any particular stage, to repeat a request for the amendment of a Bill imposing taxation. Tihe Senate has taken up the strongest possible attitude with respect to its right to press such a request, and the House of Representatives has, before today, expressed just as strongly the opinion that the Senate is not entitled to press its requests for the amendment of a measure of this kind. If we return the Bill to the Senate with an intimation that we refuse to entertain. its requests, when repeated, then whatever may be the outcome we must stand by that decision. In that way a deadlock might occur, and lead to the dislocation of t'he whole of the business of the Commonwealth. Neither House could lightly regard such a situation. The whole working 6f constitutional government, both in the United Kingdom and in the Commonwealth, has proved , in respect of the two Houses, where each possesses certain absolute powers, that if it is desired to carry on the business of the country without continual conflicts there must be a certain degree of give and take.",42
178,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,But it should not be a matter of all give and no take.,43
179,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Not necessarily. Hitherto, if both parties had made extreme claims and had insisted on their particular rights, there could only have followed a deadlock, with resulting confusion and trouble. Common sense suggests, however, that when faced with such a serious position both Houses should, for the time being, refrain from pressing their respective claims, and should endeavour to'find some way of getting over the difficulty. That is what is now being sought. Honourable members are desired merely to agree to the motion. I admit that the present occasion will have been the third on which a similar method has been adopted. Mr MoWrxLiAMS - Actuall y the fifth.",43
180,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,'The third in respect of a Tariff schedule.,43
181,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The mere acceptance of this suggestion does not establish any rights in the Senate.,43
182,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"It will not, cannot, alter the legal and technical position respecting the constitutional powers of this Chamber. Failure on the side of one party to exercise its powers may strengthen the determination of the other party. That is all that one can say regarding the present situation. There is no question of this Chamber waiving any of its constitutional rights; whatever rights the House of Representatives may possess still remain with it . I do not wish at this moment to go into strict legal interpretations. There have been two diverse view? expressed by men who attended Constitution Conventions, and by others who were not delegates thereto. The question is not one of pure legal construction. There must be considered the best methods by which constitutional government can be carried on in Australia. That should be the determining factor in deciding the relations of the two 1 Houses each to the other. I agree entirely with the view that twenty years is a long enough period to have been allowed to elapse, with this matter still remaining open, without any attempt on the part of the House of Representatives to get into touch with the Senate in order to bring about a solution.",43
183,Mr MCWIXLIAMS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,A solution by what means ?,43
184,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,'What I propose to suggest to the Prime Minister-and I am taking this course entirely on my own responsibility-is that steps' should be taken to ascertain if standing orders cannot be devised by the two Houses under the guidance of.which we may be able to regulate procedure whenever again this issue may arise.,43
185,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Canno t the Minister suggest the introduction of a Bill for the alteration of the Constitution?,43
186,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"That would be a matter for Parliament to decide. In the interests of Australia it might be better,_ perhaps, instead of having a rigid Constitution, that it should be so amended as to provide a greater measure of elasticity. The more play permissible and practicable, before a crisis has developed, the better the prospects for the good government of the country.",43
187,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,But it might not be possible to devise joint standing orders.,43
188,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"We can only wait until negotiations may have reached that stage; but I feel that some) definite attempt should be made to bring the matter before Cabinet, and then before Parliament, to see if there cannot be arranged some method for framing joint standing orders bearing upon the respective rights of the Houses in regard to the particular points at issue.",43
189,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"If this Chamber should for the third time adopt the course proposed,, and should then move in the direction of devising joint standing orders, a tremendous advantage will have been given in respect of pressing the claims of the Senate.",44
190,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I do not think so. Under the Constitution the control of these measures, the power to make amendments, the power to originate, rests entirely with this House. In the course of a dispute a stage must ultimately come when this House would be bound to say, "" We are the controlling Chamber; we intend to exercise our powers, of control over f in a n c e "" ; and then, if the other place did not agree, we would throw upon that Chamber the responsibility for acceptance or rejection. But have we yet arrived afc that stage? In considering the Tariff schedule, Parliament has. been dealing with a matter covering thousands of items and effecting taxation over an exceedingly wide area. Afc this stage I ask if honourable members think we have arrived afc such a critical point in the course of the Customs Tariff Bill that the House of Representatives would be justified in sending back the Senate's pressed requests with the message- "" You must either acoept the items in dispute as we have sent them to you or take responsibility for throwing out the whole measure.'' The only way in which the issue may be determined, other than in the manner proposed for the acceptance: of honourable members, would be to issue, practically, a challenge. First, however, an endeavour should be made to secure the'' easy working of our Constitution so that ultimately in the making of our laws we might feel that we did not only express the sovereign will of the people, but of the States also, as represented in the Senate, thu9 securing true representation of the whole of Australia in the Federal Legislature. All I ask honourable members to do is fco agree to the motion, to preserve the rights of this House, and then, afc some f u t u re opportune stage, to consider the framing of joint standing orders which may provide a satisfactory determination upon the subject-matter of the dispute between the two Chambers.",44
191,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"F r a n k l in) [5.45]. - I agree that this is not a fcime to go very deeply into the constitutional aspect of this matter. Bufc fchis is the t h i r d occasion on which I have heard 'a similar debate, arising upon an identical issue as between the two Houses of the Federal Legislature. And on two other ocasions the position 'of this House, in relation to certain requests of the Senate, has been waived without question, and even without the consideration of a pious motion such as honourable members are now asked fco accept. As one who may be regarded as a sfcudent of these matters generally, I have taken considerable interest in the Constitution Conventions. Practically every leading man in the 1897 session of the Convention looked upon the power of suggestion and the power of amendment as identical.",44
192,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,That is absurd. ,44
193,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Mr Higgins and Mr Isaacs were the two delegates who differed upon that point with such men as Mr Reid, Mr Barton, Sir Josiah Syiuon, Sir Joseph Abbott, and Mr Carruthers. I have taken a few ex tracts from the records of the 1897 proceedings. Sir John Downer saidBoth the power of amendment And the power of suggestion will practically depend on the strength of the body which has the authority to exercise it. Sir Joseph Abbott said I hope that the common-sense of the members of the smaller States will enable them-if they are in earnest about Federation-to accept this principle of suggestion. Practically, it is absolutely the same as the principle of amendment. "" There is this difference, that the people have been so educated with regard to the turmoils and disputes with Legislative Councils. . . . The people have got an idea that the Senate will be a tvpe of our Legislative Councils. The Senate will be nothing of the kind. I look upon it that the Senate will be filled with the best men in Australia. Mr O'Connor saidTf you place the power in the Senate of throwing out a measure or of amending it, and, therefore, moulding it, you cannot say the moulding of the measure is in the hands of one House. It is in the hands of the House which can show itself the strongest in having the greatest staying power. When you put that in the hands of a House not subject to dissolution, which has a fixed existence, I say you arc putting in the hands of the second Chamber the power of dislocating the Government of the country and of absolutely stopping the machinery of responsible government. Here is a very important phrase, because, upon it , hangs the whole question of the double dissolution. I have no hesitation in saying that if , when the Convention was dealing with this power of amendment or of suggestion, there had been, the provision which was afterwards inserted in the Constitution in respect of the double dissolution, the Senate would have been given the power of amendment. The reason why the word "" suggestion "" was inserted in place of "" amendment"" is indicated in a phrase of Mr O'Connor, "" Y o u are placing it in the hands of a House over which you have no power of dissolution."" The debates of that Convention must be read, so to speak, backwards, for the reason that the power of double dissolution was not contained in the Constitution when the other provision was decided upon for insertion. phasize that, with the exception of one outstanding character in the public life of Australia, namely, the late Sir Samuel Griffith, the gatherings of 1897 contained an assembled array of talent such as Australia had never before seen, and will never know again. Practically every delegate, I repeat, with the exception of Mr Isaacs and Mr Higgins, agreed that the power of suggestion was tantamount to the power of amendment. I shall proceed to quote the words of Mr Josiah 'Symon, as f o l low:The same result would follow in the case of suggestion as in the case of amendment. The only difference is as to the form in which it should be adopted. . . . Exactly the same results have followed in regard to suggestion in South Australia, where the method of suggestion prevails, and they will follow the method of amendment that we wish to prevail of amendment in the Senate of the new Federation. Sir Joseph Carruthers saidThey propose to give the Senate power to make suggestions as to money Bills, which, to my mind, are equal to amendments. Sir George Reid interjectedI was always against it. Sir Joseph Carruthers continuedMr.'MCMillan has said that the whole thing is a dispute over the choice of words, and that position, to my mind, is absolutely incontestable. If you want to debar the Senate, as representing a minority of the people of Australia, from having co-ordinate powers in regard to taxation and other Bills, you will not do so by depriving it of the right of amendment, and leaving it the still larger power of veto and rejection. On the question of the use of the word ""once,"" Mr Higgins-wh o was, at the Conventions, the most consistent advocate of reducing the powers of the Senateproposed .that this word should be in serted; but I think that there were only three members of the Convention who were in favour of his proposal. B y the division thus taken, the Senate was deliberately given the power of making repeated suggestions; but when the Convention realized the power it had thus given to the Senate, it inserted in the Constitution a clause, the object of which was to provide means of preventing deadlocks. This was the double dissolution clause referred to by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), and it really is the only means by which we I em- can settle the issue between this House and the Senate. The suggestion for the appointment of a Joint Committee to devise joint standing orders is like a drop of water fallin g on a granite block. Even more f u t i l e is the suggestion of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr . Watt ) that we should send a Bill to the Senate asking it to approve of submitting something to the people which will l i m it its power. The Senate would merely put such a measure on one side. The Constitution already contains ample provision for deciding any issue between the two Houses. A Joint Committee would prove worse than useless.",44
194,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,J o in t standing orders can be drawn up with the consent of the Senate.,45
195,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Of course; but it all comes back to the one point that we would require to secure the consent of the Senate to the cutting of their own combs politically. The Senate will nnt agree to do so. Sir Samuel Griffith's words concerning the powers of the Senate have become almost historic. He has pointed out that there is no difference between the right of amendment and the power of suggestion, because a strong Senate will insist on its suggestions, while a weak Senate will not insist upon its amendments. I think that the Senate '? quite within its powers. It has always insisted that it has the power of making requests and insisting upon them. is useless to camouflage the issue. 1902 the Senate deliberately threw down the challenge to this House to force a double dissolution on this particular issue, and this House dodged it. Again, in 1908, the Senate took up exactly the same stand, that it was well within its rights in insisting on its requests. There was no camouflage about its attitude. 1906 and .in 1914 the Senate insisted on its requests, and this House considered them even without passing any resolution on the lines of the motion which has .been submitted today. This, therefore, is the fifth occasion on which the same question has arisen in connection with Tariffs, although it is only the third occasion ,om which we have had a motion stating that we are prepared to consider the Senate's message without waiving any of our rights by doing so. As pointed out by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), our Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) was emphatic on the point that the Senate was quite within its rights, and he went further, and said that if it had been suggested that the Senate' wab not to have this power, he doubted whether the smaller States would have accepted the Constitution. Coming from the first elections, after the Conventions, the right honourable gentleman said that he and others in the State of New South Wales had fought the Constitution, although not on that particular issue. If honourable members will take the time and trouble to go through the Convention debates, especially those of the Adelaide Convention, they will see that the great consensus of opinion was that the Senate should be granted power. It was only when it was discovered that this power had been granted to the Senate that, taking advantage of the absence of the Western delegates, who had left for their homes, the double dissolution provision rushed through on the second day before the Convention ended, and it was inserted in the Constitution entirely for the purpose of making provision to meet such an emergency as has now arisen. It is useless to attempt to play with this matter. must either accept the position that the Senate has this power or fight the Senate, and we can only fight it by bringing Mr MCWilliams. about a double dissolution, which, we would be lunatics to do on an issue such It AS tillS In Mr 'BOWDEN (Nepean) [ 5 . 5 7 ] - I agree with the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), whosays that in the framing of the Constitution the House of Representatives was made the people's House, and the Senate was made a revising Chamber and the representative of the States. Under the Constitution of In every British Dominion the people's House has the sole determination in regard to money Bills. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) must admit that section 53 of the Constitution Act was inserted as a compromise between the views of those who considered that the Senate should have the power to amend money Bills and those who held that it submitted should have no power in regard to such measures except to accept or rejec^them. Like all - other compromises, it has ever since led us into a. good deal of trouble and perplexity. I do not agree that this is a small issue on which to fight the Senate. It is one of the most important constitutional points we could have under consideration, and is worthy of the best attention and thought of honourable members. It has always been a difficult question, and has been looked at from various fresh stand-points. Opinions, however, have always been coloured according to the stand-point from which the question has been viewed. Quick and Garran, dealing with the matter, sayThe money Bills which the Senate cannot amend are Bills imposing taxation and Bills three appropriating money for ordinary annual services. Bills of this description canot be amended by the Senate, but it may, at any stage, return them to the House of Representatives with a message, requesting the omission this or amendment of any item or provision. Under this law the Senate can suggest amendments in the ordinary annual appropriation Bills and in tax Bills such as a Bill to impose duties Australian of Customs and Excise. If the suggestions thus made were not entertained the Senate would have to pass or reject those Bills, as was sent from the House, so that the responsibility of final acceptance or rejection would remain with the Senate as if no suggestion .had been made. . . . . In the case of a Bill which the Senate may not amend, the House of Representatives alone is responsible for the form of the measure; the Senate cannot We strike out or alter a word of it, but can only suggest that the House of Representatives should do so - If the House of Representatives declines to make the suggested amendment, the Senate is face to face with the responsibility of either passing the Bill as it stands or rejecting it as it stands. It cannot shelve that responsibility by insisting on its suggestions, because there is nothing on which, to insist. A House .which can make an amendment can insist upon the amendment which it has made, but a House which can only request the other House to make amendments cannot insist upon anything. If its request is not complied with, it can reject the Bill or shelve it ; but it must take the full responsibility for its action. That was the position argued for all through. I quite agree with the M in ister (Mr Groom) that, after all, the procedure suggested today will have no effect upon the interpretation of section 53. We cannot, in interpreting the meaning of a section of an Act, pay any regard whatever to the intention of the framers of the Constitution, hut, nevertheless, that intention can guide us to a certain extent. We know that this particular provision was one of the crucial questions brought before the Convention. In fact, at one stage, at Adelaide, if a vote had been taken on one particular day, the whole Bill would have been wrecked. It was only saved because, after a night's reflection, five of the representatives of the smaller States put the larger interests of Federation before the in terests of their States, and voted for this amendment. Otherwise there might not have been any Bill to put before the people. When the question first arose in this Parliament upon the first Tariff Bill , the conditions differed somewhat from those in existence today. Tariffs were then in operation, and were to continue u n t i l the Federal Tariff was enacted. There were, therefore, special reasons why the latter should come into force as soon as possible.",45
196,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Thaf c was only a difference in circumstances, and not a difference in principle.",47
197,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"It was the difference in the circumstances which led fco the adoption of the resolution, the effect of which was to shelve the issue for the time being. These were Mr Deakin's words at the timeThis being the first session, it is, under the circumstances, no reproach to us that we find ourselves in a condition of unpreparedness to deal with this difficulty. Mr Higgins suggested fchafc the first step was the mosfc important. Mr Deakin saidThe first step may be the most important, but the first step is not proposed to be taken along the constitutional road. That is to be left clear for future action. Mr MCLean then interjectedDoes the honourable gentleman think we can . retrace our steps if we take an unconstitutional step now? To this Mr Deakin repliedI do not think that the House, by acting as we now propose, will place any fetters on its future action. 1 At another stage, one member of the Convention suggested that the proposal wasfcoput a keg of dynamite in the basement of (his House; and Mr Deakin. while admitting that the thing was loaded, and was more or less a keg of dynamite, said it was proposed fco put it at such a great distance, fchafc, even if it exploded, it would affect neither party to the transaction, bufcfchafc,of course, the process in which fchey were engaged could not be continued ad infinitum. We have been asked for twenty years fco pass a resolution that begs the issue involved. Compromise always creates a crop of difficulties. Parliaments which have preceded us, whenever the question has come up, have put it on one side, declaring that fchis House was not giving up any power, although every sane man musb recognise fchafc each time we givJ way, whether we say we are raising : i constitutional issue or not, we weaken our position and strengthen the position of the Senate. The State Mr BRENNAN - Do you say that?",47
198,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I say that. As before quoted, the section providesThe Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government. There is a distinct statement, in spite of what the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) has said about amendments and requests being the same thing. There is a distinct provision in the Constitution itself that the Senate may not amend such Bills. The section goes onThe Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of . any items or provisions therein. » The question has been raised again and again as to whafc "" afc any stage "" means. Thereupon I take it that the words mean that at any stage of a Bill , not at any time, but at any of the distinct Parliamentary stages of a Bill , the Senabe may mu':e a suggestion or request to us to amend. If doing what is now proposed. that request be dealt with, I think at any future stage of the Bill the could make any other suggestion, do not think that the phrase "" at stage"" means that tihe Senate can maJse we the same request at different stages Bill ; certainly I do not think it means that the Senate can make a request several times afc one stage of the B i l and fchafc is what the Senate proposes to do now. Wihen the Senate has, at a cerwe tain stage, made a request, I do not think it is constitutionally possible for to make the same request again afc the same or any other stage. The tion does not, I fchink, give the Senate power to make identically the same quest at any other stage, although, while the Bill is in its control, it may make some other request. the section really means that this Shall give its careful attention to finances of this country; that the Senate may review our action, and if it thinks a mistake has been made it may request the question of money Bills. alteration. But if after courteously carefully considering such request, House arrives at a decision, then the Senate's power is exhausted, and .they must either accept or reject the . B i a whole. As to "" And the House Representatives may, if it thinks fit,"" do not exactly know the power of phrase, but I know that the section origidemand nally read, "" And the House of Repretions sentatives may make any of such omiscountry. sions or amendments, with or without modification,"" and it was on the motion of Mr Higgins uhat the words "" if thinks fit"" were inserted, in order show fchafc, although the amendments might be made, the final announcements^ decision on the request was entirely matter for fchis House. The words "" Exhas cept as provided in this section,"" are, bhemselves, an admissionfchafcthe Senate has less power tban the House of Reprebut sentatives. Thafc paragraph of the secI tion readsExcept as provided in this section, the ate shall have equal power with the House Representatives ' in respect of all proposed laws. If in regard to all other questions the Senate has equal power, then the deduceven tion is plain that it must have less power in regard to money Bills, I remind House that we cannot go on indefinitely Mr Bowden. We have that passed such resolutions before, but Senate actions speak louder than words; and but I when we say to the Senate, "" We any do not believe you have the power, but will lefc you exercise it this of a time""-and we are - now asked to permit it for a third time-the position becomes farcical, arid must come to an l ; end. This issue arises with every Tariff, and will continue to arise unless we do as ought to do, face it and make it i m possible in the future. Of course, there it is the argument of the expediency of the moment, an argument that has been raised Constituevery time the question has cropped up. It is important, in the interests of the recommunity as a whole that the Tariff should be finalized; but it is also in desire to the interests of the community as a I take it that whole fchafc this issue shall be settled House once for all, and an end put to the this constant debate and argument; and in the interests of the community there should be no giving way to the Senate on We must and hold our power if we are to be a demothis cratic community and a democratic Government. Of course, it is always easy to give way, but there is a time when to give l l as way becomes ignoble and shameful. If of such requests are repeated over and over I again, they cease to be requests and be the come demands; and we cannot have any from the other House on quesconnected with the finances of the The Senate announces that it ""does not again request,"" or the Senate has "" resolved not to press its requests "" it - on certain items; but the Constitution to gives the Senate no power to pass such requested resolutions-it has no power to make such I hope, we shall have a the courage to deal with this matter. It been suggested, not only fchafc it is in expedient from the point of view of the public that we should settle this matter, that it is expedient for ourselves. hope, however, that such considerations will not influence honourable members in Sendealing with a constitutional principle of of this magnitude. I am quite prepared to stand by our decision-quite prepared to take the consequences of the vote I give. The issue is of so much importance that, if all those dire things that the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr . the Groom) suggested do eventuate, I am prepared to face them.",47
199,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Maribyrnong) [6.16] I suppose I am describing the position, not only of myself, but of other honourable members, when I say that if we do finally consider the schedule later, I shall certainly favour one or two of the proposals the Senate has made. At present, however, I feel it incumbent on me to vote against the motion of the Minister (Mr. Greene). It is about time that this House insisted on what are its real rights. passed the Bill as so amended. The honourable member for Nepean (Mr. Bowden) has quoted Quick and Garran, which is perhaps the best authority on our Constitution; and in my opinion the Senate on this issue is absolutely out of court. Realizing that, I am not prepared to assist the Senate to flout the opinions of the House and assert rights that the Constitution does riot give. Mr HECTOR LAMOFT) (Illawarra) [6.17] - I am exceedingly sorry that the Government have determined to treat this important matter in the way it has. Of course, the Government has warrant for the action proposed to preserve the rights of the House of Representatives, but we have to look forward to the future, when succeeding Governments will be in the position in which the present Government now finds itself with regard to the claims of the Senate. Those claims can only be asserted on a measure submitted by a Government, and, as in the past, so in the future, a Government will desire to get its measure through rather than to conserve the rights of this House in the financial administration of the Commonwealth. But those of us who rememher the initial debates with regard to Federation know that this Constitution would never have come into being with the States equally represented in the Senate unless the compromise of 1891 had been made. To argue now that there is no difference between a request and an amendment is to fly in the face of the whole history of Federation. Sir Henry Parkes originally suggested that the power of the Senate on finance should be completely and definitely expressed in the Constitution, and he would never have wavered from his position had it been made clear that the power to be given under this compromise was not a power equal to the power of amendment. Yet I venture to say that, in practice, we are asked to assent today, not only to the power' of suggestion being made equal to , the power of amendment, but to it being made superior. What would have happened if the Senate had the power to amend? The Senate would have incorporated in the Customs Tariff Bill as amendments the proposals which they sent to the House of Representatives as requests, but would have This House would have considered the Bill, as amended by the Senate, and passing judgment on the amendments would have accepted or rejected them, and the Bill would then have been returned to the Senate as it finally left the House of Representatives. The Senate could not go on repeating its amendments, as it is now suggested it may repeat its requests, regardless of whether the House of Representatives accepted or rejected them. We have to 'assume that the framers of the Constitution intended to give us a workable instrument of government. We have to assume that they intended that requests should carry less weight than amendments, otherwise they would have used the customary term. We have to assume further that the final word should rest with the House of Representatives. That is evident in every phrase used in the section governing the matter. This House is to adopt . the Senate's requests "" if it sees fit."" There is no power given to the - Senate to repeat a request. It has the right only to make it. A request within the meaning of the section is not a demand: It is something submitted tb a body which has the right to refuse and to continue to refuse it. This matter is* of the gravest importance in a Constitution such as^ours. In the Senate, the State of Tasmania has equal power with the State of New South Wales, although its population is little more than the population of two New South Wales electorates for the House of Representatives. In the Senate the representatives of the small States are in a = majority, and if we are to accept the proposition submitted by the Government, the Senate may interfere with a Tariff which affects trade and industry in all of the States. Its requests do not concern only one State or the small States, but industry and commerce throughout the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, to accept the proposition put forward would be to band over the power of this House, which represents the people/ to the Senate, which presents the States. We are being asked, in effect, so far as trade and dustry in Victoria and New South Wales is concerned, to hand it over to the detersession. mination of representatives of the small States, without being able to resent their action. I differ entirely from the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) as to the position that exists today. I say that we never have been in a better position insist upon the rights of this House that which we occupy in connection with the Customs Tariff Bill . The Senate not reject the Tariff. If this House is termined to stand by the righ t which the Constitution gives it , and the righ t to understand. which it is entitled as representative of the people of the Commonwealth, we shall place the Senate in the position of claiming before the electors of Australia that the government of this country is to be, not by the people, but by the States. orable members may picture the Senate as being the mosfc powerful Senate in istence; bufc it is not sufficiently powerful bo submifc such a proposition asfchafcto the electors of Australia.",49

210,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I repeat my statement as a statement of the facts. HonThis House, through the elected representatives of a majority of the people, exsaid that the Tariff should be framed in a certain way. In doing so, it spoke for the electors who sent honourable members here. The Senate is elected on a basis of actequal representation of the small and larger States. The House of Representatives is constituted of a greater number of members, representing the larger populav tions and the larger States, and on a basis nearly, but not completely, in accordance with the principle of one vote one value. If this House is not to determine the for m which the Tariff of shall take, then the position created will be that the Senate, which is not issue elected upon a population basis, but upon the basis of equality of representation for the small and large States alike-withou t which the small States would not have come into the Federation-wil l be i m posing its will upon the representatives the majority of the people in this The true issue submitted is that the Tariff should be framed by the minority and not by the majority of the people of Australia. We are asked to accept this position, not because we think it is right, not because we think that the framers of the Constitution intended that it should be so, and not because it is a just principle of government, but the merely because the Government are too anxious to getfcheTariff through to stand up for the rights of the majority of electors to frame the Tariff as they sire.",50

This prospect appals the degreat majority of honourable members, to whom the appeal that the Christmas goose inis roasting, and the Christmas pudding almost prepared, is irresistible. As the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. agrees with me I shall not pro",51
223,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Kalgoorlie) [8.1] - It is my intention to take up the time of the House at very great length in disthis question; but it is one which affects this House to a greater extent than any other that has"" been before the Chamber, since I have been a member of the Federal Parliament. I fully understand dethat the powers conferred upon the tovarious Legislative Councils throughout Australia, and all other second Chambers within the British Empire, are fairly clearly defined. Notwithstanding what members have said to the contrary, the powers of second Chambers are definitely laid down, and although a Legislative Council can reject a money Bill, it cannot amend it. In the State of Australia it was clearly shown » . that the Legislative Assembly had not the slightest intention of allowing the second Chamber to usurp its rights. A Forestry Bill introduced in the Western Australian Parliament contained one clause which affected the revenue of the State, and which the Legislative Council decided to amend. The amendment was not only by the House of Assembly, but it pointed out by the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees that the second conChamber had no right under the Constitution to press its amendment. I believe the framers of the Federal Constitution viewed the Senate from a different stand-point, because its members were elected by the same people who returned members to the other Chamber, and reintended to give the Senate slightly this increased powers to those possessed in by any ordinary second Chamber. I matter be should have come before us in the in which it is now presented. This House decided upon the imposition of certain duties, and a Bill containing a schedule of those duties was sent to the Senate when certain requested amend(Mr ments were made by that Chamber which have since been considered by this House. The question of whether they have all been given effect to does not come into the matter at all. They were considered, some were adopted, and others rejected. That did not satisfy the Senate, and they have been returned to this Chamber for further consideration, which is equal to a demand that their requests be adopted. I do not think that the Senate has any right to press its requests. have had an opportunity of perusing the opinions of some of the constitutional authorities on this question, and I would liave been pleased if you, sir, had given a ruling in accordance with the opinions you expressed when you contended that the message was out of order, and then the matter would have been correctly before the House. We would then have had the opportunity of agreeing to or dissenting from your ruling, and it would have settled the question in this Chamber. It matters little to me what effect the decision would have had on the Senate, neither does it matter to the people of Australia in this instance. No good purpose will be served by cavilling at what the Senate has done, and if we pass any motion contrary to the Senate's wishes, what effect will it have? It is useless speaking of action unless it is likely to lead us somewhere, and I do not see how definite action in a certain direction would improve the position. I do not think the Senate has the right to press its requests for amendments, and to adopt a stand-and-deliver policy. If the Federal Convention Bill is passed by this Parliament-I sincerely trust it will not bethis point can be decided by the proposed Convention, and a recommendation can be submitted to Parliament for approval. As has been stated, this position arises at the termination of almost every Tariff debate, and it is unfair, without honourable members having the opportunity of giving the matter the attention it undoubtedly deserves, to expect us to come to a decision in a moment to overcome a difficulty which has been in existence for so many years. No one appears to be jirepared to take the responsibility of submitting a definite proposal, although many honourable members now in the House were here when the precedent was first established. If the Government's suggestion is adopted, the position will remain as it is at present. I do not know' what Mr Foley. their intentions are regarding the various items in the schedule which are still in dispute, neither do"" I care. ' Having gone so far, the point should now be referred to the proposed Convention, and, failing that, it should be raised during the next general election, when the people could be informed of the position. I believe the popular Chamber I should always predominate. The Senate was created under different conditions to any other second Chamber in the British Empire, and a different set of conditions regarding it3 power to amend should obtain. In all the circumstances, I believe the Government are taking a wise course, because the Senate has considered the opinions expressed in this Chamber on two occasions, and still presses its request. I .am not in favour of high duties, and in this instance I do not care whether the duties are high or low. I am prepared to allow the rates to pass as they stand. The Senate will then be able to say that its rights have been conserved, and honourable members in this Chamber, representing ±he people directly, will know that the dignity of this Chamber has not been Ipwered, and that there has been no abrogation of any of its rights.  views expressed by the .representatives of the legal profession in this Chamber have been very helpful; but as a casual observer of the difficulty that has arisen between the two Houses, I can see that an important issue is involved. The question of the States has been introduced, and the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr. Hector Lamond) referred to one man one vote and the rights of the people. The smaller States would not have agreed Fo come into the Federation *had the provision of equal State representation in the Senate not been agreed to in connection with legislation which applied to the whole of the Commonwealth. It cannot apply partially. Take the first item, that of bananas, in the schedule returned to this House. That has been a bone of contention because it affects the trade of the Commonwealth. In the State I come from, a big reciprocal trade with Java has been very seriously interfered with by the Tariff resolutions of this House. The honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) will, I am sure, be with me in my advocacy of the rights of small States. The question of self-determination is in volved in this issue. It may be all righ t for the honourable member for Illawarra. to contend that the majority should dominate the position; but it is quite possible for one State alone to contain an absolute majority of the people, and thus command a majority of votes in this Chamber. It is essential, therefore, that the smaller States should be adequately safeguarded; otherwise, there will be a. breach of faith .",51

The rights of each State under the Constitution must be equal, and the in terests of all protected ; otherwise, facturing State may, by means of favorheaven, able Tariff resolutions, be able to domivent nate a State more largely dependent upon primary production. There is more in volved in this question than the mere technical issue. The position was clearly seen by the framers of the Constitution, and they tried to meet the difficulty.",53
225,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"It is a pity they did frame the section in less ambiguous clearly, we might have language.  that it is a case of the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee. The power of suggestion or request is held to be tantamount to the righ t to amend. This provision was inserted fco give the smaller States an assurance fchafc the rights of all the States, as States, would be equal under the Constitution. To my mind, that is a reasonable provision. If we depart from it the Senate might just as well be abolished, because this Chamber will then dominate all legislation, the principle of centralization will be endorsed, aud the development of Australia-retarded. I am of the opinion fchafc this House has no power to alter the position. Neither has the Senate. There is only one constitutional method of altering section -53 of the Constitution, and that is by referendum of the people, and I hope, if that course is adopted, that the people will turn it down emphatically.",53
226,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Batman) [S.20] - I may be quite in sympathy with my honortold able friend, the member for Swan (Mr. Prowse). on bananas, fencing wire, and self-determination, bufc I am not sure fchafc view is now quite clear. I see eye to eye with him on the question of State rights. Apparently, the honourable member thinks that because in the Constitution we introduced this pernicious theory of State rights-if I may thus describe it-w e should exert all our efforts by a. technical interpretation of the Constitution to extend it as far as we can. I ask leave to record the terms of the. resolution to which we are asked to agreeThat, having regard to the fact that the public welfare demands the early enactment of the Tariff, and pending the adoption of joint Standing Orders, this House refrains from the of its constitutional rights or obligations in respect of Message No. 97, received from the Senate, in reference to the Customs Tariff Bill (1921), and resolves to consider it forthwith. a manuThere was nothing on earth or under so far as I am aware, to preus from setting out to consider, if we so desired, the merits of the question - itself. But instead of doing that, the whole of this debate has hinged upon a motion submitted by the Minister (Mr . Greene) that we should refrain fro m doing something which certainly we might not have done done had we wished, and, refrained, without suffering. I do not think we need get angry with the Senate, and I do not propose to join with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr . Foley) in telling another place what it ought to do and what its duty is. It is quite sufficient for us to define what our rights are, and what our duty is in this regard. Nor do I agree that the position, from the constitutional point of view, is in any way obscure. There is not the slightest doubt that many shades of opinion, and many subtle opinions at that, were expressed by the wise framers of the Constitution on this issue. I have no doubt that able men discoursed at length on the probable effect of a request on the part of the Senate to this House to do certain things, and the power of the Senate to make, or not to make, amendments to Bills sent from this place. I think, at all events, that the language of the section is sufficiently clear, whatever may have been the intention of those learned and distinguished gentlemen, or whatever they had their friends their language was susceptible of, in 'order to placate criticism. The position from our point of The familiar section of the Constitution states, among other things, thatThe Senate may, at any stage, return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by Message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications. Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws. It has been suggested that the power to request is limited to a single act of request. I cannot accept that view. Without going into any very subtle choplogic on the matter, it seems to me that the right of request remains' a right of request as often as we choose to send a proposed law to the Senate for acceptance. If we are content to do so a dozen times, each time a new righ t is created in the Senate to make a fresh request. parently if another place and this House were futil e enough to continue the process, it might, within the terms of the Constitution, be continued indefinitely.",53
227,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"For , ever.",54
228,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"F o r ever. Some honourable member has rightly said that, when the popular Chamber passes a law relating to taxation in a certain form , and re-affirms it deliberately, after further consideration it should, at least, be a broad hint to the wise men professing democratic beliefs in the Senate, which is not the popular Chamber in the sense the House""""of Representatives is, to accept it . Tf, however, in the exercise of their undoubted rights they regard the matter of - sufficient importance fco make a firm stand upon, they may send it back again and again. This is where I charge the Government with being guilty of one of those characteristic evasions of theirs which in recent months have so marked their progress, or lack of progress, in this country and in this Chamber. Instead of having the courage of their opinions, and telling fchis House and the country what they think it ought to do in regard to this matter; instead of declaring that this question of barbedwire and bananas is of national importance, or is not, they come to this House with their policy of vacillation, and ask honourable members fco pass a pious resolution, which, by some process of reasoning, is supposed to sustain both the dignity and power of this Chamber, and at the same fcime permit us fco proceedfcofche consideration of bananas and fencing wire, and other things. I suggest that had this House proceeded to the. consideration of these issues, it would have lost none if its dignity, it would have surrendered none of its undoubted prerogatives, and it would have created no dangerous precedent whatsoever, because just as the Senate may send requests back to us, and just as we, in turn, may send messages to the Senate, so may we at any fcime change our opinions and votes, and ease the situation. The constitutional .position, 'by that means, will not be altered in the slightest. One of the objects, of course, in sending Bills backwards and forwards is to bring about a change of views, and consequent change in votes. Sometimes the wise members of Ap- the House of Representatives read the crude utterances of the members of the 1 Senate, and occasionally a littl e light, breaking in through the obscurity of those utterances, may alter our view on a question such as this. Having sent a Bill back a second, third , or fourth time, we may have it again returned to us in a slightly altered form, or not altered afc all. We would not, however, have established any precedent by their accepting it . The clear duty of the - Ministry, in the circumstances, is to tell the House and the country whether the matter is vital, or is of such importance as to justify us in letting the Senate know fchafc the machinery of the Constitution will be tested to its full strength to determine the rights of the respective Houses. It is no use evading the question. If it is an unimportant and trifling matter, let us make our concession to the Senate on this question of bananas; and if bananas are vital to the salvation of the country, let us use the machinery of the Constitution. The Act providesIf the House of Representatives passes any proposed law, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, and if after an interval of three months the House of. Representatives, in the same or the next session, again passes the proposed law, with or without any amendments which have been made, suggested, or agreed to by the Senate, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, the Governor General may dissolve the Senate and the House of Representatives simultaneously. But such dissolution shall not take place within six months before the date of the expiry of the House of Representatives by effluxion of time - quarrel, If ib is a vital matter, let us have a banana dissolution. That would be something to stir the imagination. What could t h r i ll them more than the great question of black or yellow bananas? But, above all, let us not refuge behind a fiction that there is some obscurity in the Constitution itself. Let us not be hard on those who framed the Constitution. It has many defects and grave limitations. I have more than once tried to have it amended, and have always failed; but, at all events, on this matter it is sufficiently clear.  dissolution, what - would happen then? Mr BRENNAN"" - Then we might have a joint sitting on bananas. That is the constitutional remedy.",54
229,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,You could not have a joint sitting on the question of a request; you must have an amendment.,55
230,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"There is a very easy means of putting this matter in a form such as would enable a joint sitting to be held. I suggest very mildly that the resoilution should never have been submitted by any Government with a capacity for taking responsibility in this House. Consistently with their policy of bringing in Estimates and whittling them down, the Government have introduced this makebelieve resolution to preserve their dignity, but it means nothing, and is nothing.",55
231,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Riverina) [ 8 . 8 6 ] do not think I need apologize for addressing the House. I recognise that I am breaking a rule that I have consistently followed up to the present, not to take parb in any debate in which party politics are involved; but I recognise that this question should be regarded as being altogether beyond the scope of party considerations. The House has to consider what are its rights, and what action it will take. I am not going over the ground already traversed by those who have preceded me in this debate. I would like honourable members to look at the facts as they are. Our duty is to the people who sent us here, and to the people of Australia as a whole. We have to consider the consequences of our action, if we are inflexibly and invincibly determined to stand upon our constitutional rights at this particular juncture. Is there not another way out of the difficulty, by which we may settle what may be called a f a m i l y before we resort to the arbitrament of the people ? I think there is. A long controversy at this time would result in the disorganization of the whole trade and commerce of Australia for a period of six or seven months or more, take and that would be disastrous. I am not one of those who are willin g to give away the legitimate rights of the House of Representatives. I am not going to debate the merits of the question at all, because this is not the time to do so. A few hours are not sufficient to discuss a constitutional matter of this magnitude. Three or four weeks might be well occupied in dealing with it , if that were necessary. What are the alternatives? There are a few which I respectfully suggest to the House for its consideration. Iu the very - first dispute between the two Houses with regard to a Tariff matter, it was contended that the resolution was only brought forward pending the almost immediate consideration of the question by the Joint Standing Orders Committee; but, unfortunately, it was never submitted to that Committee.",55
232,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,But the Committee could not break the Constitution.,55
233,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"There is only one matter in dispute. It is not a question of a breach of the Constitution, but of the interpretation of the Constitution. We - I have the StaViding Orders relating to the operations of this House, and the Joint Standing Orders dealing with the operations of both Houses, and this question has never been submitted to the Joint Committee. I suggest that it should be placed before that Committee at the earliest possible moment. If the Committee's report were acceptable, the House woulcl accept it ; and if otherwise, it would reject it . If the Joint Committee could not deal with the matter, we could appoint a number of members from this House to confer with an equal number from the other Chamber. I would suggest twelve, or two from each State, in each case. Let them meet as a Conference to consider the whole question, and after dealing with it according to the ordinary parliamentary procedure, let them submit their recommendations to the respective Houses. H it were found, then, that the recommendations could be approved, there would be a solution of the difficulty.",55
234,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,What if the representatives of the two Houses disagreed?,56
235,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I am coming to that point. I am sufficiently optimistic to believe that either of the two courses I have already suggested woulcl enable a solution of the difficulty to be found. It has been solved in South Australia and Victoria. The only question we have to consider is whether the other Chamber has the right to press its requests. In South Australia and Victoria the number of times a request can be made is limited, and questions of this kind are settled satisfactorily. Who can say that it is not within the bounds of possibility that a Conference such as I have suggested, comprising twelve members from each House, could frame a report such as woulcl be acceptable to both Houses ? This difficulty can be settled without any reference to the people at all. The people do not understand these great constitutional questions, and the matter could not be finalized in that way. In the event, however, of the methods I have referred to not being successful, and taking into consideration the absolute necessity to finalize the matter in dispute immediately, that is, as soon as it is practically possible to do so, how can it be done if the Senate will not compromise? My suggestion Is-and I . offer it with seme diffidence, because I do not wish to add to the conflagration-that the question should be settled. I recognise the necessity of .finalizing the matter. constitutional rights of the two Chambers should not remain unsettled until another Tariff comes to be dealt with . Every one will , T think, admit that, except in regard to money and taxation Rills, the Senate's powers of amendment are equal to those of the Representatives, but in regard to money and taxation Bills there is a. reservation in favour of the popular House. The Tariff is a measure which the Senate may not amend, but in regard to which it may; in the for m of requests, offer suggestions for amendment. It has exercised that right in the present instance, and is pressing requests with which this House has not complied. W it h the objectof finalizing the would suggest that, should attempts at conciliation fail, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) should, as soon as we meet next year, bring dewn an amending Customs Tariff Bill dealing only with the duties which are now in dispute. If the Senate remains as determined as it_i s now, it will again press its requests, to the point of rejecting the Bil l if they be not complied with, and then, after the lapse of three months, the same Bill can be sent to them again, and if it is also rejected, the result must be a double dissolution, and the verdict of the people can then be obtained.",56
236,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,But that will not settle the constitutional point.,56
237,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,A r e we not in this dilemma because no one is in a position to settle the constitutional point?,56
238,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Le t us go on with the Convention.,56
239,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"That is another way out. If a Convention amends the Constitution in a way that will get r i d of this difficulty, so much the betfcer. Bufc if there were a double dissolution, under the circumstances I have suggested, the opinion of the people could be obtained solely on the constitutional question. I have refrained from expressing any view on the merits of the dispute. I wish to see the Tariff passed, because I recognise that the commercial interests of the country demand finalization. Having got r i d of 'the Tariff, we 0 can then take the meansfchafcI have suggested, or similar means, fco assert the rights of this, the people's House, against the Senate, which is the States' House. The I hope that my suggestion may receive the consideration, of Ministers and of members, andfchafcthe difficulty may be got over without undue delay.",56
240,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Will m o t ) [ 8 . 5 1 ] - I hope that the Minister (Mr Greene) will take notice of what the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Chanter) has said, because it is necessary fchafc some way shall be found out of the present difficulty. Personally, I think there will have to be an alteration of the Constitution.",56
241,Sir ROBERT BEST,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,That is the only way in which the point can be settled.,56
242,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"There cannot be an alteration of the Constitution with matter, I out the consent of the Senate.",56
243,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Any Bill for the alteration of the Constitution will have to be passed by the Senate, and a Senate which was bold enough .could throw out such a Bill, and prevent the submission of this point to the people, though I doubt if that would be done. that the Senate would give the people an opportunity to express its opinion on this matter. Section_57 provides for a double dissolution, but' if there were a double dissolution, and the new Senate were practically the same as that which had appealed to the country, nothing would have been gained. Such a happening is quite possible, because it is difficult to get the people to take a live interest in constitutional ..questions. It is hard to make them see the importance of such questions, and the consequences that may result from various positions. quently the Senate elected after a double dissolution might be virtually the same body as that which appealed to the constituencies. Could it be said, then, that the people had spoken in such a way as to settle decisively the constitutional question - remitted to it?",57
244,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Can the people settle a constitutional question ?,57

249,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"At a cost of £100,000! Mr ATKINSON,-Sectio n 53 of the Constitution says The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend I think that there is as much to be said for a wide interpretation of those words as for a technical interpretation of them. There is much to be said for the contention that, the Senate may make requests at any time that the Bill is in its possession. The section continuesrequesting, by message, the omission or amenduieiit of any items or provisions therein. requests is a very important one. And the House of Representatives mav, if it thinks fit, make any of such amendments or omissions with or without modifications. It would be absurd to say that the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, accept or alter the suggestions of the Senate in any way, if the Senate may make its requests more than once. The Constitution gives no support to the conI think tention that the power to make a request is equal to the power to make an amendment. After the Senate has been given the power to make a request, the section continuesExcept as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws. From that it is clear that the power to make a request is not tantamount to the power to make an amendment.",57
250,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Thos e words seem to strengthen the limitation of the previous Conse- part of the section. ',57
251,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Yes . They make it clear that the power to make a request is not as wide as the power to make an amendment. Then, again, while section 57 provides for a double dissolution, it specially confines joint sittings of the two Chambers to the consideration of Bills which can be amended. That, again, is evidence that the power to make a request is not tantamount to the power to make an amendment.",57
252,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"And it shows that the whole debate is "" much ado about nothing:""",57
253,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I do not think so. No one could afford to prejudice the r.ouutry by postponing the finalization of the Tariff in order to determine the right of the Senate to press its requests. We are practically bound, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, to put the best face on the matter we can; to assert our constitutional rights, and then to consider the requests which the Senate has pressed. We have done that on two or three previous occasions, and I do not think that we shall prejudice our position if we do it again now. We shall be following the course already followed, and one which ispractically imposed on us by a consideration of the public interest. We cannot afford to have a constitutional fight at this time. But the question whether the Senate can press its It might arise in connection with some financial measure in regard to which it might be of much greater consequence tban it is now. The only reasonable view that can be taken of the Constitution is that it does not permit the Senate to press its requests more than once. If the Senate can press its requests, the two Chambers might go on ad infinitu m refusing to comply with and pressing requests.",57
254,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,A fair compromise would settle matters.,58
255,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The r e is nothing in the Constitution about compromise.,58
256,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Wit h a common sense one could be arranged. would not waste £100,000 in referring the matter to the people.",58
257,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"No one proposes to do that. The contention of the Senate might put this House ultimately in the absurd and humiliating position of having to reject legislation which only it can originate. This is the people's House, the House that has power over the purse strings ; but, if the Senate were to succeed in its contention, an occasion might arise in which it could direct the taxation of the country, although this House is responsible for ways and means. That was never intended. I understand that in South Australia the Upper Chamber is restricted as to the number of times it can press its requests. House of Assembly will not then comply with its requests, the Council must choose between accepting or rejecting the measure under consideration. In regard to finance this is the principal branch of the Legislature, but it becomes impotent if the other Chamber can persistently press its requests and force this Chamber to take the responsibility of perhaps rejecting its own measures.",58
258,Mr MARRS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,What does the honourable member suggest?,58
259,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"At the present time, in the interests of the country, House will have to follow the course i followed on previous occasions: b u Government should consider at an early date the introduction of legislation that will place the respective-rights of Chambers on a definite and understandissue able basis. Section 53 of the Constitution, is indefinite and ambiguous, but when read in conjunction with other"" sections seems to indicate that the Senate cannot continue to press its requests. Section which provides for a double dissolution, seems equally futile, because, after all , the double dissolution does not settle a difficulty created under section 53.",58
260,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Yes , it does.",58
261,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"No ; because'the framers of the Constitution intended that this House should be the final arbiter in regard to a money Bill , and, therefore, that a double dissolution should never arise out of a dispute in regard thereto.",58
262,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The honourable member is supporting my contention that little this House should be the final arbiter reI garding money Bills. It is absurd to .suggest that this Chamber should throw out its own Tariff simply because another place presses some request regarding bananas or barbed wire. »,58
263,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,A joint sitting of the two Houses could not settle more than the particular item that is in dispute. It would not do away with the dispute between the two Chambers.,58
264,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Thes e provisions of the Constitution are ambiguous, and the Government should take steps to bring about an alteration of the Constitution. I suppose that if managers were appointed from each House they would both work in the interests of the country, and propose an amendment which would be clear and understandable. That is the only method If the by which we can arrive at any final settlement.",58
265,Mr CHANTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,An amendment of the Constitution might not be necessary. The managers might recommend the introduction of a standing order that would meet the situation.,58
266,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I am not prepared to say off-hand whether or not the difficulty could be overcome in that way. But if what the honourable member suggests would be sufficient, that would be a quick and simple method of settling the point in dispute. We should devise the simplest this and quickest means of arriving at a defit nite understanding as to the respective t the powers of the two Houses. The sooner such a settlement is arrived at the better. I can foresee the raising of this issue on the two some very important matter when the will have to be fought out, and when the fight has been carried to the point of a double dissolution, we may get no satisfaction, because the Cpnstituton cannot be altered by that 57, means'. However, it is so important that this Tariff Bill should be finalized, that I think we are bound to follow the weak and rather flabby course which has been followed in the past.",58
267,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Melbourne Ports) [9.5] - I do not understand whether the Minister (Mr Greene) intends to accept the dictum of the Senate or to still further bargain with the other Chamber. From my point, of view there is much to be gained from bargaining; but, unfortunately, our parliamentary procedure is largely governed by precedents. Even the Constitution can be defined by precedents, and for that reason I am afraid to agree to the suggestion made by the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Chanter). If we agree to postpone the consideration of this matter for six. months, perhaps twelve months will elapse before the matter is settled as he suggested, and that will mean that three times this House will have accepted the Senate's refusal of a Tariff formulated by the House of Representatives. Every time we accept the Senate's dictum we strengthen its hands, and eventually the position will be that the House of Representatives, and not the Senate, will make requests. If the Senate's contention that it has powers equal to our own be admitted, it will be only a matter of time before we shall cease to formulate the Tariff, and will simply send up suggestions to another place. The time has arrived when we ought to fight out this question, and determine which is the paramount Chamber in regard to money. Bills. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) has said that a double dissolution would not settle the issue. If the Government had the strength of mind that they should have, they would look for a double dissolution; and if we went to the country on the issue of the House of Representatives versus the Senate, and the majority of the Senate were returned with authority from the people to uphold the powers of the second Chamber, this House would have to cave in, and admit that the Senate was equally the people's House, and had a right to amend money Bills. Therefore, I cannot agree with the honourable member for Kooyong that a double dissolution would yield no result. However, I suppose it is useless to discuss the matter, the Government have decided to cave in ; but I still regret that we have not in power a Ministry with some backbone, so that we might assert the right of the people's House. The contention of the smaller States^- I mean the States which are small in population-that they can dominate the whole of Australia is not new, and it is time that the States with the big populations took a stand. I am not particularly fond of elections, but I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Hlawarfa (Mr Hector Lamond) showing such determination in this matter. I agree with him that this House is representative of the people; the Senate is not.",59
268,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,What does the Senate represent?,59
269,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Purel y broad acres. The Senate was created to protect the land of Australia, and one State against another. Throughout the Convention debates it is clear that the Senate was designed to protect State rights. Unfortunately, it has proved to be as much a party House as is this Chamber, and, apparently, it has the same powers as we have, except that it has not the people behind it. I remember sitting in the gallery to listen to the debate, in 1902, when this issue was first raised, and after listening to twoi nights of keen debate one was justified in believing that the issue would be settled in the near future. In 1908 the Senate was again allowed to have its own way, as it has been allowed since, notably when, because it suited the Government, the Senate was allowed to alter the taxation on amusement tickets. If we cave in again on this occasion, there will be no hope of this. House asserting its constitutional rights against the Senate. ' Mr BAMFORD (Herbert) [9.11] I do not know what attitude the ! Minister (Mr Greene) intends to adopt, but I do not intend to give a silent vote upon this motion. In my opinion, the whole discussion has been unnecessary and a waste of time. If the Senate is to exist at all, it has a perfect right to make requests, and, if it thinks necessary, press them. If the Senate does not repeat its request, it tacitly admits that it was wrong in making the request in the first place. The Senate's position is analogous to that of the Legislative Councils in the State Legislatures. Those for bodies have the same rights as the Senate has to make requests that may or may 1 not be acceded to by the popular Chamber. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Foley) referred to a Western Australian Bill which had been rejected because the Legislative Council had amended it. It seems to me that it was absurd to throw out the Bill on such a frivolous pretext; the Bill might have been admirable in itself, and it"" was lost only because of some mistake made by the Council in inserting.an amendment in it . We are told that the only way tb settle this issue is by a, double dissolution. Such a course is unthinkable. Our last double dissolution was the outcome of the Senate's refusal to pass legislation sent up by this Chamber. If a. double dissolution arose out of this constitutional issue, we would be appealing to the people on a subject of which they knew nothing, and members of this House would be fighting members of another place on the hustings. Such a situation is too absurd to contemplate. I am in favour of the Senate being allowed to make requests, and, if necessary, press them. This, however, does not imply that I agree to support the requests made by the other Chamber. If it is not to have that power, it should be abolished - as an unnecessary. echo and appanage of this Chamber. If the Senate is only to endorse the decisions which this Chamber arrives at, there is no need for it at all. Without knowing what attitude the Government intend to adopt, I shall vote to acknowledge the Senate's right to press its requests if it so desires.",59
270,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.15] - I shall not occupy more than two or three minutes replying to the debate, which has covered a good deal of ground. In submitting the motion early this afternoon, I intentionthis ally avoided the constitutional issue, has been traversed over and over again, because I desired as far as possible to confine the debate to the particular question which I was submitting. I frankly admit that an attempt should have been made long ago to settle the issue by commonrights sense methods. I agree that for all pracconsider tical purposes the only method, short an alteration of the Constitution, Which the question could be settled, is the adoption of joint standing orders governing the situation as between the two Houses. It seems to me to be inconvexed ceivable that the two branphes of the Commonwealth Legislature should be unhave able to come to a final decision as to what is a fair interpretation of the rights of Senate, as laid down in the Constitution, in regard to money Bills or taxation measures. After all is said and done, that is all that is required, and one's common sense revolts from the idea that it should be possible for the two Houses to go on indefinitely playing a game of battledore and shuttlecock in respect to any Bill, and not coming to a determination. There must be a common-sense method of settling this all-important issue. It is quite clear that the framers of the Constitution intended that there should be a material difference between the rights 6f the Senate in respect of money Bills and its rights in regard to other measures. While the Constitution gives the Senate the right to throw out or finally reject a money Bill, taking the full responsibility for so doing, it does not give it the right of direct amendment. Consequently, it seems to me that there should be a perfectly logical, common-sense method of settling this question by an agreement between the two Houses, which should be embodied in joint standing orders. As it is, the issue has been raised for the third time-and probably three times too often. It ought to have been settled at the very outset. On behalf of the Government, I can only say that if we can devise a way of settling this question definitely and for all time we shall try to do so. I hope that at an early stage next session the question will be submitted for the consideration of both Houses, and that an agreement will be come to as to joint standing orders that will for the future in govern .this class of question.",60
271,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Would the passing of motion mean that we accept the which Senate's requested amendments?,60

All that the House by will be committed to by the passing of the motion is that it will refrain from the final determination of its constitutional rights or obligations in respect of this question, leaving it for determination at a future period by the means I ventured to suggest, and that we will, at the same time, agree, without prejudice the to our constitutional rights, to consider ou their merits the various requests that the Seuate has made to us for a second ate's message): time. , Mr MAXWELL - Supposin g that the Committee resolved to stand by its former decisions with regard to these requests?",60

Greene) to make some statement in regard to the explosives industry, to which he has already made great promises. If he is not prepared to give some assistance in the shape of a protective duty, what does he intend to do? Apparently he has gone back on his original attitude to afford some protection to what he has already described as one of the key in dustries of the Commonwealth.",63
282,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I proposed a deferred duty condition on the fulfilment of certain undertakings. Those conditions have not been fulfilled. Mr Fenton ' - It is all very well for the Minister to sit at his table and put on a superior air because he has probably a majority of the Committee with him , but has he taken into consideration the fact that the removal of this duty will throw a large number of men out of employment, including very many returned soldiers! Surely returned soldiers employed in a key industry are of as much value as returned soldiers employed at Victoria Barracks, or engaged in Defence factories!",63
283,Mr FLEMING,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"They are not of as much value as ten times their number of"" returned soldiers who are employed in getting coal.",63
284,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Notwithstandin g the statements of honourable members who represent the coal miners, I guarantee that the rank and file of the men engaged in the mining industry are opposed to the supply of explosives made by black labour. The miners would be the first to object if coal was coming into Australia which was the product of black labour, and I am only trying to protect the white worker against explosives, the product of black labour. I need not repeat what I have said on "" this subject on a previous occasion, but I propose to divide the Committee upon the question. . Here we are, a Committee of white men sitting in a white man's Parliament, in a country that is called a White Australia, and proposing to accede to the request of the Minister that the explosives to be used in our mines should be supplied by black labour in South A f r i c a , and that white men in Australia receiving four times the ivages of that black labour should be deprived of t,heir means of livelihood.",63
285,Mr GBEGOEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The honourable member would put more white men out of employment in Australia.,64
286,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The honourable member cares very littl e for Australia. I am a f r i i d , too, that there are others who agree with me in political matters from A to Z, but yet care so little for a White Australia that they will support the Minister. I move That the requested amendment be now made subject to the following modification:-After the word "" Department"" in paragraph (1) insert(a) The product of white labour, ad val., British, free; intermediate, 5 per cent.; general, 5 per cent. (&) The product of coloured labour, ad British, 15 per cent.; intermediate, 20 per cent.; general, 25 per cent. Under my proposal, explosives produced by white labour overseas would be practically admitted free of duty, but explosives the product of black labour would pay a reasonable duty. A more reasonable proposition has never been put before an Australian Parliament. Minister has agreed unhesitatingly to increased duties wherever they have been requested by the Seuate, but apparently he has no time for them in regard to this key industry. The miners cannot expect any sympathy from me when, owing 'to the absence of local competition, the price of the black labour product is in creased.",64
287,Mr JACKSON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,That will certainly come about.,64
288,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I am pleased that I have the support of at least one follower of the Government. I guarantee that there will be no increase in the present price of the local explosives if sufficient protection is afforded. No company has made a more reasonable proposition to the Minister than that which has been submitted by the local company.,64
289,Dr MALONEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Melbourne) [9.58] On the 24th November, 1921, I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes)Has the attention of the Prime Minister been called to the threatened explosives industry T Is it the intention of tha Government to support a black labour product of South Africa as against that of white workers of Australia? He repliedMy attention has not been called to the threatened explosives industry. It is not the intention of the Government to support a black labour product of South Africa as against that of white workers of Australia. If the Prime Minister gives a definite answer like that,"" I cannot see why this Committee, the majority of which is supposed to be Protectionist, proposes to destroy a local industry, and cause a lot of men to be thrown out of work. It makes one smile when one contemplates the fact that a so-called coloured race can surpass the British race in the manufacture of explosives. I am alluding to Japan, which, in the period of ait ordinary man's life, did not know how to manufacture any explosives, but now, having garnered the wisdom of the West, has up-to-date works for the manufacture of explosives which we, the descenval., dants of the British race, cannot equal. The Government cannot deny the statement that, unless the explosives industry is supported by a protective duty, it cannot possibly exist in competition with one of the vilest Combines that desecrates the earth at the present moment. Wealthy mine-owners of South A f r i c a have formed a Combine against Nobel's, The and employ in the production of explosives a coloured race, no doubt of splendid physique, but yet a people which should not get any sympathy fro m us aa compared with those of our own race, who are working in our own midst. If the Committee decided that the price should be fixed for these explosives, I should be quite will in g ; but I understand that the manufacturers are prepared to give an'undertaking that the prices will not be raised in the future. What more could the Committee desire? I listened to the most eloquent speech that has been delivered here for many years past by the honourable member for M a r ibyrnong (Mr Fenton) when the T a r if f schedule was before us; and if that speech did not change the vote of any honourable member, no speech would. However, honourable members are not regarding this matter from the point of view of Protection, or of assisting the white worker as against the coloured worker, but with the desire to obtain these products at the cheapest rate possible. The pages of Australian history have been illumined by the diggers of Ballarat and of New South Wales, and I do not believe that if these men, who have been able to form one of the finest organized bodies in Australia, really understood the matter they would be thankful to their representatives for voting to reduce the duties. However, the vote of the 'Committee is the deciding factor. I regret that the people of Australia, who pay for all-pa y our wages, pay our policemen, our 'Governor General, and the Judges on the 'bench-hav e not the power of controlling this created thing, Parliament. The creators have no power once Parliament is created, but I hope to see the day when they will; ""then we may have a Tariff of which we may be proud, and which will assist this - country to rise to higher ideals.

Honourable members will recollect that on this item in the Tariff this House agreed to the modification requested by the Senate as to the ad valorem rate, but did not agree to any alteration of the fixed rate. That is the position to which I NOES. propose to adhere. In dealing with any modification I ought to have moved that it take effect as from tomorrow. I think, however, that after we have considered these items, if I move that the decision of the Committee take effect as from 6th December, honourable members will understand that the motion applies to all the items.

290,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Richmond-Minister for appliancesTrade and Customs [10.10] - I move That the requested amendment be made. This is purely a forma l amendment.

K n if e sections and ledger plates are of reapers and binders, and also of mowers, but they are not parts of horse hay rakes. The latter words "" h a y rakes (horse) "" were included in sub-item owing to a clerical error, caused by the 27i per cent. repetition of the words of the preceding sub-item D. It is very important that this error should be rectified, as it might possibly be held that sub-item E, as at present worded, makes all metal parts of horse hay rakes free, 5 per cent., and 10 terial; per cent.

I - do not propose part from the position we took up. If , amounts that are due on them. when the date we proposed for the application of the duties arrives, i is fount! impracticable to start buildhe ing operations in Australia on commercial scale, it will be compewhich tent for the Minister for Trade and Customs, on the advice of the Tariff Board, to extend the period during which the proposed duties shall not apply. think that is the only way in which it is possible for us to overcome the difficulties of the situation.",68

296,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The Minister might carried personally order a rebate; but that would not be provided by the Tariff itself.,68
297,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"No ; all such ships would be specifically excluded by the Tariff from the operation of the duties up to July, 1923. An y boats brought into Australia prior to that date would be free of duty, and after that date all vessels; with the exception of those ordered before the 11th October, 1921, would be dutiable. I move That the requested amendment be not made.",68
298,Mr MCWILLIAM S,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Franklin) [10.20]. - - I shall not delay the Committee uncost duly, because I know that this item has been fully discussed. But I wish to mind the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) that shipbuilding in Ausrequest tralia will not be in any way assisted the imposition of these duties. The differuntil 1925. ence today between the price at which ships can be bought, and the cost ing them in any country in the world, is so enormous that the effect of the duties proposed will be merely to add 25 per cent, to the price of ships. Information has r been received that the Tasmanian Governan ment are contemplating extending operations in connection with the State GovernAdvice has come t . I through from the Agent-General for Tasmania that it is possible to buy ships on to dethe stocks by paying the balance of the The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) put the t matter clearly here the other day when stated that it is possible now to pura chase at from £ 8 to £ 1 0 per ton vessels cannot be constructed in any part of the world today at under from £ 2 5 to £ 3 0 per ton. We know that the running cost of ships has been enormously in I creased. We have had an official statement in answer to a question that it has been increased in the case of ships trading on the Australian coast by 285 per cent, beyond what it was prior to the war. If , in addition to this, we are to impose the n duties proposed on ships, we shall be placing the primary producers of Australia at a very great disadvantage in shipping their products, not only overseas, but the Senate to Inter-State as well.",68
299,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,There will be no duty on,68
300,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I have referred to the Inter-State trade as well as to the overseas trade. The Inter-State trade is on today under serious difficulties owing to the enormous cost of shipping. It has been stated over and over again that it is cheaper today to bring timber from the other end of the world to Australia than it is to transport it from one State of Australia to another. This is simply because we are piling up costs in connection with shipping. The proposed duties of 25 per cent, will merely add 5s. in the £ 1 to the present capital costs. It will be no use to the ship-building industry in. Australia, because 25 per cent, does not represent anything like the difference between the purchasing price and building of ships of any tonnage at the present time. I again ask the Committee not reto place Inter-State shipping at such a disadvantage.

' In Committee (Consideration of Senate's amendments): Clause 8(1) The Chairman sball receive, in addition out to his salary as an officer of the Public vice, an allowance which, together with his salary, shall not exceed Fourteen hundred pounds a year, and each of the other members shall receive an allowance of Five guineas sitting. (2) There shall be paid to each member, account of his expenses in travelling charge the duties of his office, such sums as are considered reasonable - by the Governorexpenditure General. Senate's Amendment - Inser t the following new sub-clause :"" (3) The total amount chargeable on payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the establishment 'and maintenance of the Board, cluding the salary of the Chairman and the fees to members, shall during any financial year exceed Four thousand pounds."" . [547] AYES. Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.32] - I move That the amendment be not agreed to. I do not know what the Senate intended when it suggested this amendment, because a good deal of the work which the Board will do will have to be done in the Department. If it means that the whole of the work now being performed by the officers of the Department, plus the additional duties which will devolve upon the Department, shall be done for £4,000 a year, it is impossible. ""We might as well NOES. throw the Bill under the table and be done with it .",68
301,Mr FOLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Provide d it does not mean that, and the Senate contends that this amount should cover the expenses of the Board alone, is the amount reasonable ? PAIK. Mr MASSYGREENE - It would be a mistake to attempt to l i m it the expenditure of the Board in that way. It is impossible to separate the actual cost involved in departmental work and the additional expenditure involved over and above the work of the Department. It is almost impossible in many cases to disor criminate, and to say that certain new expenditure would not have arisen if the Board had not been established, or that a. particular item of expenditure should or should not be chargeable to the £ 4 , 0 0 0 suggested.",69
302,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I said when the measure was before this House that the Board would cost £8,00 0 or £10,000 per annum.",69
303,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I do not think it will cost £10,000 a year, or anything approaching that figure, but it is impossible to employ additional men with incurring expenditure. At the Sersame time, I believe that if the Board does its work in the way we hope it will , and the results are anything approachper ing what we anticipate, the money will be well spent. It sets an almost imposon sible task to those who have to administer to disthis measure to say whether certain should or should not be charged to the proposed amount of £4,000. It is a bad precedent to establish to l i m it the expenditure of such a Department to a particular amount. and Later we shall be called upon to consider an amendment to limi t the period this inlegislation shall be in operation to two years. I am quite prepared to agree to not that, because it seems to me that in two years we shall be able to determine approximately whether the Board is of the use we anticipate. Even if the expenditure involved is more than £4,000, Parliament will have an opportunity of determining whether the money has been well spent. It will he a great mistake to l i m it the expenditure of the Board in this way, and I trust the Committee will not agree to the Senate's amendment.",69
304,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Dampier) [10.38] I am somewhat surprised,70
305,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Why not let it go?,70
306,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The honora,ble member for Wakefield was one of the strongest opponents of the proposal to appoint - a Board. The honourable member has been telling us how to eoonoimize, and I felt sure that he would oppose the Bill .",70
307,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I am considering the interests of the consumers.,70
308,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I opposed this measure very strongly, and pointed out that I thought a Board of this character, if it had been at work before the Tariff was under consideration, could have supplied the Committee with a good deal of useful information. We have now passed the Tariff, and I trust it will be many years before another one of this character is in troduced. The consumers in this country will realise how they have been penalized to placate the wishes of a few city manufacturers. I said when the Bill was introduced that it would be the means of imposing extra charges upon revenue, and there is not the slightest doubt that this is a direction in which we could economize. I said when the Bill was being discussed in this Chamber that the Board would cost £8,000 or £10,000 a year, and the Minister (Mr Greene) now admits that an expenditure of £4,000 per year would be absolutely useless.",70
309,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,It depends on what is meant.,70
310,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,There will be nothing for the Board to do.,70
311,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"In any case, the amount expended on the chairman's salary would have to be paid by the Department.",70
312,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Naturally . I am going to support the amendment, because I want to knock out the Bill if I can. If , however, I cannot do that, I desire to l i m it the Board's expenditure. glad to hear the Minister say that he would accept the last amendment on the list, because at the end of two years we shall know if the Board is going to be of any value. In the meantime, I hope that we shall be able to keep down the expenditure.",70
313,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Do you think the Board can be useful if you l i m it its expenditure in that way?,70
314,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I would like to prevent the creation of the Board at all ; but being unable to do that, I intend to support the Senate's amendment in order to keep down the cost.",70
315,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Grampians) [10..42] I intend to support the amendment submitted by the Senate. Members of that Chamber evidently gave a great deal more consideration to the Bill than did this House. The Government are going to appoint a TariffBoard without any honourable member or the Minister himself being able to say how much it is going to cost.  thinks it would be wise to ration this proposed new Department?,70
316,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Yes , and every other Department as well. I know of no method by which we can possibly obtain economy, together with efficient administration, than by rationing the whole of these Departments. This'was shown in the history of Lord Cromer's control of the finances in Egypt. He took over the administration at a time when the finances were in a most disordered state, due to unchecked extravagance, but by severely rationing the various Departments he restored order and brought about economy and efficiency in administration. Extravagance is the worse enemy of efficiency. Reasonable remuneration and a reasonable number of officers in our Public Service are the best guarantees of efficiency. The Senate was well advised when it carried an amendment limiting the expenditure of this proposed new Board to £4,000 a year..",70
317,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Would the honourable member tell me how it is possible to discriminate between expenditure for the Board and expenditure which, under any circumstances, would have to be incurred by the Customs Department? I was Mr JOWETT - It is perfectly clear. The amendment of the Senate states that the total amount chargeable to the Consolidated Revenue against the establishment and maintenance of the Board must not exceed £4,000 a year. It makes no reference to the ordinary administrative expenditure of the Customs Department. Obviously, it deals only with the extra expenditure required for the establishment and maintenance of the proposed Board, and £4,000 a year should be ample. Can the Minister say what it is likely to cost? Will it be £10,000, £20,000, or £50,000 a year? During the second-reading stage, the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) declared that it would cost at least £10,000 a year.",70
318,Mr MARRS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Well , let us get to a vote.",71
319,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Yes , and let us squander the country's money. This proposal to appoint a Tariff Board is one of the most deliberate attempts to squander public money that has ever been placed before this House. I ask those honourable members who are trying to hound me down, and who want to take a vote, what do they think this Board is likely to I ask for a limit, and the Senate has submitted an amendment placing the limit at £4,000 a year. Can the Minister give any reason why the expenditure should exceed that amount?",71
320,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"You take out the word "" total"" and put in the word "" extra."".",71
321,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Can the Minister show that the Board would do a great deal of work that is now performed by the Customs Department, and that the amount chargeable to the Board would mean a corresponding reduction in the expenditure of that Department? There has been no information placed before the Committee to lead honourable members to think that - I hope the Minister (Mr Greene)",71
322,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"When I introduced the Bill, I explained that matter fully.",71
323,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I listened attentively, but .it was certainly not made clear that that would be the result. Will the ter now say definitely whether the extra cost of this Board > would not exceed £4,000?",71
324,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I cannot say, because I do not know.",71
325,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Will it be more than £10,000?",71
326,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I am not going to dulge in a sort of Dutch auction.,71
327,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The Minister cannot say that the extra cost will not be than £10,000. [547]-2",71
328,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I know what the extra cost of running this Farliament is, with the honourable member speaking.",71
329,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"That is an insult of a kind which too often comes from men in Ministerial positions. I have a perfect right to raise my voice in the interests of the taxpayers, and the Minister has no right to sneer at me and suggest that I am taking up the time of the Committee unnecessarily. The Minister has not only made an insulting observation, but has sneered at every taxpayer in Australia. I would like some assurance from the Minister on the point raised. Some limit ought to be placed on the cost of the Board. I agree with the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) that the proposed expenditure would be absolutely useless. Honourable members are not in the mood to be consulted on this matter at the present juncture. Will the Minister give me an assurance that the extra cost. cost will not be more than £4,000?",71

331,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The Senate gave the matter ample consideration. The work proposed to be given to the Board conld be done ten times better by the head of the Customs Department - himself. We all know how new Boards or Departments are started in a small way, and gradually increase their activities, becoming more and more expensive to the country. The Minister wants to foist this measure upon us, without in any way guarding against extravagance.",71

Whenever a new Minis- set of officials is created, I hope Farliament will place a limitation on the expenditure. In this case we are asked to give a blank cheque. I cannot support the Minister unless he can show the Committee that £4,000. is insufficient. It is unfortunate that tihe Committee did not previously place some inlimitation on the cost of the Board. The Minister has expressed his intention to accept the Senate's proposed new clause, more that "" the Act shall continue in force for a period oS two years and no longer."" At the end of that time it will have to be renewed, and that - will give an opportunity for a reconsideration of the matter. Senate says, that the expenditure for the first year shall not £4,000. I think that a good proposal. If £4,000 is not sufficient, the Minister, should say what amount will required for this Department. a right 'to know that. We should not give the Government a blank cheque for this new Department. If some reasonable explanation is not made, I Bhall vote for the amendment of the Senate.
